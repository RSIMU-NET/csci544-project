GAO agreed, under its audit authority, to perform the initial audit of SEC's financial statements. GAO's audit was done to determine whether, in all material respects, (1) SEC's fiscal year 2004 financial statements were reliable, (2) SEC's management maintained effective internal control over financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations, and (3) SEC's management complied with applicable laws and regulations. Established in 1934 to enforce the securities laws and protect investors, the SEC plays an important role in maintaining the integrity of the U.S. securities markets. GAO was asked by the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, Government Information, and International Security, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, to present the results of its May 26, 2005, report, Financial Audit: Securities and Exchange Commission's Financial Statements for Fiscal Year 2004 (GAO-05-244)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The SEC's first ever financial audit was performed by GAO for fiscal year 2004. In reporting on the results of the audit, GAO issued an unqualified, or clean, opinion on the financial statements of the SEC. This means that SEC's financial statements presented fairly, in all material respects, its financial position as of September 30, 2004, and the results of operations for the year then ended. However, because of material internal control weaknesses in the areas of preparing financial statements and related disclosures, recording and reporting disgorgements and penalties, and information security, GAO issued an adverse opinion on internal controls, concluding that SEC did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2004. However, SEC did maintain, in all material respects, effective internal control over compliance with laws and regulations material in relation to the financial statements as of September 30, 2004. In addition, GAO did not find reportable instances of noncompliance with laws and regulations it tested. It is important to remember that GAO's opinions on SEC's financial statements and internal controls reflect a point in time. SEC prepared its first complete set of financial statements for fiscal year 2004 and made significant progress during the year in building a financial reporting structure for preparing financial statements for audit. However, GAO identified inadequate controls over SEC's financial statement preparation process including a lack of sufficient documented policies and procedures, support, and quality assurance reviews, increasing the risk that SEC management will not have reasonable assurance that the balances presented in the financial statements and related disclosures are supported by SEC's underlying accounting records. In addition, GAO identified inadequate controls over SEC's disgorgements and civil penalties activities, increasing the risk that such activities will not be completely, accurately, and properly recorded and reported for management's use in its decision making. GAO also found that SEC has not effectively implemented information system controls to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of its financial and sensitive data, increasing the risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss of the data, possibly without detection. The risks created by these information security weaknesses are compounded because the SEC does not have a comprehensive monitoring program to identify unusual or suspicious access activities. SEC agreed with our findings and is currently working to improve controls in all these areas."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the results of our audit of the  Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) fiscal year 2004 financial  statements, the first complete set of financial statements SEC has prepared  and has subjected to an independent audit. Our recent report, issued on  May 26, 2005, presents the results of that audit. Today, I will discuss those  results and the steps we believe SEC needs to take to improve its ability to  produce timely and reliable financial statements, and to produce them  efficiently and with reasonable assurance that they are fairly presented.  These steps will also help SEC to produce complete and reliable  information for internal management who make decisions about SEC  operations and expenditures, and congressional stakeholders who provide  oversight of SEC operations and make decisions about SEC funding.", "The results of our audit were mixed\u2014a clean opinion on the financial  statements and an adverse opinion on internal control. Because we  detected three material weaknesses in internal control, we concluded that  SEC\u2019s internal control did not reduce to a relatively low level the risk of  misstatements material to the financial statements. In other words,  mistakes may occur and either go undetected by employees in the normal  course of their work or be detected too late to prevent errors or fraud. The  material weaknesses we found relate to SEC\u2019s internal control over  (1) preparing financial statements and the related disclosures, (2) recording and reporting of disgorgements and civil penalties, and (3) information security. It is important to remember that our opinions on  SEC\u2019s financial statements and internal controls reflect a point in time. SEC  has stated its commitment to enhancing its financial and operational  effectiveness. We and others have made recommendations, which if  successfully implemented, would help SEC to generate timely, reliable, and  useful financial information with which to make informed decisions,  manage daily operations, and ensure accountability on an ongoing basis.", "SEC has a very visible and prominent leadership role in promoting and  enforcing accountability for corporations whose equity and debt securities  are traded in the securities markets. Recently, this role has also  encompassed helping to ensure the effective implementation of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act, with its emphasis on internal control and corporate  governance for the companies it regulates. At a time when many  corporations are striving to strengthen internal controls and improve  financial reporting, SEC has the opportunity and responsibility to serve as a  model of good practice. In that regard, SEC stated in its 2004 Performance  and Accountability Report, issued in May 2005, that SEC must lead by  example with respect to the internal control requirements demanded of the  private and federal sectors, and also articulated management\u2019s vision that  SEC serve as the standard against which other federal agencies are  measured. A higher standard of accountability is appropriate for SEC as a  government regulatory agency; moreover, it is important to the success of  SEC\u2019s programs, activities, and leadership in the business community and  as a government regulator."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Audit Results", "paragraphs": ["In our audit of the fiscal year 2004 financial statements for SEC, we found  the financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended September  30, 2004, including the accompanying notes, are presented fairly, in all  material respects, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted  accounting principles;  SEC did not have effective internal control over financial reporting  (including safeguarding of assets), but had effective control over  compliance with laws and regulations that could have a material effect  on the financial statements as of September 30, 2004; and  no reportable noncompliance with laws and regulations we tested.", "We issued an unqualified, or clean, opinion on the SEC\u2019s financial  statements. This means that the financial statements and accompanying  notes present fairly, in all material respects, SEC\u2019s financial position as of  September 30, 2004, and, as well, certain other financial information that  the statements must provide: net cost, changes in net position, budgetary  resources, financing, and custodial activities for the year then ended. We  also found that the statements conform to U.S. generally accepted  accounting principles. In order to reach our conclusions about the financial  statements, we (1) tested evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures  in the financial statements, (2) assessed the accounting principles used and  significant estimates made by management, and (3) evaluated the  presentation of the financial statements.", "We found three material weaknesses in internal control and thus issued an  adverse opinion on internal control\u2014stating that SEC management did not  maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and the  safeguarding of assets as of September 30, 2004. Internal control over  financial reporting consists of an entity\u2019s policies and procedures that are  designed and operated to provide reasonable assurance about the  reliability of that entity\u2019s financial reporting and its process for preparing  and fairly presenting financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles. It includes policies and procedures for  maintaining accounting records, authorizing receipts and disbursements,  and the safeguarding of assets. Because SEC makes extensive use of  computer systems for recording and processing transactions, SEC\u2019s  financial reporting controls also include controls over computer operations  and access to data and computing resources.", "Our opinion on SEC\u2019s internal control means that SEC\u2019s internal control did  not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that misstatements material to  the financial statements may occur and go undetected by employees in the  normal course of their work. This conclusion on SEC\u2019s internal controls did  not affect our opinion on SEC\u2019s financial statements. This is because during  the audit process SEC made the adjustments identified during the audit as  necessary for the fair presentation of its financial statements. However, the  weaknesses we found could affect other, unaudited information used by  SEC for decision making. Our evaluation of internal control covered SEC\u2019s  financial reporting controls which also cover certain operational activities  that result in SEC\u2019s financial transactions, such as activities pertaining to  stock exchange transaction fees, public-filing fees, maintaining  disgorgements and penalties receivable, payroll-related transactions, and  others.", "We also tested SEC\u2019s compliance with selected provisions of laws and  regulations that have a direct and material impact on the financial  statements. For example, we tested for compliance with sections of the  Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that requires SEC to collect  fees from the national securities exchanges and the National Association of  Securities Dealers based on volume of stock transactions, and sections of  the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that requires SEC to collect fees  from registrants for public filings. Our tests found no instances of  noncompliance that are reportable.

As I will discuss later, this issue is compounded by SEC\u2019s  limitations with its financial management system. Also, SEC did not have  formalized quality control or review procedures. As a result, we identified  errors in the beginning asset and liability balances and in the September 30,  2004, draft financial statements prepared by SEC management, that if had  not been corrected, would have resulted in materially misleading operating  results for fiscal year 2004.", "SEC\u2019s lack of formalized processes, documented procedures, and quality  assurance checks, significantly delayed the reporting of fiscal year 2004  financial results, consumed significant staff resources, caused audit  inefficiencies, and resulted in higher financial statement preparation and  audit costs. I would like to highlight the following items we found:  SEC did not have documentation providing an explanation or a  crosswalk between the financial statements and the source systems,  general ledger accounts, account queries, and account analyses.", "SEC did not maintain a subsidiary ledger for certain activities, such as  customer deposit amounts pertaining to filing fees.", "Accounting staff had difficulty in retrieving support for certain account  balances, such as undelivered-order amounts, and for certain property  and equipment leases.", "Reconciliations of detail and summary account balances were not  prepared for certain financial statement line items, such as for the  customer deposit liability relating to filing fees and the associated  earned filing fee revenue; the accounts receivable related to exchange  fees and the related amount of earned exchange fee revenue; and the  budgetary accounts related to undelivered and delivered orders, thus  requiring SEC staff to create an audit trail after the fact.", "There also was no consistent evidence of supervisory review of journal  entries, including closing and adjusting journal entries made in  connection with preparing quarterly and year-end financial statements.", "Comprehensive accounting policies and procedures were still in draft or  had not yet been developed for several major areas related to financial  statements, including disgorgements and penalties, filing fees, exchange  fees, and fixed asset capitalization.", "GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  requires that controls over the financial statement preparation process be  designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the  balances and disclosures reported in the financial statements and related  notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,  including the maintenance of detailed support that accurately and fairly  reflect the transactions making up the balances in the financial statements  and disclosures. In addition, an effective financial management system  includes policies and procedures related to the processing of accounting  entries.", "SEC\u2019s difficulties in the area of financial statement preparation are  exacerbated because SEC\u2019s financial management system is not set up to  generate the user reports needed to perform analyses of accounts and  activity on a real-time basis leading to SEC\u2019s staff-intensive and time- consuming efforts to prepare financial statements. Because SEC does not  maintain standard schedules for producing certain basic reports of account  detail for analysis, users have to request reports generated on an ad hoc  basis by a software application whose operations are known only to some  SEC staff. Also, as I will discuss in more detail later, not all of SEC\u2019s  systems used for tracking and recording financial data are integrated with  the accounting system.", "Federal agencies preparing financial statements are required to develop a  financial management system to prepare a complete set of statements on a  timely basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  The financial statements should be the product of an accounting system  that is an integral part of an overall financial management system with  structure, internal control, and reliable data. Office of Management and  Budget Circular No. A-127, Financial Management Systems, requires that  each agency establish and maintain a single integrated financial  management system\u2014basically a unified set of financial systems  electronically linked for agencywide support. Integration means that the  user is able to obtain needed information efficiently and effectively from  any level of use or access point. (This does not necessarily mean having  only one software application covering all financial management system  needs or storing all information in the same database.) Interfaces between  systems are acceptable as long as the information needed to enable  reconciliation between the systems is accessible to managers. Interface  linkages should be electronic unless the number of transactions is so small  that it is not cost beneficial to automate the interface. Reconciliations  between systems, where interface linkages are appropriate, should be  maintained to ensure data accuracy.", "To support its financial management functions, SEC relies on several  different systems to process and track financial transactions that include  filing and exchange fees, disgorgements and penalties, property and  equipment, administrative items pertaining to payroll and travel, and  others. Not all of these systems are integrated with the accounting system.  For example, the case-tracking system and the spreadsheet application  used to account for significant disgorgement and penalty transactions and  the system used to account for property and equipment are not integrated  with the accounting system. Without a fully integrated financial  management system, SEC decision makers run the risk of delays in  attaining relevant data or using inaccurate information inadvertently while  at the same time dedicating scarce resources toward the basic collection of  information.", "A properly designed and implemented financial statement preparation and  reporting process (which encompasses the financial management system)  should provide SEC management with reasonable assurance that the  balances presented in the financial statements and related disclosures are  materially correct and supported by the underlying accounting records. To  address the issues related to SEC\u2019s financial statement preparation and  reporting processes, we recommended that SEC take the following 13  actions to improve controls over the process. 1. Develop written policies and procedures that provide sufficient  guidance for the year-end closing of the general ledger as well as the  preparation and analysis of quarterly and annual financial statements. 2. Establish clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the staff involved  in financial reporting and the preparation of interim and year-end  financial statements. 3. Prepare a crosswalk between the financial statements and the source  systems, general ledger accounts, and the various account queries and  analyses that make up key balances in the financial statements. 4. Maintain subsidiary records or ledgers for all significant accounts and  disclosures so that the amounts presented in the financial statements  and footnotes can be supported by the collective transactions making  up the balances.  5. Perform monthly or periodic reconciliations of subsidiary records and  summary account balances. 6. Perform a formal closing of all accounts at an interim date or dates to  reduce the level of accounting activity and analysis required at year- end. The formal closing entails procedures to ensure that all  transactions are recorded in the proper period through the closing date,  and then closing the accounting records so that no new entries can be  posted during that period.  7. Distinguish common closing and adjusting entries in a formal listing,  which is used in the general ledger closing process and in preparing  financial statements. 8. Require supervisory review for all entries posted to the general ledger  and financial statements, including closing entries. A supervisor should  review revisions to previously approved entries and revised financial  statements and footnotes. All entries and review should be  documented. 9. Establish milestones for preparing and reviewing the financial  statements by setting dates for critical phases such as closing the  general ledger; preparing financial statements, footnotes, and the  performance and accountability report; and performing specific quality  control review procedures. 10. Use established tools (i.e., checklists and implementation guides)  available for assistance in compiling and reviewing financial  statements. 11. Maintain documentation supporting all information included in the  financial statements and footnotes. This documentation should be  more self-explanatory than what has been retained in the past. The  documentation should be at a level of detail to enable a third party,  such as an auditor, to use the documentation for substantiating  reported data without extensive explanation or re-creation by the  original preparer. 12. Take advantage of in-house resources and expertise in establishing  financial reporting policies, internal controls, and business practices, as  well as in review of financial statement and footnote presentation. 13. Develop or acquire an integrated financial management system to  provide timely and accurate recording of financial data for financial  reporting and management decision making.", "In response to our audit findings, SEC plans to increase its financial  reporting staff this fiscal year, formalize its policies and procedures, and  solicit advice from corporate financial reporting experts within SEC. SEC  senior management has reviewed and endorsed certain initial policies  applied in the first year of financial reporting, and has modified or  recommended others for further review. In addition, SEC plans to establish  a formal audit committee to provide for regular review by key management  officials and advise on policies and controls. SEC is undertaking a  multiyear project to replace the existing case-tracking system with a  system that is better designed for financial reporting purposes.", "Now I would like to shift to the second material internal control weakness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Has Control Weaknesses over Disgorgements and Civil Penalties", "paragraphs": ["As part of its enforcement responsibilities, SEC issues and administers  judgments that order disgorgements and civil penalties against violators of  federal securities laws. The resulting transactions for fiscal year 2004  involved collections of about $945 million, and recording and reporting of  fiduciary and custodial balances on the financial statements. SEC records  and tracks information on over 12,000 parties in SEC enforcement cases  involving disgorgements and penalties through a case-tracking system.  However, the case-tracking system is not designed for financial reporting  and is not integrated with SEC\u2019s general ledger accounting system, which  accumulates, tracks, and summarizes SEC\u2019s financial transactions.", "To compensate for limitations in the system, SEC staff compiles quarterly  subsidiary ledgers using extensive and time-consuming procedures. After  downloading financial information on disgorgements and penalties from  the case-tracking system to a spreadsheet with thousands of cases and  defendants with a magnitude of approximately 1 million data elements,  SEC staff performs numerous calculations using the data in the  spreadsheet to compile the disgorgement and penalty balances as of the  end of each quarter. Such a process is inherently inefficient and prone to  error. Further, since the source of the data included on the spreadsheet is  from the case-tracking system, whose data reliability has been reported as  a problem by SEC for the past three years, it is imperative that specific  control procedures be put in place to provide reasonable assurance over  the completeness and reliability of the data in the case-tracking system. In  addition, control procedures are needed to reduce the risk of errors in the  spreadsheet and ultimately the reported financial statement information.  Finally, when reviewing case files we noted instances in which the  supporting documentation in the files contained notations by the case  managers indicating that potential activities or transactions related to the  case had occurred. However, there was not adequate supporting  documentation to support an entry to the case-tracking system. These  instances raised questions about whether SEC\u2019s accounting and financial  reporting information related to penalties and disgorgements was  potentially incomplete or out-of-date.", "As a result of the issues I have described, we concluded that SEC did not  have adequate control procedures in place to provide adequate assurance  over the reliability of financial information related to this area. Thus, our  auditors performed additional testing over SEC\u2019s financial statement  balances related to penalties and disgorgements. GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government requires that agencies  establish controls to ensure that transactions are recorded in a complete,  accurate, and timely manner. Although SEC has a draft policy that covers  certain aspects of accounting for disgorgements and penalties, it is not  comprehensive. For example, the policy does not define who is responsible  for recording disgorgement and penalty data or the documentation that  should be maintained to support the amounts recorded. Of even greater  importance, the policy does not identify controls that are critical for  determining the amounts to be recorded and for reviewing entries for  completeness and accuracy, including the specific types of controls needed  for the quarterly downloading of data and use of the spreadsheets for  arriving at the accounting entries. Nor does the policy address supervisory  review necessary to ensure consistent application of the procedures.", "A lack of comprehensive policies and controls over disgorgement and  penalty transactions increases the risk that the transactions will not be  completely, accurately, and consistently recorded and reported. In our  audit of the estimated net amounts receivable from disgorgements and  penalties, we did find errors in the recorded balances for the related gross  accounts receivable and allowance for loss. Specifically, we noted errors  where SEC had made entries to the accounting system that conflicted with  information in the files. We also noted inconsistent treatment in recording  judgments, interest amounts, terminated debts, and collection fees  imposed by Treasury. We believe that these errors and inconsistencies  occurred because of the control weaknesses we found. While, in most  cases, these errors and inconsistencies were offsetting, such errors raise  concern about the reliability of the $1.673 billion gross accounts receivable  for disgorgements and penalties and the related allowance amounts of  $1.394 billion reported in footnote 3 to SEC\u2019s financial statements.", "To address internal control weaknesses over disgorgements and penalties,  we recommended that SEC 1. implement a system that is integrated with the accounting system or  that provides the necessary input to the accounting system to facilitate  timely, accurate, and efficient recording and reporting of disgorgement  and penalty activity; 2. review the disgorgement and penalty judgments and subsequent  activities documented in each case file by defendant to determine  whether individual amounts recorded in the case-tracking system are  accurate and reliable;  3. implement controls so that the ongoing activity involving  disgorgements and penalties is properly, accurately, and timely  recorded in the case-tracking system and the accounting system;  4. strengthen coordination, communication, and data flow among staff of  SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement and Office of Financial Management  who share responsibility for recording and maintaining disgorgement  and penalty data; and 5. develop and implement written policies covering the procedures,  documentation, systems, and responsible personnel involved in  recording and reporting disgorgement and penalty financial  information. The written procedures should also address quality  control and managerial review responsibilities and documentation of  such a review.", "SEC agrees with our findings in this area and has begun efforts to  strengthen internal controls. For example, SEC plans to complete a  comprehensive review of files and data and review and strengthen policies  and procedures for recording and updating amounts receivable for  disgorgements and penalties. SEC anticipates that consistent application of  strengthened internal controls and potentially some limited redesign of the  existing management information system will be adequate to resolve the  material weaknesses in fiscal year 2006. However, SEC acknowledges that  a replacement of the current case-tracking system and a more thorough  reexamination of the relevant business process would provide more  effective assurance. Accordingly, in fiscal year 2006, SEC plans to complete  a requirements analysis as the first phase of the multiyear project to  replace the case-tracking system.", "Now I would like to shift to the discussion of the material internal control  weakness pertaining to information security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Needs to Address Weak Controls over Financial and Sensitive Data", "paragraphs": ["Information system controls are essential for any organization that  depends on computer systems and networks to carry out its mission or  business and maintain key records and accountability information.

We found these weaknesses in  user accounts and passwords, access rights and permissions, network  security, and the audit and monitoring of security-related events. These  weaknesses were heightened because SEC had not fully established a  comprehensive monitoring program.", "We identified the following electronic access control weaknesses:  SEC operating personnel did not consistently set password  parameters\u2014such as a minimum of six digits including both numbers  and letters\u2014to ensure a level of difficulty for an intruder trying to guess  a password, and users sometimes did create easy-to-guess passwords.", "All 4,100 network users were inadvertently granted access that would  allow them to circumvent the audit controls in the commission\u2019s main  financial systems.", "Key network devices were not configured to prevent unauthorized  individuals from gaining access to detailed network system policy  settings and lists of users or user groups.", "SEC did not have a comprehensive monitoring program for routine  review, audit, or monitoring of system user-access activities. For  example, audit logging, which is typically used to track certain types of  activity on a system, was not consistently implemented on network  services and there was no real-time capability to target unusual or  suspicious network events for review. In addition, SEC had not fully  implemented a network intrusion-detection system. The commission  did, however, have several initiatives under way to monitor user access  activity.", "We also identified weaknesses in other information system controls\u2014 including physical security, segregation of computer functions, application  change controls, and service continuity. For instance:   At the time of our review, 300 employees and contractors had physical  access to SEC\u2019s data center. Persons with access included an  undetermined number of application programmers, budget analysts,  administrative staff, and customer support staff. Typically, persons  serving these functions do not need access to the data center for their  work.", "SEC had not sufficiently separated incompatible system administration  and security administration functions on its key financial applications.", "Although a change control board at SEC was responsible for authorizing  all application changes, none of the software modifications reviewed  had documentation to show that such authorizations had been obtained.", "SEC had not implemented a service-continuity plan to ensure that the  system and its major applications could continue to function after a  major disruption, such as a loss of electricity.", "As a result of these weaknesses, sensitive SEC data\u2014including payroll and  financial transactions, personnel data, regulatory, and other mission- critical information\u2014were at increased risk of unauthorized disclosure,  modification, or loss.", "A key reason for weaknesses in SEC\u2019s information system general controls  is that the commission has not fully developed and implemented a  comprehensive agency information security program. The Federal  Information Security Management Act (FISMA) requires each agency to  develop, document, and implement an agencywide information security  program to provide security for the information and systems that support  the operations and assets of the agency. Agencies are required to use a risk- based approach to information security management. FISMA also requires  an agency\u2019s information security program to include these key elements:  periodic assessments of risk and the magnitude of harm that could  result from unauthorized access, use, or disruption of information  systems;  policies and procedures that are based on risk assessments and risk  reductions to ensure that information security is addressed throughout  the life cycle of each system and that applicable requirements are met;  security awareness training to inform all users of information security  risks and users\u2019 responsibilities in complying with information security  policies and procedures; and  periodic tests and evaluations of the effectiveness of information  security policies, procedures, and practices related to management,  operational, and technical controls of every major system.", "Although SEC has taken some actions to improve security management\u2014 including establishing a central security management group and appointing  a senior information security officer to manage the information security  program\u2014further efforts are needed. For example, we found that the  commission had not clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the  central security group it had established. In addition, SEC had not fully  (1) assessed its risks, (2) established or implemented security policies,  (3) promoted security awareness, or (4) tested and evaluated the  effectiveness of its information system controls.", "SEC and its Office of Inspector General (OIG) have recognized weaknesses  in the commission\u2019s information security program. Since 2002, SEC has  reported information security as a material weakness in its FMFIA reports.
