Title IV-B of the Social Security Act is the primary source of federal funding designated for child welfare services that is available to states. In fiscal year 2012, Congress appropriated $730 million under Title IV-B. Although states augment these funds with state, local, and other federal funds, some children and families may not receive the services they need. Congress mandated that GAO provide information about the funding and provision of child welfare services. This report addresses: (1) how selected states use funds provided under Title IV-B, (2) what alternative sources of federal funding states use to fund child welfare services and other activities covered under Title IV-B, and (3) what services, if any, child welfare agencies have difficulty securing for children and their families. To answer these questions, GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and reports; analyzed HHS expenditure data and program evaluations; and interviewed HHS officials, child welfare experts, and state and local child welfare officials in 4 states and 13 localities selected to illustrate a variety of approaches to financing and delivering services.

New Mexico targeted certain counties for services, such as intensive in-home services for families at risk of foster care.", "States nationwide also use other federal funds, such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and Social Services Block Grant (SSBG) funds, as well as Medicaid, for purposes covered under Title IV-B. In the spring of 2011, 31 states reported spending TANF funds, and in fiscal year 2010, 44 states reported spending SSBG funds on these purposes. Some states also claim federal Medicaid reimbursement for activities covered under Title IV-B. One selected state, Minnesota, claimed reimbursement for case management for children at risk of foster care placement in 2011. Funds authorized under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act make up the large majority of federal child welfare funds, but are designated for purposes such as providing room and board payments for children in foster care and subsidies to adoptive parents, and generally cannot be used for child welfare services. However, 14 states have waivers allowing them to use these funds more flexibly to improve child and family outcomes. Among GAO's selected states, Florida had a waiver allowing it to use some Title IV-E funds for in-home services designed to prevent foster care placement.", "Many services, including substance abuse treatment and assistance with material needs, such as housing, are difficult for child welfare agencies to secure due to a variety of challenges. A 2008-2009 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) survey that sampled children and families in the child welfare system found that many did not receive needed services. For example, an estimated 58 percent of children age 10 and under at risk of emotional, behavioral, or substance abuse problems had not received related services in the past year. Local child welfare officials in four selected states reported service gaps in multiple areas. Service gaps may harm child wellbeing and make it more difficult to preserve or reunite families. For example, officials from one locality noted 2- to 3-month wait times for substance abuse services. Due to the chronic nature of the disease, delays in receiving services may make it more difficult to reunify families within mandated deadlines. Officials cited factors contributing to service gaps that included provider shortages and lack of transportation. Additionally, officials noted difficulty securing services from partner agencies, such as housing authorities. State fiscal constraints, which affect both child welfare and partner agencies, contribute to such difficulties."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2011, states reported that over 675,000 children were  victims of maltreatment, often abused or neglected by their parents.

These states would be solely responsible for covering additional  costs incurred if the number of children in foster care, or costs of caring for  such children, exceeded state estimates. States with active and recently  approved waivers have used various methods to determine that their  projects were cost neutral. First, states with flexible funding waivers agree  to receive a capped (or fixed) amount of Title IV-E funding in exchange for  flexibility to use those funds for an expanded array of services, similar to a  block grant.

ACF\u2019s most recent Child  and Family Services Reviews, conducted from fiscal years 2007 to 2010,  showed that 20 of 52 states did not have an appropriate range of services  to adequately identify and address the needs of children and families.  ACF defined an appropriate range of services as those that help create a  safe home environment and enable children to remain at home when  reasonable, and help find other permanent homes for foster and adopted  children. ACF officials told us that, while the reviews do not include formal  data on the availability of specific services, their reports on individual  states indicate that the most commonly unavailable services included:  behavioral health services, including child psychologists and psychiatrists;  substance abuse treatment for adults and youth; housing; and domestic  violence services. In a survey funded by Casey Family Programs, 25 out  of 41 of state child welfare agencies responding reported waiting lists for  at least one service provided by child welfare agencies or their purchased  service providers. (This survey did not ask states about the length of  time a child or family remained on the waiting list before receiving  services.) These services included in-home services, home visiting  services, and substance abuse assessment and treatment. The absence  of a waiting list, however, does not necessarily indicate that services are  available. A service provider may not maintain a waiting list even if there  are families waiting to be served.", "Officials from our 13 selected localities echoed these concerns. In  response to a GAO data collection instrument, most of these localities  reported key service gaps in the areas of substance abuse assessment  and treatment services; assistance with material needs, such as housing  and transportation; and in-home services (see figure 4).", "Service gaps can negatively affect outcomes for children and their  families. Specifically, according to officials in our 13 selected localities,  previous GAO work, and some research, service gaps can complicate  efforts to prevent placement in foster care, hinder chances of reunification  after foster care, and harm child well-being.", "Officials in our selected localities reported that difficulty securing high- quality, timely treatment for families with parental substance abuse  problems can decrease the likelihood of recovery and reunification. In 6  of 13 selected localities, officials reported waiting lists for substance  abuse treatment services. Officials in one of these localities noted that  clients often wait 2 to 3 months for these services. Further, officials in  five localities said that available inpatient services were of poor quality or  too short in duration to meet client needs. New Mexico officials told us  their state\u2019s behavioral health entity covered a maximum of 30 days of  inpatient substance abuse treatment, which they said is insufficient for  long-term addicts.", "Some research corroborates the views of local officials that lack of access  to timely, intensive treatment may negatively affect a family\u2019s chances of  reunification. A 2007 study of nearly 2,000 women in Oregon who were  substance abusers and had children in foster care found that mothers  were more likely to be reunited with their children if they entered  treatment quickly and spent more time in treatment. Similarly, in California, a study of more than a thousand mothers who participated in a  drug treatment program in 2000 found that mothers who completed or  spent at least 90 days in treatment were about twice as likely to reunify  with their children as those who spent less time in treatment. GAO  previously reported on family-centered residential drug treatment  programs, which can last up to 24 months and may allow women to bring  their children with them. These programs help women address issues  underlying their substance abuse, build coping strategies, and enhance  parenting skills, which can reduce chances that children will need to be  removed to foster care. The Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration (SAMHSA) evaluated performance data from  residential treatment programs for mothers and found that 6 months after  treatment ended, fewer children of participating women were living in  foster care and most children who accompanied their mothers to  treatment were still living with them.", "Officials in several of our selected localities also said it could be difficult  for families experiencing substance abuse to achieve reunification within   Delays in receiving treatment can make it difficult  mandated deadlines. for treatment to be completed within these deadlines. In addition, a  previous GAO report found that mandated reunification deadlines can  conflict with the amount of time required to successfully address the  needs of these families.high-quality, evidence-based treatment is essential to achieving  reunification within mandated timelines. Officials in one selected locality  said they frequently terminate parental rights due to parents\u2019 inability to  establish sobriety within limited time frames. However, officials in another  locality reported that judges are sympathetic to substance-abusing   One ACF official told us that timely access to  parents\u2019 efforts to engage in services, and frequently extend their  permanency deadlines.", "According to past GAO work and officials in selected localities, lack of  affordable housing may also contribute to children\u2019s removal into foster  care or may prevent families from reunifying. In 2007, GAO surveyed 48  state child welfare directors about African American children in foster  care. Officials from 25 states cited a lack of affordable housing options as  one factor that contributed to disproportionately high rates of foster care  placement among African American children in the child welfare system.  This report found that affordable public housing is a critical support that  can help low-income families stay together. 13 selected localities told us that a parent\u2019s inability to obtain housing  could prevent family reunification even if all other reunification criteria had  been met. However, officials in one locality said they work with families  to find them appropriate housing and would not keep a child from his or  her parents based solely on the family\u2019s housing situation.", "Similarly, officials in 3 of our  GAO previously reported that failure to provide services to address the  trauma of abuse or neglect may negatively affect children\u2019s well-being in  both the short and long term. GAO reported that children may experience  traumatic stress as a result of maltreatment, which significantly increases  their risk of mental health problems, difficulties with social relationships  and behavior, physical illness, and poor school performance. Early  detection and treatment of childhood mental health conditions can  improve children\u2019s symptoms and reduce the likelihood of negative future  outcomes, such as dropping out of school or becoming involved in the   ACF has also made the social and emotional  juvenile justice system.", "GAO, African American Children in Foster Care: Additional HHS Assistance Needed to  Help States Reduce the Proportion in Care, GAO-07-816 (Washington, D.C.: July 11,  2007). well-being of children receiving child welfare services an agency priority,  and is encouraging child welfare agencies to focus on improving  behavioral and social-emotional outcomes for the children they serve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "In Our Selected Localities, Service Gaps Were Caused by Factors Including Provider Shortages and Challenges Accessing Services of Partner Agencies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Provider Shortages", "paragraphs": ["Officials from 8 of our 13 selected localities reported a shortage of  substance abuse treatment providers. Some officials cited a shortage of  treatment in general, while others discussed shortages of specific kinds of  treatment. For instance, officials from six localities reported an inadequate  number of inpatient treatment providers. Officials from two selected  localities also reported particular difficulty finding providers that offered  appropriate substance abuse treatment services for adolescents. In one  Virginia locality with extremely high rates of substance abuse, officials  said that in order to address this shortage, their local behavioral health  agency had hired a counselor dedicated to treating youth with substance  abuse problems. However, this counselor served five counties and had  difficulty keeping up with demand.", "Officials from nine selected localities as well as three state officials from  our discussion group reported a shortage of mental health service  providers. Officials from six localities and three state officials from our  discussion group also noted shortages of certain types of specialists. For  example, officials from multiple localities in three out of four selected  states reported acute shortages of child psychiatrists. One state official  who participated in our discussion group also reported particular difficulty  finding mental health providers who offered evidence-based therapies  specifically designed to address trauma in children. Officials in one  Florida locality said that service providers in their community were  interested in becoming trained in certain evidence-based practices, but  found it too costly to do so. To address mental health provider shortages,  Minnesota\u2019s Department of Human Services contracted with the Mayo  Clinic to provide phone-based psychiatric consultation services to primary  care doctors across the state. Officials said the initiative would improve  the quality of psychiatric care for children, including children in the child  welfare system.", "Officials in several localities across three states and from one state in our  discussion group reported a shortage of mental health, substance abuse,  and/or other service providers who accept Medicaid. GAO has previously  reported on this issue. In a recent survey of states, GAO found that 17  states reported challenges ensuring enough mental health and substance  abuse providers for Medicaid beneficiaries. Additionally, GAO found in  2011 that more than three times as many primary care physicians  reported difficulty referring children enrolled in Medicaid or the Children\u2019s  Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to specialists as compared with  privately-insured children.", "Finally, provider shortages were cited as particularly challenging in rural  areas. Officials in localities across all four selected states and two state  officials from our discussion group reported provider shortages in rural  areas. Officials from some rural localities described difficulty attracting  and retaining service providers. A local Florida official said that one of his  agency\u2019s behavioral health purchased service providers had been  advertising a child psychiatrist position for 5 years without success. In  several localities, officials said provider shortages often result in families  traveling long distances to receive services in more urban areas.", "Inadequate health coverage among some children and families in the  child welfare system also contributes to service gaps. In 6 of 13 localities,  officials cited lack of health insurance as a factor contributing to difficulty  securing medical services for families. Officials from selected localities  reported that in some cases services were more difficult to obtain for  parents than for their children, due to lack of health insurance. In  addition, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid and may  lack private health insurance as well. Officials in several localities  described particular difficulty obtaining services for these families. There  are, however, a variety of approaches local officials reported using in  order to obtain services for families. In some cases, agencies were able  to turn to behavioral health agencies. And in one locality, officials said a  local non-profit sometimes funded mental health assessments for clients  without insurance. In other cases, officials said their agencies paid for  these services with their own funds. Additionally, fewer parents in the  child welfare system may lack health insurance after January 1, 2014,  when states may expand eligibility for Medicaid coverage to non-elderly  non-pregnant adults with incomes at or below 133 percent of the federal  poverty level, as provided for under the Patient Protection and Affordable  Care Act.", "Lack of transportation is also a widespread impediment to obtaining  services, especially in rural areas. Officials in all selected agencies that  served rural areas reported difficulty with transportation for rural clients,  and discussion group participants from two additional states reported  similar difficulties. A number of local officials said that providing services  in the home could help mitigate transportation challenges, as well as  allow providers to better assess and address challenges in the home  environment. Some officials noted that in-home services are typically  more expensive than office-based services. However, officials in one  Florida locality reported that they had made in-home services a budgetary  priority due to transportation challenges in their area.", "While state child welfare agencies receive reimbursement under Title IV- E for many costs related to children in foster care, funding for services  designed to prevent the need to remove children from their homes and  place them in foster care is more limited. State and local child welfare  agencies may face difficult decisions when determining which of these  prevention activities to prioritize and fund, particularly in light of the  ongoing fiscal challenges states face. For instance, local officials in New  Mexico described challenges in securing resources to provide services to  children and families at risk of foster care placement. New Mexico state  officials told us they contracted for services designed to avoid foster care  placement or reunite families after foster care entirely with Title IV-B  PSSF family preservation and reunification funds and did not allocate  state or other federal funds to support these contracts. Because Title IV-B  funds were limited, the state targeted services only to selected counties  with the highest need. Officials in one New Mexico county said that most  of their family preservation and reunification services were cut for fiscal  year 2013, in part because they had been successful in reducing the  number of children in foster care and were no longer considered a high  need county.", "Fiscal challenges have also affected child welfare partner agencies. For  example, one ACF official we interviewed noted that most states have  experienced budget cuts in social services, which affect both child welfare  and substance abuse services. In addition, officials from SAMHSA told us  that since 2008, states have had more difficulty maintaining state funding  of behavioral health services.", "Many localities experienced gaps in services provided by partner  agencies, in some cases due to the fiscal constraints of those agencies.  For example:", "Officials in 7 of the 13 localities, as well as one state official from our  discussion group, said that their local housing authorities had long  waiting lists (in some cases up to 3 or 4 years) for Section 8 housing  vouchers. As a result, families referred to the housing authority often  did not receive assistance.", "In a few localities, officials said that families with children in foster  care could not obtain approval for public housing units until they had  regained custody, which hindered efforts to reunite children with their  families. One ACF official said that, in response to GAO\u2019s inquiry, the agency initiated discussions with HUD about improving outreach  to local housing authorities about this issue.", "Officials in two localities in different states, as well as one state official  from our discussion group, noted that their state Medicaid programs  required diagnoses of mental health disorders to cover services, even  for very young children (ages 0 to 3 years). Officials stated that these  requirements could make obtaining needed services difficult in some  cases, and could result in inappropriate diagnoses in other cases.", "States may place appropriate limits on accessing services based on medical necessity  or utilization control procedures. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 440.230.", "However, in some cases, selected child welfare agencies coordinated  with other service agencies to improve families\u2019 access to services. For  example:", "Three selected localities had coordinated with their local housing  authority to apply for a grant through the federal Family Unification  Program, which sets aside housing vouchers for families in the child  welfare system.", "Two selected localities had Family Dependency Treatment Courts,  which coordinate court, treatment, and child welfare services for child  welfare cases in which parental substance abuse is a primary factor.", "One Virginia locality collaborated with partner agencies to use funding  provided under the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act for  homelessness prevention and rapid re-housing to help families at risk  of eviction. As these funds were about to expire, they worked with  community partners to identify other sources of funding to allow this  homelessness prevention program to continue.", "There are also other opportunities on the federal, state, and local level for  child welfare and partner agencies to coordinate to improve service  delivery for children and families in the child welfare system.

Grants were awarded to projects  focused on improving safety, family functioning, and child well-being  in families at risk of homelessness and child maltreatment.", "Also in 2012, ACF awarded nine grants totaling almost $29 million  over 5 years for projects to improve the social and emotional well- being of children and youth in the child welfare system. The purposes  of these grants, which are in the form of cooperative agreements,  include improving adoption outcomes through interagency  collaboration and supporting child welfare agencies in assessing  children\u2019s mental and behavioral health needs.", "The Commissioner of ACF\u2019s Administration on Children, Youth and  Families told us the agency is encouraging states to collaborate with  state Medicaid agencies to solve issues affecting families in the child  welfare system, including barriers to accessing Medicaid-funded  mental health services for infants. As an example, he said ACF\u2019s most  recent Title IV-E waiver announcement encouraged state child welfare  agencies to submit proposals in conjunction with state Medicaid  agencies. According to the Commissioner, six out of nine approved  waiver proposals explicitly indicate a partnership with the state  Medicaid agency.", "In fiscal year 2012, SAMHSA awarded 16 grants totaling almost $16  million to implement systems of care (which involve collaboration  across government and private agencies, providers, and families) for  children and youth with serious emotional disturbances.

They must make difficult choices  about how to allocate their limited resources to support services critical to  ensuring children\u2019s safety and well-being. Despite their use of Title IV-B  funding in combination with other federal dollars to supplement their state  and local funds, these agencies continue to struggle to meet the complex  needs of children not in foster care and their families. Given current state  and federal fiscal constraints, they will likely continue to struggle. The  waivers HHS has granted to some states to use their Title IV-E funding  more flexibly may provide useful information about the effects of shifting  available resources from foster care costs to support services intended to  reduce the need for foster care without increasing funding overall."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services for review and comment.

The agency also agreed with  GAO\u2019s concluding observations that ongoing fiscal constraints contribute  to challenges in meeting the needs of children and families, and offered  two steps child welfare agencies could take to more effectively use  available resources: (1) identify currently funded services that do not yield  desired results and shift resources toward evidence-based programs and  practices; and (2) use outcomes (specifically those related to child well- being), rather than services delivered, to measure program success. Our  report did not address the effectiveness of specific services; however we  agree that information about effective practices is an important tool that  child welfare agencies can use to determine how best to allocate  available funds. Additionally, our work has long shown that using  outcomes is an important component of measuring program success.", "HHS also discussed the use of TANF funds for child welfare purposes in  its comments, and noted that in addition to the services described in our  report, TANF funds are spent on foster care maintenance payments and  adoption subsidies, as well as relative foster care maintenance payments  and guardianship subsidies. Because this report focuses on expenditures  for services typically covered under Title IV-B, we did not include  maintenance payments and adoption subsidies in the scope of our  review. We have clarified that, due to the similarity among these payment  types, we excluded relative maintenance payments and guardianship  subsidies as well. HHS also noted that states may spend federal TANF  funds on purposes authorized solely under prior law that do not meet a  TANF purpose, and that many of these expenditures are for child welfare  purposes. We have also clarified that our analysis includes these  expenditures, as appropriate. Finally, HHS described planned revisions to  its TANF expenditure reporting form to capture more detailed information  about how states spend TANF funds on child welfare payments and  services. We have not reviewed these plans; however, we recently  recommended that HHS develop a detailed plan and specific timelines to  help monitor its progress in revising these TANF reporting categories.", "In addition to these general comments, HHS also provided us with  technical comments that we incorporated, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to relevant congressional  committees, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and other  interested parties.
