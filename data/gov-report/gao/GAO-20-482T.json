Although the assumptions in each of these projections vary somewhat, all result in the same conclusion: over the long term, the imbalance between spending and revenue that is built into current law and policy will lead to (1) deficits exceeding $1 trillion each year beginning in fiscal year 2020 and (2) both the annual deficit and the cumulative total debt held by the public continuing to grow as shares of gross domestic product (GDP).

This situation\u2014in which debt grows faster than GDP\u2014means the current  federal fiscal path is unsustainable.", "Decisions in the near term to support economic growth and address the  security and social challenges the nation faces need to be accompanied  by a broader fiscal plan to put the federal government on a sustainable  long-term path. This is essential to ensure that the United States remains  in a strong economic position to meet its security and social needs. It is  also necessary to preserve flexibility to address potentially urgent or  unforeseen events, such as natural disasters, economic downturns,  cyberattacks, and military conflicts.", "GAO\u2019s Fiscal Health report provides information on (1) the unsustainable  fiscal path and its primary drivers, (2) growing fiscal pressures that could  further strain the federal budget, (3) why it is important to change the  fiscal path, and (4) the need to take a new approach to managing the  debt.", "My statement is based upon our 2020 annual report on the nation\u2019s fiscal  health, which leverages our fiscal year 2019 audit of the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements; our work on natural  disasters; 2019 High-Risk List; the 2019 fragmentation, overlap, and  duplication annual report; and other related work.

By comparison, such debt has averaged  46 percent of GDP annually since 1946. If current trends continue, debt  as a share of GDP will exceed the historic high 1946 level of 106 percent  of GDP within 11 to 14 years. In 2050, it will be nearly twice that level and  about four times its post-World War II average. Figure 1 shows that in  GAO, CBO, and 2019 Financial Report projections, debt held by the  public as a share of GDP grows substantially over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spending Outlook Is Driven by Health Care and Net Interest on the Debt", "paragraphs": ["Under GAO, CBO, and the 2019 Financial Report projections, spending  for the major health and retirement programs grows more rapidly than  GDP in coming decades. This is a consequence of both an aging  population and projected continued increases in health care costs per  beneficiary. Medicare spending is expected to exceed $1 trillion per year  by fiscal year 2026, and Social Security spending already exceeds $1  trillion per year.", "However, according to the projections, these spending categories will  eventually be overtaken by spending on net interest, which primarily  consists of interest costs on the federal government\u2019s debt held by the  public. In recent years, persistently low interest rates have resulted in  lower interest costs for the government than previously projected. Despite  these low interest rates, spending on net interest grew from $263 billion in  2017 to $376 billion in 2019. That $376 billion is 8.4 percent of total  federal spending, which exceeded combined spending on agriculture,  transportation, and veterans\u2019 benefits and services.", "Going forward, both interest rates and the debt are projected to grow,  which means spending on net interest is projected to grow faster than any  other component of the budget. In 2032, spending on net interest is  projected to exceed $1 trillion annually. Over the past 50 years, net  interest costs have averaged 2 percent of GDP but these costs are  projected to increase to 7.2 percent by 2049. As figure 2 shows, we  project that as a share of GDP, net interest spending will exceed  Medicare spending in 2041, Social Security spending in 2044, and total  Discretionary spending in 2049.", "Interest costs will also depend in part on the outstanding mix of Treasury  securities. The Department of the Treasury issues securities in a wide  range of maturities to appeal to a broad range of investors to support its  goal of borrowing at the lowest cost over time. Treasury refinances  maturing debt by issuing new debt in its place at the prevailing interest  rate. At the end of fiscal year 2019, 61 percent of the outstanding amount  of marketable Treasury securities held by the public (about $9.9 trillion)  was scheduled to mature in the next 4 years. If interest rates are higher,  Treasury will have to refinance these securities at the higher interest  rates, adding to the interest costs of the growing federal debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Action Is Needed to Address an Unsustainable Fiscal Path", "paragraphs": ["Impending financial challenges for major programs and fiscal risks are  both straining the federal budget and contributing to the growing debt.  Sustaining key programs will require changes (see fig. 3).", "The President\u2019s Budget, CBO, and the Chair of the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System all make it clear that rising federal debt  could have long-term consequences for the economy. For example it  could:  constrain Congress\u2019s ability to support the economy or address other  national priorities,  restrain private investment and thereby reduce productivity and  overall growth, and erode confidence in the U.S. dollar.", "In addition, it may increase the risk of a fiscal crisis, in which investors  would lose confidence in the U.S. government\u2019s financial position, and  interest rates on Treasury securities would increase abruptly.", "To change the long-term fiscal path, policymakers will need to consider  policy changes to the entire range of federal activities, both revenue  (including tax expenditures) and spending (entitlement programs, other  mandatory spending, and discretionary spending). As Congress  considers changes in revenue and spending policies to improve the  federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal path, it will also need to consider  other approaches for managing the level of debt.", "As currently structured, the debt limit is a legal limit on the total amount of  federal debt that can be outstanding at one time. The debt limit does not  restrict Congress\u2019s ability to pass spending and revenue legislation that  affects the level of debt, nor does it otherwise constrain fiscal policy.  Without legislation to suspend or raise the debt limit, Treasury cannot  continue issuing debt to finance the decisions already enacted by  Congress and the President. We have reported on the negative impacts  of uncertainty around the debt limit which include (1) increased Treasury  borrowing costs, (2) decreased demand for Treasury securities, and (3)  constrained Treasury cash management. We have reported numerous  times that the full faith and credit of the United States must be preserved.", "We have also recommended that Congress consider other approaches to  the current debt limit to avoid seriously disrupting the Treasury market  and increasing borrowing costs and to allow it to better manage the  federal government\u2019s level of debt. A number of bills have been  introduced in this Congress to address this issue. The Senate Budget  Committee\u2019s proposal to reform the Congressional budget process would  automatically adjust the debt limit to conform to levels established in the  budget resolution.", "In contrast to the debt limit, fiscal rules can support efforts to achieve  fiscal sustainability by imposing numerical limits or targets on the budget  to guide fiscal policy. Fiscal rules are intended to influence decisions  about spending and revenue as they are made.", "The Senate Budget Committee\u2019s proposal to reform the Congressional  budget process is an example of one such approach. This legislation  would specify target ratios for debt as a share of GDP and track  legislation against that target. As Congress continues to consider options,  two key points should be emphasized.", "An agreed-upon goal can help policymakers justify and frame their  choices. With that in mind, a fiscal target that establishes a common  goal for controlling the size of the federal debt relative to the  economy\u2014as well as well-designed rules that put the federal  government on a path to achieve that target\u2014could form part of a  long-term fiscal plan to put the government on a sustainable fiscal  path.", "The longer action is delayed, the greater and more drastic the  changes will have to be, placing an additional burden on future  generations.", "While changes in spending and revenue to ensure long-term fiscal  sustainability require legislative actions to alter fiscal policies, executive  agencies can also take actions to contribute toward a sustainable fiscal future. Although executive actions alone cannot put the U.S. government  on a sustainable fiscal path, it is important for agencies to act as stewards  of federal resources. These actions include reducing improper payments,  which agencies estimate totaled $175 billion in fiscal year 2019;  addressing the $381 billion annual net tax gap; better managing  fragmentation, overlap, and duplication across the federal government;  and improving information on federal programs and fiscal operations to  aid agency decision-making.", "Chairman Enzi, Ranking Member Sanders, and Members of the  Committee, this completes our prepared statement.
