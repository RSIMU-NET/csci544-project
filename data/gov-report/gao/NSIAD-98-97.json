Consumable items, such as clothing and medical supplies, are managed primarily by DLA. Reparable parts are generally expensive items that can be fixed and used again, such as hydraulic pumps, navigational computers, wing sections, and landing gear. Each military service manages reparable parts that are used for their operations. These management functions include determining how many parts will be needed to support operations, purchasing new parts, and deciding when broken parts need to be repaired. As shown in figure 1, aircraft reparable parts represent an estimated 59 percent of DOD\u2019s secondary inventory.", "To provide reparable parts for their aircraft, the military services use extensive logistics systems that were based on management processes, procedures, and concepts that have evolved over time but are largely outdated. Each service\u2019s logistics system, often referred to as a logistics pipeline, consists of a number of activities that play a role in providing aircraft parts where and when they are needed. These activities include the purchase, storage, distribution, and repair of parts, which together require billions of dollars of investment in personnel, equipment, facilities, and inventory. In our recent reports on the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force logistics pipelines, we highlighted many of the problems and inefficiencies associated with the services\u2019 current logistics systems.

According to the statute, not more than 50 percent of the funds made available for depot-level maintenance and repair can be used to contract for performance by nonfederal government personnel. Other statutes that affect the extent to which depot-level workloads can be converted to private sector performance include (1) 10 U.S.C. 2469, which provides that DOD-performed depot maintenance and repair workloads valued at not less than $3 million cannot be changed to contractor performance without a public-private competition and (2) 10 U.S.C. 2464, which provides that DOD activities should maintain a government-owned and operated logistics capability sufficient to ensure technical competence and resources necessary for an effective and timely response to a national defense emergency.", "Another provision that may affect future DOD logistics operations is  10 U.S.C. 2474, added to the United States Code by section 361 of the Fiscal Year 1998 National Defense Authorization Act.

The most successful improvements include using highly accurate information systems to track and control inventory; employing various methods to speed the flow of parts through the pipeline; shifting certain inventory tasks to suppliers; and having third parties handle parts repair, storage, and distribution functions. One airline, British Airways, has substantially improved its logistics operations over a 14-year period. British Airways approached the process of change as a long-term effort that requires steady vision and a focus on continual improvement. Although the airline has reaped significant gains from improvements, it continued to reexamine operations and make improvements to its logistics system. Adopting practices similar to British Airways and other commercial airlines could help DOD\u2019s repair pipelines become faster and more responsive to customer needs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Commercial Airline Reengineering Efforts", "paragraphs": ["British Airways used a supply-chain management approach to reengineer its logistics system. With this approach, the various activities encompassed by the logistics pipeline were viewed as a series of interrelated processes rather than isolated functional areas. For example, when British Airways began changing the way parts were purchased from suppliers, it considered how those changes would affect mechanics in repair workshops.", "British Airways officials described how a combination of supply-chain improvements could lead to a continuous cycle of improvement. For example, culture changes, improved data accuracy, and more efficient processes all lead to a reduction in inventories and complexity of operations. These reductions, in turn, improve an organization\u2019s ability to maintain accurate data. The reductions also stimulate continued change in culture and processes, both of which fuel further reductions in inventory and complexity.", "Despite this integrated approach, British Airways\u2019 transformation did not follow a precise plan or occur in a rigid sequence of events. Rather, according to one manager, airline officials took the position that doing nothing was the worst option. After setting overall goals, airline officials gave managers and employees the flexibility to continually test new ideas to meet those goals.", "Four specific practices used by British Airways and other airlines that appear to be suited to DOD operations to the extent they can be implemented within the existing legislative and regulatory framework include the (1) prompt repair of items, (2) reorganization of the repair process, (3) establishment of partnerships with key suppliers, and (4) use of third-party logistics services. These initiatives are interrelated and, when used together, can help maximize a company\u2019s inventory investment, decrease inventory levels, and provide a more flexible repair capability. They appear to address many of the same problems DOD faces and represent practices that could be applied to its operations. We recommended in our reports that DOD test these concepts in an integrated manner to maximize their potential benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Repairing Items Promptly", "paragraphs": ["Certain airlines begin repairing items as quickly as possible, which prevents the broken items from sitting idle for extended periods. Minimizing idle time helps reduce inventories because it lessens the need for extra \u201ccushions\u201d of inventory to cover operations while parts are out of service. In addition, repairing items promptly promotes flexible scheduling and production practices, enabling maintenance operations to respond more quickly as repair needs arise.", "Prompt repair involves inducting parts into maintenance shops soon after broken items arrive at repair facilities. However, prompt repair does not mean that all parts are fixed. The goal is to quickly fix only those parts that are needed. One commercial airline routes broken items directly to holding areas next to repair shops, rather than to stand-alone warehouses, so that mechanics can quickly access these broken parts. The holding areas also give mechanics better visibility of any backlog. It is difficult to specifically quantify the benefits of repairing items promptly because that practice is often used with other ones to speed up pipeline processes. One airline official said, however, that the airline has kept inventory investment down partly because it does not allow broken parts to remain idle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reorganizing the Repair Process", "paragraphs": ["One approach to accelerate the repair process and promote flexibility in the repair shop is the \u201ccellular\u201d concept. Under this concept, an airline moved all of the resources that are needed to repair broken parts, such as tooling and support equipment, personnel, and inventory, into one location or repair center \u201ccell.\u201d This approach simplifies the repair of parts by eliminating the time-consuming exercise of routing parts to workshops in different locations. It also ensures that mechanics have the technical support to ensure that operations run smoothly. In addition, because inventory is placed near workshops, mechanics have quick access to the parts they need to complete repairs more quickly. British Airways adopted the cellular approach after determining that parts could be repaired as much as 10 times faster using this concept. Figure 2 shows a repair cell used in British Airways\u2019 maintenance center at Heathrow Airport. Another airline that adopted this approach in its engine-blade repair shop was able to reduce repair time by 50 to 60 percent and decrease work-in-process inventory by 60 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Establishing Partnerships With Key Suppliers", "paragraphs": ["Several airlines and manufacturers have worked with suppliers to improve parts support and reduce overall inventory. Two approaches\u2014the use of local distribution centers and integrated supplier programs\u2014specifically seek to improve the management and distribution of consumable items, such as nuts, bolts, and fuses. These approaches help ensure that the consumable items for repair and manufacturing operations are readily available, which prevents parts from stalling in the repair process and helps speed up repair time. In addition, by improving management and distribution methods, such as streamlined ordering and fast deliveries, these approaches enable firms to delay the purchase of inventory until a point that is closer to the time it is needed. Firms, therefore, can reduce their stocks of \u201cjust-in-case\u201d inventory.", "Local distribution centers are supplier-operated facilities that are established near a customer\u2019s operations and provide deliveries of parts within 24 hours. One airline that used this approach has worked with key suppliers to establish more than 30 centers near its major repair operations. These centers receive orders electronically and, in some cases, handle up to eight deliveries a day. Airline officials said that the ability to get parts quickly has contributed to repair time reductions. In addition, the officials said that the centers have helped the airline cut its on-hand supply of consumable items nearly in half. Figure 3 shows a local distribution center, located at Heathrow Airport, that is operated by the Boeing Company.", "Integrated supplier programs involve shifting inventory management functions to suppliers. Under this arrangement, a supplier is responsible for monitoring parts usage and determining how much inventory is needed to maintain a sufficient supply. The supplier\u2019s services are tailored to the customer\u2019s requirements and can include placing a supplier representative in customer facilities to monitor supply bins at end-user locations, place orders, manage receipts, and restock bins. Other services can include 24-hour order-to-delivery times, quality inspection, parts kits, establishment of data interchange links and inventory bar coding, and vendor selection management. One manufacturer that used an integrated supplier received parts 98 percent of the time within 24 hours of placing an order, which enabled the manufacturer to reduce inventories for these items by $7.4 million\u2014an 84-percent reduction. Figure 4 illustrates how an integrated supplier could reduce or eliminate the need for at least three inventory storage locations in a typical DOD repair facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Using Third-Party Logistics Providers", "paragraphs": ["Third-party logistics providers can be used to reduce costs and improve performance. Third-party firms take on responsibility for managing and carrying out certain logistics functions, such as storage and distribution. As a result, companies can reduce overhead costs because they no longer need to maintain personnel, facilities, and other resources that are required to do these functions in house.", "Third-party firms also help companies improve various aspects of their operations because these providers can offer expertise that companies often do not have the time or the resources to develop. For example, one airline contracts with a third-party logistics provider to handle deliveries and pickups from suppliers and repair vendors, which has improved the reliability and speed of deliveries and reduced overall administrative costs. The airline receives most items within 5 days, which includes time-consuming customs delays, and is able to deliver most items to repair vendors in 3 days. In the past, deliveries took as long as 3 weeks.", "In addition, third-party providers can assume other functions. One third-party firm that we visited, for example, can assume warehousing and shipping responsibilities and provide rapid transportation to speed parts to end users. The company can also pick up any broken parts from a customer and deliver them to the source of repair within 48 hours. In addition, this company maintains the data associated with warehousing and in-transit activities, offering real-time visibility of assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Impact of Best Practices on DOD Operations", "paragraphs": ["If DOD were to adopt a combination of best practices, similar to those employed by commercial airlines, the time items spend in the services\u2019 repair pipelines could be substantially reduced. For example, the cellular concept enables a repair shop to respond more quickly to different repair needs. An integrated supplier can provide the consumable parts needed to complete repairs faster and more reliably. Both of these concepts are needed to establish an agile repair capability, which in turn enables a company to repair items more promptly. A much faster and responsive repair pipeline would allow DOD to buy, store, and distribute significantly less inventory and improve customer service. For example, an Army-sponsored RAND study noted that reducing the repair time for one helicopter component from 90 to 15 days would reduce inventory requirements for that component from $60 million to $10 million.", "Figures 5 and 6 uses the Army\u2019s pipeline for reparable parts to illustrate the potential impact that the integrated use of best practices would have on DOD\u2019s logistics system. Figure 5 illustrates the current repair pipeline at Corpus Christi Army Depot, including the average number of days it took to move the parts we examined through this pipeline and the flow of consumable parts into the repair depot. The consumable parts flow includes hardware inventory stored in DLA warehouses and repair depot inventory, which in 1996 totaled $5.7 billion and $46 million, respectively. Despite this investment in inventory, the supply system was completely filling customer orders only 25 percent of the time. Also, as of August 1996, mechanics had more than $40 million in parts on backorder, 34 percent of which was still unfilled after 3 months. In addition, reparable parts flowing through this system took an average of 525 days to complete the process.", "Figure 6 illustrates a modified Army system, incorporating the use of an integrated supplier for consumable items, third-party logistics services, parts induction soon after they arrive at the depot, and cellular repair shops. If the military services were to adopt these practices, they could substantially reduce the number of days for a part to flow through the repair pipeline and reduce or eliminate much of the inventory in DLA and repair depot storage locations.", "DOD\u2019s application of concepts such as third-party logistics and integrated suppliers, however, may require a cost comparison between government and commercial providers in accordance with Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76. This circular requires, in general, that a public-private competition must be held before contracting out of functions, activities, and services that were being accomplished by more than 10 DOD employees.

The overall goal of the program is to eliminate unnecessary steps in the logistics pipeline that delay the flow of parts through the system. The Army plans to achieve this goal in a similar manner as the private sector: by changing its processes and not by refining the existing system. The Army\u2019s Vice Chief of Staff has strongly endorsed the program as a vehicle for making dramatic improvements to the current logistics system. In anticipation of these improvements, the Army has reduced its operating budgets for fiscal years 1998 through 2003 by $156.5 million.", "The Velocity Management program consists of Army-wide process improvement teams for the following four areas: ordering and shipping of parts, the repair cycle, inventory levels and locations (also known as stockage determination), and financial management. For each of these areas, the Army is examining its current processes and attempting to identify ways to improve them. The Army\u2019s implementation strategy for these improvement areas includes three phases: defining the process, measuring process performance, and improving the process. As shown in table 1, the four improvement areas are in various implementation phases.", "The order and shipping improvement area is in phase 3 and the farthest along in the implementation process. In this area, the Army has reduced the time it takes to order and deliver parts to a customer located in the United States from approximately 22 to 11 days, or by 50 percent. According to Army officials, this improvement was achieved by automating the ordering process and having delivery trucks dedicated to servicing a single customer. The Army plans to continue work on other functions in this area, such as the receiving process.", "The stockage determination and repair cycle initiatives are both in  phase 2. According to Army officials, these improvement areas have not advanced as quickly as planned due to difficulties in obtaining reliable data to measure the current processes. Also, Army officials have not precisely determined what metrics to use for measuring future improvements.

The first initiative, called regional supply, consolidates decentralized supply management functions into seven regionally based activities. Under the old system, naval bases, aviation repair depots, and shipyards each had supply organizations to manage needed parts. These activities often used different information systems and business practices and their own personnel and facilities. This initiative does not consolidate inventories into fewer storage locations. The consolidation is intended to provide central management of spare parts for these individual operations, improve parts visibility, and reduce the overhead expenses associated with separate management functions. The Navy hopes that the centralized management approach will lead to a better sharing among locations and reductions in inventories. In fiscal year 1997, the Navy reported inventory reductions of $4.9 million through its regional supply program, and it expects to reduce inventories by an additional $24 million in fiscal  year 1998. The Navy expects that 90 percent of the supply management consolidations will be completed by the end of fiscal year 1998.", "The second initiative, called regional maintenance, similarly identifies redundant maintenance capabilities and consolidates these operations into regionally based repair facilities. For example, in one region the Navy is consolidating 32 locations used to calibrate maintenance test equipment into 4 locations. The regional maintenance program is mainly focused on reducing infrastructure costs, but its other objectives include improving maintenance processes, integrating supply support and maintenance functions, and providing compatible information systems. Through fiscal year 1996, the Navy identified a total of 102 regional maintenance initiatives: 55 were started in fiscal year 1997, and 47 are to be implemented between fiscal years 1998 and 2001. The Navy estimates that its regional maintenance efforts will save $944 million between fiscal years 1994 and 2001.", "We recently reported that, although the Navy has made progress in achieving its infrastructure streamlining objective under regional maintenance, the progress thus far has not been as great as anticipated and challenges remain for accomplishing future plans. Full implementation, initially projected for fiscal year 1999, is now projected for fiscal year 2000 and could take longer. Many of the initiatives identified have not been completed, and projected savings are not being achieved. For example, one initiative to consolidate planning and engineering functions for certain repairs is not progressing as planned, delaying planned personnel reductions and affecting up to $92 million in savings projected to occur between fiscal years 1998 and 2001. The Navy has classified many of its initiatives as high risk because of barriers to implementation, including institutional resistance to change, inadequate information systems, and poor visibility over maintenance-related costs.", "The Navy\u2019s third initiative, called direct vendor delivery, is a logistics support technique intended to reduce the costs of the inventory management and distribution functions. Under this initiative, a contractor (typically an original equipment manufacturer) will be responsible for repairing, storing, and distributing weapon system components. The contractor agrees to meet certain delivery timeframes and supply availability rates for the components. When a component fails at an operating location, it is sent directly to the contractor rather than to a Navy repair facility. The contractor in turn ships a replacement part back to the operating location. If a future demand for the item is anticipated, then the contractor fixes the broken component so it can be used again. According to the Navy, the direct vendor delivery concept will motivate the contractor to increase the reliability of the component so it needs to be repaired less frequently, which may reduce the component\u2019s life-cycle costs.", "The direct vendor delivery concept is in the early stages of development. As of January 1998, the Navy had placed only 3 subsystems, consisting of 96 components, under contract. The value of these three contracts represent about 1 percent of the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 1998 purchase and repair budget.

The Air Force expects to save $948 million in supply costs between fiscal years 1997 and 1999 as a result of Lean Logistics initiatives.", "Under Lean Logistics, the Air Force developed a program to redesign the current repair pipeline. In June 1996, the Air Force began testing certain concepts at 10 repair shops, and the tests involve less than 1 percent of the Air Force\u2019s inventory items. The concepts include repairing items quickly after they break, using premium transportation to rapidly move parts, organizing support (supply and repair) personnel into teams, and deploying new information systems to better prioritize repair actions and track parts.

According to an October 1997 cost-benefit analysis of these projects, the tests were not a complete success. For example, 70 percent of the shops showed improvement in depot repair efficiency, but only 10 percent of the shops showed improvements in improving the responsiveness to the customer. Also, three of the four performance areas showed mixed results for 50 percent or more of the shops.

Our past work and this report have been concerned with efforts to improve the existing in-house repair pipeline through the use of proven best practices adopted in the private sector, especially for aircraft parts, once the decision has been made to keep the repair function at public facilities. This C-17 contract represents a different arrangement and we are not in a position to comment on the merits of that approach.", "With regard to the Matters for Congressional Consideration, our intent is to highlight two actions that we believe may be useful to Congress if it decides to expand section 395 to include reparable parts.

Since February 1996, we have issued three reports that compared commercial logistics practices with similar Army, Navy, and Air Force operations for reparable aircraft parts. In these reports, we highlighted four factors that contributed to the services\u2019 slow and inefficient repair pipelines. These factors are (1) broken reparable parts move slowly between field units and a repair depot, (2) reparable parts are stored in warehouses for several months before and after they are repaired, (3) work processes at repair depots are inefficiently organized, and (4) consumable parts are not frequently available to mechanics when needed. As a result, the services can spend several months or even years to repair and distribute repaired parts to the end user. The amount of time it takes to repair parts is important because DOD must invest in enough inventory to resupply units with serviceable parts during the time it takes to move and repair broken parts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army Logistics Pipeline", "paragraphs": ["In April 1997, we reported that the Army\u2019s current repair pipeline, characterized by a $2.6-billion investment in aviation parts, is slow and inefficient. To calculate the amount of time the Army system takes to repair and distribute parts using the current depot repair process, we judgmentally selected 24 types of Army aviation parts and computed the time the parts spent in four key segments of the repair process. The key segments were (1) preparing and shipping the parts from the bases to the depot, (2) storing the parts at the depot before induction into the repair shop, (3) repairing the parts, and (4) storing the parts at the depot before being shipped to a field unit. The parts we selected took an average of  525 days to complete the repair process. The fastest time the Army took to complete any of the four pipeline segments was less than 1 day, but the slowest times ranged from 887 to more than 1,000 days. Table I.1 details the fastest, slowest, and average times the Army needed to complete each of the four pipeline segments.", "A comparison of the Army\u2019s engineering estimate of the repair time that should be needed to complete repairs with the actual amount of time taken is a measure of repair process efficiency. Of the 525-day average pipeline time from our sample, the Army estimates that an average of  18 days should be needed to repair items. The remaining 507 days, or 97 percent of the total time, was spent transporting or storing parts or was due to unplanned repair delays.", "Another measure of repair process efficiency is a calculation of how often an organization uses its inventory, called the turnover rate. The higher the turnover rate, the more often a company is utilizing its inventory. At British Airways, the inventory turnover rate for reparable parts was  2.3 times each year. In comparison, we calculated that the Army\u2019s turnover rate for fiscal year 1995 repairs was 0.4 times, or about 6 times slower than British Airways."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Navy Logistics Pipeline", "paragraphs": ["In July 1996, we reported that the Navy\u2019s system, characterized by a $10 billion inventory of reparable parts, is slow and complex and often does not respond quickly to customer needs. For example, customers wait an average of 16 days at operating bases and 32 days on aircraft carriers to receive parts from the wholesale system. If the wholesale system does not have the item in stock, customers wait over 2-1/2 months. Many factors contribute to this situation, but among the most prominent is a slow and complex repair pipeline. Within this pipeline, broken parts can pass through as many as 16 steps, taking as long as 4 months, before they are repaired at a repair depot and are available again for use.", "Specific problems that prevent parts from flowing quickly through the pipeline include a lack of consumable parts needed to complete repairs, slow distribution, and inefficient repair practices. For example, the Navy\u2019s practice of routing parts through several workshops at repair depots increases the time needed to complete repairs. One item we examined had a repair time of 232 hours, only 20 hours of which was spent actually repairing the item. The remaining 212 hours, or 91 percent of the total time, was spent handling and moving the part to different locations.", "In contrast, leading firms in the airline industry, including British Airways, hold minimum levels of inventory that can turn over four times as often as the Navy\u2019s. Parts are more readily available and delivered to the customer within hours.

Of this amount, the Air Force estimated $20.4 billion, or 56 percent, was needed to support daily operations and war reserves, and the remaining $16.3 billion was divided among safety stock, other reserves, and excess inventory. These large inventory levels were driven in part by the slow logistics pipeline process. For example, one part we examined had an estimated repair cycle time of 117 days; it took British Airways only 12 days to repair a similar part. We reported that the complexity of the Air Force\u2019s repair and distribution process creates as many as 12 different stopping points and several layers of inventory as parts move through the process.
