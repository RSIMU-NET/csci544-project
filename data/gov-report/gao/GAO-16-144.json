In 2013, the President directed Education, DHS, HHS, and Justice to help schools with their plans. GAO was asked to report on these efforts.", "This report examines (1) how federal agencies support school emergency management planning and the extent to which they coordinate efforts; (2) the extent to which states require and support efforts to plan for school emergencies; and (3) what districts have done to plan and prepare for school emergencies and challenges faced. GAO interviewed federal officials and surveyed relevant state agencies in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.

Since jointly issuing a Guide for Developing High-Quality School Emergency Operations Plans in 2013 in response to a presidential plan, individual agencies have continued to work on a range of emergency preparedness initiatives, sometimes collaboratively; however, with the guide completed and no strategic coordination of agency efforts particular to schools, federal agencies have taken a piecemeal approach to their efforts. GAO found gaps in coordination that suggest recent efforts are insufficient: not all relevant agencies and officials are included in collaborative efforts or are aware of related efforts and resources, and agencies are offering different interpretations of the same federal guidance\u2014all of which risks wasting limited federal resources on duplicative, overlapping, or fragmented efforts. Education officials said that although agencies discussed the need to continue coordinating following the guide, the presidential plan did not designate a lead agency going forward, nor give any agency direct authority or responsibility over an interagency effort, or require agency participation. However, these officials said Education has general authority to collaborate with other federal agencies to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of its programs and to serve as the lead agency, where warranted and agreed upon. Leading practices on federal interagency collaboration include identifying leadership, relevant participants, and resources, and agreeing on outcomes. Absent a well-coordinated effort, agencies will continue to determine their priorities individually, which may hinder assistance to schools.", "In GAO's survey of 51 state educational agencies, 32 states reported that they require districts to have emergency operations plans, 34 reported they require schools to have plans, and almost all states reported providing training, technical assistance, or guidance to support districts in developing or implementing plans. GAO's survey also found that 32 states reported requiring districts to conduct emergency exercises, such as drills, and 40 states reported requiring individual schools to do so. In addition, many states reported allowing districts and schools to determine specific plan content, with fewer than half reporting that they required districts or states to review district or school plans.", "GAO's generalizable survey of school districts estimates that most districts updated and practiced their emergency operations plans with first responders, but struggled to balance emergency planning with other priorities. GAO's survey results also found that most districts had plans addressing multiple hazards and emergency procedures, such as evacuation. However, GAO estimates about half of districts included procedures on continuing operations or recovering after an incident. GAO also found most districts conducted emergency exercises, such as fire drills, and about half did so annually with police and fire department officials. However, an estimated 59 percent of districts had difficulty balancing emergency planning with higher priorities, such as classroom instruction time."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Education convene its federal interagency partners to develop a strategic approach to interagency collaboration on school emergency preparedness, consistent with leading practices.

It is important for school districts to be  prepared to confront a range of threats and hazards, from man-made to  natural. At the same time, many entities, including federal, state, and local  agencies, support school emergency management planning efforts  designed to prevent, respond to, and recover from an incident. We  previously reported on the status of school emergency preparedness in  2007 and found that while no federal laws required school districts to  have emergency operations plans in place, 32 states reported having  laws or other policies requiring them, and that an estimated 95 percent of  school districts nationwide had also developed emergency operations  plans.", "In 2013, the Departments of Education (Education), Health and Human  Services (HHS), Homeland Security (DHS), including the Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and Justice (Justice),including  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), jointly issued guidance for  schools to help them develop emergency operations plans in response to  a presidential call for action to increase school safety. Federal agencies  have also developed additional tools and administered new grant  programs aimed at helping schools prepare for emergencies. You asked  us to provide an update on the status of school emergency management  planning, given continued incidents that threaten the safety and security  of the nation\u2019s children while in school.", "This report examines (1) how federal agencies support school emergency  management planning and the extent to which they coordinate their  efforts, (2) the extent to which states require and support efforts to plan  for school emergencies, and (3) what school districts have done to plan  and prepare for emergencies and what challenges, if any, they have  faced.", "To answer these questions, we used a variety of methodologies. To  address objective 1, we conducted interviews with officials from  Education, DHS, HHS, and Justice and with staff at the Office of  Management and Budget; and reviewed relevant federal documents. We  also reviewed leading practices on interagency collaboration to assess  the collaborative efforts of these agencies. To address objective 2, we  administered two web-based surveys to all 50 states and the District of  Columbia: one to state educational agencies and another to state  administrative agencies. We administered these surveys from April  through July 2015, and all state agencies responded for 100 percent  response rates. To address objective 3, we administered a third web- based survey to a stratified random sample of 573 school districts\u2014the  results of which were nationally generalizable. We administered this  survey from April through July 2015, and 403 districts, or 70 percent of  the districts in our sample, responded to the survey. The district survey  estimates are subject to sampling error because they are based on a  random sample. All percentage estimates used in this report have 95  percent confidence intervals and margins of error of within +/-7  percentage points, unless otherwise noted. To address both objectives 2  and 3, we visited Massachusetts, Texas, and Washington, which we  selected because they represent geographic diversity and vary across  characteristics, such as type of federal funding received for emergency  preparedness as well as whether there was a state school safety center,  which provides training and guidance to enhance school safety and  security. Within these states, we interviewed state education officials as  well as officials from five school districts, selected to reflect a mix of  urban, suburban, and rural areas. In each district, we interviewed officials  from at least two schools of varying student ages. In one state, we also  interviewed officials from a charter school that received federal funding for  school emergency preparedness. Information obtained during these  interviews is not generalizable, but provides insight into school  emergency management planning at the state, district, and school level.", "For more detailed information on our scope and methodology, see  appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 to March 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The federal  government\u2019s role in school emergency management has been to support  state and local activities, by providing guidance, training, equipment, and  funding to help districts and schools respond to emergencies effectively.  DHS is responsible for most federal emergency management programs,  including some that allow funds to be used for school emergency  preparedness. In fiscal year 2015, DHS awarded $989 million to states,  urban areas, and territories to prepare for and respond to terrorist attacks  and other disasters.", "Since our 2007 report, the federal government has taken additional steps  to help districts and schools plan for and manage emergencies. In  March 2011, the White House issued Presidential Policy Directive 8,  aimed at strengthening the security and resilience of the United States  through systematic preparation for the threats that pose the greatest risk  to the country\u2019s security. It also directed DHS to develop, in coordination  with other federal agencies, a national preparedness goal that identifies  the core capabilities necessary for preparedness and a national  preparedness system to guide activities to achieve that goal.", "In response to the directive, DHS released in September 2011 the  National Preparedness Goal that identified capabilities to prevent, protect  against, mitigate, respond to, and recover from threats and hazards.  The Goal defined success around these five mission areas, which occur  before, during, or after an incident (see fig. 1). The Goal recognized that  preparedness is a shared responsibility of the whole community, which  FEMA, as a component of DHS, notes includes schools, among others.  As stated in the Goal, threats and hazards may include acts of terrorism,  cyberattacks, pandemics, and catastrophic natural disasters.", "In January 2013, following the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary  School, the White House developed a plan, Now is the Time, to protect  children and communities from gun violence which called, in part, for all  schools to have comprehensive emergency operations plans (see fig.  2). This plan also directed Education, DHS, HHS, and Justice to release  a set of model, high-quality emergency operations plans for schools by  May 2013."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Provide Resources to Support School Emergency Management Planning, but Some Resources Are Often Underutilized and Efforts Are Not Strategically Coordinated", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Agencies Provide Various Resources to Help Schools Prepare for Emergencies, but Most School Districts Reported Not Using Federal Guidance and Other Non- Financial Resources", "paragraphs": ["Education, DHS, HHS, and Justice each provide assistance to school  districts and schools with preparing for emergencies. In response to the  President\u2019s call for model, high-quality emergency operations plans for  schools, among other things, in his 2013 plan to reduce gun violence, the  federal agencies jointly developed a Guide for Developing High-Quality  School Emergency Operations Plans (Federal Guide)\u2014the primary  federal resource designed to help schools develop, implement, and revise  their emergency operations plans. The Federal Guide, which identifies  key planning principles for developing school emergency operations  plans, states that it is considered informal guidance and schools and  school districts are not required to adopt it. These principles include  considering all threats and hazards and all settings and times, and call for  following a collaborative process when creating and revising a plan.", "The Federal Guide suggests that schools use a six-step planning  process, similar to the process established by FEMA for state and local  emergency management planning, to develop, maintain, and revise their  emergency operations plans. According to Education officials, this  represents a shift in guidance from an emphasis on plan content to an  emphasis on the planning process (see fig. 3).", "Education, DHS, HHS, and Justice also separately develop and provide  resources such as guidance, training, technical assistance, and funding,  in line with their respective missions, to help districts and schools prepare  for emergencies. These include resources that directly support  emergency operations plan development as well as those that more  generally can be used to enhance districts\u2019 and schools\u2019 ability to prevent,  protect against, mitigate, respond to, or recover from threats and hazards  (see table 1).", "Despite the availability of resources from Education, DHS, HHS, and  Justice for school emergency preparedness, our nationally representative  survey of school districts found that an estimated 69 percent of districts  did not rely on non-financial resources from any of these agencies to  develop or implement their plans in recent years. Further, as shown in  figure 4, we estimate that about one-third of districts or fewer relied on  such resources from the agencies individually.", "Our survey of school districts and visits to districts and schools suggest  that limited awareness of federal non-financial resources and reliance on  local resources may be factors in districts\u2019 limited use of such federal  resources. For example, based on our survey, an estimated 37 percent of  districts are aware of the Federal Guide or related resources from the  REMS TA Center. Similarly, officials in 2 of the 12 schools we visited  were familiar with the Federal Guide, though it is targeted to schools. In  one school we visited, an official who was familiar with the Federal Guide  told us that it was not user-friendly given its length (e.g., 67 pages). In  addition, officials in two districts said they rely on their state for guidance,  rather than on the federal government directly, as, for example, some  federal standards and guidance may not be as tailored to them.  According to our survey of state educational agencies, 35 states,  representing a majority of school districts, provide the Federal Guide to  their districts to assist in developing or implementing emergency  operations plans. With this number of states doing so, it is unclear why  there is limited awareness of the Federal Guide by districts nationwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agency Collaboration to Support School Emergency Preparedness Is Ongoing, but Gaps Exist", "paragraphs": ["Education, DHS, HHS, and Justice collaborate on a number of individual  agency initiatives to support district and school efforts to prepare for  emergencies. According to federal officials, following the significant  interagency collaboration required to produce the Federal Guide in 2013,  as facilitated by the Office of the Vice President and National Security  Council, Education has continued to collaborate with the agencies to  develop resources to facilitate use of the Federal Guide, including by  leading development of a related guide for school districts. Education and  the agencies also developed resources that, though not necessarily  explicitly prepared as an emergency preparedness resource, can be used  to assist schools with other aspects of emergency preparedness,  including prevention. For example, Education and Justice jointly  developed a school discipline resource package designed, in part, to  assist schools in creating safer environments, which can be an important  step for prevention. Federal agency officials also told us they collaborate  through various groups that address, to varying degrees, certain needs of  schools and school children. For example, several agencies participate in  the Comprehensive School Safety Initiative interagency working group,  and a federal interagency policy sub-committee on active shooters,  though this entity is not specific to schools and does not address the full  range of threats and hazards schools face. Some agencies are also  involved with the National Advisory Council on Children and Disasters.  However, none of these entities primarily focus on the needs of schools  for emergency management planning, which, given the presence of  young children, can differ significantly from those of other institutions.  Federal officials told us the partnerships that resulted from the Federal  Guide have been valuable: one official said federal interagency  collaboration is the best she has experienced in her 18 years with her  agency.", "However, we identified gaps in recent federal agency coordination that  suggest these efforts are insufficient in fully addressing the needs of  schools. Insufficient coordination may compromise the ability of federal  agencies to effectively support district and school emergency  preparedness efforts, and risks hindering such planning to help protect  students and staff in emergencies. We found:", "Not all relevant federal agencies are included in collaboration  efforts. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials said the  agency is not involved in federal interagency collaboration on school  emergency management planning, including with the REMS TA  Center, despite TSA having developed multiple resources on school  transportation security, and knowing through its Baseline Assessment  for Security Enhancement program that security for school bus  transportation is often left out of district planning. Additionally, TSA  officials told us they were also not involved in developing the Federal  Guide because they were unaware of the effort\u2014even though DHS, of  which TSA is a part, was one of the agencies involved in developing  the Federal Guide. Due to their lack of involvement in federal  interagency efforts for school emergency management planning, other  federal agencies may be unaware of TSA resources and unable to  share TSA information with local stakeholders. Recognizing the  importance of addressing transportation in school emergency  management planning, the Federal Guide makes multiple references  to it. Moreover, the REMS TA Center has elaborated on the  importance of addressing transportation in planning, stating in  informal guidance that effective emergency operations plans must  include procedures for students and staff to follow during non- instructional times, including time when students are on a school bus.  Leading practices on interagency collaboration state that it is  important to ensure that all relevant participants have been included in  the collaborative effort.", "Relevant agency officials are not always aware of each other\u2019s  efforts and resources, including within their own agency.  Education and FEMA officials said they collaborate on various school  emergency management planning initiatives. For example, Education  officials said that FEMA was among its federal partners involved in  developing a REMS TA Center tool designed to help districts and  schools create and customize emergency operations plans, and the  head of FEMA\u2019s Emergency Management Institute (EMI) told us that  staff provide such tools to their training participants. However, EMI  officials we spoke with who are responsible for training courses for  district and school staff on developing emergency operations plans  said they were unfamiliar with these tools, raising concerns about  communication and coordination within the agency. In another case, a  FEMA official responsible for the Office of Counterterrorism and  Security Preparedness, to whom we were referred by FEMA officials  we interviewed about issues of coordination with DHS, said his office  was not involved in the development of related guidance from DHS\u2019  Office of Infrastructure Protection issued in April 2013 on developing a  comprehensive K-12 school security program, which discusses how to  develop an emergency operations plan. Further, the official  indicated that he was unaware of the DHS guidance until its release.", "As a result, officials from DHS and FEMA were simultaneously  involved in developing multiple resources for K-12 schools\u2014including  the Federal Guide, issued in June 2013\u2014to prepare for emergencies  without sufficiently coordinating these efforts. In reviewing the DHS  guidance, we also found it makes no specific mention or reference to  FEMA\u2019s six-step planning process\u2014the process on which the Federal  Guide is based\u2014though it includes a number of the same steps. Gaps  in effective coordination and communication within and across  agencies raise questions about the efficient use of resources, and the  extent to which these related resources may be overlapping,  duplicative, or fragmented. Officials from Education and FEMA told us  greater collaboration is needed and welcome, particularly in light of  limited resources. Leading practices state that the challenges posed  by continuing federal budget constraints call for agencies to work  together more closely to leverage limited resources to achieve their  missions.", "Agencies that collaborate offer different interpretations of the  same federal guidance. Education and the FBI were partners,  among others, in producing the Federal Guide; but, since its  completion, these agencies now publicly offer different positions on  the Federal Guide\u2019s Run, Hide, Fight model. This model describes\u2014in  order of preference\u2014the steps adults should take when confronted by  an active shooter (see sidebar). Specifically, an Education official said  in producing the Federal Guide the federal agencies agreed to  exclude students from involvement in the option of fighting an active  shooter and instead included language that focused solely on  adults. In contrast, an FBI official stated that the Federal Guide is  designed to allow each community to determine whether to discuss  with high school students the option of fighting, and set its own  standards on how to discuss the Run, Hide, Fight model with school- age children\u2014views which have been reported publicly. The FBI  official also said the goal of the Federal Guide is not to develop a one- size-fits-all plan, but rather, to have district officials, principals,  teachers, parents, and local first responders decide what is best for  their community. The FBI official stated that, though student  involvement in the option of fighting is not included in the Federal  Guide, the FBI does not take a position on whether or not school  districts should teach children to consider the option of fighting. In  addition, the official told us the FBI\u2019s position aligns with Federal  Guide and noted that adults should consider the option to fight and be  trained accordingly. Given that the Federal Guide explicitly refers only  to adults when discussing the fight portion of Run, Hide, Fight,  conflicting views from federal agencies may create confusion for  districts and schools in interpreting this aspect of the federal  recommendations. Leading practices on interagency collaboration  state that it is important to address the differences created by diverse  organizational cultures to enable a cohesive working relationship and  create the mutual trust required to enhance and sustain a  collaborative effort. Education and FBI officials told us they meet  regularly with other federal partners through a federal interagency  policy sub-committee on active shooters, facilitated by White House  staff; however, their collaboration through this mechanism\u2014which is  not exclusively focused on school emergencies\u2014has not yielded a  consistent federal message to the public about whether and how  students should be involved in Run, Hide, Fight.", "In the absence of a well-coordinated strategy for school emergency  management planning efforts, federal agencies have taken a piecemeal  approach to these efforts, which contributes to the gaps we have  identified. Education officials said that, especially since the issuance of  the Federal Guide, federal agencies currently face challenges around  coordination, resulting in efforts that have developed organically and  incidentally and without a strategic focus. Specifically, with their limited  resources, agencies determine their priorities and initiatives\u2014and the  resources devoted to them\u2014on an individual agency basis; meanwhile,  the emergency management and safety needs of schools are numerous  and complex. Acknowledging the value of interagency collaborative  efforts, these Education officials also said that such efforts help avoid  duplicative and inconsistent efforts across agencies. While officials from  FEMA and Justice did not identify specific challenges with federal agency  coordination in this area, these agencies focus more generally on  emergency planning and not specifically on the needs of school districts  and school emergency management planning\u2014the area in which  Education identified issues.", "As efforts to develop the Federal Guide came to a close, Education  officials told us that the agencies discussed the need to continue to  coordinate federal school emergency preparedness efforts moving  forward. According to these officials, the presidential plan that required  development of the Federal Guide did not designate a lead agency going  forward or give any agency direct authority or responsibility to convene an  interagency working group or require the participation of other federal  agencies. However, they said that the Department of Education  Organization Act provides the agency the general authority to collaborate  with other federal agencies to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness  of its programs and, where warranted and agreed upon, to serve as the  lead agency in such collaborations. Importantly, Education officials also  stressed that the ability to successfully carry out such activities relies to a  large degree on other federal agencies\u2019 cooperation as well. Staff from  the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\u2014the agency responsible  for, among other things, communicating the President\u2019s directions to  Executive Branch officials regarding specific government-wide actions\u2014 told us that while they may become involved in federal interagency efforts  absent clear leadership, federal efforts around school emergency  preparedness are best handled by agencies and monitored by OMB  through, for example, review of administration policy.", "The absence of an interagency body to coordinate related federal efforts  may hinder the ability of federal agencies to successfully address the  complex emergency management needs of schools. Leading practices  such as (1) identifying leadership for collaborative efforts; (2) defining and  agreeing to common outcomes, and assigning accountability for these  collaborative efforts; (3) identifying all relevant participants; and (4)  identifying necessary resources have been shown to improve the  likelihood of success for federal interagency efforts. Further, the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), as updated  by the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, establishes a framework for a  crosscutting and integrated approach by agencies to focus on results and  improve government performance. This framework includes identifying  how an agency is working with other agencies to achieve its performance  goals, in that well-coordinated strategies can reduce potentially  duplicative, overlapping, and fragmented efforts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most States Reported Requiring Emergency Operations Plans and Exercises, and Providing Training or Other Support", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most States Reported Requiring District or School Emergency Operations Plans, and Many Also Allowed Districts and Schools to Determine Plan Specifics", "paragraphs": ["According to our survey of state educational agencies in the 50 states  and the District of Columbia, 32 states reported requiring that districts  have emergency operations plans and 34 states reported requiring that  schools have plans, and 25 states reported requiring plans for both (see  fig. 5).

Separately, our district  survey shows that an estimated 69 percent of districts nationwide  reported having procedures in their district or school plans that support  the access and needs of the whole school community, including these  individuals. For example, in one of the elementary schools we visited, the  school calls for a \u201cbuddy system\u201d to help each special needs student  evacuate during an emergency. The school\u2019s plan also notes that special  equipment, such as lights or horns, might be required to alert students  with certain sensory disabilities during emergencies. In a similar trend,  according to our state survey, fewer than 10 states reported requiring  either districts or schools to address the needs of individuals with limited  English proficiency. Our district survey shows that an estimated 45  percent of districts had procedures in their district or school plans for  communicating with parents or students who are limited English  proficient.", "Another example of an area where states allowed districts and schools to  determine the content of their plans is threats or hazards.

The Federal Guide also notes that such collaboration makes  more resources available and helps ensure the seamless integration of all  responders. Relatedly, we found that an estimated 68 percent of districts  incorporated their district plans into the broader community\u2019s emergency  management system. For example, officials from one district we visited  said their school district is a part of the city\u2019s emergency operations plan  and has responsibility for providing shelter during emergencies.", "As part of developing and updating an emergency operations plan, the  Federal Guide recommends that districts and schools assess the risks  posed to them by specific threats and hazards. Based on our survey data,  we estimate that more than three-quarters of districts recently conducted  such assessments of their vulnerabilities (see fig. 9).", "For example, officials from one district told us that they conduct an annual  safety assessment of each school. In doing so, they assess physical and  access control, such as fences and locks. Officials from another district  said assessments led to security enhancements, such as adding fences  to sports fields, panic buttons that connect office staff to emergency  officials, and software to run instant background checks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Districts Reported Having Emergency Operations Plans That Address Threats and Hazards, While Half Did Not Include Certain Recovery Procedures", "paragraphs": ["Our district survey found that most school districts had emergency  operations plans that address multiple threats and hazards, such as  intruders, fires, active shooters, natural disasters, and bomb threats (see  fig. 10). We also observed during visits to schools that a school\u2019s  particular circumstances, such as location, affect the threats and hazards  they face. For example, officials from one school said their plan includes  not only common threats and hazards, such as fires, but also those  associated with facilities nearby, including an airport and chemical plant.", "According to our survey, districts generally had plans that address most  of the emergency response procedures recommended in the Federal  Guide, such as evacuation and shelter-in-place (see fig. 11). For  example, we estimate that almost all districts had procedures in place for  evacuation, lockdown, and communication and warning. To illustrate,  officials from five schools we visited said they use an automated  messaging system to notify parents of an emergency.", "In contrast, our district survey estimates that about half of districts  specified how they would maintain continuous operations or recover after  an incident. For example, officials we interviewed from one school said  that while their plan does not comprehensively address how they would  maintain continuous operations after an incident, it does specify some  aspects: if the school needed to close for an extended period, lessons  could continue via a web portal. It is not readily apparent why fewer  districts included these types of procedures in their plans. Education\u2019s  REMS TA Center offers several resources on these topics such as an  online course for developing continuity of operations procedures, among  others.", "The Federal Guide recommends that emergency operations plans  provide for the access and functional needs of the whole school  community, including persons with disabilities and people with limited  English proficiency, among others. As previously noted, our district survey  found that an estimated 69 percent of districts had plans with procedures  supporting persons with disabilities. An additional 22 percent of districts  also had such procedures outside of their plans. We also learned about  such procedures in some of the schools we visited. For example, officials  from one school said that they used specially colored markers on the  walls to guide a visually impaired student toward the exit. Officials from  another school told us that during fire drills students who are highly  reactive to loud noises such as a fire alarm are proactively given noise- reducing headphones. As noted earlier, our district survey estimated that  45 percent of districts had plans that address procedures for  communicating with students or parents who are limited English  proficient. An additional 26 percent of districts also reported having such  procedures outside of their plans. Our visits to schools revealed specific  examples. Officials from one school said teachers of students with limited  English proficiency walk through each step of a drill to ensure these  students understand. Regarding communication with parents who are  limited English proficient, officials from one school said they have a  contract with a language translation service to connect a school  administrator, translator, and parent via conference call, when necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Districts Conducted Emergency Exercises and Many Did So Regularly with First Responders", "paragraphs": ["Our survey estimated that most school districts recently completed a  variety of emergency exercises, such as drills and group discussions, and  many did so regularly with first responders (see fig. 12). According to the  survey, almost all districts conducted drills. Officials from four schools we  visited said they explain drill procedures to students in an age-appropriate  way, a practice recommended by the Federal Guide. For example,  officials at one school we visited said that during a lockdown drill  kindergarten teachers tell their students that a wild animal may be loose  in the building.", "In contrast, our survey estimated that fewer districts completed functional  and full-scale exercises, which require a significant amount of planning,  time, and resources. For example, officials from one school district told us  they participated in a city-wide functional exercise that involved various  community partners, such as the public health department. They said the  8-hour session helped participants better understand their roles during an  emergency, for example, the responsibilities of school principals.", "Districts that conducted drills, functional exercises, or full-scale exercises  did so for specific threats or for certain procedures. For example, our  survey found that almost all performed such exercises for fires and  lockdowns (see fig. 13). This aligns with our state survey findings that  many states reported requiring districts or schools to conduct such  exercises.", "Our survey also found that fewer districts\u2014an estimated 67 percent\u2014 conducted active shooter exercises. In the districts we visited, we heard  about some reasons for this. Officials from two districts said these  exercises can create anxiety within the school community, including  among parents. Officials from one of these districts noted the difficulty of  striking a balance between providing knowledge and inciting fear,  particularly at schools with younger children.", "Based on our survey, we estimated that about half of districts practiced  their emergency exercises annually with law enforcement and fire  department officials (see fig. 14). Similar to the benefits cited in  developing plans with community involvement, officials from two schools  we visited told us that firefighters and police officers observe and provide  feedback on their drills. Officials from one school cited the advantages of  such interactions as strengthening community relationships as well as  providing first responders with helpful information in advance of an  emergency, such as a school\u2019s layout. However, our survey estimated  that about a quarter of districts reported having never practiced with  emergency medical services or emergency management officials, and  about a third never practiced with public health officials.", "Following such exercises, the Federal Guide recommends that officials  gather to evaluate how the process went, identify shortfalls, and  document lessons learned. We found examples of this at the schools we  visited. For example, officials from 7 of the 12 schools we visited said that  they debrief after drills to determine what lessons could be learned.  During our interviews with schools, we learned of such improvements. For  example, officials at one school realized teachers could not lock their  classroom doors without stepping into the hallway, potentially placing  them in harm\u2019s way. Officials remedied the problem by placing a magnet  over the door\u2019s locking mechanism which can be quickly removed to lock  the door in an emergency.

Relatedly, it also  estimated that more than half of districts felt that they did not conduct  enough training because of limited time. Our visits to states and schools  revealed similar challenges. Officials from one state told us that district  and school staff had inadequate time for emergency management  planning. Similarly, officials from 6 of the 12 schools we visited reported  difficulty finding sufficient time to plan for emergencies, train staff, or  conduct drills, with several noting that such activities competed with other  school priorities. Officials from one school suggested additional  professional staff days were needed, but said that negotiating such days  can be difficult.", "According to our survey, an estimated 49 percent of districts cited a lack  of staff expertise and an estimated 42 percent of districts reported  insufficient equipment as impediments to emergency management  planning. For example, officials from one state we visited said that  teachers are not trained in emergency management, such as on how to  conduct table top exercises. In addition, officials from several districts and  schools said obstacles to emergency preparedness can include schools\u2019  physical aspects. For example, officials from one district said that schools  with portable classrooms cannot use their intercom system to announce  emergency drills, but rather must connect to those classrooms using a  phone line.", "Further, officials from two of the three states we visited and from  Education said districts and schools have limited resources for  emergency management planning. As mentioned previously, our state  survey found that few states reported providing funding to help districts  develop or implement their plans. Federal Education officials echoed a  similar opinion stating that in an environment of constrained resources,  districts and schools tend to focus almost exclusively on response  activities, as opposed to the other four preparedness areas (prevention,  protection, mitigation, and recovery). They suggested that this could have  serious implications for schools and districts.

Education and  other federal agencies individually offer a breadth of resources that  districts and schools can use in their emergency planning. Although  individual agencies continue to work on a range of emergency  preparedness issues, and, in some cases, have continued to collaborate  with other agencies in doing so, current collaboration efforts are  insufficient to comprehensively address the complex and unique needs of  schools. For example, an existing federal interagency group on active  shooters was not created to address the range of threats and hazards  schools face, nor to be specific to schools\u2019 needs, which, given the  presence of young children, can differ significantly from those of other  institutions. Moreover, in the absence of a well-coordinated federal  strategy for school emergency preparedness planning, federal agencies\u2019  piecemeal approaches to school emergency management planning  contribute to the gaps we identified in timely, continued, and most  importantly, strategic coordination, and risk wasting limited federal  resources on efforts that may be overlapping, duplicative, or fragmented.", "To help protect students entrusted to public schools from natural and  man-made threats and hazards, it remains critical for federal agencies to  address key considerations shown to improve the likelihood of success  for interagency collaboration on a well-coordinated federal strategy.
