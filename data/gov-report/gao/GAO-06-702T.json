In academic year 1994-1995, about 519,000 students (32 percent) obtained STEM degrees. About 578,000 students obtained STEM degrees in academic year 2003-2004, accounting for 27 percent of degrees awarded. Despite increases in enrollment and degree attainment by women and minorities at the graduate level, the number of graduate degrees conferred fell in several STEM-related fields from academic year 1994-1995 to academic year 2003-2004. College and university officials and students most often cited subpar teacher quality and poor high school preparation as factors that discouraged the pursuit of STEM degrees. Suggestions to encourage more enrollment in STEM fields include increased outreach and mentoring. The past decade has seen an increase in STEM employees, particularly in mathematics and computer science. From 1994 to 2003, employment in STEM fields increased by an estimated 23 percent, compared to 17 percent in non-STEM fields. Mathematics and computer science showed the highest increase in STEM-related employment, and employment in science-related fields increased as well. However, in certain STEM fields, including engineering, the number of employees did not increase significantly. Further, while the estimated number of women, African-Americans, and Hispanic-Americans employed in STEM fields increased, women and minorities remained underrepresented relative to their numbers in the civilian labor force. The number of foreign workers employed in the United States has fluctuated, experiencing declines in 2002 and 2003. Key factors affecting STEM employment decisions include mentoring for women and minorities and opportunities abroad for foreign employees. Thirteen federal civilian agencies spent approximately $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2004 to fund over 200 programs designed to increase the numbers of students in STEM fields and employees in STEM occupations and to improve related educational programs. The funding reported for individual STEM education programs varied significantly, and programs most commonly provided financial support to students or infrastructure support to institutions. However, only half of these programs had been evaluated or had evaluations underway, and coordination among STEM education programs was limited. It is important to know the extent to which existing STEM education programs target the right people and the right areas and make the best use of available resources. Since our report was issued in October 2005, Congress, in addition to establishing new grants to encourage students from low-income families to enroll in STEM fields, established an Academic Competitiveness Council to identify, evaluate, coordinate, and improve federal STEM programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss U.S. trends in the fields of  science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in relation to  the changing domestic and global economies. The health of the U.S.  economy is directly tied to our science and technology industries, and the  United States is a world leader in scientific and technological innovation.  Since 1995, for example, the United States has generated the largest share  of high-technology manufacturing output of any country in the world.  Concerns have been raised, however, about the nation\u2019s ability to maintain  its technological competitive advantage, especially in light of other  nations\u2019 investments in their own research infrastructures, the aging and  changing U.S. workforce, and the fiscal challenges facing the nation. From  1990 to 2003, research and development expenditures outside the United  States have more than doubled, from about $225 billion to over $500  billion. According to the Census Bureau, the median age of the U.S.  population in 2004 was the highest it had ever been, and the growth of the  labor force is expected to slow considerably, becoming negligible by 2050.  Further, as the United States becomes a more diverse society, minorities,  in addition to women, will continue to represent a continuously increasing  share of the workforce, yet women and minorities have tended to be  underrepresented in STEM education programs and career fields. These  factors, concurrent with the nation\u2019s large and growing long-term fiscal  imbalance, present significant and difficult challenges for policymakers as  they tackle how best to ensure that our nation can continue to compete in  the global marketplace.", "My testimony today will focus on three key issues: (1) trends in degree  attainment in STEM- and non-STEM-related fields and factors that may  influence these trends, (2) trends in the levels of employment in STEM-  and non-STEM-related fields and factors that may influence these trends,  and (3) federal education programs intended to support the study of and  employment in STEM-related fields. My comments are based on the  findings from our October 2005 report, Higher Education: Federal  Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Programs and  Related Trends. Those findings were based on our review and analysis of  data from a variety of sources. For that report we (1) analyzed survey  responses from 13 federal departments and agencies with STEM education  programs; (2) analyzed data on students and graduates from the  Department of Education\u2019s (Education) National Center for Education  Statistics (NCES) and on employees from the Department of Labor\u2019s  (Labor) Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS); (3) interviewed educators and  administrators at eight colleges and universities, federal agency officials,  and representatives from associations and education organizations;  (4) conducted interviews via e-mail with 31 students from five universities  we visited; and (5) reviewed reports on various topics related to STEM  education and occupations. For this testimony, we provide updated  information concerning the number of graduates in STEM and non-STEM  fields as well as congressional legislation related to STEM education  programs. Our work was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, our findings are as follows:   While postsecondary enrollment has increased over the past decade, the  proportion of students obtaining degrees in STEM fields has fallen. In  academic year 1994\u20131995, about 519,000 students obtained STEM degrees,  about 32 percent of all degrees awarded. More students\u2014approximately  578,000\u2014obtained STEM degrees in academic year 2003\u20132004, but such  degrees accounted for only 27 percent of those awarded. While the  number of degrees obtained in some STEM fields increased, the number of  degrees obtained in engineering, biological science, and certain technical  fields declined. Further, despite increases in the overall enrollment and  degree attainment by women and minorities at the graduate level, the  number of graduate degrees conferred fell in several STEM-related fields  from academic year 1994\u20131995 to academic year 2003\u20132004. College and  university officials and students cited subpar teacher quality at the high  school and college levels, poor high school preparation, more rigorous and  expensive degree requirements for STEM majors, and lower pay of STEM  occupations relative to such fields as law and business as factors that  discouraged students from pursuing degrees in STEM fields. Suggestions  to encourage more enrollment in STEM fields include increased outreach  at the kindergarten through 12th grade level, increased mentoring, and a  greater federal presence.", "Coinciding with the spread of the Internet and the personal computer,  the past decade has seen an increase in the overall number of STEM  employees, particularly in mathematics and computer science. From 1994  to 2003, overall employment in STEM fields increased by an estimated 23  percent, compared to an estimated 17 percent increase in non-STEM  fields. Mathematics and computer science showed the highest increase in  STEM-related employment\u2014estimated at 78 percent\u2014while employment  in science-related fields increased an estimated 20 percent. However, in  certain STEM fields, including engineering, the number of employees did  not increase significantly over the 1994\u20132003 period. Further, while the  estimated number of women employed in STEM fields increased, there  was not a significant change in the percentage they comprised. While the  number of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans employed in STEM  fields increased from 1994 to 2003, minorities remained underrepresented  relative to their numbers in the civilian labor force. Although foreign  workers have filled more than 100,000 positions annually, many in STEM  fields, through the H\u20131B visa program, employment levels declined in 2002  and 2003 after several years of increases.  Key factors affecting STEM  employment decisions include mentoring for women and minorities and  opportunities abroad for foreign employees.", "The federal government spent approximately $2.8 billion in fiscal year  2004 to fund over 200 programs designed to increase the numbers of  students in STEM fields and employees in STEM occupations and to  improve related educational programs. Thirteen federal civilian agencies  operated these programs, and most programs provided either financial  support to individuals, particularly to students and scholars, or equipment,  building, and other infrastructure support to institutions. The funding  reported for individual STEM education programs varied significantly,  from $4,000 for a U.S. Department of Agriculture-sponsored program to  $547 million for a National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant program.  However, only half of these programs had been evaluated or had  evaluations underway, and coordination among STEM education programs  was limited. As we note in our 2005 report, it is important to know the  extent to which existing STEM education programs target the right people  and the right areas and make the best use of available resources before  expanding federal support.", "Since our report was issued in October 2005, several initiatives to improve  federal support have taken place. For example, Congress established  National Science and Mathematics Access to Retain Talent (SMART)  Grants to encourage students from low-income families to enroll in STEM  fields and foreign languages critical to the national security of the United  States. In addition, Congress established an Academic Competitiveness  Council, chaired by the Secretary of Education, to identify, evaluate,  coordinate, and improve federal STEM programs. Further, according to  Education, the department plans to determine which federal programs  work best for students and how to use taxpayers\u2019 dollars more efficiently,  as well has how to align programs with the accountability principles of the  No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 (NCLBA)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["STEM fields include a wide range of disciplines and occupations, including  agriculture, physics, psychology, medical technology, and automotive  engineering. Many of these fields require completion of advanced courses  in mathematics or science, subjects that are first introduced and  developed at the kindergarten through 12th grade level. The federal  government, universities and colleges, and other entities have taken steps  to help improve achievement in these and other subjects through such  actions as enforcement of NCLBA, which addresses both student and  teacher performance at the elementary and secondary school levels, and  implementation of programs to increase the numbers of women,  minorities, and students with disadvantaged backgrounds in the STEM  fields at postsecondary school levels and later in employment.", "The participation of domestic students in STEM fields\u2014and in higher  education more generally\u2014is affected both by the economy and by  demographic changes in the U.S. population. Enrollment in higher  education has declined with upturns in the economy because of the  increased opportunity costs of going to school when relatively high wages  are available. The choice between academic programs is also affected by  the wages expected to be earned after obtaining a degree. Demographic  trends affect STEM fields because different races and ethnicities have had  different enrollment rates, and their representation in the population is  changing. In particular, STEM fields have had a relatively high proportion  of white or Asian males, but the proportion of other minorities enrolled in  the nation\u2019s public schools, particularly Hispanics, has almost doubled  since 1972. Furthermore, as of 2002, American Indians, Asians, African- Americans, Hispanics, and Pacific Islanders constituted 29 percent of all  college students.", "Students and employees from foreign countries have pursued STEM  degrees and worked in STEM occupations in the United States as well. To  do so, these students and employees must obtain education or  employment visas. Visas may not be issued to students for a number of  reasons, including concerns that the visa applicant may engage in the  illegal transfer of sensitive technology. Many foreign workers enter the  United States annually through the H\u20131B visa program, which assists U.S.  employers in temporarily filling specialty occupations. Employed workers  may stay in the United States on an H\u20131B visa for up to 6 years, and the  current cap on the number of H\u20131B visas that can be granted is 65,000. The  law exempts certain workers from this cap, including those in specified  positions or holding a master\u2019s degree or higher from a U.S. institution.", "The federal government also plays a role in helping coordinate federal  science and technology initiatives. The National Science and Technology  Council (NSTC) was established in 1993 and is the principal means for the  Administration to coordinate science and technology policies.

For example, university officials said that, because many students  had not taken higher-level mathematics and science courses such as  calculus and physics in high school, they were immediately behind other  students. A study of several hundred students who had left the STEM  fields reported that about 40 percent of those college students who left the  science fields reported some problems related to high school science  preparation.", "Several other factors were cited by university officials, students, and  others as influencing decisions about participation in STEM fields. These  factors included the relatively low pay in STEM occupations, additional  tuition costs to obtain STEM degrees, and the availability of mentoring,  especially for women and minorities, in the STEM fields. For example,  officials from five universities told us that low pay in STEM occupations  relative to other fields such as law and business dissuaded students from  pursuing STEM degrees. Also, in a study that solicited the views of college  students who left the STEM fields as well as those who continued to  pursue STEM degrees, researchers found that students experienced  greater financial difficulties in obtaining their degrees because of the extra  time needed to obtain degrees in certain STEM fields.", "University officials, students, and other organizations suggested a number  of steps that could be taken to encourage more participation in the STEM  fields. University officials and students suggested more outreach,  especially to women and minorities from kindergarten through the 12th  grade. One organization, Building Engineering and Science Talent (BEST),  suggested that research universities increase their presence in pre- kindergarten through 12th grade mathematics and science education in  order to strengthen domestic students\u2019 interests and abilities. In addition,  the Council of Graduate Schools called for a renewed commitment to  graduate education by the federal government through actions such as  providing funds to support students trained at the doctoral level in the  STEM fields and expanding participation in doctoral study in selected  fields through graduate support awarded competitively to universities  across the country.

Moreover, although international graduate applications  increased in academic year 2005\u20132006 for the first time in 3 years, it is too  early to tell if this marks the end of declines in international graduate  student enrollment. In terms of employment, despite some gains, the  percentage of women in the STEM workforce has not changed  significantly, minority employees remain underrepresented relative to  their employment in the civilian labor force, and many graduates with  degrees in STEM fields are not employed in STEM occupations. Women  now outnumber men in college enrollment, and minority students are  enrolling in record high levels at the postsecondary level as well. To the  extent that these populations have been historically underrepresented in  STEM fields, they provide a yet untapped source of STEM participation in  the future.", "To help improve the trends in the numbers of graduates and employees in  STEM fields, university officials and others made several suggestions, such  as increasing the federal commitment to STEM education programs.  However, before expanding the number of federal programs, it is  important to know the extent to which existing STEM education programs  are appropriately targeted and making the best use of available federal  resources\u2014in other words, these programs must be evaluated\u2014and a  comprehensive evaluation of federal programs is currently nonexistent.  Furthermore, the recent initiatives to improve federal coordination, such  as the American Competitiveness Council, serve as an initial step in  reducing unnecessary overlap between programs, not an ending point. In  an era of limited financial resources and growing federal deficits,  information about the effectiveness of these programs can help guide  policymakers and program managers in coordinating and improving  existing programs as well as determining areas in which new programs are  needed.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
