The Coast Guard awarded the Deepwater contract to Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS) in June 2002. The Coast Guard estimates the program will cost $17 billion over a 30-year period. ICGS is a system integrator, with responsibility for identifying and delivering an integrated system of assets to meet the Coast Guard's missions. GAO was asked to assess whether the Coast Guard is effectively managing the Deepwater program and overseeing the contractor and to assess the implications of using the Deepwater contracting model on opportunities for competition."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over a year and a half into the Deepwater contract, the key components needed to manage the program and oversee the system integrator's performance have not been effectively implemented. Integrated product teams, the Coast Guard's primary tool for overseeing the system integrator, have struggled to effectively collaborate and accomplish their missions. They have been hampered by changing membership, understaffing, insufficient training, and inadequate communication among members. In addition, the Coast Guard has not adequately addressed the frequent turnover of personnel in the program and the transition from existing to Deepwater assets. The Coast Guard's assessment of the system integrator's performance in the first year of the contract lacked rigor. For example, comments from the technical specialist responsible for monitoring the design and delivery of ships were not included in the evaluation scores. Further, the factors that formed the basis for the award fee determination were unsupported by quantifiable metrics. Despite documented problems in schedule, performance, cost control, and contract administration, ICGS received a rating of 87 percent, resulting in an award fee of $4.0 million of the maximum $4.6 million annual award fee. Further, the Coast Guard has not yet begun to measure the system integrator's performance on the three overarching goals of the Deepwater program--operational effectiveness, total ownership cost, and customer satisfaction. Its original plan of measuring progress on an annual basis has slipped, and Coast Guard officials have not projected a time frame for when they will be able to hold the contractor accountable for progress against these goals. This information will be essential to the Coast Guard's decision about whether to extend ICGS's contract after the first 5 years. Competition is critical to controlling costs in the Deepwater program and a guiding principle of Department of Homeland Security acquisitions. Concerns about the Coast Guard's ability to rely on competition as a means to control future costs contributed to GAO's description of the Deepwater program in 2001 as \"risky.\" Three years later, the Coast Guard has neither measured the extent of competition among suppliers of Deepwater assets nor held the system integrator accountable for taking steps to achieve competition. Deepwater's acquisition structure is such that the two first-tier subcontractors have sole responsibility for determining whether to hold competitions for assets or to provide these assets themselves. The Coast Guard has taken a hands-off approach to \"make or buy\" decisions made at the subcontractor level. As a result, questions remain about whether the government will be able to control costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard is undergoing a major transformation through its  Deepwater program, the largest acquisition project in its history. The  program involves modernizing or replacing cutters, aircraft, and  communications equipment used for missions that generally occur beyond  50 miles from shore. These missions include drug interdiction, alien  migrant interdiction, search and rescue, overseas port security and  defense, and offshore inspection of foreign vessels bound for U.S. ports.  The three goals of the Deepwater program are to maximize operational  effectiveness, minimize total ownership cost (TOC), and satisfy the  customer. On March 1, 2003, the Coast Guard became part of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Deepwater program,  estimated to cost $17 billion over a 30-year period, is one of the largest  acquisitions in the department.", "In June 2002, the Coast Guard awarded a contract to Integrated Coast  Guard Systems, LLC (ICGS) as the system integrator for Deepwater to  develop and deliver an improved, integrated system of ships, aircraft,  unmanned aerial vehicles, command, control, communications, computer,  intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and supporting  logistics. The contract has a 5-year base period with five additional 5-year  options. ICGS is a business entity jointly owned by Northrop Grumman  Ship Systems (Northrop Grumman) and Lockheed Martin Corporation  (Lockheed Martin).

In 2001, we described the  Deepwater project as \u201crisky,\u201d due to the unique, untried acquisition  strategy for a project of this magnitude within the Coast Guard. We  highlighted concerns about the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to ensure that  procedures and personnel would be in place to manage and oversee the  system integrator and raised concerns about the agency\u2019s ability to keep  costs under control in future program years by ensuring adequate  competition for Deepwater assets. Now that the Deepwater program is  underway, you asked us to assess whether the Coast Guard is effectively  managing the acquisition program and overseeing the contractor and to  assess the implications of using the Deepwater contracting model on  opportunities for competition.  Specifically, we assessed whether the  Coast Guard (1) has a structure in place to effectively manage the program  and oversee the system integrator, (2) has established adequate criteria by  which to assess and reward the system integrator\u2019s performance, (3) has  the information needed to make a decision about extending the contract  after the first 5 years, and (4) is addressing the role and extent of  competition for Deepwater assets."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Deepwater is the largest and most complex procurement project in the  Coast Guard\u2019s history.

It includes the modernization and  replacement of an aging fleet of over 90 cutters and 200 aircraft used for  missions that generally occur beyond 50 miles from shore. Deepwater  currently accounts for almost one-third of the Coast Guard\u2019s acquisition  staff and one-third of support personnel funding.", "Rather than using the traditional approach of replacing classes of ships or  aircraft through a series of individual acquisitions, the Coast Guard chose  to employ a \u201csystem-of-systems\u201d acquisition strategy that would replace its  aging deepwater assets with a single, integrated package of new or  modernized assets. The primary objectives of the Deepwater program are  to maximize operational effectiveness and to minimize TOC while  satisfying the needs of the customer\u2014the operational commanders,  aircraft pilots, cutter crews, maintenance personnel, and others who will  use the assets.", "The Deepwater program has been in development for a number of years.  Between 1998 and 2001, three industry teams competed to identify and  provide the assets\u2014aircraft, helicopters, cutters, logistics, and   C4ISR\u2014needed to transform the Coast Guard. In June 2002, the Coast  Guard awarded a contract to ICGS as the system integrator for Deepwater.  Under a 5-year base contract with five additional 5-year options, ICGS is  responsible for designing, constructing, deploying, supporting, and  integrating the Deepwater assets to meet Coast Guard requirements. ICGS,  a business entity comprised of a nine-member Board of Directors, is jointly  owned by Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. Northrop Grumman  and Lockheed Martin are the two first-tier subcontractors for the  Deepwater program. They, in turn, provide Deepwater assets themselves  or award second-tier subcontracts for the assets.", "In our 2001 report, we identified several areas of risk for Deepwater. First,  the Coast Guard faced potential risk in the overall management and day- to-day administration of the contract. We reported on the major challenges  in developing and implementing plans for establishing effective human  capital practices, having key management and oversight processes and  procedures in place, and tracking data to measure system integrator  performance. In addition, we, as well as the Office of Management and  Budget, expressed concerns about the potential lack of competition during  the program\u2019s later years and the reliance on a single system integrator for  procuring the Deepwater equipment. We also reported there was little  evidence that the Coast Guard had analyzed whether the approach carried  any inherent risks for ensuring the best value to the government and, if so,  what to do about them.", "Since fiscal year 2002, Congress has appropriated almost $1.5 billion for  the Deepwater program (see table 1), and as of September 2003, the Coast  Guard had obligated $596 million to ICGS and $120.4 million for  government program management, legacy asset sustainment, and facilities  design work.", "In response to congressional direction to assess the feasibility of  accelerating the Deepwater program, the Coast Guard reported in March  2003 that it could accelerate the implementation schedule from 20 years to  10 years and that this acceleration would provide increased operational  capability sooner to support maritime homeland security.", "On March 1, 2003, the Coast Guard became part of DHS. A December 22,  2003, acquisition decision memorandum from the DHS Investment Review  Board\u2019s (the Board) acting chairperson to the Coast Guard Commandant  stated that the Deepwater program has been designated as a level 1  investment, meaning that it will be reviewed at the highest levels within  the department. Further, because Deepwater interoperability within DHS  and with the Department of Defense will be a major program challenge,  the DHS Joint Requirements Council will be kept informed of Deepwater  developments. While decisions as to specific assets or capabilities have  been deferred to the Coast Guard acquisition executive, the Board will  meet to discuss actual or projected changes to the program that affect  cost, schedule, or performance. Noting that the Coast Guard has proposed  accelerating the Deepwater program in fiscal year 2005, the Board directed  the Coast Guard to ensure that risk management planning receives  appropriate attention, that TOC is kept current, and that cost, schedule,  and performance are monitored by measuring actual data against the  baseline and projections to completion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Components of Management and Oversight Have Not Been Effectively Implemented", "paragraphs": ["Complex, performance-based contracts such as Deepwater require  effective government oversight to ensure that the intended results are  achieved and that taxpayer dollars are not wasted. Both Coast Guard and  ICGS officials have acknowledged that an unusually large degree of  collaboration and partnership between the government and the system  integrator must be in place for the Deepwater acquisition to be successful.  However, a year and a half into the program, the key management and  oversight components needed to make the program effective have not  been effectively implemented. Integrated product teams (IPT) are the  Coast Guard\u2019s primary tool for managing the program and overseeing the  contractor, but these teams have struggled to collaborate effectively and  accomplish their missions. While the Coast Guard has a Deepwater human  capital plan in place to guide strategic planning for turnover among  Deepwater personnel, the plan is not being followed and vacancies exist in  key positions. Further, while it is still early in the program, the transition  from existing Coast Guard assets to the new Deepwater assets has not  been effectively communicated, a particular concern in light of schedule  delays for some of the first assets to be delivered. Finally, a number of  plans integral to the organization and management of the Deepwater  program were finalized much later than anticipated. Appendix II contains  additional information on these plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IPTs Have Had Difficulty Fulfilling Their Critical Management Function", "paragraphs": ["IPTs are the Coast Guard\u2019s primary tool for managing the Deepwater  program and overseeing the system integrator. More than 30 of these  teams, comprised of Coast Guard, ICGS, and subcontractor employees  from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, are responsible for overall  program planning and management, asset integration, and overseeing the  delivery of specific Deepwater assets. However, the teams have struggled  to effectively carry out their missions. Our prior work at the Department  of Defense has shown that effective IPTs have (1) expertise to master  different facets of product development, (2) responsibility for day-to-day  decisions and product delivery, (3) key members who are either physically  collocated or connected through virtual means to facilitate team cohesion  and the ability to share information, and (4) control over their  membership, with membership changes driven by each team\u2019s need for  different knowledge.", "The Deepwater program manager reported IPT performance shortcomings  as an issue in 14 of the 16 monthly program assessment reports provided  to us. The following comments, made in Deepwater management reports  by Coast Guard officials involved on a number of different IPTs, convey  the difficulties faced by the teams in the first year and a half of the  program. Though the comments in table 2 are not exhaustive, they  demonstrate that the Deepwater IPTs have not been effective.", "Based on our review of program reports, we identified four major issues  that have impeded the effective performance of the IPTs.", "Lack of timely charters to vest IPTs with authority for decision  making. Authority for day-to-day decisions\u2014required for program  success in meeting cost, schedule, and performance objectives\u2014is  vested in IPTs through charters; yet charters for most of the Deepwater  IPTs were not developed in a timely manner. In fact, 27 of the 31 IPT  charters were not approved until after the first year of the contract.  More than merely a paperwork exercise, sound IPT charters are critical  because they detail each team\u2019s purpose, membership, performance  goals, authority, responsibility, accountability, and relationships with  other groups, resources, and schedules. Between June 2002 and June  2003, 20 delivery task orders, authorized for issuance by the  contracting officer, were executed by IPTs that did not have charters in  place. Similarly, we found that some sub-IPTs, which address specific  issues at a subasset or component level, were operating on an ad hoc  basis without charters. For example, a November 2002 management  report states that sub-IPTs addressed numerous issues concerning  requirements for the national security cutter, even though their  charters were not approved until a year later. In addition, two other  sub-IPTs were not chartered.", "Inadequate communication among members. The Coast Guard\u2019s  Deepwater program management plan has identified collocation of IPT  members as a key program success factor, along with effective  communications within and among teams. Face-to-face informal  communication enhances information flow, cohesion, and  understanding of other members\u2019 roles\u2014all of which help foster team  unity and performance. Yet only 3 of the 31 operating IPTs are entirely  collocated, meaning that every IPT member is in the same building. The  IPTs responsible for assets frequently have members in multiple  locations. For example, the logistics process and policy development  IPT has members in 6 different locations. As noted in table 2, Coast  Guard IPT members have raised geographic separation as an issue of  concern. ICGS developed a Web-based system for government and  contractor employees to regularly access and update technical  information, training materials, and other program information, in part  to mitigate the challenges of having team members in multiple  locations. However, Coast Guard documents indicate that the system is  not being updated or used effectively by IPTs. In fact, the Deepwater  program executive officer reported that, while the system has great  potential, it is a long way from becoming the virtual enterprise and  collaborative environment required by the contractor\u2019s statement of  work.", "High turnover of IPT membership and understaffing. Most of the  Deepwater IPTs have experienced membership turnover and staffing  difficulties, resulting in a loss of team knowledge, overbooked  schedules, and crisis management. In a few instances, such as the  national security cutter and maritime patrol aircraft, even the IPT  leadership has changed. Also, key system integrator officials serving on  the management IPTs have left the company. Both the Chief Financial  Officer and the President of ICGS left their positions during the latter  half of 2003, and an additional six of the nine ICGS Board members  have changed. In addition, Coast Guard and system integrator  representatives have also been staffed on multiple IPTs, and, in many  cases meetings were attended by fewer than 50 percent of IPT  members. A December 2002 Coast Guard document summarizing  various programmatic recommendations cited a contractor study that  recommended individuals be assigned to IPTs on a full-time basis and  that they not serve on more than two teams. However, as of December  2003, 15 individuals were serving on three or more IPTs.", "Insufficient training. The system integrator has had difficulty  training IPT members in time to ensure that they could effectively carry  out their duties, and program officials have referred to IPT training as  deficient. IPT charters state that members must complete initial  training before beginning team deliberations regarding execution of  new contracts for Deepwater assets. IPT training is to address, among  other issues, developing team goals and objectives, key processes, use  of the Web-based system, and team rules of behavior. According to a  Coast Guard evaluation report, IPT training was implemented late,  which has contributed to a lack of effective collaboration among team  members.", "The Coast Guard hired a consultant to survey IPT members concerning  teams\u2019 performance from July 2002 to September 2003. Three surveys  consisted of questions about mission, team member cooperation,  performance, communication, and integrated product and process  development. The final report on the survey results highlighted the need  for improved communications both within and among teams. Respondents  were also concerned that workloads were too high."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Capital Issues Pose a Challenge", "paragraphs": ["In our 2001 report, we noted that as the Deepwater program got off the  ground, tough human capital challenges would need to be addressed. A  critical challenge we raised was the need to recruit and train enough staff  to manage and oversee the contract. To date, the Coast Guard has not  funded the number of staff requested by the Deepwater program and has  not adhered to the processes outlined in its human capital plan for  addressing turnover of Deepwater officials. These staffing shortfalls have  contributed to the problems IPT members have identified\u2014such as the  struggle to keep pace with the workload and the difficulties in making  decisions due to inconsistent attendance at IPT meetings.", "Although the Deepwater program has identified the need for a total of 264  staff in fiscal year 2004, only 224 positions have been funded, and only 209  have been assigned to the program. The Coast Guard\u2019s fiscal year 2004  funding for personnel was increased to $70 million; however, the Coast  Guard did not request sufficient funds to fill the 40 positions that the  Deepwater program identified as necessary. According to Coast Guard  officials, $70 million is insufficient to fund their fiscal year 2004 personnel  plan because they need $67 million of this amount just to fund current  personnel levels. The assistant commandant has imposed a temporary  hiring freeze and plans to monitor expenditures throughout the year to  identify any available funding for additional positions. Although we asked,  Coast Guard officials did not explain why they did not request sufficient  funds to adequately staff the program.", "In addition, the Coast Guard has not adequately addressed the imminent  departure of Coast Guard officials from the Deepwater program. Coast  Guard officials will leave each year due to the normal rotational cycle of  military members (every 3 to 4 years) and retirements. The Deepwater  human capital plan sets a goal of a 95 percent or higher \u201cfill rate\u201d annually  for both military and civilian positions and proposes using a \u201cfloating\u201d  training position that can be filled by replacement personnel reporting for  duty a year before the departure of the military incumbents. This position  is meant to ensure that incoming personnel receive acquisition training  and on-the-job training with experienced Deepwater personnel. However,  the 2004 request for this training position was not funded, nor was funding  provided for additional new positions identified as critical. In December  2003, the Director of Resources and Metrics and the Chief Contracting  Officer left the Deepwater program, and the program manager is slated to  leave in March 2004. In addition, by July 1, 2004, five key Coast Guard  officials who oversee the work of the asset IPTs are scheduled to leave.

Operating units will receive  additional ships, aircraft, or C4ISR every year thereafter until the  Deepwater program ends. However, the Coast Guard has not  communicated decisions on how the new and old assets are to be  integrated during the transition and whether Coast Guard or contractor  personnel\u2014or both\u2014will be responsible for maintenance. Coast Guard  field personnel, including senior-level operators and naval engineering  support command officials, told us that they have not received information  about how they will be able to continue meeting their missions using  current assets while being trained on the new assets. They are also unclear  as to whether the system integrator or Coast Guard personnel will be  responsible for maintenance of the new assets. For example, although  Deepwater officials have stated that maintenance on the new assets will  be a joint responsibility, naval engineering support command staff had  received no instruction on how this joint responsibility is to be carried out.  Coast Guard officials told us that guidance on joint maintenance  responsibility has not been completely disseminated throughout the Coast  Guard, but said that ICGS has recently added representatives at the key  maintenance and logistics sites to coordinate maintenance issues.", "One of the first Deepwater assets to be delivered is the 123-foot cutter. The  Coast Guard is modifying its 110-foot cutter by adding 13 feet of deck and  hull, a stern ramp, a superstructure, and communication equipment. The  123-foot cutter is an example of the transition challenges facing the Coast  Guard. First, there is confusion over which of the cutters will be modified  and when. The contract with ICGS calls for all 49 cutters to be modified;  however, Deepwater officials are considering curtailing the modification  efforts and accelerating the development of the fast response cutter  instead. (The fast response cutter was originally planned to be delivered in  2018 as a replacement for the 123-foot cutter). In addition, the Coast Guard  identified 22 of the 110-foot cutters that, due to unexpectedly severe hull  corrosion, required additional inspection and repair separate from the  Deepwater modification plans. To date, $14.7 million in non-Deepwater  funds has been made available to repair 8 of these cutters. Further, Coast  Guard officials note that there are 4 cutters in operation in the Persian  Gulf, which makes them unavailable for modification at this time.  System  integrator and Coast Guard officials expressed confusion about the status  of the cutter modifications, hull repair program, and fast response cutter  schedule. For example, ICGS officials indicated that they did not know  what the Coast Guard plans for the 123-foot cutter modification. The Coast  Guard is considering several options and has not made a final decision on  the cutter modification effort.", "Transitioning the staffing and operations of current Coast Guard assets to  Deepwater assets may be further complicated by schedule delays. Reliable  information on the delivery of Deepwater assets is important to the  planning and budgeting efforts of Coast Guard operators and maintenance  personnel to ensure that current missions are met and existing assets are  maintained. Delivery of the first 123-foot cutter and short range prosecutor  is scheduled for March 2004, slipping from the original delivery date of  November 2003, and the rescheduled date of December 2003. This delay is  affecting the schedules for the remaining cutters under contract, according  to the most recent program manager assessment. Program management  reports also indicate that schedule milestones have slipped for the  maritime patrol aircraft.  The first two aircraft are currently scheduled to  be delivered to operating divisions in late 2006 or early 2007, compared  with the original plan of 2005.

While  the Coast Guard has begun to develop models to measure the extent to  which Deepwater is achieving increased operational effectiveness and  reduced TOC, a decision has not yet been made as to which specific suite  of models will be used.  The former Deepwater chief contracting officer  told us he anticipates that the metrics will be in place in year 4 of the  contract, the same year the decision needs to be made to extend the  contract. Other officials acknowledged that it is difficult to hold the  contractor accountable for progress toward the goals this early in the  program, but could not offer a projection as to when the operational  effectiveness and TOC results would be forthcoming.", "Coast Guard officials noted the large degree of complexity involved in  attempting to measure the system integrator\u2019s progress toward the  Deepwater goals. In previous work, we found that assessing improvements  in operational effectiveness and TOC may be difficult because  performance data may reflect factors that did not result from the  contractor\u2019s actions. Because the Deepwater program includes legacy  assets, modified assets, and new assets, the line of accountability between  the government and the system integrator is blurred. It is not always clear  who is responsible between Coast Guard and ICGS for the change in  performance or costs of Deepwater assets. Measuring the 123-foot cutter\u2019s  performance, for example, is complicated by the fact that ICGS is  responsible for the new 13 feet of deck and hull and other modifications,  while the engine and the other 110 feet of the deck and hull are the Coast  Guard\u2019s responsibility.", "Coast Guard officials said that they are measuring \u201coperational  performance,\u201d such as the number of search and rescue, drug interdiction,  and migrant interdiction missions carried out by the current assets.  However, they could not explain how these measures will be used to  assess ICGS\u2019s progress toward improving operational effectiveness with  Deepwater assets. The officials stated that the models they are using to  measure operational performance for the various Coast Guard missions  lack the fidelity to capture whether improvements may be due to Coast  Guard or contractor actions, the capability of specific Deepwater assets,  or even outside factors such as improved intelligence on drug smugglers.  Program officials noted that it is difficult to hold the contractor  accountable for operational effectiveness at this point, before Deepwater  assets are delivered.", "Establishing a solid baseline against which to measure progress in  lowering TOC is critical to holding the contractor accountable. However,  the Coast Guard is using as the baseline ICGS\u2019s own projected cost of  $70.97 billion plus 10 percent (in fiscal year 2002 dollars).  Therefore, the  government will not have the TOC information it needs to make a contract  extension decision. Measurement of ICGS\u2019s cost as compared to its own  cost proposal will tell the Coast Guard nothing about the efficiencies it  may be getting using the Deepwater performance-based approach.  Further, the baseline the Coast Guard is using has been significantly  changed from that originally envisioned. The Deepwater program  management plan, approved in December 2003, states that the estimated  cost to replace individual Coast Guard assets under a traditional approach,  (i.e., without the ICGS Deepwater \u201csystem of systems\u201d solution), is to be  the \u201cupper limit for TOC\u201d that the contractor should not exceed. The  officials could not explain why the program management plan, which sets  forth the overall framework for managing Deepwater, contains a different  TOC baseline than the one they are using.", "Further, changes in such variables as fuel costs or cutters\u2019 operating  tempo could result in additional changes being made to the TOC baseline.  Coast Guard officials explained that proposed changes to the baseline  would be approved by the program executive officer on a case-by-case  basis. However, the Coast Guard has not developed criteria for potential  upward or downward adjustments to the baseline.", "The Coast Guard has only recently begun to address the contractor\u2019s  progress in meeting the third overall goal of Deepwater, customer  satisfaction. A January 9, 2004, report indicates that the Coast Guard had  not yet identified the metrics needed to measure this goal. As a start, on  January 12, 2004, a survey was sent to 25 senior leaders and program  managers.", "The Coast Guard decided to use the system integrator approach 6 years  ago. In our previous work, we found that given the Coast Guard\u2019s reliance  on a single system integrator for the Deepwater program, the agency  would be at serious risk if it decides not to extend the contract.  Because  ICGS proposed the specific assets that became the Deepwater solution, a  decision not to extend the current contract would require a new  Deepwater acquisition strategy to be developed. Exit strategies and other  means to deal with potential poor performance by the system integrator  are important to mitigate these program risks. However, the Coast Guard  is just beginning an internal review of the system integrator\u2019s plan to  transition out of the program in the event such action would be necessary.  Further, Deepwater program officials indicated that it is not realistic to  believe the Coast Guard would switch system integrators at this point in  the program.

Over 40 percent of the funds obligated to Lockheed Martin and Northrop  Grumman have either remained with those companies or been awarded to  their subsidiaries.

In October 2003,  ICGS issued a policy statement on the open business model. The stated  business approach of the guidance is to encourage second-tier suppliers to  remain innovative and competitive by directing Lockheed Martin and  Northrop Grumman, as the first-tier subcontractors, to (1) generally avoid  the use of teaming agreements with suppliers and prohibit teaming  agreements based on guaranteed work share, (2) defer second-tier  supplier decisions as long as practicable so that changes in the  marketplace can be considered, and (3) actively solicit market information  and new suppliers. However, this guidance is a philosophy\u2014not a formal  process involving specific decision points\u2014that does not ensure that  competition will be considered. The December 2003 Deepwater  performance measurement plan requests that the contractor prepare self- assessments of its efforts to promote competition.

We found that, in some cases, teaming agreements were  implemented in the proposal phase of Deepwater and were carried over  when ICGS won the contract. In other cases, some degree of competition  had occurred.", "In December 1998, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Ingalls Shipbuilding,  Inc., and Halter-Bollinger Joint Venture, L.L.C entered into a teaming  agreement that included the 123-foot cutter modification. The  agreement was established to make the capabilities of both Halter and  Bollinger available to Lockheed Martin for all phases of the Deepwater  program. Despite the open business model\u2019s prohibition of work share  agreements, such an agreement is in place between Lockheed Martin  and Halter-Bollinger. Halter-Bollinger will be responsible for the design  and construction of all vessels equal to or less than 200 feet in overall  length, with the exception of the national security cutter.

In October 2000, Lockheed  Martin signed a memorandum of understanding with CASA Aircraft  USA, Inc. to provide an airframe for Deepwater and to help develop  and market ICGS\u2019s Deepwater proposal. After some Coast Guard  officials expressed concern about the aircraft model that had been  selected for Deepwater, ICGS was awarded a task order to pay for an  evaluation of alternative aircraft.

Such a  strategy carries inherent risks that must be mitigated by effective  government oversight of the contractor. The Coast Guard faces a tough  challenge in holding ICGS accountable for results, while facing the  daunting prospect of starting over with a new approach should the  contractor fail. Nevertheless, the integrity of the contractor oversight  process must be enforced through such mechanisms as effective IPTs and  a rigorous and transparent award fee determination process.", "Further, the Coast Guard must determine how to hold the contractor  accountable for achieving the basic goals of the Deepwater program in  order to position itself to make a contract extension decision. While there  is no question that the success of Deepwater depends on an effective  partnership between the government and the contractor, the Coast Guard  must preserve its ability to change course if necessary. Solid baselines  need to be developed so actual costs and operational effectiveness of the  Deepwater assets can be accurately measured and reported. The current  use of the contractor\u2019s proposed costs, plus 10 percent, as the TOC  baseline\u2014rather than the estimated cost to replace the assets via a  traditional procurement approach\u2014is troublesome. Further, because the  program management plan does not reflect the change to the TOC  baseline, we question whether this decision was well thought-out and in  the government\u2019s best interest.", "In addition to contractor oversight, the Coast Guard has not invested the  resources needed to ensure that its own personnel are trained and staffed  in sufficient numbers to carry out their duties. The disconnect between the  process outlined in the human capital plan for ensuring a smooth  transition as military personnel rotate out of Deepwater and the current  situation\u2014where key Deepwater officials are leaving the program without  a chance to adequately train their replacements\u2014is cause for concern as  the Deepwater program moves forward. It is unclear why the Coast Guard  has not devoted adequate attention to human capital needs. In addition,  although the first Deepwater assets are just starting to be delivered, the  lack of a solid and well-developed transition plan from legacy to  Deepwater assets is already causing problems, as evidenced by the 123- foot cutter modification difficulties. The schedule delays for several of the  assets further highlight the need for more focus on the transition to  Deepwater assets.", "The concerns we raised in 2001 about the Coast Guard\u2019s ability to control  costs in future years remain valid today. Without a mechanism to hold the  system integrator accountable for ensuring adequate competition, the  Coast Guard cannot be sure that competition will be used to guard against  cost increases that could jeopardize the program.
