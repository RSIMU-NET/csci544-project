Two agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) oversee organ transplant programs: the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) oversees transplant programs that receive Medicare reimbursement, and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) oversees the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN), which manages the nation's organ allocation system. GAO was asked to examine (1) federal oversight of transplant programs at the time the high-profile cases came to light in 2005 and 2006 and (2) changes that federal agencies have made or planned since then to strengthen oversight. GAO interviewed CMS, HRSA, and OPTN officials and reviewed agency documents and data and a CMS draft proposal for sharing information with HRSA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Limitations in federal oversight of organ transplant programs existed when high-profile problems came to light in 2005 and 2006. These high-profile cases included, for example, a transplant program that lacked a full-time surgeon for over a year and had been turning down organs offered for patients at markedly high rates. At that time, CMS did not actively monitor heart, liver, lung, and intestine transplant programs, relying instead primarily on complaints to detect problems. CMS periodically monitored kidney transplant programs through on-site inspections, known as surveys, but the surveys reviewed compliance with requirements that had not been substantially updated in decades and were limited in scope. In addition, some programs were not actively monitored. At the same time, the OPTN actively monitored transplant programs for many types of potential problems and worked with the programs to resolve identified problems. The OPTN's monitoring activities, however, were not sufficient to promptly detect certain problems that prolonged the time that patients waited for transplants, such as inadequate staffing at transplant programs. CMS, HRSA, and the OPTN have made or plan to make changes to strengthen their oversight of organ transplant programs, but the effectiveness of these changes will depend, in part, on implementation and information sharing by CMS, HRSA, and the OPTN. In 2006, after high-profile problems came to light, CMS began actively monitoring heart, liver, lung, and intestine transplant programs. In a more fundamental change, CMS published new regulations in 2007 that establish a single set of updated requirements for all Medicare-approved transplant programs and provide for periodic reviews of programs. The OPTN has been working with HRSA to develop and implement a set of indicators to better detect problems that prolong the time patients wait for transplants. However, neither CMS nor the OPTN has fully implemented these changes, and their full effect remains to be seen. In particular, CMS has not determined the extent to which it will conduct on-site surveys in its periodic reviews of programs for Medicare reapproval. Under the new regulations, CMS may choose not to conduct on-site reapproval surveys of programs meeting certain Medicare requirements. Not conducting these surveys may limit CMS's ability to monitor for compliance with other Medicare requirements and to detect problems like some of those involved in the high-profile cases. As of January 2008, CMS had not determined how it will choose which transplant programs to survey, if any, among those for which it has discretion. Further, while CMS, HRSA, and the OPTN recognize the value of sharing information about potential problems at transplant programs, how they will share additional information from their oversight activities has not been resolved. A definitive agreement between CMS and HRSA on this issue will better ensure that problems at transplant programs are detected and corrected in a timely manner."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Organ transplantation has become increasingly common, with over 28,000  organ transplants performed in the United States in 2007.

Despite increases in organ donations, the demand for organs  continues to exceed the available supply. Over 6,000 people die each year  in the United States while waiting for organ transplants. The scarcity of  organs relative to demand emphasizes the need to ensure both the  equitable allocation of organs and proper oversight of the organ  transplantation system, including the programs that perform organ  transplants.", "Two agencies within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  are involved in overseeing the organ transplantation system.

The OPTN\u2019s responsibilities include  maintaining a list of individuals waiting for transplants, operating a  computerized system for matching donated organs with individuals on the  waiting list, and developing policies for how organs are to be allocated.  The OPTN is administered by a nonprofit organization that has a contract  with HRSA. Historically, the OPTN\u2019s primary focus has been ensuring the  equitable allocation of donated organs, and its policies include detailed  allocation rules for matching donated organs with individuals on the  waiting list. Its policies also address other areas related to  transplantation, such as the training and experience of key transplant  personnel and performance standards for transplant programs related to  patient survival rates and transplant activity. More recently the OPTN\u2019s  activities expanded to include monitoring members\u2019 compliance with  federal regulations and OPTN policies. The OPTN monitors its members\u2019  compliance through various mechanisms, such as on-site reviews of  transplant programs and regular reviews of organ allocations, and is  responsible for reporting member noncompliance and any other issues  affecting patient health or public safety to HRSA.", "HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for  regulating transplant programs that receive reimbursement under the  Medicare program.

At the same time,  CMS\u2019s requirements address some areas in common with the OPTN, such  as minimum qualifications for some transplant program personnel and  patient survival rates.

Medical records were falsified to  conceal the switch, and the patient who had the highest priority for the  liver later died without a transplant.

We also reviewed case files from the OPTN detailing the  OPTN\u2019s review of and actions taken on compliance cases that occurred  from 2003 through 2006, including the three high-profile cases; the OPTN\u2019s  data on transplant programs that did not meet OPTN performance  standards for clinical outcomes or transplant activity from January 2003  through October 2006; the OPTN contract with HRSA; CMS data on  surveys of renal (kidney) transplant programs; CMS data on reviews of  extra-renal (heart, liver, lung, and intestine) transplant programs  conducted in 2006 and 2007; CMS complaint investigations of the three  high-profile cases; and a CMS draft proposal for sharing information with  HRSA. We examined the reliability of the data used in this report by  performing appropriate electronic data checks and checks for obvious  errors, such as missing data and data outside of expected ranges.

The OPTN emphasizes that its  confidential review process focuses on corrective action rather than  punishment and is aimed at continuous quality and performance  improvement. On its own, the OPTN can impose certain sanctions against  noncompliant transplant programs, such as issuing a letter of warning or  placing a program on probation.

The OPTN,  however, missed opportunities to link these separate sources of  information. For example, OPTN staff who handle patient transfers were  aware that an HMO was attempting to transfer hundreds of patients to its  new transplant program at an unprecedented rate and was experiencing  problems with the transfers. However, they did not alert other appropriate  OPTN staff to the possible need for a compliance review or to look into  the situation by, for example, reviewing available data that indicated far  lower-than-expected numbers of transplants at the new program.

Although the OPTN\u2019s goal was to  conduct routine on-site reviews of heart and liver programs once every   3 years, it had fallen behind this schedule. In December 2006, 50 percent of  continuously active heart and liver transplant programs had not been  reviewed on-site in the previous 3 years and 38 percent had not been  reviewed on-site in the previous 4 years. OPTN and HRSA officials  attribute the delay in routine on-site reviews to HRSA\u2019s directive to the  OPTN to study a new lung allocation policy.

According to CMS officials, the agency\u2019s initial monitoring  effort revealed that nearly all 242 Medicare-approved programs were  complying with NCD criteria for meeting minimum survival rates. A  number of programs, however, were not in compliance with the NCD  annual transplant volume criteria, which specify that programs must  conduct a minimum number of transplants each year. CMS continued to  monitor extra-renal transplant programs and ultimately found that a total  of 49 extra-renal transplant programs did not meet the NCD transplant  volume criteria in 2005, 2006, or both. As a result, CMS notified 11  programs that agency officials viewed as the most problematic that they  could lose Medicare approval for failure to comply with NCD criteria.  Ultimately, CMS withdrew Medicare approval from 1 of the 11 programs;  of the remaining 10 programs, 2 withdrew voluntarily and 8 programs were  implementing corrective action plans as of December 2007. (See table 2.)", "In March 2007, CMS made a more fundamental change to its oversight by  publishing final regulations establishing a new set of Medicare  requirements specifically for organ transplant programs. The regulations  include 13 core requirements known as Medicare conditions of  participation (CoP). Whereas renal and extra-renal transplant programs  were previously subject to different requirements and regulatory  procedures, the new regulations provide a single set of CoPs and review  procedures for all types of transplant programs. In addition, the new  regulations both update and expand upon previous requirements. For  example, the new CoPs incorporate an updated method for calculating  survival rates that reflects current best practices. The CoPs also include  entirely new requirements, such as those related to the protection of living  donors. (See app. I for more information about the 13 CoPs.)", "The new regulations also bring CMS requirements into substantial  alignment with OPTN policies. Specifically, 10 of the 13 CoPs pertain to  areas addressed in OPTN policies. In some instances, CMS incorporated  OPTN policies into its requirements such that these policies are now  enforceable under federal regulation for Medicare-approved transplant  programs. In some areas, the new regulations impose additional  requirements not covered by the OPTN. For example, while OPTN policies  require transplant programs to provide social support services, CMS\u2019s  regulations further require that social support services be furnished by a  qualified social worker, as defined by CMS. In other areas, the new CMS  requirements cover matters not addressed in existing OPTN policies. For  example, one CoP requires programs to implement formal quality  assessment and performance improvement programs\u2014a requirement not  paralleled in OPTN policies.

As part  of determining compliance with the CoPs, each transplant program that  applies for Medicare approval will undergo an on-site survey. Transplant  programs that are in compliance with all CoPs will be approved for  participation in Medicare for 3 years.

The set of indicators  includes two existing indicators already developed by the OPTN, one of  which, although available, was not previously reviewed by the MPSC, and  a new organ acceptance rate indicator. The new indicator, which is  intended to identify programs exhibiting lower-than-expected rates of  organ acceptance, is a key component of the set of activity-level indicators  and has been under development since January 2006.

According to CMS\u2019s new regulations, CMS may  choose not to conduct on-site reapproval surveys for transplant programs  meeting data submission, clinical experience, and outcomes requirements.  This means that CMS could potentially choose not to conduct any  reapproval surveys for programs meeting these requirements. While CMS  officials said that they see value in conducting reapproval surveys, just  how CMS will apply its discretion remains unclear. As of January 2008,  CMS officials said that the agency had not decided how many reapproval  surveys it would conduct or how it would choose which programs to  survey among those that meet the aforementioned requirements. They  emphasized the agency\u2019s need to carefully consider resource constraints in  making these decisions. A decision by CMS not to conduct an on-site  reapproval survey at a transplant program means that compliance with  some CoPs would not be reviewed unless there was a complaint  investigation. As a result, problems at transplant programs unrelated to the  data submission, clinical experience, and outcomes requirements\u2014for  example, a transplant program failing to provide required protections for  living donors or to sufficiently staff its program\u2014could go undetected. In  two of the high-profile cases, staffing problems that ultimately affected  patients\u2019 access to transplants would not have been detected by the  outcomes indicator that CMS has now adopted, and the numbers of  transplants performed per year at these programs exceeded or were close  to CMS\u2019s clinical experience requirement.", "Additional questions remain regarding the extent to which CMS will  accurately track on-site surveys to avoid the misclassification errors we  identified in our review and complete the surveys on a timely basis. As a  result of the new transplant regulations, renal transplant programs will no  longer share Medicare identification numbers with dialysis facilities, and  previously misclassified renal transplant programs will at some point  receive a new accurate classification in CMS\u2019s survey database once they  are approved. However, the potential for transplant programs to be  mistakenly classified may remain because transplant programs within the  same hospital will share one transplant center Medicare identification  number, according to CMS officials. CMS officials said that they were  highly aware of the need for their systems to accurately track the status of  each transplant program separately. They said that they plan to test for  this capability in their new tracking system for transplant programs, which  remains under development. What also remains to be seen is the extent to  which surveys will occur on a timely basis. Prior to the new regulations,  state agencies did not always meet CMS goals for surveying ESRD  facilities. Now, under the new regulations, the responsibilities of state  agencies that will be conducting on-site surveys of transplant programs  will increase, since they will be required to survey both renal and extra- renal transplant programs. With respect to initial approval surveys, CMS\u2019s  stated plan is that high-priority surveys of transplant programs will be  completed by the end of fiscal year 2008, but as of January 2008, CMS  officials expressed some uncertainty about meeting this goal. Initial  surveys of transplant programs have been given a relatively high priority in  the state agency workload, but it is not definite that this high priority level  will continue because CMS has revised state agency workload priorities in  the past. Further, the priority level for reapproval surveys is not yet  known; a lower priority could affect how frequently surveys occur.", "The last unresolved question concerns the OPTN\u2019s and HRSA\u2019s planned  organ acceptance rate indicator, which as part of a set of activity-level  indicators, could potentially improve the OPTN\u2019s ability to detect  transplant programs experiencing problems that prolong the time patients  wait for transplants. According to the OPTN, the organ acceptance rate  indicator for kidney and liver transplant programs has been developed but,  as of February 2008, has not yet been implemented; HRSA officials expect  the indicator to be in place within 1 year. HRSA and OPTN officials  reported that they are considering developing organ acceptance rate  indicators for transplant programs for other organ types. Before extending  the indicator to other types of programs, however, the OPTN will first  assess the effectiveness of the indicator at detecting potential problems at  kidney and liver transplant programs, which perform larger volumes of  transplants, and determine the feasibility of developing an indicator for  programs with lower transplant volumes, such as heart and lung transplant  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS, HRSA, and the OPTN Are Sharing Basic Data on Transplant Programs, but How They Will Share Additional Information from Their Oversight Activities Has Not Been Resolved", "paragraphs": ["CMS, HRSA, and the OPTN have recognized the importance of sharing  data on transplant programs with one another and have taken initial steps  to share basic data. To help CMS assess programs\u2019 compliance with its  new Medicare requirements, the OPTN (through HRSA) is now sending  CMS certain basic transplant program data on a quarterly basis. For  example, the new Medicare regulations require transplant centers to be  OPTN members, so the OPTN is providing data on the status of each  transplant center\u2019s membership in the OPTN. (See table 3.)", "While this basic data sharing represents progress, CMS, HRSA, and the  OPTN have additional information resulting from their oversight activities  that could be shared. The exchange of this information is important  because CMS and the OPTN conduct different monitoring activities and, as  a result, may have different information about transplant programs that  could be relevant to each other. For example, while both CMS and the  OPTN conduct on-site reviews of transplant programs, the OPTN\u2019s on-site  reviews focus largely on medical records review while CMS\u2019s on-site  surveys are more broadly scoped. If the OPTN determined during an on- site review that the medical urgency assigned to patients by a transplant  program was not supported by its medical records, this information could  be of interest to CMS if this practice inappropriately reduced the chances  of others on the waiting list to receive a transplant. As another example,  the OPTN and HRSA are working to put into place their organ acceptance  rate indicator, which CMS officials said they would be interested in using.  Information from CMS\u2019s and the OPTN\u2019s investigations could also be  potentially important to share. For example, if CMS investigated a  complaint from a patient about the length of time he or she had been  waiting for a transplant and determined that the delay was caused by the  program failing to update the patient\u2019s health status, a violation of OPTN  policy, the OPTN might want to flag the program for closer monitoring.", "CMS and HRSA have recognized the importance of sharing information  from their oversight activities, but the agencies have not yet reached  agreement on how they would do so. CMS submitted a draft proposal to  HRSA in April 2007 describing how CMS and HRSA could potentially share  information about organ transplant programs. CMS and HRSA officials  have since discussed the initial proposal, including possible revisions, but  their progress has been slow. As of February 2008, CMS and HRSA had yet  to reach agreement or establish a time frame for doing so. According to  HRSA officials it had taken the agencies several months to better  understand each other\u2019s oversight processes, and both agencies needed to  further explore their information needs. CMS officials also indicated that  further issues would need to be resolved before an agreement could be  reached.", "As part of any agreement to share information from their oversight  activities, CMS and HRSA will need to determine precisely what  information from their oversight activities they will share and at what  point in their oversight processes they will share it. CMS and HRSA have  discussed but not resolved these issues:    Nature of information to be shared. It will be important for CMS and  HRSA to determine specifically what information they will share from  their oversight activities. For example, while CMS\u2019s initial proposal  addressed how CMS and HRSA could share information from CMS\u2019s and  the OPTN\u2019s investigations of serious complaints, such as those involving  threats to patient health and safety, CMS and HRSA officials have since  discussed whether to share information from all complaints. In addition,  CMS and HRSA have not determined to what extent information from  routine inspections, such as the OPTN\u2019s on-site reviews and CMS\u2019s on-site  surveys, will be shared and at what level of detail. For example, CMS\u2019s  initial proposal called for CMS to notify the OPTN about its completed on- site surveys and to indicate whether the transplant program surveyed had  a plan of correction, but it did not call for CMS to provide information on  the deficiencies CMS found. HRSA officials have since expressed their  interest in having this more detailed information.", "Timing of information sharing. A more difficult challenge that CMS and  HRSA face is agreeing when to share information about potential  problems at transplant programs. Officials from both CMS and HRSA  consider the severity of the identified problem(s) with a program to be a  key factor in determining the appropriate time for information sharing. In  this regard, officials from both agencies stated a willingness to promptly  share information on potentially serious problems. Agreeing on just when  to exchange information on less serious problems has been more  problematic for the agencies in part because of differences in their  approaches to oversight. On the one hand, CMS officials emphasize their  agency\u2019s obligation to investigate any indications of noncompliance with  Medicare requirements and prefer to be notified as soon as possible if the  OPTN discovers a potential problem indicating noncompliance with  Medicare CoPs. On the other hand, HRSA officials have emphasized that  the viability and success of the OPTN\u2019s performance improvement process  depends upon transplant programs sharing openly about their practices or  past events. HRSA officials contend that the possibility of such  information being shared with CMS, a regulatory agency, could cause  transplant programs to be less candid about discussing real or potential  problems, making it more difficult for the OPTN to help them return to  compliance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CMS, HRSA, and the OPTN recognize the gaps in oversight that existed  when serious problems were exposed at transplant centers and have taken  significant steps to strengthen federal oversight. The actions they have  taken will help improve standards for transplant programs and should  improve detection of potential problems. These actions include CMS\u2019s  issuance of new regulations that expand and update requirements for  transplant programs. In addition, CMS plans to conduct on-site surveys of  all transplant programs seeking initial Medicare approval under the new  regulations and to regularly review certain transplant program data, which  should reduce the chances of problems going undetected by the agency.  Similarly, if the OPTN\u2019s and HRSA\u2019s efforts to develop and implement a set  of activity-level indicators to detect problems that prolong the time  patients wait for transplants are successful, the indicators will likely result  in earlier detection of these more subtle problems.", "The full effect of these planned improvements, however, is unknown at  this time, and much has yet to be accomplished. While surveyors have  begun conducting on-site surveys for initial Medicare approval, CMS  expects these surveys may take 3 years to complete. CMS is still in the  process of designing its tracking system for transplant programs, and it is  important that the system include mechanisms to check that transplant  programs remain accurately classified in the CMS survey database over  time. The OPTN and HRSA are working on implementing their set of  activity-level indicators for kidney and liver transplant programs. It will be  important for the OPTN and HRSA to implement the activity-level  indicators to the extent feasible to provide improved monitoring tools to  detect problems affecting patient access to transplants like those involved  in the high-profile cases in 2005 and 2006. Attending to these areas is  critical for effective oversight, and we encourage CMS, HRSA, and the  OPTN to continue their efforts to implement these initiatives.", "Of more concern are two other issues. The first is how CMS will ultimately  conduct on-site surveys for transplant programs seeking reapproval under  the new Medicare regulations. Under the regulations, CMS may choose not  to conduct such surveys for transplant programs meeting data submission,  clinical experience, and outcomes requirements. Not conducting on-site  reapproval surveys may limit CMS\u2019s ability to monitor these transplant  programs\u2019 compliance with other Medicare CoPs, for example, whether  transplant programs are providing required protections for living donors,  and to detect problems like those involved in some of the high-profile  cases. CMS has not yet developed a process to determine the scope of the  transplant programs (number or type) to be included in reapproval  surveys or the criteria for determining which, if any, transplant programs  that meet the three requirements will receive such surveys. Given the  potential importance of these reapproval surveys, we believe that having a  methodology that ensures that CMS conducts surveys of at least some  transplant programs meeting the three requirements is critical to maximize  CMS\u2019s opportunities to identify potential problems in a timely manner.", "We also have a concern about the pace of progress being made to share  information about the oversight activities of CMS, HRSA, and the OPTN.  Agency officials believe, as we do, that their ability to identify potential  problems could be enhanced by sharing information resulting from their  oversight activities. While CMS\u2019s draft proposal for sharing such  information is an important first step in reaching an agreement on this  issue, CMS and HRSA have yet to finalize an agreement or establish a time  frame for doing so. Without a definitive time frame for reaching  agreement, there is increased risk that the negotiation process among  these agencies could languish, and they could miss opportunities to detect  and remedy problems with transplant programs. Furthermore, in  developing an agreement, CMS and HRSA will need to fully articulate what  types of information will be shared from their oversight activities and  when they will share it. While we agree that there are challenges  associated with reaching agreement on this issue, we also believe it is  important to settle these issues and finalize a clear written agreement that  maximizes information sharing as appropriate and better ensures that all  parties are aware of critical information in time to take appropriate action.
