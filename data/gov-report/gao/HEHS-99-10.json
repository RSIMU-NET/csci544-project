Controversy about the extent to which the federal government should be involved in education policy led the Congress to amend the act in 1996 to reduce the requirements states would have to meet to receive access to Goals 2000 funding.", "In fiscal years 1994 through 1997, the Department of Education provided more than $1.25 billion in formula-based grants to states under title III of Goals 2000 for the purpose of systemic education reform. The program requires that 90 percent of the funds be awarded as competitive subgrants to local school districts. However, little comprehensive information has been developed to determine what activities these grants are funding at the state or local level. Therefore, you asked us to review the Goals 2000 program to determine (1) how its funds have been spent at both the state and local levels, including the levels of funding for developing standards and assessments as well as health education, and (2) how state and local officials view Goals 2000 as a means to promote education reform efforts.", "In conducting our work, we interviewed federal, state, and district officials, visited selected states, and reviewed relevant documents.

To obtain in-depth and specific information about how the program has been used to promote education reform, we made site visits to 10 states, where we interviewed state and district officials. We also obtained and reviewed various state and federal audit reports relevant to the examination of Goals 2000 expenditures and obtained financial data from states on the funds they elected to retain at the state level. We conducted our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards between November 1997 and October 1998.

Funds are provided through title III of the act and are to be used at the state and local levels to initiate, support, and sustain coordinated school reform activities. (See app. II for a listing of allocations.) States can retain up to 10 percent of the funds received each year, and the remainder is to be distributed to districts through a subgrant program. States have up to 27 months to obligate funds; after this time, unobligated funds must be returned to the federal government.", "Goals 2000 requires states to award subgrants competitively. To comply with this component of the law, states\u2019 subgrant programs require districts to compete directly against one another for funding or compete against a standard set of criteria established by the state to determine levels of funding for individual applicants. Some states weigh districts\u2019 subgrant proposals against one another and against standard criteria.", "Prior to the 1996 amendments, Goals 2000 was criticized as being too directive and intrusive in state and local education activities. The act initially required that states submit their education reform plans to the Secretary of Education for review and approval before they could become eligible for grants. The Omnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 amended the law by providing an alternative grant application process that did not include the Secretary of Education\u2019s approval of a state\u2019s education reform plan and eliminated some requirements for state reporting of information to the Department of Education. The amendment also allowed local districts in certain states to apply directly to the Department for Goals 2000 funds, even if their state did not participate at the state level.", "As a result of the 1996 changes, the Goals 2000 program is essentially a funding-stream grant program with fiscal objectives. These types of grants differ from performance-related grants, which have more immediate, concrete, and readily measurable objectives. Funding-stream grant programs often confine the federal role to providing funds and give broad discretion to the grantee. They are also the least likely of various grant types to have performance information. Goals 2000 does not have specific performance requirements and objectives, and the Department of Education has issued no regulations specifically related to performance by states and districts concerning their activities under Goals 2000. Rather, the Department of Education provides states the latitude to merge Goals 2000 funds with other funds from state and local sources to support state and local reform activities. However, the Department has identified objectives in its annual performance plan that it expects to achieve as a result of this program, along with other education programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Goals 2000 Funds Support a Broad Range of Education Reform Efforts at the State and Local Levels", "paragraphs": ["Goals 2000 funds, totaling about $1.25 billion for fiscal years 1994 through 1997, have supported a broad range of education reform activities at both the state and local levels. Of this amount, states reported that about $109 million (9 percent) was retained at the state level where it was used for management, development of statewide standards, and other related purposes. The remaining funding was provided in the form of subgrants to local districts, consortia of districts, individual schools, and teachers. State program officials reported that subgrants supported a broad array of district efforts to promote education reform activities and keep up with new state standards and assessments. These efforts included developing district and school reform plans, aligning local curricula with new assessments, and promoting professional development activities for teachers.

In some instances, state-retained funds were combined with subgrants to support local initiatives. In the 4-year period that we reviewed, states were able to provide detail on how $62 million in state-retained funds have been used. Of this amount, states primarily used Goals 2000 funds for personnel and benefits and contract services and consultants. (See fig. 1.) Funds were also used for training and travel; printing and postage; equipment and supplies; and rent, telephone, overhead, and other costs not classified elsewhere.", "The largest category of state-retained funds where detail was available was for funds reported as used for personnel and benefit costs (44 percent). These expenditures typically involved salaries and benefits for state-level staff who managed the state\u2019s subgrant program and other state-sponsored education reform activities. Generally, these personnel were responsible for disseminating information on the Goals 2000 program, providing technical expertise to districts regarding grant requirements, assisting district personnel with proposal writing, reviewing districts\u2019 subgrant proposals, and managing the subgrant selection process. These staff also typically monitored subgrantees\u2019 expenditures and reviewed reports that subgrantees submitted regarding their projects.", "The remaining state-retained funds where detail was reported were used for contract services, training and travel, printing and postage, equipment and supplies, and other activities. Contract services and consultant fees constituted about 28 percent of state-retained funds. These expenditures were often associated with state efforts to create new standards and assessments, develop new curricula in alignment with the standards, and use outside experts to research and develop these measures. Travel, training, and conference costs, accounting for about 9 percent of total expenditures, typically supported state Goals 2000 panel activities and training for teachers and administrators. These funds were also used to support state conferences designed to educate district and school officials about Goals 2000 and allow them to share information and collaborate on projects. Printing and postage made up 7 percent of state-retained funds, and funds used for equipment and supplies, such as purchasing computer hardware and software, made up another 7 percent. Other expenses\u2014such as rent, telephone costs, overhead, and other costs not classified elsewhere\u2014accounted for the remaining 5 percent of the identified funds.The additional $47 million identified by states as having been retained at the state level had either not yet been spent or could not be identified in detail.", "Most state officials said that Goals 2000 funding has been an important resource in their states\u2019 development of new standards and assessments, but they were unable to estimate how much future Goals 2000 funding they would need to complete these activities.

(Amounts for fiscal year 1997 are incomplete because several states had not yet awarded their subgrants for that year at the time of our review.) Subgrants ranged from a $28 subgrant that funded a reading professional development activity in a single California school to a $6.1 million subgrant for fourth- to eighth-grade reading instruction awarded to the Los Angeles Unified school district. More than 34 percent of the 14,367 school districts nationwide that provide instructional services received at least one Goals 2000 subgrant during the 4-year period reviewed. Many districts received Goals 2000 funding for 2 or more of the years we reviewed.", "Over the 4-year period reviewed, Goals 2000 subgrants funded several general categories of activities: local education reform projects, professional development, computer equipment and training, preservice training, and standards and assessments. Local education reform projects and professional development, the two largest categories, together account for about two-thirds of the subgrant funding. Some activities fell into a \u201ccrosscutting and other\u201d category that reflected activities that had been combined or were too infrequent to categorize separately. In cases where states could not identify a single primary activity for a grant, we classified the grants as having had a crosscutting purpose.

For example, Indiana awarded a subgrant to align curricula and instruction and to design and implement an improvement plan that allows secondary schools to build on foundations developed at the elementary schools. In Kentucky, state officials reviewed their comprehensive reform activity and concluded that their plan was missing a public engagement program for parents and community members that would sustain education reform.

Teachers who participated in the training program subsequently used the strategies to help 63 of 89 at-risk first-graders progress to reading at a level comparable to the average of their class.

In Peoria, Goals 2000 funded a grant allowing education majors in local colleges to attend an educators\u2019 fair, observe classes, create projects for classroom use, and meet regularly with selected master teachers from the district. In Delaware, a subgrant funded technology and staff support for a preservice program that allowed second-year student teachers to teach during the day and attend courses by videoconference rather than driving long distances to the state\u2019s only university with a preservice training program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technology and Training", "paragraphs": ["Subgrants for computer equipment and training\u2014which are used to buy computer hardware and software, network schools to educational sites on the Internet, and train teachers and staff on the effective use of the new technology\u2014amounted to about 10 percent of total funding. For example, a subgrant in Louisiana allowed a teacher to buy a graphing calculator, which could be used with an overhead projector to help low-performing math students better understand algebra. In some states, districts could purchase technology using Goals 2000 funds if the primary purpose of the subgrants involved meeting state education reform goals. Other states\u2014including New Mexico, Kansas, and Wisconsin\u2014permitted districts to purchase technology using Goals 2000 funds only if the equipment was closely tied to an education reform project. As one Wisconsin official stated, \u201cDistricts cannot purchase technology for technology\u2019s sake.\u201d A few states restricted technology purchases in 1 or more years. Oregon, for example, did not permit districts to purchase high-cost computer equipment using Goals 2000 subgrant funds. However, some states, such as Virginia and Alabama, required all subgrant projects to be associated with technology. Officials in these states told us that they had taken this approach because their states tied their education reform efforts to their state technology plans or because the approach was one of the least controversial purposes available for using Goals 2000 funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Standards and Assessments", "paragraphs": ["Standards and assessments activities, accounting for about 5 percent of total subgrant funding, included funding for such activities as the development of standards, alignment of current curriculum standards with new state content standards, and the development of new or alternative assessment techniques.

State staff were also developing new assessments using state-retained funds. With Goals 2000 funds, Texas funded the development and dissemination of its Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) program, which informs teachers about what students should know and be able to do. Goals 2000 paid for items such as a statewide public and committee review of TEKS and subsequent revisions; printing and distribution of TEKS following its adoption by the state board; and ongoing support, including statewide centers, resource materials and products, and training related to TEKS. In Louisiana, Goals 2000 project directors reported that teachers in a number of subgrant projects were able to experiment with alternative assessment techniques.

In many of these cases, state officials were unable to identify a single focus for subgrant activities because they reflected a combination of activities. Some subgrants, for example, combined development of a district improvement plan (a local education reform activity) with teacher education on the new curriculum (a professional development activity). In Pennsylvania, most of the $41 million in subgrants for the 4-year period had several different areas of focus, such as a district\u2019s $462,100 subgrant identified as being for the development and implementation of a local improvement plan, assessments, technology, and preservice teacher training and professional development.", "Less than two-tenths of 1 percent of Goals 2000 subgrant funding was identified as being used to support health-related education activities. In the 31 subgrants specifically identified as being related to health issues, most involved nutrition and hygiene education efforts that district officials believed were important to the preparedness of their students to learn. For example, a subgrant in New Mexico focused on making children healthier and used subgrant funds to implement a curriculum that taught children about health issues, such as dental care, nutrition, exercise, and problems associated with cigarette smoking and alcohol use.

For example, one Oregon official said that Goals 2000 funding was the difference between \u201cdoing it and doing it right\u201d and that, without Goals 2000 funds, the state would either not have been able to develop standards or would have had to settle for standards only half as good as the ones that were developed. For example, Goals 2000 funds allowed Oregon to bring in experts, partner with colleges, align standards, create institutes to help teachers with content standards, and articulate the curriculum to all teachers to prepare students for standardized testing.

For example, in Nevada, a state official said that Goals 2000 was a catalyst for developing content and performance standards that identified what, at a minimum, students would need to master at certain grade levels. Before Goals 2000, the state did not even have the terminology for standards-based reform. Goals 2000 brought terminology and a consistency of ideas regarding standards-based reform, he said.

The Congress has been considering changing the present format of Goals 2000 funding as part of ongoing discussions on how to better assist states in their education reform efforts. Almost every state official told us that flexibility is key to Goals 2000\u2019s usefulness in promoting state education reform because states could direct these funds toward their state\u2019s chosen education reform priorities. The current level of flexibility, officials told us, allowed states to use their state-retained funding according to self-determined priorities as well as structure their subgrant programs to mesh with their states\u2019 education reform plans. As one Washington state official said, Goals 2000 is laid out in the law with broad functions rather than with specific programs, which has had an impact in bringing schools and districts together to increase standards and prioritize issues rather than developing program \u201cstovepipes.\u201d A state official from Arizona said that the flexibility permitted in determining how funds will be used allows states that are at different points in the reform process to use the funds according to their own needs\u2014an especially important feature given the wide variation among states with respect to education reform progress. In New York, local and state officials described the Goals 2000 funding as being valuable because it allowed the state to react quickly to problems and opportunities.

Generally, these state officials wanted the funding criteria to remain as they are with funds dedicated to systemic education reform purposes at a broad level but permitting flexibility at the state and local levels to determine what would be funded within that broad purpose. For example, Louisiana state officials said that they feared the funding would be used in lieu of current state spending if it were not earmarked for education reform and that this would reduce the level of reform that would occur in the state.
