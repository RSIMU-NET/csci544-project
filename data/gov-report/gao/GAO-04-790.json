Nonetheless, the department is in the early stages of developing the infrastructure needed for implementing its new human capital management system. DHS has begun strategic human capital planning efforts at the headquarters level since the release of the department's overall strategic plan and the publication of proposed regulations for its new human capital management system. Strategic human capital planning efforts can enable DHS to remain aware of and be prepared for current and future needs as an organization. However, this will be more difficult because DHS has not yet been systematic or consistent in gathering relevant data on the successes or shortcomings of legacy component human capital approaches or current and future workforce challenges. Efforts are now under way to collect detailed human capital information and design a centralized information system so that such data can be gathered and reported at the departmentwide level. DHS and Office of Personnel Management leaders have consistently underscored their personal commitment to the design process. Continued leadership is necessary to marshal the capabilities required for the successful implementation of the department's new human capital management system. Sustained and committed leadership is required on multiple levels: securing appropriate resources for the design, implementation, and evaluation of the human capital management system; communicating with employees and their representatives about the new system and providing opportunities for feedback; training employees on the details of the new system; and continuing opportunities for employees and their representatives to participate in the design and implementation of the system. In its proposed regulations, DHS outlines its intention to implement key safeguards. For example, the DHS performance management system must comply with the merit system principles and avoid prohibited personnel practices; provide a means for employee involvement in the design and implementation of the system; and overall, be fair, credible, and transparent. The department also plans to align individual performance management with organizational goals and provide for reasonableness reviews of performance management decisions through its Performance Review Boards."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is an historic  opportunity for the federal government to fundamentally transform how  the nation will protect itself from terrorism and other threats.

Among other things, the proposal establishes a  pay for performance system, a new adverse actions and appeals process,  and new labor relations rules.  The regulations provided the broad outline  of the DHS proposed system.  As the system evolves, critical issues, such as  how DHS will link individual performance expectations to DHS\u2019s mission  and goals, how it will define performance expectations to promote  individual accountability, and how it will continue to incorporate adequate  safeguards to ensure fairness, will need to be addressed.

Our first report, issued in September 2003, described the process  DHS put in place to design its human capital system and involve employees  and analyzed the extent to which the process reflected what we found to be  important elements of successful transformations.  We found that, to date,  the design effort was collaborative and facilitated participation of  employees from all levels of the department.  The effort also generally  reflected what we have found to be important elements of effective  transformations.  Second, we provided our preliminary observations on  selected major provisions of the proposed human capital regulations in a  testimony and two related items of correspondence providing answers to  post-hearing questions.

Moving forward, the department plans to  design a centralized information system so that human capital data can be  gathered and reported at the corporate level.", "With this information, the department will be better positioned to conduct  data-driven evaluations of the successes and shortcomings of its new  human capital management system.  DHS documents indicate that the  department is committed to an ongoing comprehensive evaluation of the  effectiveness of the human capital system.  The department described  efforts to identify human capital metrics and an intent to use employee  surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and needs.  We testified that DHS  should consider doing evaluations that are broadly modeled on the  evaluation requirements of the OPM demonstration projects.  Under the  demonstration project authority, OPM requires agencies to evaluate and  periodically report on results, implementation of the demonstration  project, cost and benefits, impacts on veterans and other equal  employment opportunity groups, adherence to merit system principles, and  the extent to which the lessons from the project can be applied  governmentwide.  A set of balanced measures addressing a range of results  and customer, employee, and external partner issues may also prove  beneficial.  An evaluation such as this would facilitate congressional  oversight; allow for any midcourse corrections; assist DHS in  benchmarking its progress with other efforts; and provide for documenting  best practices and sharing lessons learned with employees; stakeholders;  other federal agencies; and the public.

DHS is recognizing that there are up-front costs to design and  implementation and that its components are starting from different places  regarding the maturity of their human capital management systems.   Members of the Senior Review Advisory Committee agreed during their  deliberations that creating the new human capital management system will  require a substantial investment, and identified this as a core principle for  the design of the system.  Additionally, during the DHS focus groups,  employees expressed an interest in increasing the resources available for  training and professional development, and noted the importance of having  an adequate budget for the performance management system in  particular.", "The administration recognizes the importance of funding this major reform  effort and has requested, for fiscal year 2005, $102.5 million to fund  training, the development of the performance management and  compensation system, and contractor support, and over $10 million for a  performance pay fund in the first phase of implementation (affecting about  8,000 employees) to recognize those who meet or exceed expectations.   Approximately $20 million was also requested to fund the development of a  departmental human resources information technology system.  While the  investments are important to the ultimate success of DHS\u2019s efforts, it is  equally important to recognize that certain costs are one-time in nature  and, therefore, should not be built into the base of DHS\u2019s budget for future  years.", "Communication.  In our September 2003 report, we commended the  structured approach the department developed to communicate with  stakeholders on the human capital system and recommended that the  Secretary of DHS ensure that the message communicated across the  department was consistent.  Officials we interviewed in five legacy  components of the department agreed that communication from DHS  headquarters on the human capital system has been consistent.  In  particular, three noted that the information contained in the weekly  departmental newsletter is helpful.  As an example of the consistency of  the communication on the new human capital management system,  between December 5, 2003 and February 27, 2004, employees were assured  in five different newsletters that the new human capital system would not  lead to a loss in pay or benefits and four different newsletters reported that  no layoffs would result due to the implementation of the new system.  To  ensure the consistency of the message, a Communications Coordination  Team, which includes members from across the department, has been  established to disseminate information and promote a clear understanding  of the new human capital system.  This team meets biweekly or weekly   and is co-chaired by the Director of Internal Communications and the  Director of Human Resource Management.", "In our September report we also recommended that the department  maximize opportunities for two-way communication and employee  involvement through the completion of the design process and  implementation, and noted that special emphasis should be placed on  seeking the feedback and buy-in of front-line employees in the field.   Opportunities for two-way communication were limited between the  conclusion of the town hall meetings in July 2003 and the publishing of the  proposed regulations in February 2004.  The primary means for employees  to provide feedback was through the Human Resources Design Team  e-mail box.  Employees and the general public were also allowed to  participate in the public comment period of the Senior Review Advisory  Committee meetings in October 2003.  While the department continued to  consult intermittently with leaders of the three major unions during this  period, one agency official noted that the department does not have a  similar mechanism in place to obtain feedback from nonunionized  employees.  One action taken to overcome this challenge was the effort to  notify employees how to comment on the proposed regulations, which was  communicated in six different newsletters between February 13 and March  22, 2004.  DHS received over 3,400 comments on its proposed regulations,  in part due to its efforts to encourage employees to submit comments on  the system.", "Since the release of the proposed regulations, DHS has provided  information to employees through a variety of formats.  For example, a link  to the proposed human capital regulations was placed in a prominent  position on the intranet home page of the department for easy access.  On  February 13, 2004, a satellite broadcast outlined the major features of the  human capital management system, reaching approximately 500 DHS  locations around the country.  During the broadcast, employees submitted  questions, and those unable to view the broadcast could access it through  the DHS Internet Web site.  Additionally, a senior leadership conference  was held, in part, to brief executives on the proposed system.  The  department has developed tool kits to provide information to both  executives and line managers about the changes and to provide them with  talking points for discussion with their employees and developed a quad- fold to distribute to line employees containing questions and answers about  the new system.  Town hall meetings that were held around the country to  mark the one-year anniversary of the department included discussions  about the proposed human capital system.  Finally, between February 13  and March 22, 2004, the time in which employees could submit comments  on the proposed regulations, the weekly DHS newsletter included answers  to commonly asked questions and details on what would be changed and  remain the same under the proposal.", "The success of DHS communication efforts is especially important, given  employee responses to the OPM FHCS:  40 percent report that managers promote communication among  different work units, which is less than the governmentwide response of  51 percent;  65 percent feel they have enough information to do their job well, which  is less than the governmentwide response of 71 percent; and  37 percent are satisfied with the information they receive from  management on what is going on in the organization, which is less than  the governmentwide response of 45 percent.", "Training.  Members of the Senior Review Advisory Committee identified  training and development as a critical component for implementing the  human capital system.  Furthermore, participants in the DHS focus groups  expressed a need for training and professional development opportunities  in a number of areas, including general supervisory capabilities, assessing  employee performance, labor-management relations, and alternative  dispute resolution.  The DHS proposal correctly recognizes that a  substantial investment in training is a key aspect of implementing a  performance management system.  The need for in-depth and varied  training will continue as the system is implemented, as indicated by results  from the OPM FHCS in which 53 percent of respondents believe  supervisors/team leaders in their work unit encourage their development at  work, which is less than the governmentwide response of 59 percent.   Furthermore, 47 percent feel they are given a real opportunity to improve  their skills, which is less than the governmentwide response of 57 percent.", "Our recently released guides for agencies to help ensure investments in  training and development are targeted strategically and could prove helpful  to DHS as it develops its training and development programs.", "Employee Participation.  The Undersecretary for Management has  already noted her commitment to move forward on implementing the  human capital system in a collaborative way, and reiterated that support in  a December 19, 2003 memorandum to DHS employees regarding the human  capital system.  Regardless of whether it is a part of collective bargaining,  involving employees in such important decisions as how they are deployed  and how work is assigned is critical to the successful operations of the  department.  This is likely to be a significant challenge for the department  in light of employee responses to the OPM FHCS in which 28 percent of  DHS employees indicated a feeling of personal empowerment, which is  fewer than the governmentwide response of 40 percent.  Additionally, 44  percent of DHS employees reported satisfaction with their involvement in  decisions that affect their work, compared to 53 percent governmentwide.", "Implementation Teams.  DHS formed three implementation teams at the  end of February 2004 to support the design and implementation of the  human capital management system because of the multiple areas that  require management attention.  This includes a Training and  Communications team; a Pay, Performance, and Classification team; and a  Labor Relations, Adverse Actions, and Appeals team.  According to agency  officials, the teams will initially focus their efforts on data collection and  project planning activities until the department issues interim final  regulations for the human capital management system, at which time the  teams will begin to draft departmental policies to support implementation.   Agency officials reported that, as they move forward, they will pay  particular attention to how their decisions may affect other human capital  approaches across the department.", "The mission of the Training and Communications team is to develop  comprehensive communication and training plans, coordinate and manage  the development of training, coordinate the delivery of training, and to  disseminate information related to the design and implementation of the  department\u2019s human capital system.  The co-leads of the team said their  work largely depends on the efforts of the other two implementation teams  and acknowledged the concerns raised by employees on the need for  training, especially for departmental managers.  They also said they plan to  rely on the training capacity already in the department.  A second goal is for  the team to ensure that communication with employees about the new  human capital management system is coordinated and consistent across  components and to ensure that avenues are available for DHS employees to  communicate ideas to the implementation teams.", "The mission of the Pay, Performance, and Classification team is to design  departmental policies, procedures, guidance, implementation instructions,  and evaluation criteria so that components can implement new systems in  the areas of pay, performance management, and classification.  The team is  beginning its work by gathering information in these areas from  departmental components and defining the system objectives.  Officials  noted this would be a significant challenge because of differences in the  types of data collected, the varied manner in which the data are stored, and  uneven levels of data reliability.  As the team develops its proposals, it  plans to use advisory groups to evaluate the efficacy of draft policies.   Particular attention will be paid to ensuring there are adequate safeguards  in the classification, pay, and performance management systems, according  to officials.", "The mission of the Labor Relations, Adverse Actions, and Appeals team is  to prepare rules, regulations, policies, procedures, guidance, implementing  instructions, and evaluation criteria for the department to deploy new  systems in these areas.  The co-leads noted that they intend to work  collaboratively to design systems that encourage cooperation.  These  officials reported that their initial tasks are to explore how to staff different  boards and panels identified in the proposed regulations and determine  how to transition pending cases to the new system.  They further plan to  identify elements that require departmental-level guidance, identify  elements where policy variation is appropriate among departmental  components, and collect data on historical levels of grievances and appeals  to forecast the potential workload once the department is transitioned to  the new system.", "The composition of the implementation teams sends an important signal.   Each of the three implementation teams is co-led by professional staff from  DHS headquarters and a component agency.  As of mid-March 2004,  officials noted the membership of the teams was still evolving, but was  composed mainly of human capital professionals.  Agency officials noted  that decisions had not yet been made about the level of involvement of  union officials.  These same officials reported that OPM staff would serve  as advisers when needed as opposed to participating on a full-time basis,  and noted an intention to pull together groups of employees to serve as  \u201csounding boards and challenge groups\u201d throughout the process.   Contractors will be integrated with the teams to provide project  management and other support.", "As DHS moves forward, it may find helpful a set of key capabilities that our  work has found to be central to the use of human capital authorities.

A fact-based, performance-oriented approach to  human capital management is crucial for maximizing the value of human  capital as well as managing risk.  High-performing organizations use data to  determine key performance objectives and goals that enable them to  evaluate the success of their human capital approaches.  Valid and reliable  data are critical to assessing an agency\u2019s workforce requirements and  heighten an agency\u2019s ability to manage risk by allowing managers to  spotlight areas for attention before crises develop and identify  opportunities for enhancing agency results.

Publishing the results in a manner that  protects individual confidentiality can provide employees with the  information they need to better understand the performance  management system.", "While incorporating these safeguards into performance management  systems, our work indicates that there is a set of key practices for agencies  to create a clear linkage, or \u201cline of sight,\u201d between individual performance  and organizational success.  These key practices include the following.  1. Align individual performance expectations with organizational  goals. An explicit alignment helps individuals see the connection between  their daily activities and organizational goals. 2. Connect performance expectations to crosscutting goals. Placing  an emphasis on collaboration, interaction, and teamwork across  organizational boundaries helps strengthen accountability for results. 3. Provide and routinely use performance information to track  organizational priorities. Individuals use performance information to  manage during the year, identify performance gaps, and pinpoint  improvement opportunities. 4. Require follow-up actions to address organizational priorities. By  requiring and tracking follow-up actions on performance gaps,  organizations underscore the importance of holding individuals  accountable for making progress on their priorities. 5. Use competencies to provide a fuller assessment of performance.   Competencies define the skills and supporting behaviors that individuals  need to effectively contribute to organizational results. 6. Link pay to individual and organizational performance. Pay,  incentive, and reward systems that link employee knowledge, skills, and  contributions to organizational results are based on valid, reliable, and  transparent performance management systems with adequate safeguards. 7. Make meaningful distinctions in performance. Effective  performance management systems strive to provide candid and  constructive feedback and the necessary objective information and  documentation to reward top performers and deal with poor performers. 8. Involve employees and stakeholders to gain ownership of  performance management systems. Early and direct involvement helps  increase employees\u2019 and stakeholders\u2019 understanding and ownership of the  system and belief in its fairness.  9. Maintain continuity during transitions. Because cultural  transformations take time, performance management systems reinforce  accountability for change management and other organizational goals."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Ed Stephenson, Ellen V.
