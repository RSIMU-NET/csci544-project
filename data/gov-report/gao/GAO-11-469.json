Therefore, decisions that program officials make during the acquisition process to acquire or not acquire rights to technical data, which may cost $1 billion, can have far-reaching implications for DOD's ability to sustain and competitively procure parts and services for those systems. DOD needs access to technical data to control costs, maintain flexibility in acquisition and sustainment, and maintain and operate systems. In response to a congressional request, GAO reviewed the extent to which: (1) DOD has updated its acquisition and procurement policies to reflect a 2007 law and 2006 GAO recommendations; (2) selected acquisition programs adhered to requirements to document technical-data needs; and (3) DOD took actions to improve technical-data decisions by program managers. GAO interviewed DOD officials, reviewed acquisition strategies and acquisition plans from 12 programs, and compared those documents to relevant DOD policies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD updated its acquisition and procurement policies to require that acquisition program managers document their long-term technical-data needs in a manner that reflects a 2007 law and GAO's 2006 recommendations. Together these policies require documentation of: (1) an assessment of technical-data requirements, (2) the merits of a \"priced-contract option\" that enables DOD to obtain additional technical data that it did not acquire in its initial contract, (3) the contractor's responsibility to verify its assertions of limits to DOD's ability to use the technical data, and (4) the potential for changes in the system's sustainment plan. According to DOD officials, these policy updates do not require changes to the way program managers assess technical-data needs. Sampled acquisition programs partially addressed the four updated technical-data-documentation requirements. Ten of the 12 programs GAO reviewed addressed at least 1 of the 4 requirements in their acquisition strategies and acquisition plans; however, none of the programs addressed all 4 of the requirements. Specifically, 9 of the 12 strategies documented an assessment of their technical-data requirements. For example, the strategy for a Navy communications system stated that the program planned to obtain technical data and associated rights to sustain the system over its life cycle and allow for competitive procurement of future systems. In contrast, 3 of the 12 strategies documented the contractor's responsibility to verify its assertions of limits to DOD's ability to use the technical data. Each of the three strategies noted that the program planned to include a clause in its contracts that identifies the contractor's responsibilities. DOD has issued guides--that are voluntary for the program managers to use--to improve technical-data decision-making. These guides may help program managers with decisions and documentation on technical data. However, DOD technical-data policies remain unclear. Effective internal controls help organizations implement their directives. GAO found that, because DOD has not issued clarifications to its policy, DOD policies that require documentation of long-term technical-data needs are unclear. As a result, acquisition strategies have not always documented required information on technical data--a point the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics recently emphasized. Because of the ambiguity in the policies, DOD's ability to implement effective internal control over those policies is limited. Moreover, DOD recently added a requirement that program managers conduct a business-case analysis for systems' long-term technical-data needs. However, DOD has not issued policy or other internal controls that describe how to conduct this analysis. GAO has previously reported that the military services inconsistently completed similar business-case analyses because DOD had not issued instructions on how to conduct them. Without instructions that describe how to conduct the business-case analysis, senior acquisition decision makers may not receive the information they need to decide whether to approve programs at major milestones in the acquisition process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) update policies to clarify its technical-data documentation requirements and (2) instruct program managers on the elements to include and the information to report for technical-data business-case analyses.

Technical  data\u2014recorded information used to produce, support, maintain, or  operate a system\u2014can enable the government to complete maintenance  work in house, as well as to competitively award contracts for the  acquisition and sustainment of a weapon system. Because many systems  remain in DOD\u2019s inventory for decades, decisions that officials make  during the acquisition process to acquire or not acquire rights to technical  data can have far-reaching implications for DOD\u2019s ability to sustain the  systems and competitively procure parts and services. Weapon systems  are costly to sustain in part because they often incorporate technologically  complex subsystems and components and need expensive spare parts and  logistics support to meet required readiness levels. According to DOD, at  least 70 percent of a weapon system\u2019s life-cycle costs are incurred to  operate and support a weapon system after it has been acquired, with the  percentage depending on how long a system remains in the inventory.", "Since 2002, we have issued several reports that address technical data.  For example, we reported in 2006 that a number of fielded Army and Air  Force systems encountered limitations in sustainment options because the  military services lacked needed technical-data rights. In the 2006 report,  we recommended that DOD require program managers to assess long-term  technical-data needs and establish corresponding acquisition strategies  that provide for the technical-data rights needed to sustain weapon  systems over their life cycles. More recently, we reported in 2010 that the  government\u2019s lack of access to proprietary technical data, among other  things, limits\u2014or even precludes the possibility of\u2014competition for DOD  weapons programs.", "Congress has also highlighted the importance of technical data in the  defense acquisition process. For example, section 802 of the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 includes a requirement that  the Secretary of Defense direct program managers for major weapon  systems to assess their systems\u2019 long-term technical-data needs.  The act  also requires that the Secretary direct program managers to develop  corresponding acquisition strategies that provide for the technical-data  needs to sustain their systems throughout their life cycle. Similarly,  Congress passed the Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009,  which required in part that the Secretary of Defense is to ensure the  acquisition strategy for each major defense-acquisition program includes  measures to ensure competition, or the option of competition, in contracts  for the program throughout its life cycle. The act cited the acquisition of  complete technical-data packages as one option for promoting  competition.", "In response to your request, this report addresses the extent to which (1)  DOD has updated its acquisition and procurement policies to reflect  certain technical-data-related provisions of the 2007 National Defense  Authorization Act and GAO\u2019s 2006 recommendations aimed at assessments  of long-term technical-data needs; (2) selected defense acquisition  programs have adhered to the updated requirements in DOD policy to  document their systems\u2019 long-term technical-data needs; and (3) DOD has  taken actions to improve decision making by program managers on the  long-term technical- data needs for systems in its acquisition process.", "To evaluate the extent to which DOD updated its acquisition and  procurement policies to reflect certain technical-data-related provisions of  the 2007 National Defense Authorization Act and GAO\u2019s 2006  recommendations, we analyzed the act and our prior recommendations.  We identified and evaluated changes the department made to its  acquisition and procurement policies since the 2007 act. We used  information from our evaluation of these policies in the analyses we  conducted for each of our objectives. We also reviewed follow-up records  maintained by DOD and GAO that document actions the department had  taken in response to audit recommendations. To evaluate the extent to  which selected defense-acquisition programs have adhered to the  requirements in DOD policy to document their system\u2019s long-term  technical-data needs, we selected a non-generalizable sample of 12  programs out of about 50 programs subject to the requirements outlined in  DOD acquisition and procurement policies. Our sample included Army,  Navy, and Air Force programs in the two highest-value acquisition  categories that reached major milestones in the defense acquisition  process from September 2007 to August 2010. In addition, findings from  our sample are not generalizable to all DOD acquisition programs,  although the variety of circumstances that the programs in our sample  face illustrates important aspects of documenting a system\u2019s long-term  technical-data needs. We obtained key acquisition documents\u2014the  acquisition strategy and acquisition plan\u2014from the programs in our  sample that reflect the technical-data needs of the system. Two team  members concurrently conducted independent analyses of the same  acquisition documents for each program comparing the documents against  relevant criteria from DOD policy. We then compared the two sets of  observations and reconciled any differences with the assistance of a third  analyst, when necessary. We provided our preliminary observations of the  documents to officials in each program and considered additional  information they provided when our observations indicated that the  program documents had not addressed one or more of the requirements.  To evaluate the extent to which DOD has taken actions to improve  technical-data decision making, we reviewed documentation including the  November 2010 Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics memorandum, Implementation Directive for Better Buying  Power\u2013Obtaining Greater Efficiency and Productivity in Defense  Spending, as well as guidelines on technical data that the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics,  which is part of the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), and each of  the military departments recently issued. For each of our objectives, we  also interviewed officials in a variety of relevant organizations including  the OSD, the acquisition headquarters office in each of the military  departments, and the 12 acquisition programs in our sample. During these  interviews, we obtained perspectives from officials and documentation  such as acquisition strategies and acquisition plans from each of the  programs in our sample. We also assessed the reliability of all of the data  that we discuss in this report by reviewing relevant documentation and  interviewing knowledgeable officials. We found the data sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 to May 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

To assess a system\u2019s  technical-data requirements, program officials determine which  components DOD will need technical data for and the level of rights to  seek for those data. Program officials consider several factors in their  assessment, such as the government\u2019s cost for the rights to the data,  sustainment plans, re-procurement needs, and contractors\u2019 economic  interest. Once program officials complete their assessment, they record  the technical-data requirements in a data-management strategy that is  included in the acquisition strategy, a document that is required by DOD  Instruction 5000.02. They also include similar documentation in the  acquisition plan, which is required by the DFARS. The acquisition strategy  describes the overall approach for managing and planning for the program,  while the acquisition plan describes the program\u2019s contracting approach.  The program manager then submits these documents to senior department  officials to review and approve at certain major milestones in the defense  acquisition process.", "Contracting phase: Program officials specify the approved technical-data  requirements in solicitations they issue to contractors. These solicitations  describe the capability requirements for a system that the government  intends to acquire. Contractors then submit proposals to DOD in which  they describe the system that they would build to provide the required  capability. In the proposals, contractors also discuss technical-data issues.  For example, if a contractor desires to assert restrictions on DOD\u2019s ability  to use any of the technical data needed to manufacture or sustain the  system, the contractor asserts those restrictions in its proposal. Program  officials then review and evaluate the contractors\u2019 proposals using criteria  included in the solicitation. Officials evaluate any asserted restrictions on  DOD\u2019s use of technical data to identify areas of disagreement that the  department should resolve through negotiations or other procedures in  accordance with applicable law. DOD officials then award a contract.", "Performance and delivery phase: During this phase, the selected  contractor begins producing the system and may assert additional  restrictions to technical-data rights in certain circumstances. For example,  the contractor may assert new restrictions if the department modifies its  system requirements or if the contractor inadvertently omitted a  restriction during the contracting phase. DOD officials may also challenge  these additional asserted restrictions. Contractors mark all technical data  they deliver to the government with a level of rights (e.g., government  purpose or limited rights). In addition, program officials review these  markings to ensure that the contractor has identified them in a manner  that is consistent with DOD policies and the agreement in the contract.", "Post-performance and sustainment phase: In this phase, the  contractor has delivered a system to DOD. DOD officials may realize  during post-performance and sustainment whether they have acquired the  necessary technical data and technical-data rights during the sustainment  phase. When sustaining systems, DOD personnel may use technical data  for critical functions including maintaining and repairing systems. Any  new technical data and technical-data rights that would be needed for any  support contracts during sustainment phase would need to be acquired.  Program officials also may challenge the level of rights that the contractor  asserted for any delivered technical data that is used to produce the  system for up to 3 years after final payment under the contract or three  years after delivery of the data, whichever is later. Program officials may  also exercise options to obtain additional rights and data that the  department did not acquire during the performance and delivery phase if  DOD and the contractor had included a provision in the contract called a  \u201cpriced-contract option.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO and Defense Audit Agencies\u2019 Work on Technical Data", "paragraphs": ["For nearly a decade, we and the military-service audit agencies have  conducted reviews that included information on DOD\u2019s acquisition of  technical data and technical-data rights for systems in the acquisition  process.

Subsequently, we reported in August 2004 that DOD  program managers often opt to spend limited acquisition dollars on  increased weapon system capability rather than on acquiring the rights to  the technical data\u2014thus limiting their flexibility to perform maintenance  work in house or to support alternate source development should  contractual arrangements fail.

We also found that delaying action  in acquiring technical-data rights can make these data cost-prohibitive or  difficult to obtain later in a weapon system\u2019s life cycle.", "DOD took a series of actions to change its acquisition and procurement  policies in a manner that reflects the language of the 2007 act and our 2006  recommendations. As a result of these actions, program managers are now  required to record their long-term technical-data needs in two key  acquisition program documents: the acquisition strategy and acquisition  plan. Initially, OSD issued a memorandum in July 2007 requiring program  managers for systems in the two highest-value acquisition categories  (ACAT I and II) to assess the long-term technical-data needs for their  systems and document a corresponding strategy for technical data in each  program\u2019s acquisition strategy. DOD later included this policy change in  the December 2008 update of its acquisition policy, DOD Instruction  5000.02. In a separate action, DOD issued an interim rule in September  2007 amending the DFARS. This rule also requires program managers to  assess the long-term technical-data needs for their systems and document  a corresponding strategy in each program\u2019s acquisition plan. DOD finalized  the interim rule in December 2009.  Together these policy changes  required that strategies and plans for major acquisition programs:  1.  assess the data required to design, manufacture, and sustain the  system as well as to support re-competition for production,  sustainment, or upgrade;  2.  address the merits of including a priced contract option for future  delivery of data not initially acquired;  3.  consider the contractor\u2019s responsibility to verify any assertion of  restricted use and release of data; and  4.  address the potential for changes in the sustainment plan over the life  cycle of the weapon system or subsystem.", "OSD officials told us that these policy updates do not change the  requirements program managers must follow to decide what technical  data or technical-data rights to acquire for their systems. They also told us  that the only new requirement was that program managers include  documentation of their system\u2019s long-term technical-data needs in  acquisition strategies and acquisition plans.

For  example, the guide suggests that program managers consider whether Air  Force depot officials agree that the technical data and technical-data rights  that the program intends to acquire for the system are sufficient to enable  depot-level maintenance. Later, in October 2010, the Air Force\u2019s Product  Data Acquisition Team launched a technical-data-focused Web site that  includes some of the same information contained in the earlier Air Force  guide and additional information. For example, the Web site asks program  managers if the technical-data rights that program managers intend to  acquire enable the Air Force to support competition for contracts for  spare parts, equipment to upgrade to a system, and logistics support.", "The Army\u2019s Product Data and Engineering Working Group in August 2010  published a 68-page guide that describes steps it recommends program  officials take to assess a system\u2019s long-term technical-data needs and  document those needs in a data-management strategy. The Army\u2019s guide  contains a work sheet that provides program managers with a systematic  approach to assess their technical-data needs. For example, for each  component of a system, the worksheet prompts program managers to  consider the (1) level of rights required, (2) expected levels of rights the  Army will acquire in negotiations with a manufacturer, (3) any gaps  between the requirements and expected negotiated outcomes, (4) plans to  close any gaps, and (5) risks associated with those plans.", "The Navy in June 2010 published a set of guidelines that it recommends  program managers follow when they determine their systems\u2019 technical- data rights. The Naval Open Architecture Enterprise Team included these  guidelines in an appendix to a contracting guidebook. Like the Air Force  and Army resources, the appendix lists questions that the team  recommends program managers consider when conducting a technical- data rights assessment. For example, the appendix asks whether the  government will obtain government-purpose rights at a minimum for a  system and asks for a justification for agreeing to more restrictive rights  than government purpose rights.", "In addition to these department-level guides, some subordinate commands  within military departments have issued guidance on technical-data  assessments. For example, Air Force Materiel Command issued a  handbook on technical-data rights in May 2010, while the Air Force\u2019s  Space and Missile Systems Center issued the third edition of a similar  guide in January 2011.

However, the policy does not clearly state the level of detail program  managers are required to document, or the extent to which they should  document their reasoning for acquiring or not acquiring technical data and  technical-data rights. Likewise, the DFARS requires programs to address  in program documentation the potential for changes in the sustainment  plan over the system\u2019s life. However, the policy does not make clear what  information DOD expects to be provided in documentation of possible  future changes to a system\u2019s sustainment plan (for example, underlying  assumptions), and how this information should relate to the technical-data  discussion. Our previously discussed evaluation of 12 acquisition  strategies and plans\u2014most of which were approved before OSD and the  military departments issued their voluntary guides\u2014showed that program  managers may not fully understand how to respond to these revised  policies. As we noted, we found that eight of the 12 acquisition strategies  and plans we reviewed addressed no more than two of the four  requirements (see fig. 2).", "OSD had not issued an update to the DOD Instruction 5000.02 or the  DFARS as of April 2011 to clarify what programs specifically need to do to  address the assessments of technical data. OSD officials acknowledged to  us that the policies could be rewritten for greater clarity, and they pointed  out ambiguities in some of the requirements. For example, they told us  that the assessment of technical-data requirement is unclear. The officials  told us that if they had the opportunity, they would clarify the requirement  to state that program managers (1) assess the data that are needed to re- compete for production, sustainment, or upgrade, and (2) determine what,  if any, of that technical data the program requires.", "Ambiguity in the revised policies results in limits to department decision  makers\u2019 ability to exercise effective internal control in their reviews of  acquisition documentation. Without clear policies on documenting long- term technical-data needs, program managers may not understand how to  respond and, as a result, may continue to submit incomplete acquisition  documentation. Without complete documentation, senior level department  decision makers are limited in their ability to carry out their internal  control responsibilities to ensure that programs are aligned with  department policies and priorities. An August 2010 memorandum from the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and  Logistics called attention to this limitation stating that recent acquisition  strategies often did not include sufficient detail on topics including  technical-data requirements.

In addition, because OSD has not issued policy instructing  program managers on how to report on the results of these analyses,  program managers may not provide the information that senior leaders in  DOD and the military departments need in order to decide whether to  approve the acquisition programs at major milestones in the acquisition  process. Technical-data decisions can be costly, with some prime  contractors quoting a price in excess of $1 billion for technical-data  packages.

We reviewed DOD and military  department regulations governing technical-data acquisition and technical- data-related reports issued by GAO and DOD. We compared changes that  the department made to its acquisition and procurement policies to  respond to the law and our recommendations. Specifically, we analyzed  the following policies: (1) a memorandum issued by the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  (OSD), Data Management and Technical Data Rights (July 19, 2007); (2)  DOD Instruction 5000.02, Operation of the Defense Acquisition System  enclosure 12(9) (Dec. 8, 2008); and (3) the Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement (DFARS) 207.106 (S-70). We also used information  from this evaluation of the policies and their requirements in the analyses  we conducted for our other objectives. To obtain DOD\u2019s perspective on  changes to these policies as well as information for all three of our  objectives, we interviewed officials in a variety of organizations including  OSD, acquisition headquarters for each military department, selected  program executive offices, and the acquisition programs in our sample.  Table 1 lists the organizations we contacted to conduct interviews and  obtain documents related to the acquisition of technical data. We also  reviewed information in databases in the DOD Office of the Inspector  General and GAO that record actions DOD took to implement our  recommendations. To evaluate actions DOD and the military departments  took to implement additional legislative provisions and audit  recommendations related to technical data (that we describe in app. II),  we evaluated the requirements in the relevant legislation or the actions  called for in the relevant recommendations. We then obtained and  analyzed key documentation, such as updates DOD made to the DFARS to  implement section 202 of the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of  2009.", "To evaluate the extent to which selected defense acquisition programs  adhered to the updated requirements in DOD policy to document their  systems\u2019 long-term technical-data needs, we selected a non-generalizable  sample of 12 acquisition programs from a population of about 50  programs. To draw the sample, we asked the three military departments to  identify all acquisition programs at the two highest-value acquisition  categories (ACAT I or II) that had reached the first three acquisition  milestones\u2014A - Material Solution Analysis, B - Technology Development,  and C - Engineering and Manufacturing Development\u2014between  September 2007 and August 2010. We chose September 2007 because this  was the first point at which both sets of requirements for documenting  long-term technical-data needs were in effect, and we chose August 2010  because we selected our sample at that time. Because too few Marine  Corps programs reached one of these milestones during this period, we  excluded this service from our evaluation. To draw the sample, we  selected four programs from each department, balancing the ACAT levels  and milestones. We then selected those programs that had most recently,  at the time we drew our sample, reached their respective milestones. We  used this approach because DOD updated its policies in 2007, and we  wanted to allow as much time as possible for the military departments to  develop methods to respond to the requirements in DOD\u2019s updated  policies. Although findings from this sample are not generalizable to all  DOD acquisition programs, the variety of circumstances that programs in  our sample face can illustrate important aspects of documenting a  system\u2019s long-term technical-data needs. Our sample includes a variety of  acquisition programs, including new systems (e.g., Joint High Speed  Vessel), modifications to existing systems (e.g., C-130 Avionics  Modernization Program), and systems that were primarily software (e.g.,  Joint Battle Command-Platform). After completing our sample selection,  we analyzed the content of each program\u2019s acquisition strategy and  acquisition plan, which are required to document the program\u2019s long-term  technical-data needs. To conduct these analyses, we compared each  program\u2019s acquisition strategy and acquisition plan against certain criteria  from the July 2007 memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, DOD Instruction 5000.02, and the  DFARS. We could not compare the acquisition strategies and plans in our  sample to the voluntary guides that OSD and the military departments  issued in 2009 and 2010 because the guides were issued after the majority  of programs in our sample had completed their acquisition milestone  documentation. Two team members concurrently conducted independent  analyses of the same documentation. We then compared the two sets of  observations and reconciled any differences with the assistance of a third  analyst, when necessary.
