The age of the structures, past inattention to maintenance needs, and high visitation have left its facilities in need of revitalization and repair. Currently, the Smithsonian estimates $2.3 billion in costs for revitalization, construction, and maintenance projects between 2005 and 2013. This report addresses (1) how the current condition of the Smithsonian's facilities has affected access to the collections, and the collections themselves; (2) what changes the Smithsonian has made to its organization, practices, and prioritization processes to improve its facilities management; and (3) the estimated costs and status of the Smithsonian's facilities projects and their funding sources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To date, facilities-related problems at the Smithsonian have resulted in a few building closures and access restrictions and some cases of damage to the collections. For example, structural deterioration has caused closure of the 1881 Arts and Industries Building on the National Mall pending major repair and revitalization, as well as some facilities at the National Zoo. Concern over asbestos in a number of storage buildings has led to restricted access to the items within them. Some artifacts, such as two historic aircraft, have been damaged by water leaks from deteriorated pipes and roofing elements. Stopgap measures, such as draping plastic sheeting over artifacts in areas experiencing leaks, have prevented or minimized damage in other cases. Maintaining desired humidity and temperature levels for conserving the collections is a pervasive problem in some older Smithsonian facilities. These problems are indicative of a broad decline in the Smithsonian's aging facilities and systems that pose a serious long-term threat to the collections. The Smithsonian recently centralized its facilities organization, adopted industry best practices to maximize the effectiveness of its resources, reviewed its operating procedures, standardized its cost-estimating practices, and established processes for prioritizing work and allocating funds. These changes resulted from an internal review and a 2001 report by the National Academy of Public Administration, which recommended that the Smithsonian centralize its then highly decentralized approach to facilities management and budgeting in order to promote uniform policies and procedures, improve accountability, and avoid duplication. The Smithsonian created the Office of Facilities Engineering and Operations (OFEO) in 2003 to assume responsibility for all facilities-related programs and budgets--formerly divided among four administrative offices and the individual museums and centers. Most of the museum and center directors were either positive or neutral about the effectiveness of the reorganization so far. Overall, the reorganization appears to be moving in the right direction, though it has been hindered by reductions in OFEO's staffing and budget. The Smithsonian currently estimates that its planned capital and maintenance projects for 2005 through 2013 will cost about $2.3 billion, though this could grow because it is largely based on preliminary assessments. Of 13 revitalization and construction projects active during our review, most were on time and within budget. The Smithsonian's annual operating and capital program revenues come from its own trust fund assets and its federal appropriation (totaling $904.0 million in fiscal year 2004, with $184.4 million for facilities). Funding at this level would not be sufficient to cover the facilities projects planned for the next 9 years. Ensuring credible, long-term budget planning for sustaining and modernizing facilities involves the Smithsonian, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Congress in examining viable funding options. While Smithsonian officials have discussed funding options internally and with various stakeholders, no consensus has emerged on how to deal with this funding challenge."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2004, the Smithsonian Institution (the Smithsonian) closed its  1881 Arts and Industries Building to the public over concern about its  deteriorating roof structure. During 2003, the roofs of two historic  buildings of similar age and design had partially collapsed under heavy  snowfall. Arts and Industries\u2014used most recently for special exhibits and  administrative offices\u2014will need major renovation and revitalization work,  including the replacement of its aging electrical, plumbing, and heating and  cooling systems, before it can be returned to service. The failing condition  of this National Mall (the Mall) landmark is the most extreme example of  what a Smithsonian official has characterized as a \u201cbroad decline\u201d in its  extensive physical plant.", "This decline can, paradoxically, be linked to the Smithsonian\u2019s remarkable  success in carrying out its mission: \u201cthe increase and diffusion of  knowledge among men.\u201d In the years since its founding in 1846, the  Smithsonian Institution has preserved\u2014and shared\u2014our nation\u2019s most  precious objects and become an international leader in scholarship and  scientific discovery. From its original building on the Mall (commonly  known as \u201cthe Castle\u201d), the Smithsonian has evolved into the world\u2019s  largest museum complex and research organization, with 18 museums and  galleries, 10 science centers, a zoological park, and various other  facilities\u2014in total, more than 660 owned and leased buildings and other  structures, with an estimated replacement value of about $4.7 billion for  owned space as of June 2004. About 143.7 million objects and specimens  are safeguarded, studied, and displayed within its facilities, including  research collections in natural history and biology, as well as icons of our  national history such as the Fort McHenry \u201cStar Spangled Banner\u201d and the  Apollo 11 command module. Two of the Smithsonian\u2019s museums on the  Mall are the most visited in the world, with a third rivaling visitation at the  British Museum and the Louvre.", "With this tremendous physical expansion and popularity, however, have  come related facilities problems that include the structural deterioration of  aging buildings; heating, cooling and electrical systems that are well past  their normal life expectancy; leaks from roofs and pipes that jeopardize the  collections; inadequate exhibition and storage space; and maintenance  levels that have not kept pace with the wear and tear from millions of  visitors each year. A 2001 report by the National Academy of Public  Administration (NAPA)\u2014based on a review requested by the Congress\u2014 highlighted the need for major changes in the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities  management practices to help address these problems. In response to  NAPA\u2019s recommendations, as well as its own internal review, the  Smithsonian has been transforming its approach to facilities management.  The NAPA report also found that, prior to 2000, the Smithsonian  underestimated its revitalization needs, which were significantly larger  than were identified in its budget requests. The Smithsonian has updated  its funding requirements and has a 9-year estimate for the revitalization of  its older buildings, new construction, and minor repair and maintenance  (maintenance) work that now stands at about $2.3 billion.", "In light of ongoing concerns over the state of its facilities, you asked us to  review the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities management. Accordingly, we addressed  the following questions:  How does the current condition of the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities affect  public and scientific access to the collections, and the collections  themselves?", "What changes to its organizational structures and practices has the  Smithsonian put in place to manage its facilities, and how does the  Smithsonian now prioritize its revitalization, construction, and  maintenance projects?", "What are the estimated costs and status of the Smithsonian\u2019s major  revitalization, construction, and maintenance projects, including those  that have been deferred, and what are the funding sources for these  projects?", "In addition, you asked us to provide information on how the Smithsonian  uses its trust fund resources and federal appropriations to fund its  operations, as well as information on the basic legal authorities under  which the Smithsonian runs its revitalization, construction, and  maintenance programs. This information is included as appendix I of this  report.", "To address these issues, we visited 11 Smithsonian facilities to view and  discuss problem areas with staff from the Smithsonian\u2019s Office of Facilities  Engineering and Operations (OFEO) and the directors of the individual  facilities. The Smithsonian identified these facilities as having significant  facilities-related problems. Several facilities that we visited consisted of  multiple buildings, such as the National Zoological Park (the National Zoo),  which has more than 40 buildings. We interviewed the OFEO director and  other appropriate OFEO staff, project executives, and project managers, as  well as the Smithsonian\u2019s chief financial officer, associate general counsel,  and 16 directors of museums, galleries, the National Zoo, a program and a  research center (all internal customers of OFEO). We reviewed a variety of  Smithsonian handbooks and guidance related to facilities project  management, prioritization criteria, decision-making processes, and best  practices. We also reviewed the NAPA report, the Smithsonian inspector  general\u2019s reports, and other appropriate reports. We researched the  Smithsonian\u2019s enabling legislation, the statutes under which it currently  operates, including appropriations acts and numerous statutes authorizing  Smithsonian Institution facilities from the 1950s. We also reviewed the  Smithsonian\u2019s congressional budget requests and audited financial  statements for fiscal years 2002, 2003, and 2004. The information we  gathered was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review. We  conducted our work between April 2004 and April 2005 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. See appendix VII for a  more detailed explanation of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Congress established the Smithsonian Institution in 1846 to administer  a large bequest left to the United States by James Smithson, an English  scientist, for the purpose of establishing in Washington, D.C., an institution  \u201cfor the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.\u201d In accepting  Smithson\u2019s bequest on behalf of the nation, the Congress pledged the \u201cfaith  of the United States\u201d to carry out the purpose of the trust. To that end, the  act establishing the Smithsonian provided for the administration of the  trust, independent of the government itself, by a Board of Regents and a  Secretary, who were given broad discretion in the use of the trust funds.  The board was composed of both private citizens and members of all three  branches of the federal government, in order to ensure \u201cthe wise and  faithful use\u201d of the Institution\u2019s funds. The trust funds were permanently  loaned to the Treasury to be maintained in a separate account; and the  principal was to be maintained and the interest from that money used for  the operation of the Institution. Although the Smithsonian has grown  greatly since its founding nearly 160 years ago, it retains its essential  character as a trust establishment of the United States.", "Over the last 150 years, the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities inventory has expanded  to include 18 museums and galleries, 10 science centers, a zoo, and other  facilities\u2014most located in or near Washington, D.C., with others in  Massachusetts, New York, Florida, Arizona, Hawaii, and the Republic of  Panama. (See fig. 1.) These facilities include about 660 buildings and  structures, owned and leased, ranging from major museum buildings to  storage buildings and storage sheds. There are about 8.6 million square feet  of owned space and 1 million square feet of leased space. The Smithsonian  has estimated the replacement value for owned space at about $4.7 billion  as of June 2004. In 2003, an estimated 25 million people visited Smithsonian  museums, and researchers made 39,000 visits to use its facilities.", "The major buildings owned by the Smithsonian range in age from about 160  years old to less than a year old, with most of the facilities growth  occurring since the 1960s. (See fig. 2.) More than half of these buildings are  more than 25 years old, 6 are designated as National Historic Landmarks,  and about 40 are listed on the National Register of Historic Places or  otherwise eligible for special consideration under federal guidelines for  historic buildings. Not all of these buildings involved new construction.  For example, the Patent Office Building, Renwick Gallery, and Cooper- Hewitt Museum were transferred to the Smithsonian after they were built,  and the Victor Building was purchased for use as administrative offices.  The two latest additions to the Smithsonian are the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy  Center (phase I), which is part of the National Air and Space Museum and  opened in December 2003, and the National Museum of the American  Indian, which opened in September 2004. The Smithsonian\u2019s growth will  continue with the construction of an aircraft restoration area at the Udvar- Hazy Center (phase II), which the Smithsonian plans to complete in 2008,  and the design and construction of a National Museum of African American  History and Culture, authorized by the Congress in 2003. Beyond this, some  members in both houses of Congress have expressed interest in developing  a National Museum of the American Latino Community.", "In 1995, a commission established by the Smithsonian\u2019s Board of Regents  reported that the Institution\u2019s facilities were deteriorating at an accelerated  rate because of their age, the large number of visitors, and the  Smithsonian\u2019s failure to invest sufficient resources to repair, revitalize, and  maintain them. The commission concluded that over the next decade, a  total of $50 million a year would be needed to restore the Institution\u2019s  facilities (excluding the National Zoo) to the point of being safe for people  and appropriate for collections. This estimated annual need was more  than double the fiscal year 1995 appropriation for these purposes.", "Generally, the Congress provided increased funding in the late 1990s, but in  2000 the newly appointed Secretary of the Smithsonian testified that he  believed the Smithsonian\u2019s buildings were in poor condition and that the  cost to restore them would be substantially more than previously  identified. The Secretary stated that the Smithsonian \u201chas hesitated to  represent to Congress the full scale of the need. Instead, we\u2019ve tried to  make do.\u201d In response, the Congress directed the Smithsonian to contract  with NAPA for a review to obtain a better understanding of the use of funds  that had been provided to date. Specifically, NAPA was to determine (1)  how the Smithsonian had expended federal funds for repair and restoration  of its facilities, (2) what progress had been made in restoring the facilities,  and (3) what tasks lay ahead.", "NAPA reported in July 2001 that the federal funds appropriated for the  Smithsonian\u2019s facilities had been used properly; the Smithsonian\u2019s facility  requirements exceeded the amounts provided in the institution\u2019s annual  budgets; and the Smithsonian\u2019s 2000 estimates were based on a reasonable,  building-by-building approach and were more realistic than previous  estimates. NAPA found that the Smithsonian had used the funds for high- priority repair and restoration projects but that its needs were far greater  than those identified in its budget requests. While validating the  Smithsonian\u2019s 10-year estimate of about $1.2 billion in repair and  revitalization projects, NAPA noted that this estimate could increase to at  least $1.5 billion because it was not adjusted for the effects of inflation and  reflected only rough \u201corders of magnitude\u201d estimates for later-year  requirements. The report also recommended management improvements,  including centralizing the Smithsonian\u2019s decentralized facilities  management under a single organization and implementing a more  structured maintenance program. At the beginning of our review, the  Smithsonian had implemented 25 of the 30 recommendations, including a  fundamental reorganization of its facilities management organization,  funding, and staffing and the other 5 recommendations were in the process  of being implemented. (See app. II for a listing of NAPA\u2019s recommendations  and the status of the Smithsonian\u2019s implementation of them.) In addition to  the need for management improvements, NAPA highlighted the importance  of a \u201ccontinuing and substantial infusion of funds\u201d to address facilities  needs.", "We alluded to the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities problems in our High Risk Series  report on federal real property. The Smithsonian is one example of the  problem facing agencies across the federal government, which have  accumulated significant backlogs of maintenance and renovation needs  and face serious deterioration problems. Overall, we found that the  condition of federal facilities is one of alarming and accelerating  deterioration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Facility Conditions Have Generally Had Limited Effects on Access and Collections, but Some Chronic Problems Present Ongoing Risks", "paragraphs": ["Facilities-related problems at the Smithsonian have resulted in a few  building closures and access restrictions and, in some cases, harm to the  collections.

The roof panels of the Arts  and Industries Building, which opened in 1881, have deteriorated to the  point where they are considered unsound. The building was closed to the  public in 2004 and will be closed to staff in 2005. Prior to its public closure,  the Arts and Industries Building housed collections and received more than  900,000 visitors annually. The building also provided the Smithsonian with  a venue for functions related to fund-raising. No date has been set for  reopening this museum. Figure 3 shows a comparison of the North Hall of  the Arts and Industries building in 1977 and February 2005.", "At the National Zoo, facilities such as the sloth bear enclosure and the flight  cage for birds of prey have been rendered unusable because of  deterioration. In 2002, the National Zoological Park Director testified to the  Congress that over half of the National Zoo\u2019s buildings have seriously  compromised structural, mechanical, electrical, and fire and life-safety  systems. The National Zoo has begun a revitalization program that  currently is being funded. Figure 4 shows the deterioration at the zoo\u2019s  sloth bear facility.", "In addition to structural deterioration, problems with asbestos have  restricted researchers\u2019 access to certain collections. At the Garber Facility,  a complex used for storage and other support purposes, researchers\u2019  access to 5 of the complex\u2019s 40 buildings has been restricted because of  asbestos. In these 5 buildings, the stored items must be covered with  plastic, and access is limited to a few staff. Figure 5 shows the interior of  building 16 at the Garber Facility, which provides storage for artifacts for  the National Museum of American History.", "Both public and researchers\u2019 access to facilities and collections also can be  temporarily restricted by revitalization projects. For example, the Patent  Office Building, the second oldest building in the Smithsonian\u2019s inventory,  has been closed to the public since 2000 for revitalization. This building is  the home of the National Portrait Gallery and Smithsonian American Art  Museum. The Smithsonian has tried to limit the impact of the closure for  revitalization by loaning art work from these collections to other museums  or having traveling exhibits. Parts of the National Museum of American  History, the National Museum of Natural History, and the National Zoo also  have been closed to the public during revitalization projects. At the  National Museum of Natural History, the mammal collection was closed to  researchers for 2 years while the exhibit hall was undergoing revitalization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Damage and Threats to Collections", "paragraphs": ["Besides affecting access to the collections, the condition of Smithsonian  buildings can also affect the collections themselves. The greatest dangers  to the collections to date have been posed by water. For example, at the  National Air and Space Museum, Smithsonian officials showed us that  leaks have damaged both the Lilienthal Hang Glider, which helped pioneer  early flight design by influencing the Wright Brothers, and the Douglas  Skyrocket, D558, the first airplane to break Mach 2. (See figs. 6 and 7.)  Water also damaged 200 books at the Smithsonian Institution Archives due  to a drain back-up.", "Smithsonian officials identified several incidents and vulnerabilities related  to water, including:  In February 2005, a broken pipe at the National Zoo\u2019s mechanical room  that supports the pools for the seals and sea lions flooded the room with  8 feet of water and damaged controls, pumps, and motors. The pipes  were scheduled for replacement this spring. See figure 8.", "At the Smithsonian Institution Archives, 19 water emergencies have  occurred since June 2002, and the facility has formed an emergency  response team to deal with them. \u201cWe are excellent drapers of plastic,\u201d  according to an Archives official. Some of the leaks were directly above  collections, but quick action by the staff averted damage to the  collections.", "At the National Museum of African Art, breaches in the roof membrane,  malfunctioning valves, and clogged pipes often leak over galleries,  collection storage areas, and offices. Replacing the roof and the water  condensate system could address these problems, but other, higher  priorities have received funding instead.", "At the Renwick Gallery, gutters have leaked into the Grand Salon and  adjacent gallery, but damage to artwork has been avoided. Repairs are  scheduled for fiscal year 2005.", "At the Freer and Sackler Galleries, water has leaked many times in  storage areas and the library, and condensation poses a serious problem  in the Freer Gallery\u2019s exhibition areas. To date, no major damage to the  collections has occurred.", "Another area of concern is related to fluctuating temperature and humidity,  particularly in a museum setting where collections must be stored and  displayed in precise ways. While we toured various facilities, operations  and maintenance managers showed us aging heating, ventilation, and air- conditioning systems that, the managers said, were no longer consistently  maintaining the temperature and humidity needed to protect collections  from deterioration. At the Renwick Gallery, for example, fluctuations in  temperature and humidity produced by steam outages have caused  weeping of the plaster on the gallery walls and could potentially damage art  work. Poor ventilation at the Smithsonian Institution Archives caused high  humidity, resulting in mold damage that made some records unreadable.", "Lastly, safety concerns and hazardous materials also threaten some  collections. For example, at both the National Museum of Natural History  and the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, biological specimen  collections are preserved in an alcohol solution that poses a safety risk  from fire or explosive vapor that has to be controlled. Additionally, at the  Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, collections are stored in  deteriorating surplus trailers, many of them over 20 years old. Figures 9 and  10 depict problems with the storage of specimens stored in alcohol-filled  containers of various sizes at the National Museum of Natural History.  Several large rooms of about 10,000 square feet are used to store these  containers, though current code limits such rooms to 500 square feet for  safety purposes. Figure 9 shows that the storage containers are not  enclosed, and figure 10 shows alcohol storage rooms that do not have  current code-required explosion proof electrical equipment and fixtures.", "The Smithsonian is working to address these situations.

In July 2001, NAPA reported  that the Smithsonian\u2019s decentralized organizational structure and  management practices, in some cases, had a direct and adverse effect on  the planning, design, and construction activities that were integral to the  institution\u2019s revitalization, construction, and maintenance programs. In  response to NAPA\u2019s recommendations for improvement and its own  internal review, the Smithsonian began in fiscal year 2001 to centralize its  facilities management, adopted a variety of industry best practices for  managing facilities projects, and established a priority process for facilities  management. Because of the relative newness of the reorganization, it is  too early to assess its effectiveness, though it appears to be moving in the  right direction. Smithsonian museum, program, and center directors (the  internal customers directly affected by the reorganization) had generally  positive or neutral reactions to the reorganization, although several  directors believed that OFEO needed to improve communications with  them.

Three distinct organizations\u2014the offices of Physical  Plant, Environmental Management and Safety, and Protection Services\u2014 were loosely integrated under the central Office of Facilities Services, but  each organization had its own director and budget. The Office of Physical  Plant was further divided into 14 different divisions and offices. These  organizations were responsible for facility planning, design, construction,  and maintenance activities for the museums and research facilities.  However, the National Zoo had its own budget and on-site staff to perform  these functions for itself and for its Conservation and Research Center at  Front Royal, Virginia. In addition, each museum or other major facility had  its own separate funding and organization for providing custodial services,  loading dock management, trash collection, and minor maintenance.", "In its 2001 report, NAPA found that the sheer size of the Office of Physical  Plant (with a span of control encompassing 14 different units) and the wide  diversity of its functions (operations, repair, restoration, planning, design,  and maintenance) led to a hybrid organization that was awkward to  manage, diffused responsibility and accountability, and did not facilitate a  focus on the office\u2019s three primary responsibilities: (1) operation and  maintenance of the physical plant; (2) repair and restoration of facilities;  and (3) new construction. NAPA also noted that the functions and tasks  associated with operating and maintaining facilities were common to all of  the Smithsonian buildings and that overlap and duplication were likely  when more than one organization was responsible for carrying out the  same functions. NAPA concluded that centralizing facilities management  should enable the Smithsonian to provide more efficient and effective  services by putting a single organization in charge. According to NAPA, this  centralization would promote uniform policies and procedures, improve  accountability, and avoid overlap and duplication.", "In March 2001, before NAPA issued its report, the Smithsonian hired the  former director of Facilities Engineering at the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration to lead the reorganization of the facilities program  and to head the new organization. The Director met with the NAPA team  and studied its findings and recommendations. He also met with the  Smithsonian\u2019s senior leadership and, with the help of a small internal team,  listened to priorities and suggestions from various customers,  stakeholders, and other Smithsonian staff in developing a plan for the  reorganization.", "The result of this effort was the creation, in fiscal year 2004, of the Office of  Facilities Engineering and Operations (OFEO), a new, flatter facilities  management organization. OFEO assumed responsibility for all facility- related programs and budgets that had been divided among four offices the  National Zoo, and each museum or other major facility.

While all eight OFEO offices play a role in the facilities  program, the Office of Project Management oversees all revitalization and  construction projects, and two offices\u2014Facilities Management and  Facilities Reliability\u2014manage maintenance projects. The Office of Project  Management develops preliminary project scopes, schedules, and budgets;  monitors, directs, and reports on updated scopes, schedules and budgets  for projects; and coordinates the efforts of stakeholders, designers, and  construction execution. Major projects (in excess of $5 million) are  overseen by project executives, small projects ($5 million and less.) by  project managers. For major projects, such as the construction of the  National Museum of the American Indian and the revitalization of the  Patent Office Building, monthly reports indicate the status of each project\u2019s  cost and schedule. The OFEO director attends a monthly operational  review of major revitalization and construction projects with museum  directors, and the Smithsonian\u2019s deputy secretary/chief operating officer,  general counsel, and chief financial officer are briefed approximately  quarterly on the major projects. The Office of Project Management is also  responsible for the initial prioritization of revitalization and construction  projects.", "The Office of Facilities Management provides day-to-day facilities  maintenance services, including preventive maintenance, janitorial and  grounds maintenance, transportation and mail delivery, building  management for leased facilities, landscaping, and system start-ups for  newly completed facilities.

The office uses both  in-house and contractor personnel to accomplish its objectives. When a  minor repair is too large for Facilities Management, Facilities Reliability  uses its staff or contracts out the work. About 15 percent of minor repairs  are performed in-house, and about 85 percent are contracted out.

OFEO also has  been developing several handbooks to establish procedures and provide  guidance on various aspects of facilities management. Its Facilities Project  Management Handbook specifically addresses the Construction Industry  Institute\u2019s (CII) practices of benchmarking and metrics, partnering, and  preproject planning. OFEO has begun to implement these practices by, for  example, establishing and tracking metrics, such as holding contract  schedule growth to 10 percent or less and contract cost growth to 2 percent  or less. Both Facilities Management and Facilities Reliability periodically  survey their internal customers to determine their level of satisfaction with  the services provided to them.

The staff of the Smithsonian units and the staff of  the Offices of the Deputy Secretary, the Under Secretary for Science and the Under Secretary for Art  participate in this process. Projects are rated and ranked according to criteria based on health and  safety concerns first, code compliance and security, and the need for repairs and operational  efficiency.", "Once the cross-functional teams working at each facility rate and rank their projects by priority, type of  work and fiscal year, the plan is presented to the Smithsonian\u2019s Capital Planning Board. The board  under the direction of the Chief Financial Officer meets throughout the year to consider capital  requests and balance needs of the design and construction program against other capital  investments.", "A 5-year Facilities Capital Program Summary for funding is developed. The combined efforts of OFEO  and the Capital Planning Board ensure that the capital program receives wide-ranging review and  approval from all areas of the Smithsonian. The Audit and Review Committee of the Board of Regents  reviews the institution\u2019s finances and the Board of Regents authorizes the submission of the budget,  which includes the 5-year plan to Congress.", "As previously mentioned, continuing contract authority is used for multiyear funded major  revitalization, which allows for phased funding of projects and allows a project to proceed in a  measured way in partnership with the contractor. This process is also used for new construction such  as the recently completed National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall. The vast majority of  the Smithsonian\u2019s Capital projects are under $1 million in cost, so the need for phased work is only  present in the very largest capital projects. A goal of OFEO, given adequate resources in the Facilities  Planning and Design account, is to have designs funded 2 years in advance of project execution, and  to have at least 35 percent of the design complete prior to final funding decisions.", "Within the recent environment of constrained funding for the capital program, the Smithsonian has  engaged in unprecedented fund-raising for design and construction. Fully one third of the total project  costs of the National Museum of the American Indian on the Mall come from privately raised funds, as  does the entire construction of the National Air and Space Museum\u2019s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center.  This kind of partnership with the private sector will continue to be an important source of support in  the completion of the Patent Office Building revitalization, the overhaul of the major exhibitions halls at  the National Museum of American History, and the future construction of the National Museum of  African American History and Culture.", "Monitoring project performance is the fundamental responsibility of OFEO\u2019s project, design and  construction managers. The requirements for project schedules, cost estimates, milestone  submissions and regular project meetings are outlined fully in the Project Management Handbook. In  addition, on the largest projects, monthly executive meetings with museum directors and the OFEO  director are held, as well as quarterly oversight meetings with the deputy secretary/chief operating  officer and chief financial officer. There are two primary incentives for accountability:  project status is  reported regularly to individuals outside the project authority, as noted above; and, project managers\u2019  performance evaluations are based on qualitative and quantitative execution of their individual capital  programs.", "OFEO project teams consist of a lead project manager, design manager, resident engineer, client  representatives, and contracting specialists and, during design reviews, representatives of the Offices  of Safety and Environmental Management, Protection Services, Facilities Planning and Resources,  Information Technology and others. Also see items II. 4. and IV. 9. above.", "Performance metrics are a monthly feature of project management in OFEO. Measures of overall  capital performance, monthly contract obligations, time and cost growth on the largest projects and  preproject planning are included within the larger program of OFEO performance metrics. The  preproject planning reporting is particularly helpful in measuring customer satisfaction, as it monitors  the team\u2019s alignment on scope throughout the life of the project, while there is still time to do  something about it if disagreements occur.", "Documents such as the Project Management Handbook and the SD-410 are only useful if they are  up-to-date and used. Currently, both documents are being revised. Both revised documents are in the  review process and will be incorporated into OFEO standard practices. External evaluation of OFEO  projects is a useful tool for the largest and most complex projects. Within the past 2 years, the  Smithsonian\u2019s Inspector General\u2019s office has audited three projects and the Smithsonian has adopted  the recommendations made. Also sharing lessons learned outside the organization is a valuable  means of achieving feedback and OFEO staff has participated in events for numerous professional  organizations such as the Federal Facilities Counsel and the Construction Industry Institute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Facility Revitalization and Construction Project Code Assignment Matrix", "paragraphs": ["Catastrophic - Significant projects requiring immediate funding in order to correct severe safety  hazards, active failures, and prevent the loss of facilities.

We visited these facilities because the  Smithsonian identified them as having the most serious problems. The  Garber Center has about 40 buildings, the National Zoological Park has in  excess of 40 buildings and the Smithsonian Environmental Research  Center has in excess of 30 buildings. We interviewed OFEO zone mangers  and building mangers for the facilities we visited, and contacted directors  of other Smithsonian facilities, both local and nationwide, asking them to  identify their problems.", "To determine how the Smithsonian has changed its facilities management  and prioritizes its revitalization, construction, and minor repair and  maintenance programs, we reviewed a variety of documents including the  National Academy of Public Administration\u2019s (NAPA) 2001 report on the  Smithsonian, the facility organizational chart, Facilities Project  Management Handbook, drafts of the Operation and Maintenance  Handbook, Construction Procedural Guidelines, and Cost Management  Guide (for estimating costs), Facility Revitalization and Construction  Project Code Assignment Matrix, the Flow Chart of the Prioritization  Decision-Making Process for Minor Repairs and Maintenance, minutes of  the Capital Planning Board meetings and the Smithsonian Regents  meetings for 2002 through 2004, the National Research Council\u2019s  Committing to the Cost of Ownership: Maintenance and Repair of  Buildings, Federal Facilities Council\u2019s Budgeting for Facilites  Maintenance and Repair Activities and the Construction Industry  Institute Best Practices Guide. We also interviewed the director and chief  of staff of the Office of Facilities Engineering and Operations (OFEO) and  the eight heads of the offices making up OFEO, the staff responsible for  prioritizing both capital projects and minor repair and maintenance, and  the head of the Smithsonian\u2019s Capital Planning Board.", "To determine the cost and status of the Smithsonian\u2019s major (more than $5  million) construction and revitalization projects and minor repair and  maintenance projects, we toured 11 facilities (as previously identified) to  view the Smithsonian\u2019s facility problems; we reviewed the NAPA report,  three Smithsonian Inspector General reports on the construction of the  National Museum of the American Indian, the Patent Office Building, and  the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, the 2006 to 2010 Facility Capital Program  Summary, minutes of the Capital Planning Board meetings and the  Smithsonian Board of Regents meetings for 2002 through 2004, individual  project operational reports, monthly executive reports, contractor progress  reports, facility assessments, and other appropriate reports; and  interviewed the OFEO director, the directors of all OFEO offices, and  project executives and project managers responsible for oversight of  projects. OFEO also provided cost estimates for revitalization and  construction projects and the minor repair and maintenance program. We  assessed the reliability of the estimates by reviewing the processes used to  determine both revitalization and construction estimates, and minor repair  and maintenance estimates. As noted in the main body of this report, most  of the revitalization and construction estimates are \"order-of-magnitude\"  estimates that can vary by plus or minus 30 to 50 percent. Because such  variation is typical for these types of cost estimates and our objective is to  use these figures to provide the estimated costs of the Smithsonian\u2019s  facilities projects, we believe that these data are reliable for the purposes  of our report.", "To determine under what basic authorities the Smithsonian operates its  revitalization, construction, and minor repair and maintenance programs,  and how the Smithsonian uses its federal appropriations and trust monies  to fund these programs, we researched the Smithsonian\u2019s enabling  legislation; the statutes under which it currently operates, including  appropriations acts and numerous statutes authorizing Smithsonian  Institution facilities from the 1950s; congressional budget requests; fiscal  year 2002, 2003, and 2004 audited financial statements and management  letters; and project operational review reports.
