In some metropolitan areas like Portland, Oregon, and Tucson, Arizona, the dominant form of Medicare managed care\u2014the health maintenance organization (HMO)\u2014has enrolled more than 40 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries. By contrast, HMO enrollment in most rural areas, and even in some metropolitan markets, is negligible.", "Although such large disparities are sometimes attributed to areas\u2019 Medicare payment rates for HMOs, studies have identified this as only one of several influences at work. In a recent report prepared at your request, we identified a number of areas where Medicare HMO enrollment was higher despite lower payment rates and others where higher payments had failed to generate enrollment.

We categorized county enrollment as lower, intermediate, or higher, and in a similar manner categorized counties by payment rates. We then placed each county in one of nine categories based on its combination of risk HMO enrollment and payment rate.

Medicare is primarily a federally financed and administered health insurance program, which reimburses fee-for-service providers for each covered service rendered. However, Medicare also offers beneficiaries the option of enrolling in managed care plans\u2014mostly risk contract HMOs. While nearly two-thirds of beneficiaries have access to at least one Medicare HMO that provides service in their zip code areas, only about 10 percent of beneficiaries belong to a Medicare HMO. Most beneficiaries are still enrolled in the traditional fee-for-service program.", "Under Medicare\u2019s initial authority for paying HMOs that provided care to beneficiaries, few HMOs contracted with Medicare. As enacted in 1972, the legislation limited a participating HMO\u2019s profit potential while losses had to be fully absorbed. Consequently, most Medicare HMOs chose to be paid on a cost basis. Facing neither profit nor loss from serving Medicare beneficiaries, cost contract HMOs lacked a strong incentive to reduce unnecessary care and deliver care efficiently.", "Legislation changed Medicare\u2019s payment mechanism in 1982. Since then, HMOs have been able to enter into more attractive risk contracts with HCFA. The HMO receives a fixed monthly capitation payment\u2014the AAPCC rate\u2014for each beneficiary enrolled in exchange for providing all Medicare part A and part B services. The risk to the HMO is that for any particular beneficiary, the cost of care may exceed the prepaid amount.", "Each year, a risk HMO must estimate what it would charge Medicare beneficiaries for Medicare-covered services if they were commercial enrollees. The estimate of the premiums it would charge to provide such services to non-Medicare enrollees is adjusted to reflect the differences in (1) the benefits provided to Medicare enrollees and (2) the use of services by Medicare beneficiaries. This estimate (which includes the normal profit of a for-profit HMO) is used to identify any excess profits the HMO will derive from the Medicare business. The HMO is permitted to retain all profits up to the level earned on its non-Medicare business. If the expected Medicare profit exceeds the estimated profit on its non-Medicare business, the HMO must either return the excess to Medicare or provide additional supplemental benefits or reduced copayments or deductibles to beneficiaries. Virtually all HMOs faced with this choice have opted to provide increased benefits, which Medicare beneficiaries can find very attractive.", "Before an HMO can enter into a risk contract, the law requires it to have at least 5,000 commercial enrollees. An HMO serving primarily rural areas must have at least 1,500 members. In addition, the Medicare law\u2019s \u201c50-50 rule\u201d states that no more than 50 percent of an HMO\u2019s enrollment may be Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.", "Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in a risk HMO face a \u201clock-in\u201d requirement. Once they enroll, they must receive virtually all their health care services through the HMO. If a beneficiary goes outside the HMO for any health care services, neither the HMO nor Medicare is required to pay the cost. Exceptions are made for emergency and similar type care, which can be obtained anywhere in the country, and for which the HMO should pay. A few risk HMOs now offer a \u201cpoint of service\u201d option through which beneficiaries can receive certain services outside the plan\u2019s network of providers but must pay more than for \u201cwithin-plan\u201d services.", "Beneficiaries consider a number of factors when deciding whether to enroll in a Medicare risk HMO, including (1) their familiarity with managed care, (2) their attachment to current health care providers, (3) whether they travel out of the area or live part of the year in another state, and (4) likely out-of-pocket costs in a risk HMO versus the fee-for-service program (plus the cost of a Medigap policy). In a risk HMO, the beneficiary may be charged a fixed monthly premium and a copayment each time a service is used. Depending on the additional benefits a Medicare HMO provides, enrolling may be an alternative to buying Medigap insurance, often at a lower cost to the beneficiary.", "Many employers provide health benefits to retired employees who receive Medicare. Some employers, faced with rising retiree health care costs and new accounting rules, believe they can reduce costs when their Medicare-eligible retirees enroll in risk HMOs. As a result, some employers are providing retirees with incentives to join risk HMOs. They may limit their contribution to just cover the cost of a Medicare risk HMO, thereby causing retirees who do not join an HMO to face increased health care costs. To remain in Medicare\u2019s fee-for-service plan these beneficiaries may have to buy a Medigap policy and pay the difference between the premium and the employer\u2019s contribution.", "About 3.8 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in risk HMOs in August 1996, but enrollment was concentrated primarily in urban areas in the West and in Florida. Only a handful of counties in the East, South, and Midwest had more than 5 percent of their Medicare population enrolled in risk HMOs. (See fig. 1.)

For the most part, the 2,257 counties were mainly rural or sparsely populated and consequently, most had few or no HMOs serving non-Medicare residents.", "Generally, HMOs thrive and exert a stronger presence in counties that are part of metropolitan areas. In the 10 states with the highest percentage of people enrolled in HMOs in 1994, about 92 percent of the population lived in an MSA. Markets need to be of sufficient size to generate an HMO presence in general and a risk HMO program in particular. According to one study, the most remote counties with the smallest populations are not likely to be included in HMO markets. Table 2 compares characteristics of the 10 states with the lowest level of total HMO market share (that is, commercial, Medicaid, and Medicare enrollment) and the 10 states with the highest total HMO market share. The 10 states with the lowest total HMO market shares averaged less than two HMOs each.", "Even if the counties that had lower payment rates and lower enrollments had an HMO present, most lacked a Medicare population of sufficient size to attract an HMO into the risk contract program. Table 3 shows these counties had an average of about 5,600 Medicare beneficiaries. According to officials at several multistate HMO chains we interviewed, one of the factors they consider most when selecting areas of the country in which to pursue the Medicare business is the size of the Medicare population. An official at one company estimated that no more than 20 to 30 percent of the beneficiaries in a new market will join a risk HMO, which suggests that only about 1,100 to 1,700 beneficiaries in each of these counties may join. In addition, officials at multistate HMOs said that they need to enroll at least 10,000 beneficiaries within a few years to spread the risk. In another study, HMO officials said that they do not enroll Medicare beneficiaries in rural areas because the Medicare population is not large enough to cover the fixed costs associated with this coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain Factors Foster Risk HMO Enrollment in Some Areas Despite Lower Payment Rates", "paragraphs": ["In a number of counties where AAPCC payments were relatively low, the rate of Medicare risk HMO enrollment was relatively high, our analysis showed. Risk HMO enrollment flourished because of other factors, including urban settings and stronger HMO presence. Most of these primarily urban counties were in the West, where HMOs have a longer history than in many other parts of the country. The counties in and around the Portland MSA and three other MSAs in Oregon illustrate how factors other than payment rates serve to raise risk HMO enrollment.", "A large number of Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in risk HMOs that serve more urban, lower payment counties. About 400,000 beneficiaries\u2014nearly 18 percent of those eligible\u2014were enrolled in risk HMOs in 92 counties that had lower payment rates (less than $375) and higher enrollment (greater than 5 percent).

The Portland community\u2019s familiarity with HMOs\u2014Kaiser introduced the concept in Portland in the 1940s\u2014is believed to have increased the willingness of beneficiaries to participate in the risk program. Officials of two Oregon risk HMOs with whom we spoke both cited beneficiaries\u2019 familiarity with the HMO concept as the primary reason for the high enrollment rate. Consistent with consumers\u2019 apparently favorable attitude toward HMOs, beneficiaries were willing to enroll in risk HMOs even though most charge a premium.", "Because Portland\u2019s HMOs were well-established for many years, they could participate in the risk program when it began. This early participation has increased beneficiary acceptance of HMOs and allowed more time for enrollment to develop and grow, according to HMO officials we spoke with. Kaiser participated in a Medicare risk demonstration project in 1980 and has been enrolling beneficiaries ever since. Even before 1980, Kaiser enrolled beneficiaries through a cost contract with HCFA. Two other HMOs in the Portland area began to participate in the risk program in the mid-1980s.", "Employers have played a role in fostering Portland\u2019s risk enrollment. About half of Kaiser\u2019s risk HMO enrollees come from employer groups. As employees retire and age into Medicare, they are able to remain covered by Kaiser, the plan through which they may have been receiving their health care coverage for many years. In contrast, PacifiCare, which has about as many risk enrollees as Kaiser, receives only about 5 percent of its enrollment from employer groups.

However, this modest enrollment performance cannot be ascribed to weak HMO presence. Compared with HMOs in some southern MSAs, HMOs in Michigan have generated stronger total enrollment\u2014as high as about 26 percent in Flint and Ann Arbor. While the combination of attractive payment rates, a large potential market, and an active HMO industry are all present, the Medicare risk program has been slow to take root. In these Michigan MSAs, the retiree benefits provided by the automobile industry reduces the attractiveness of risk HMOs and contributes to lower enrollment by Medicare beneficiaries.", "Six of the 33 counties that had lower enrollment in risk HMOs, despite being among the 100 highest payment areas, were in Michigan. All six of these counties were in three MSAs\u2014Ann Arbor, Detroit, and Flint. In addition to being higher payment, urban areas, these three MSAs had a fairly strong HMO presence. Both Ann Arbor and Flint had total HMO enrollment of about 26 percent; in Detroit, enrollment approached 21 percent. While low compared with some areas in the West, this level of total HMO enrollment was considerably higher than in most of the eight southern MSAs that also had higher payment rates and lower enrollment in risk HMOs. Despite the presence of these factors, only about 0.5 percent of the eligible Medicare beneficiaries in the three Michigan MSAs were enrolled in risk HMOs.", "A key factor in the Michigan MSAs, according to HMO officials, is the benefit package available to retired autoworkers and retirees from other firms that patterned their benefit packages on the auto industry\u2019s. These benefit packages provide employer-sponsored comprehensive coverage of health benefits with little or no out-of-pocket payments for the retiree. As officials at the HMOs we interviewed in Detroit confirmed, beneficiaries receiving these benefits have little incentive to switch to risk HMOs.", "Excluding beneficiaries covered by rich benefit packages, the Medicare population in the Michigan MSAs is still relatively large and hence attractive to risk HMOs. Two plans whose officials we spoke with had left the risk program in the late 1980s because they were losing money but now have risk contract applications pending with HCFA and hope to begin enrolling beneficiaries in 1997. The HMOs plan to target Medicare beneficiaries not covered by rich retiree health benefits. One HMO suggested that by the end of 1998 it expects about 30,000 Medicare beneficiaries to be enrolled.

In addition, HMOs have been encouraged by increases in the AAPCC payment rates in some areas. Finally, publicly traded HMO companies, which are especially concerned with short-term profits, are seeking new ways in which to expand and grow.", "Companies\u2019 business strategies for expanding their involvement with the risk HMO program include enlarging existing risk HMO contracts through service area expansions, applying for new risk contracts, and acquiring other HMOs. Officials of one large multistate HMO articulated a strategy of expanding from existing service areas into contiguous areas and contiguous states. While acquisitions were for the most part made to obtain a share of the commercial managed care market, with the decision to start a risk program coming later, some acquisitions were made specifically with the Medicare risk market in mind. For example, PacifiCare Health Systems announced in August 1996 that it would buy FHP International in part to ensure its dominance in the Medicare risk market.", "According to the officials we interviewed at multistate HMOs, their risk HMO expansion efforts targeted markets with certain characteristics. Markets were more attractive if they had a concentrated number of beneficiaries and limited competition for them. To spread the risk, most said that an HMO must have the opportunity to enroll at least 10,000 beneficiaries in a few years. Also, officials at the HMOs said that the payment rate in a market must be high enough for a risk plan to be financially viable. Furthermore, markets must have a concentration of non-Medicare beneficiaries to be attractive because HMOs must have at least 5,000 commercial enrollees to apply for a risk contract. And the more people who are enrolled in the commercial sector of a local market, the easier it is to enroll beneficiaries because of the familiarity with managed care.", "Officials at multistate HMOs had different views of the role that payment rates play in their decisions to move into or out of a market. Officials at one multistate company said that while they consider the AAPCC payment rate when making a decision, a low payment would not automatically disqualify a market. For example, they said they were considering expanding into a low-payment market because an employer group had specifically expressed interest in the risk program in that area. Another company indicated that the payment rate needs to be high enough to adequately pay health care providers. Officials at a third multistate company believed that there were no parts of the country where the payment rate would be too low for them to enter if the large numbers of Medicare beneficiaries needed for the program to be successful were present. Officials at two multistate HMOs held divergent views on the AAPCC rate reduction that would induce their companies to leave the risk HMO program.

For the purposes of our study, we placed the 242 counties that had enrollments of more than 5 percent in the higher enrollment category. Although 5 percent would not be considered high for private sector managed care enrollment, it is high for the Medicare risk program\u2014only about 8 percent of the counties had Medicare risk enrollments of more than 5 percent. We placed the remaining 236 counties in the intermediate category (enrollments greater than 1 percent and less than or equal to 5 percent). For the distribution of the 3,141 counties in the nine categories, see table 1.", "We focused our study on the following three categories: counties that had (1) lower AAPCC rates and lower risk enrollment (2,257 counties), (2) lower AAPCC rates and higher risk enrollment (92 counties), and (3) higher AAPCC rates and lower risk enrollment (33 counties). Using HCFA data, we converted the county data into metropolitan statistical area (MSA) data for the three study categories.", "In addition to analyzing data for the three study categories, we selected three markets in which to perform more detailed work: (1) Portland, Oregon\u2014a market in the lower AAPCC rate and higher enrollment category; (2) Detroit\u2014a market in the higher AAPCC rate and lower enrollment category; and (3) Boston\u2014a market in which risk enrollment grew considerably in a relatively short time. In these markets, we interviewed officials at the applicable HCFA regional offices and at selected HMOs that had entered into or were planning to enter into Medicare risk contracts.", "Finally, we interviewed officials at all 10 HCFA regional offices, 6 national HMO chains, and 12 regional HMOs to obtain more information and get opinions on (1) the Medicare risk program in general, (2) enrollment trends in particular, (3) reasons managed care plans and beneficiaries participate in Medicare risk programs, (4) factors that made the risk market attractive, and (5) factors affecting risk program enrollment. All of the 18 HMOs had risk contracts or were planning to enter into contracts with HCFA. Also, we interviewed representatives from five management consulting firms involved in bringing employers and Medicare risk plans together to cover Medicare-eligible retirees and five employers regarding their efforts to enroll a portion of their retirees in Medicare risk plans.
