Its purpose is to address the urgent housing needs of the federal judiciary, which have arisen due to reported space shortages, security concerns, and operational inefficiencies at courthouses around the country. One of the major criticisms of this construction initiative by us and others has been the lack of a long-term strategic plan that (1) identifies and prioritizes all the judiciary\u2019s most urgently needed courthouse construction projects, (2) helps congressional decisionmakers compare and evaluate the merits of project proposals and priorities, and (3) provides a rationale for allocating resources to the most urgently needed projects.", "In March 1996, the judiciary\u2014with assistance from its administrative arm, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOC)\u2014issued a courthouse construction plan that identifies projects it proposes be funded between fiscal years 1997 and 2001.

To address this problem, the Judicial Conference of the United States directed each of the 94 judicial districts, with assistance from AOC, to develop long-range space plans to determine where new and additional space was needed. To date, AOC has provided each judicial district with planning guidance in developing 5-, 10-, and 30-year space shortage projections. As a result of this process, the judiciary identified approximately 200 locations that would be out of space within the next 10 years and has estimated that funding for new courthouses at these locations would cost approximately $10 billion. In addition to identifying space shortages, these planning efforts also identified security concerns and operational inefficiencies at many of these facilities nationwide.", "The judiciary makes requests for new courthouse projects to GSA, the federal government\u2019s central agency for real property operations. GSA requests funding for courthouses as part of the president\u2019s annual budget request to Congress. Under the Public Buildings Act of 1959, as amended, GSA is required to submit to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works and the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure detailed project descriptions, called prospectuses, that contain project cost estimates and justifications for projects that exceed a prospectus threshold. Under the act, GSA can adjust the prospectus threshold upward or downward based on changes in construction costs during the preceding calendar year\u2014the threshold is $1.74 million for fiscal year 1997. Once projects are funded by Congress, GSA is to contract with private sector firms for design and construction work.", "In the early 1990s, Congress, we, and the private sector began calling on the judiciary and GSA to prioritize projects for this major initiative. In 1990, we began reporting that Congress needed better information for decisionmaking, including a prioritization of capital investment needs. In 1994, the Conference Committee on GSA\u2019s 1995 appropriations act directed that the courthouse construction requirements established by GSA and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) include a prioritization of projects by AOC. A year earlier, the Independent Courts Building Program Panel\u2014which was formed in 1993 by GSA and AOC and comprised leading architects, engineers, and construction professionals\u2014recommended that courthouse projects be prioritized into yearly 5-year plans. More recently, in November 1995, we testified that the process for funding new courthouse projects lacked\u2014and could benefit from\u2014a comprehensive capital investment plan that articulates a rationale or justification for projects and presents projects in a long-term strategic context.Furthermore, during the last 6 years, we have reported that Congress lacks quality information to assess the merits of individual projects, understand the rationale for project priorities, and justify funding decisions.", "In March 1996, the judiciary\u2014through the Judicial Conference of the United States\u2014issued a 5-year plan for courthouse construction for fiscal years 1997 through 2001. The plan, which is intended to communicate the judiciary\u2019s urgent housing needs to Congress and GSA, identifies 45 projects for funding based on information from Congress and GSA that $500 million could be used as a planning target in estimating funds that will be available for courthouse construction each year. Appendix I shows the projects in the plan by fiscal year.", "To determine project urgency, the judiciary developed a methodology for assigning urgency scores to projects. The criteria and related weights applied in assessing urgency include the length of time space shortages have existed as defined by the year a location was or will be out-of-space (30 percent); security concern ratings of 1 through 4 (30 percent), where a 1 indicates the lowest level of security concern; operational inefficiency ratings of 1 through 5 (25 percent), where a 1 indicates minimal operational inefficiencies; and the number of judges affected as defined by the number of judges without courtrooms (15 percent). Under the methodology, each project receives an urgency score on a scale of 100, with a score of 100 indicating the highest level or degree of urgency. Appendix II contains a more detailed description of the judiciary\u2019s urgency score methodology. In addition to the plan, AOC provided us with related material, including a description of the methodology for assessing urgency, an overview of the process used to develop the plan, and urgency scores for the projects in the plan. AOC indicated that it provided the same material to key congressional committees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to determine whether the judiciary\u2019s 5-year plan (1) reflects the judiciary\u2019s most urgent courthouse construction needs and (2) provides information needed by decisionmakers to evaluate the relative merits of project proposals.", "To meet the first objective, we focused on determining whether the plan contains all the most urgently needed projects and if priorities in the plan correlate with the judiciary\u2019s own project urgency scores. In making this assessment, we relied primarily on the urgency scores the judiciary developed for projects in the plan, its methodology for assessing project urgency, and AOC data related to urgency for projects that were not included in the plan. The judiciary\u2019s methodology for assessing urgency appears to include factors that would be important in gauging the relative urgency of competing projects, and the process used to assign scores for each of the four criteria, though subjective, seems straightforward. However, we did not assess the validity of the methodology or the reliability of the urgency scores developed for each location.", "To determine whether the plan contains the most urgently needed projects, we developed minimum urgency scores for 80 locations that were not in the plan but, according to AOC, also need new courthouse projects. AOC provided us with security concern and out-of-space year data for these projects. As previously mentioned, security concern and out-of-space year data each have weights of 30 percent that are applied in developing the urgency score. Operational inefficiencies and the number of judges affected\u2014the two other components of the urgency score\u2014have weights of 25 percent and 15 percent of the score, respectively. Therefore, security concern and out-of-space year data equate to 60 percent of the total urgency scores these projects would receive.", "To calculate minimum scores for these locations, we used the security concern and out-of-space year data and applied the judiciary\u2019s urgency score methodology to these 80 other locations. Because data for operational inefficiencies were not available for these locations, we assigned minimum ratings of \u201c1\u201d to each of the 80 locations. AOC officials told us that, according to the scoring methodology, 1 was the lowest score locations could receive for this criterion. For the fourth factor, number of judges affected, AOC did not have data, and thus we used \u201c0\u201d for this factor in our calculation. Therefore, our minimum scores do not include an assessment of operational conditions at these locations or a calculation for the number of judges affected. If actual scores for these two factors were included, urgency scores for these projects could either increase or remain the same\u2014the scores could not decrease. We then compared these minimum scores to the complete scores assigned to the 45 projects in the 5-year plan and discussed the results with AOC officials. Appendix II contains a more detailed description of the urgency score methodology and our calculation of minimum scores for projects not included in the plan.", "To determine whether priorities in the plan correlate with the project urgency scores the judiciary developed, we compared the urgency scores for the 45 projects in the plan with the yearly sequence of funding priorities specified in the plan for fiscal years 1997 through 2001. We specifically focused on comparing projects that were at similar stages, such as site and design, that are scheduled for funding in different years according to the plan. We also discussed project priorities with AOC and GSA officials to identify other factors that may have been considered in prioritizing projects.", "To meet the second objective, we compared the information in the plan and related material to the types of information decisionmakers need to effectively assess project proposals and funding requests. Our past work specifically identified the types of information decisionmakers need when making decisions on courthouse construction funding. It includes a capital investment plan that prioritizes individual projects and puts them in some long-term strategic context and provides a rationale or justification for priorities set among competing projects.", "In making our comparison, we also considered the results of our work on the first objective because knowing whether the plan reflects the judiciary\u2019s most urgently needed projects has ramifications for the amount of information decisionmakers would need to understand the basis for the plan\u2019s priorities. Also, as mentioned before, the judiciary\u2019s intent in developing the plan was to communicate its urgent courthouse construction needs. In addition, we reviewed congressional reports and testimonies pertaining to capital investment planning. We also considered a 1993 report by a GSA/judiciary-sponsored panel of private sector experts that outlined ways to improve the courthouse construction initiative. We did our work between March and November 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We received written comments on a draft of this report from AOC, which we have included in appendix III. GSA provided oral comments on a draft of this report. We summarize and evaluate AOC\u2019s and GSA\u2019s comments on pages 14 and 15."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "5-Year Plan Does Not Reflect All the Most Urgently Needed Projects", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis showed that the 5-year plan does contain projects with high urgency scores, including 13 projects with scores above 65. However, it also contains others that have scores lower than projects that were not included in the plan. Using the judiciary\u2019s methodology and available data on security and space concerns and assuming the lowest possible scores for operational conditions and number of judges affected, we calculated minimum urgency scores for 80 projects that were not in the plan. Of these, we identified 30 projects that had minimum urgency scores higher than the complete scores for some of the projects in the plan. In fact, according to AOC, 1 of the 30 projects not in the plan would have a complete urgency score that is higher than those for 40 of the 45 projects in the plan.", "In developing the plan, the judiciary did not develop urgency scores for all competing projects. Instead, the judiciary focused on those projects that were in the GSA pipeline or were previously identified during earlier internal efforts to develop project priorities. Using this approach and the assumption that $500 million would be available for projects in each of the 5 years, the judiciary developed scores for 45 projects. AOC officials told us that they were unable to develop scores for other projects not included in the plan in time for the plan\u2019s March 1996 issuance. They added that, based on their general knowledge of conditions at the other locations, they believed these other projects would not have urgency scores as high as the projects in the plan, except for a few cases. However, AOC did not provide any analysis to support these assertions. It said that it intends to develop scores for all the projects for possible inclusion in future versions of the plan.", "Urgency scores and related data were not available for projects not included in the plan when we began our review. However, AOC subsequently provided us with out-of-space year and security concern data it had developed for 80 projects identified for funding consideration in the fiscal years 2002 through 2006 timeframe. These two factors have a total weight of 60 percent that is applied in developing the urgency score. We used these data to apply the judiciary\u2019s methodology for assigning project urgency scores to identify minimum scores for these 80 projects. Data for operational inefficiencies at these locations were not available; therefore, we assigned a minimum rating of 1 to each of the 80 locations. According to the scoring methodology, 1 is the score locations receive when operational inefficiencies are minimal. For the fourth factor, number of judges affected, AOC did not have data, and we used 0 in our calculation, which is the minimum score a location can receive for this factor. As shown in table 1, using these data and the judiciary\u2019s methodology, we calculated that 30 locations have a minimum urgency score of 41.3 or higher, which is higher than the complete scores for 3 projects in the plan\u2014San Diego, CA; San Jose, CA; and Cheyenne, WY.", "In addition to having a minimum score higher than the San Diego, San Jose, and Cheyenne projects, Los Angeles has a minimum score higher than another 16 locations that were included in the plan. Jackson has a minimum score higher than a total of eight projects in the plan. We also noted that the projects in San Diego and San Jose are scheduled to begin receiving the $197 million they are estimated to require in fiscal year 1998, which is 4 years before funding is to be considered for any of the projects in table 1. Appendix II shows our calculations of minimum urgency scores for each of the 80 projects that were not included in the plan.", "It is important to recognize that the minimum score calculations for these 30 locations include a minimum assessment of operational conditions and number of judges affected for these locations, 2 factors that have weights totaling 40 percent that are applied in developing the urgency scores. Although we were unable to determine the extent to which additional data on these other two criteria would increase the urgency scores, our minimum score calculations clearly showed that the 45 projects in the plan do not reflect the 45 most urgent projects according to the judiciary\u2019s methodology.", "The AOC official responsible for developing the plan told us that the actual urgency score for Los Angeles when taking into account all 4 criteria would be somewhere in the 80s. Only 5 of the plan\u2019s 45 projects have scores of 80 or above. The official said that the judiciary is aware of the conditions in Los Angeles and that the project was left out of the 5-year plan until some key planning decisions are made by GSA and the judiciary. The official added that one major obstacle to moving this project up in the plan is its cost, which is estimated at over $200 million. Another obstacle is the unwillingness of certain judicial districts to have their projects pushed back to make room for this project given that the plan assumes only $500 million will be available each year. We recognize that these factors will need to be considered in the funding process. However, not explaining the situation in Los Angeles in the plan seems questionable given the urgency score it would receive and that the objective of the plan was to communicate the judiciary\u2019s urgent needs. Further, the obstacles to including it in the plan provided by AOC seem to be ones in which Congress has a stakeholder interest since it funds the projects and may not be fully aware of the situation in Los Angeles. We did note that the plan recognizes in a footnote that further study is needed to determine how to resolve the need for a project in Los Angeles. However, the plan provides no indication of the forthcoming challenge of funding this large project with limited resources or the severe conditions that exist in Los Angeles.", "For example, Los Angeles has a \u201csevere\u201d security concern rating of 4,which is quite different from the two California locations that are scheduled for funding beginning in 1998. These two locations, San Jose and San Diego, had security concern scores of only 1\u2014the lowest score possible. No other locations, including those in the plan, had security concerns lower than 2.

The first year of the plan, 1997, does contain several projects with high urgency scores, including projects in Brooklyn, NY; Corpus Christi, TX; Cleveland, OH; and Seattle, WA that have scores ranging from 77.5 to 100. However, eight projects identified for site and/or design funding in 1999 had higher urgency scores than seven projects identified for site and/or design funding in 1998.

Furthermore, five projects scheduled for site and/or design funding in 2000 all have urgency scores higher than three of the projects scheduled for site and/or design funding in 1998. These five 2000 projects have scores ranging from 47.9 to 50.8 and are located in Harrisburg, PA; Sioux Falls, SD; Muskogee, OK; Birmingham, AL; and Toledo, OH. Appendix I shows the scores for all these projects as well as for the other projects in the plan.", "AOC officials said that projects in the plan were not prioritized exclusively on the basis of their urgency scores. As previously mentioned, the plan places heavy emphasis on projects that were already in the GSA pipeline. These pipeline projects include projects in the latter stages of the GSA planning process that GSA had already planned to request funding for in 1997 and 1998. The GSA planning process includes assessing needs, estimating costs, and developing prospectuses for congressional review. GSA officials confirmed that projects in the plan for 1997 and 1998 were in the GSA pipeline. They added that for projects identified for 1999 and beyond, GSA was not prepared to request funding any sooner than is specified in the 5-year plan. For example, they had only recently become aware of the urgent need in Richmond and were not prepared to request funds for a project there any earlier than 1999.", "According to AOC officials, the plan is transitional in that it addresses projects already identified for funding by GSA in 1997 and 1998, and then begins addressing urgent projects identified through the judiciary\u2019s new process in 1999 and beyond. According to these officials, these pipeline projects should be funded first because their planning efforts are already under way. We recognize that the process for identifying and funding projects is complex and dynamic and that various factors, including planning decisions already made, total funding available, and the political nature of the process, will influence final decisions. Nonetheless, the judiciary\u2019s plan and its related urgency score methodology have the potential to provide important baseline information to help decisionmakers weigh priorities and make more informed decisions. While we believe that pipeline projects should compete for funding, we also believe that the plan should make a convincing argument as to why these projects should be funded first. As discussed in more detail in the next section, the plan and related material do not (1) provide a rationale or justification for why Congress should fund these pipeline projects first or (2) discuss the consequences of or trade-offs involved in funding projects with low urgency scores that GSA had already planned to request instead of others that have higher scores."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plan Lacks Key Information Decisionmakers Need", "paragraphs": ["The judiciary\u2019s 5-year plan and related materials do not provide all the information needed by decisionmakers to fully assess the relative merits of project proposals.

However, it did not assess other projects that, our work showed, have higher urgency scores than several of the projects in the plan.

Instead, we reviewed the judiciary\u2019s 5-year plan, which serves as input to GSA\u2019s overall planning efforts. To date, through the 5-year plan and related urgency score methodology, the judiciary has begun playing an important role in improving strategic planning for the courthouse construction initiative.
