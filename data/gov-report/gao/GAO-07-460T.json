The Coast Guard used a system-of-systems approach to replace deteriorating assets with a single, integrated package of aircraft, vessels, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The Coast Guard also used a system integrator--which can give the contractor extensive involvement in requirements development, design, and source selection of major system and subsystem subcontractors. The Deepwater program is also a performance-based acquisition, meaning that it is structured around the results to be achieved rather than the manner in which the work is performed. If performance-based acquisitions are not appropriately planned and structured, there is an increased risk that the government may receive products or services that are over cost estimates, delivered late, and of unacceptable quality. GAO's reported concerns and related recommendations in 2004 and in subsequent assessments in 2005 and 2006 have centered onthree main areas: program management, contractor accountability, and cost control through competition. In the area of program management, GAO's prior work has found that Integrated Product Teams--the Coast Guard's primary tool for managing the program and overseeing the contractor--have struggled to carry out their missions effectively. We have ongoing work reviewing Deepwater implementation and contract oversight and will continue to monitor the Coast Guard's implementation of our recommendations. In addition to these management issues, the Coast Guard is facing operational challenges because of performance and design problems with Deepwater patrol boats. Specifically, problems with the conversion of 110-foot patrol boats to 123-foot patrol boats ultimately led the Coast Guard to suspend all normal operations of its converted 123-foot patrol boats on November 30, 2006; the Coast Guard is now exploring options to address the resulting operational gaps. In February 2006, the Coast Guard suspended design work on the Fast Response Cutter (FRC)--which was intended to replace the patrol boats--due to design risks. In moving forward with the FRC acquisition, the Coast Guard will end up with two separate classes of FRCs--an outcome that has resulted in a slippage of the anticipated FRC delivery date."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting me here today to discuss our reviews of the U.S.  Coast Guard\u2019s $24 billion Deepwater program.

Many of these  legacy assets are at or approaching the end of their estimated service lives.   Deepwater is the largest and most complex acquisition project in the  Coast Guard\u2019s history.  The acquisition is scheduled to include the  modernization and replacement of an aging fleet of over 90 cutters and 200  aircraft used for missions that generally occur beyond 50 miles from the  shore.  As originally conceived, Deepwater was designed around  producing aircraft and vessels that would function in the Coast Guard\u2019s  traditional at-sea roles, such as interdicting illicit drug shipments or  rescuing mariners from difficulty at sea.", "After the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, however, these aircraft  and vessels began taking on additional missions related to protection of  ports, waterways, and coastal areas. As a result, the Coast Guard began  revising the Deepwater implementation plan to provide replacement assets  that could better address these added responsibilities. In August 2005, the  Coast Guard issued the revised Deepwater implementation plan detailing  the assets it planned to modify or acquire, along with the proposed cost  sand schedules for doing so. Then, in February 2006, the Coast Guard  again updated its Deepwater plan to align with its fiscal year 2007 budget  submissions.

Through this approach, the Coast Guard hoped to avoid \u201cstovepiping\u201d the acquisition of vessels and aircraft, which  might lead to a situation where they could not operate optimally together.", "Our past work on Deepwater noted that decisions on air assets were made  by one subcontractor, while decisions regarding surface assets were made  by another subcontractor. This approach can lessen the likelihood that a  system-of-systems outcome will be achieved if decisions affecting the  entire program are made without the full consultation of all parties  involved.  Our more recent work on the Fast Response Cutter  (FRC)\u2014 which is discussed in more detail later\u2014indicated that changes in the  design and delivery date for the FRC could affect the operations of the  overall system-of-systems approach. Because the delivery of Deepwater  assets are interdependent within the system-of-systems acquisition  approach, schedule slippages and uncertainties associated with potential  changes in the design and capabilities of the new assets have increased the  risks that the Coast Guard may not meet its expanded homeland security  performance requirements within given budget parameters and milestone  dates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "System Integrator", "paragraphs": ["In June 2002, the Coast Guard awarded the Deepwater contract to  Integrated Coast Guard Systems (ICGS).

For example, we reported in  2004 that the Coast Guard had not adequately communicated to its  operational personnel decisions on how new and old assets would be  integrated and how maintenance responsibilities would be divided  between government and contractor personnel. We also found that the  Coast Guard had not adequately staffed its program management function.  Despite some actions taken to more fully staff the Deepwater program, we  reported that in January 2005 shortfalls remained. While 244 positions  were assigned to the program, only 206 were filled, resulting in a 16  percent vacancy rate.", "One of the key program management concerns we had, and one that is  worth highlighting, is the effectiveness of IPTs.  IPTs are the Coast Guard\u2019s  primary tool for managing the Deepwater program and overseeing the  system integrator.  Our past work has found that IPTs can improve both  the speed and quality of the decision-making process.   They can make  decisions involving significant trade-offs without relying unduly on other  organizations for information or approval.   In our prior work, we studied  successful IPTs in commercial firms and found that effective teams have  (1) expertise to master different facets of product development, (2)  responsibility for day-to-day decisions and product delivery, (3) key  members who are either physically colocated or connected through virtual  means to facilitate team cohesion and the ability to share information, and  (4) control over their membership, with membership changes driven by  each team\u2019s need for different knowledge.", "We identified two elements as essential to determining whether a team is  in fact an IPT: the knowledge and authority needed to recognize problems  and make cross-cutting decisions expeditiously. Knowledge is sufficient  when the team has the right mix of expertise to master the different facets  of product development. Authority is present when the team is responsible  for making both day-to-day decisions and delivering the product. If the  programs are experiencing problems, the teams either did not have the  authority or the right mix of expertise to be considered IPTs. If a team  lacks expertise, it will miss opportunities to recognize potential problems  early; without authority, it can do little about them.", "The Deepwater IPTs\u2014comprised of Coast Guard, ICGS, and subcontractor  employees from Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman\u2014are  responsible for overall program planning and management, asset  integration, and overseeing the delivery of specific Deepwater assets.  We  reported in 2004 that the teams had struggled to effectively carry out their  missions. We identified four major issues that had impeded the effective  performance of the IPTs.", "First, the teams lacked timely charters to vest them with authority for  decision making. More than merely a paperwork exercise, sound IPT  charters are critical because they detail each team\u2019s purpose,  membership, performance goals, authority, responsibility,  accountability, and relationships with other groups, resources, and  schedules.", "GAO, Best Practices: DOD Teaming Practices Not Achieving Potential Results,  GAO-01-510 (Washington, D.C.: April 10, 2001). program officials referred to IPT training as deficient. IPT training is to  address, among other issues, developing team goals and objectives, key  processes, use of a Web-based system intended to facilitate  communication, and team rules of behavior. According to a Coast  Guard evaluation report from December 2002, IPT training had been  implemented late, which contributed to a lack of effective  collaboration among team members.", "Third, very few of the operating IPTs were entirely colocated, (that is,  all members were not in the same building) even though the Coast  Guard\u2019s Deepwater program management plan identified colocation of  IPT members as a key program success factor, along with effective  communications within and among teams.  ICGS developed a Web- based system for government and contractor employees to regularly  access and update technical delivery task order   information, training materials, and other program information, in part to mitigate the  challenges of having team members in multiple locations. However, the  Deepwater program executive officer reported that, while the system  had great potential, it was a long way from becoming the virtual  enterprise and collaborative environment required by the contractor\u2019s  statement of work.", "Fourth, we reported that most of the Deepwater IPTs had experienced  membership turnover and staffing difficulties, resulting in a loss of  team knowledge, overbooked schedules, and crisis management. In a  few instances, such as the national security cutter and maritime patrol  aircraft, even the IPT leadership had changed.", "In 2005, we found that the Coast Guard had taken some positive steps in  that (1) the IPTs had been restructured, (2) 20 IPTs had charters setting  forth their purpose, authority, and performance goals, and (3) entry-level  training had been implemented for team members.  However, some of the  problems continued.  A Coast Guard assessment of the system integrator\u2019s  performance found that roles and responsibilities in some teams  continued to be unclear.  Decision making was to a large extent stove- piped, and some teams lacked adequate authority to make decisions  within their realm of responsibility.  One source of difficulty for some team  members was that each of the two major subcontractors has used its own  management systems and processes to manage different segments of the  program.", "In 2005, we also noted that decisions on air assets were made by Lockheed  Martin, while decisions regarding surface assets were made by Northrop  Grumman. We reported that this approach can lessen the likelihood that a  system-of-systems outcome will be achieved if decisions affecting the  entire program are made without the full consultation of all parties  involved. In 2006, we reported that Coast Guard officials believed  collaboration among the subcontractors to be problematic and that ICGS  wielded little influence to compel decisions among them. For example,  when dealing with proposed design changes to assets under construction,  ICGS submitted the changes as two separate proposals from both  subcontractors rather than coordinating the separate proposals into one  coherent plan. According to Coast Guard performance monitors, this  approach complicates the government review of design changes because  the two proposals often carried overlapping work items, thereby forcing  the Coast Guard to act as the system integrator in those situations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contractor Accountability", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, we also made recommendations related to contractor  accountability. We found that the Coast Guard had not developed  quantifiable metrics to hold the system integrator accountable for its  ongoing performance and that the process by which the Coast Guard  assessed performance after the first year of the contract lacked rigor. For  example, the first annual award fee determination was based largely on  unsupported calculations. Despite documented problems in schedule,  performance, cost control, and contract administration throughout the  first year, the program executive officer awarded the contractor an overall  rating of 87 percent, which fell in the \u201cvery good\u201d range. This rating  resulted in an award fee of $4.0 million of the maximum of $4.6 million.", "We also reported in 2004 that the Coast Guard had not begun to measure  the system integrator\u2019s performance on the three overarching goals of the  Deepwater program\u2014maximizing operational effectiveness, minimizing  total ownership costs, and satisfying the customers.
