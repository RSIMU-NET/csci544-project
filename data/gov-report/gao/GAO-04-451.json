The three areas covered OSDBU  functions listed in section 15(k) of the Small Business Act as well as  functions mentioned by OSDBU directors during our preliminary  interviews with them.

The aim of the  plan was to eliminate unnecessary contracting bundling and to mitigate the  effects of necessary contract bundling. Under the plan, OSDBUs were to be  required to conduct periodic reviews and submit their assessments to  OMB.

We received technical comments from DOD, DOT, NASA,  and SBA, which we incorporated as appropriate. DOD also commented that  the draft did not accurately reflect responses attributed to the Navy  OSDBU director. Our draft report stated that the director did not view three  of the section 15(k) duties we asked about\u2014working with agency  acquisition officials to revise procurement strategies for bundled contract  requirements, attempting to identify solicitations that involve bundling  contract requirements, and assisting small businesses to obtain payments  from agencies\u2014as responsibilities of her office. According to the  comments received from DOD\u2019s OSDBU director, Navy\u2019s OSDBU director is  ultimately responsible for carrying out these duties (1) if Navy\u2019s small  business specialists are unable to reach a mutually agreeable solution when  working with agency officials to revise procurement strategies for a  bundled contract and identify solicitations that involve contract bundling  requirements and (2) when the buying command or contract administration  office has not been able to resolve matters regarding payments.", "We do not take exception with DOD\u2019s statement that Navy\u2019s OSDBU  director is ultimately responsible for these three duties if the matters have  not been resolved by other agency officials. However, we believe the Navy  OSDBU director\u2019s responses are accurately reflected in this report. In both  the questionnaire and follow-up interview, Navy\u2019s OSDBU director stated  that she did not view the three functions as her duties.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly release its contents earlier,  we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issuance  date.
