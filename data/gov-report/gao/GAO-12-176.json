IRS officials expect the benefits of the amended return line to exceed the costs, but have not studied the costs and benefits of adding a TAC/VITA locator line.", "The use of IRS's website is growing, particularly the number of searches, which IRS officials attribute, in part, to taxpayers having difficulties locating information. Having an easily searchable website is important for IRS because it reduces costly phone calls. IRS has begun spending a planned $320 million on its website over 10 years. However, IRS's initial strategy for providing new self-service tools online does not include allowing taxpayers to access account information and is missing fundamental elements, including a justification for new services and time frames.

For example, IRS is replacing the legacy Individual Master File (IMF) and current  Customer Account Data Engine (CADE) systems that it uses to  process individual income tax returns with CADE 2. IRS plans to  implement its CADE 2 program in three phases beginning in 2012.  The first phase includes two projects: (1) processing tax returns daily,  rather than weekly, using the IMF (known as IMF daily); and (2)  implementing the CADE 2 database. IRS is also replacing its legacy e-filing system with the Modernized e- File (MeF) system, and it plans to retire the legacy e-file system in  October 2012. IRS cannot accept electronically filed returns directly  from taxpayers. Rather, IRS authorizes e-file providers, such as large  tax preparation firms, to transmit returns to IRS electronically using  either the legacy e-file or MeF system. The benefits of MeF include  accepting or rejecting individual tax returns faster, providing a clearer  explanation of why a return was rejected, and accepting prior-year  returns. The system also allows taxpayers to attach portable  document format (PDF) files to their tax returns (the legacy e-filing  system cannot accept additional documentation, requiring such  returns to be submitted on paper).", "Last year we reported that IRS has been taking actions to improve its  website by identifying steps to enhance taxpayer service.effort, IRS plans to spend $320 million to upgrade and maintain its  website over the next 10 years.

RACs  are a refund delivery option where refunds are directly deposited into a  temporary bank account set up by a financial institution or tax preparer on  behalf of the taxpayer. The tax return preparation fee, along with other  fees, is generally withheld from the refund and the remaining funds are  available to the taxpayer. RALs are short-term, high-interest-rate bank  loans that allow taxpayers to get their refunds faster and also allow  taxpayers to pay return preparation and other fees out of their refunds.

Since 2009, IRS has worked with partner organizations at VITA/TCE sites  to encourage taxpayers not requesting a direct deposit of their refund to  opt to receive it on a debit card sponsored by a participating financial  institution. Last year we reported that less than 3 percent of eligible  taxpayers at VITA/TCE sites elected to receive refunds on debit cards.  Separately, in 2011, Treasury launched a pilot program offering about  800,000 low-income taxpayers tax refunds on debit cards. Although  targeting the same demographic group, the VITA site offers are made in  person and the Treasury offer was made through the mail.

According to IRS, in fiscal  year 2010, it cost 17 cents to process an e-filed return and $3.66 for  returns filed on paper. IRS officials and representatives from major tax  preparation firms attributed the increase in the e-file rate to factors  including the e-filing requirement for paid preparers and the fact that IRS  did not mail out hard-copy tax forms to taxpayers.the states also have e-file mandates, which may also encourage  taxpayers to e-file federal returns.

IRS last made significant changes to the refund  timeliness measure in 2003. Since that time IRS has made important  changes to facilitate faster refund processing. For example, the number of  e-filed returns has more than doubled, IRS implemented new systems  including current CADE, and, in 2012, IMF daily processing should allow  IRS to issue refunds within 4 business days for direct deposit and 6  business days for paper checks after it processes the return and posts  the return data to the taxpayer\u2019s account. As a result, the goal of issuing  97 percent of refunds within the 40 days for paper returns does not give  IRS a meaningful indicator of how quickly it is disbursing refunds.", "According to IRS officials, the refund timeliness goal captures the  percentage of refunds issued for returns filed on paper within 40 days,  which is 5 days before IRS generally must begin paying interest on the  refund. However, as we previously reported, performance measures and  goals should provide useful information for decision-making to track how  programs can contribute to attaining the organization\u2019s goals and  mission. We have also stressed that agencies need to consider differing  needs of various stakeholders, including Congress, to ensure that  performance information will be both useful and used. IRS has a variety  of options for updating its refund timeliness measure. For example, more  meaningful measures could include identifying the percentage of refunds  issued during given periods (such as the percentage of refunds issued in  10 or 20 days) or creating separate measures for returns filed on paper  and returns filed electronically. Doing so would not preclude IRS from  continuing to meet its requirement of reporting the percentage of refunds  for returns filed on paper issued within 40 days.

Over the same years, as table 2 shows,  taxpayers\u2019 ability to gain access to CSRs, IRS\u2019s live telephone assistors,  deteriorated. In 2011, 72 percent of taxpayers seeking live telephone  assistance got through to a CSR, compared to 81 percent in 2007. The  deterioration in access is also reflected in the length of time taxpayers  must wait before speaking to a CSR. In 2011, average wait time was  almost 12 minutes; in 2007 it was less than 5 minutes. IRS officials  attribute the higher call volume over the years to a number of factors  including tax law changes made very late in the year that generated a lot  of taxpayer questions  Table 2 also shows that, as performance declined, IRS reduced its goals  for access to CSRs and increased its goal for telephone wait time.  Despite less chance of getting through to CSRs and longer wait times,  this year IRS met its goal for providing live assistance and almost met it  for wait time. IRS sets its telephone performance goals based on the  expected volume and complexity of calls (complexity affects the time  required to respond to a taxpayer), resource availability, and the  anticipated volume of paper correspondence that CSRs handle. Even  though IRS has reduced its goals for phone service, the number of full- time equivalents (FTE) dedicated to answering the phones has actually  increased from about 8,000 in fiscal year 2007 to about 8,800 in fiscal  year 2011.", "A positive aspect of IRS\u2019s telephone service in 2011 was the accuracy of  CSRs answers. As shown in table 2, IRS\u2019s accuracy rate estimates for  CSR answered calls remained well over 90 percent.

IRS also attributes the high accuracy rate to the  use of contact analytics\u2014a tool used to identify reasons why taxpayers  call IRS and evaluate how CSRs interact with taxpayers.", "Key to improving telephone access, given the high volume of taxpayers  calling the IRS and resource constraints, is shifting as many calls as  appropriate to self-service tools, such as interactive automated telephone  lines or the IRS website. Providing automated answers to taxpayer  questions reduces the demand to speak to a CSR and also reduces IRS\u2019s  costs.

For example, most tax preparers we  observed charge a flat fee of about $30 to $35 for setting up a RAC  account. Tax preparers may also charge an additional fee for issuing a  paper check and taxpayers may incur fees when using debit cards  supplied by tax preparers. In addition, preparers charge standard fees for  tax preparation, including for document preparation and e-filing.  Taxpayers may also incur other fees not charged by the preparer, such  as check-cashing fees.", "Despite the fact that many taxpayers still need to pay for tax preparation  services out of their refunds, the fees associated with RACs and the  concerns noted above raise questions about whether taxpayers  understand the benefits and all the fees of RACs.
