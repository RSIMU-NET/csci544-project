User fee collections have grown steadily since the early 1980s and have played several roles in the federal budget.

Here, legislation requires that collections be credited to an appropriation or fund account and offset spending in the account without further legislative action.

However, offsetting collections to appropriation or fund accounts are not limited to business-like or self-supporting activities.", "Offsetting receipts are required by law to be deposited into receipt accounts. Additional congressional action is necessary to move these into, most often, special or trust fund expenditure accounts.

Replacement of general fund appropriations can also be seen in that most increases in user fees enacted between fiscal years 1991 and 1996 were designated as discretionary spending for BEA purposes.

In fiscal year 1991, FTC received 18 percent of its new budget authority from user charges. With the 1993 fee increases, this grew to 69 percent by fiscal year 1996. In fiscal year 1991, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) received 19 percent of its new budget authority from user charges.

This increase was largely a function of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, which extended the collection of Customs Service user fees through September 2003, increased air and sea passenger collections, and lifted air and sea passenger country exemptions through September 1997. In fiscal year 1991, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) received less than 9 percent of its new budgetary authority from user fees. APHIS\u2019 revenues increased primarily because four programs previously funded with appropriations were converted to user fee funding between fiscal years 1991 and 1993. As a result, by fiscal year 1996 APHIS received 31 percent of new budget authority from user fees.

For example, some agricultural inspection fees were netted against their accounts\u2019 budget authority and outlays, which reduced spending counted against BEA discretionary spending limits. Other agricultural fees were appropriated as new budget authority and were counted as discretionary spending. While these fees offset spending, they do so at the department and subfunction levels.

This treatment was typical for agencies that conduct business-type operations and are largely self-supporting through the exchange of fees for goods or services. Most of these agencies are authorized to use these collections without further congressional action. In some cases, this reflects the belief that an agency\u2014such as the Postal Service\u2014might not be able to respond quickly to its customers if it were required to go through the appropriations process. In other cases, the amount collected is too insignificant or unpredictable to be separately appropriated and, instead, is included in a general operating account. Of these 18 agencies, 12 were funded entirely, or mostly so, through public enterprise funds.

Collections credited to a general fund expenditure account may be broad-based and cover the agency\u2019s operations as well as specific fee activities. Where the definition of costs charged to users was broadened to include indirect costs, this can mean that the agency is entirely supported by fees. For instance, PTO is fully funded through fees. Of PTO\u2019s $631 million in new budget authority for fiscal year 1996, $82 million was appropriated from a special fund and $549 million from spending authority from offsetting collections. In other cases, fees may supplement an agency\u2019s general fund appropriation. In fiscal year 1996, the Southwestern Power Administration\u2019s operations and maintenance account was funded primarily through $30 million in current appropriations from general revenues, but received an additional $3 million in collections.", "Although there are exceptions, figure 1 outlines the ways collections are generally credited to appropriation or fund accounts in the budget process, differences in BEA spending categories among these collections, and subsequent BEA scoring treatment. As shown in figure 1, collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts may either (1) offset discretionary spending at the account level or (2) be treated as negative direct spending, which has no effect on discretionary spending limits. As noted above, collections credited to discretionary appropriation or fund accounts are netted against account budget authority and outlays. For example, of the $100 million in new budget authority available to FTC in fiscal year 1996, only $35 million in its Salaries and Expenses account counted towards BEA budget authority limits. The remaining $65 million from offsetting collections was not scored.", "In a number of instances, the Congress has authorized agencies to obligate collections for program purposes without further congressional action, a form of permanent budget authority. Although fees credited directly to revolving funds are by definition available for the agency\u2019s use, this does not make program size solely a function of fee collections. The Congress can limit the amount available to an agency, typically through provisions in appropriation acts. Nearly a third of the agencies in our study with one or more revolving funds had a limitation on obligations between fiscal years 1991 and 1996.

As is the case for collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts, offsetting receipts also may be classified as either discretionary or mandatory spending under BEA. If offsetting receipts are classified as discretionary, they may (1) offset discretionary spending at the agency (executive department or independent agency) and subfunction level or (2) be used, in the case of some regulatory agencies, to reimburse general or special fund appropriations similar to collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts.

If the amount of fees collected exceeds the amount appropriated, then the excess fees are held in special or trust receipt accounts to be made available in subsequent years or deposited in the general fund of the Treasury. Typically, fees that are permanently appropriated are not for a fixed or definite amount; instead, the program retains for obligation whatever fees it generates. In contrast, fees that are currently appropriated are more likely to be for a specific amount.", "Increasingly, fees generated by some regulatory agencies are used to reimburse or reduce amounts appropriated to an agency. Agencies with this authority fund their activities either through (1) general or special fund appropriations, which their legal authority directs be reduced as fees are collected or (2) fees appropriated to special fund expenditure accounts that are then used to offset spending in another account, such as the agency\u2019s main operating account.

Still others maintain that the merits of a program\u2014not its ability to generate fees\u2014should influence funding decisions and program size, particularly in the context of continuing reductions in overall discretionary spending.

For example, dependence on fees may cause these programs to become more vulnerable to cyclical swings in demand and fee income.

Where the Congress and fee payers agree on priorities, there may be no conflict between oversight and accountability to the Congress and accountability to fee payers.

Moreover, few agencies provide purely business-type services.

Agencies will be faced with the inequities, real or perceived, that different funding sources may create. In addition to any perceived funding imbalances between fee and appropriations supported programs, management challenges can arise from differences in their funding status.

Collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts were counted as mandatory receipts (because they had permanent spending authority), and, at the same time, were netted against discretionary spending according to budget concept rules. Although this correction did not change the impact of collections credited to appropriation or fund accounts on discretionary spending, it means that if discretionary spending were ever to exceed the annual caps, all discretionary resources, including these offsetting collections, would be subject to sequestration.
