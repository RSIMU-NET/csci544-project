In that review, GAO identified 47 E&T programs and found that 44 had overlap with at least one other program in that they provided similar services to a similar population. In fiscal year 2017, the most recent year data are available, GAO identified 43 E&T programs, or 4 fewer than in 2011 (see figure). From fiscal year 2009 to 2017, federal agencies' annual obligations for E&T programs decreased from about $20 billion to $14 billion. GAO analysis of survey data found the decrease in obligations was largely due to the expiration of funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, which had provided additional funding for selected E&T programs during and after the Great Recession.", "Survey results from federal administrators of the 43 E&T programs show that the programs continue to span nine agencies and generally overlap by providing similar services, such as employment counseling and assessment services (39 of 43) and job readiness training (38 of 43). Further, programs targeting a specific population, such as Native Americans, veterans, or youth, also provided similar services. In some cases, such overlap may be appropriate or beneficial, but it may also suggest opportunities for greater efficiency.", "Almost all (38 of 43) E&T programs reported at least one action to manage fragmentation or overlap, such as co-locating services and sharing information. However, the agencies were not able to consistently provide information on the results of these actions and few evaluations encompassed multiple programs. Among studies GAO identified, six examined more than one E&T program, but only one assessed how any coordinated activities benefited the population served. None of the six studies focused on Native Americans, youth, or refugees. The Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act (WIOA) encourages agencies to conduct evaluations, and specifically requires the Department of Labor (DOL) to publish a 5-year plan describing certain E&T priorities, consistent with the purpose of aligning and coordinating certain programs. While DOL reported it took some steps, it continues to lack a strategic plan for E&T evaluations over a multi-year period. As a result, DOL does not know whether actions to manage overlap are successful."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL, in consultation with other federal agencies, develop and publish a multi-year strategic plan for its evaluations of employment and training that includes assessing the completeness and results of efforts to coordinate among E&T programs.

The most recent report, issued in January 2011,  identified 47 programs administered by nine federal agencies.

We updated that list by (1)  interviewing federal agency officials; (2) searching program objectives in  the CFDA to confirm that programs previously identified still met our  criteria for inclusion and to identify any additional programs that met our  criteria; and (3) reviewing other GAO reports published since 2011 that  provided a more in-depth review of specific types of E&T programs. In  any such analysis, the number of programs identified is likely to vary with  the definition used, and applying any definition can require subjective  judgment.", "To address our second objective, to identify areas of overlap among E&T  programs, we reviewed beneficiary eligibility requirements listed in the  CFDA and confirmed by agencies to categorize programs by targeted  population served, and compared the categories of services the programs  reported providing in our survey.

Officials from four of these programs reported that no  action was necessary because their program offered a unique service or  served a specialized population.

In addition, while unique aspects may be  protective to some extent against the risk of duplication, unique features  may not necessarily reduce the risk of overlap or need for coordination.  For example, DOD officials stated that apart from its Job Training,  Employment Skills Training, Apprenticeships, and Internships program,  they were not aware of any other federal program that allows  servicemembers to participate in job training, including apprenticeships  and internships, beginning up to 6 months before their service obligation  is completed. DOL officials confirmed that its Transition Assistance Program does not offer job training to service members, but it does, like  the DOD program, offer pre-separation employment services and  counseling.

DOL  officials said that they perform some research covering multiple programs  in preparation for conducting program impact or effectiveness studies, but  that the related findings tend to be more descriptive in nature. They also  cited plans to use common measures developed under WIOA to look at  outcomes across the core programs.", "Some agencies have sponsored studies that focus on populations served  by multiple programs, including customer experience with receiving  services from multiple programs, and an early snapshot of the extent of  state-level coordination in implementing WIOA. Specific examples of  studies that reviewed issues related to implementing multiple programs  include:", "A 2015 Mathematica study funded by HHS of WIOA-funded programs  that included numerous efforts state level administrators could  undertake to improve coordination among the programs, including  exchanging more information on strategies and methods used by  each program to address obstacles that impede coordination.", "A 2015 Rand Corporation study funded by DOD that examined  employment support programs for reservists and recommended  assessing the costs and benefits of streamlining the current program  line-up to reduce any redundancies.", "A 2017 study by IMPAQ International funded by DOL that identified  areas where customer service in WIOA job centers could be  improved, such as streamlining enrollment and registration  procedures and providing more information about the full array of  services at the centers.", "However, of the six completed studies we identified that examined more  than one E&T program, only one study assessed how any coordinated or  integrated activities benefited the population served. We found no  similar studies conducted on the effects of multiple programs targeted  toward other populations, such as Native Americans, youth, or refugees.  VA officials told us that it is important that reviews of E&T programs for  specific population take into account the complex needs of that population  to understand when there is a need for involvement of multiple programs.  For example, officials said that special populations such as homeless  veterans require a breadth of unique services that may not available  through a single program or by programs serving the general population.  Further, as programs more commonly work together, learning about the  programs\u2019 collective impact may be as important as studying the  programs\u2019 individual results.", "DOL officials told us that DOL, HHS, and Education tend to independently  create their evaluation plans for employment and training services. After  WIOA was enacted, these agencies formed the WIOA Evaluation  Workgroup with the intent of establishing greater collaboration among federal agencies on E&T program evaluation. DOL E&T programs make  up over a third of all federal E&T programs, and some of these programs  under WIOA coordinate or align their services with programs  administered by other agencies. DOL officials told us WIOA Evaluation  Workgroup members interacted with staff from other agencies, such as  USDA, who administered E&T programs to encourage their participation.  The workgroup met for the first time in September 2017. After the initial  meeting, according to DOL officials, the agencies dissolved the group  because they concluded that the topic of WIOA-related evaluation could  be covered through existing periodic interagency meetings. However,  DOL officials told us that these efforts do not focus on evaluation across  programs. In addition, the DOL agency-wide evaluation plan for fiscal  year 2018\u2014issued in September 2018\u2014does not list evaluations focused  primarily on cross-program coordination or collaboration, nor does it  address potential overlap and fragmentation among its E&T services.", "Since 2013, DOL has not published a 5-year strategic research plan for  E&T programs. In our 2011 review of DOL\u2019s research and evaluation  program for its E&T programs, we recommended that DOL develop a  mechanism to enhance the transparency and accountability of its E&T  research by consulting other key federal agencies and involving advisory  bodies or other entities outside DOL. In 2010, the Employment and  Training Administration (ETA), the division with lead responsibility for  DOL\u2019s E&T programs, began a series of meetings with a panel of outside  experts to develop a 5-year research plan. This strategic research plan  set the research agenda for E&T programs by identifying and prioritizing  what research and evaluations would be initiated over the following 5  years. Before finalizing its research agenda, DOL obtained broad input  from federal officials at Education and HHS and a range of other key  stakeholders, such as officials in local and state government and  academics from the workforce community. In May 2013, DOL submitted  to Congress and posted on its website a 5-year strategic research plan  for its E&T programs which covered program years 2012 to 2017.", "In contrast to the broad consultation and public exposure that  characterized past strategic planning for E&T research, in recent years  DOL has instead relied on an internal process to set its research and  evaluation priorities for its E&T programs and publishes only an agency- wide evaluation plan that is shorter-term and developed for a different  purpose. Specifically, ETA develops an annual learning agenda that  officials indicated highlights its research priorities, ideas, and proposed  studies. Officials stated that the E&T learning agenda is provided for  consideration with other agency-wide agendas in developing an annual  evaluation plan for all of DOL. While DOL\u2019s annual evaluation plan and  the results of its evaluations are posted publicly through its website and  submitted to the relevant congressional committees, the learning  agendas, including those for E&T programs, are internal documents, and  DOL does not release them to the public.", "The DOL-wide evaluation plan that is published presents neither a  strategy for E&T evaluation nor plans for any evaluation to be initiated  more than a year in the future. The fiscal year 2018 DOL-wide evaluation  plan discusses only research to be initiated during the next year (fiscal  year 2019) and lists studies that remain in progress from previous years.  Rather than project longer-term research needs, the plan\u2019s main purpose,  according to DOL officials, is to comply with specific appropriations  language. DOL officials told us that the list of proposed studies in the  learning agendas may not ultimately appear in the annual evaluation plan because they are not near-term priorities for the agency-wide plan. DOL\u2019s  fiscal year 2018 agency-wide plan describes initiation of four studies\u2014two  on apprenticeship, one on strategies to prevent improper unemployment  insurance payments, and another on potential effects of application fees  for certain ETA programs.", "WIOA requires that DOL publish a plan every 2 years that describes \u201cthe  research, studies, and multistate project priorities of the Department of  Labor concerning employment and training for the 5-year period following  the submission of the plan.\u201d DOL officials told us that it is complying with  this requirement by providing ETA\u2019s annual learning agendas to be  included in DOL\u2019s overall evaluation plan. However, the resulting agency- wide plan falls short of meeting best practices for robust strategic  planning. As we have previously reported, these practices include:", "Preparing annual and multiyear evaluation plans and updating these  plans annually to take into account the need for evaluation results to  inform program budgeting, reauthorization, agency strategic plans,  program management, and responses to critical issues concerning  program effectiveness.", "Including an appropriate mix of short- and long-term studies to  produce results for short- or long-term policy or management  decisions.", "Developing plans in consultation with program stakeholders to help  agencies ensure that their efforts and resources are targeted at the  highest priorities and to create a basic understanding among the  stakeholders of the competing demands that confront most  agencies.", "A 2010 internal DOL memo stated that such a plan can guide the  development of research and evaluation projects and be a valuable tool  for the broader workforce research community. Furthermore, leading  organizations, including the American Evaluation Association and the  National Academy of Sciences, emphasize the need for research  programs to establish specific policies and procedures to guide research  activities. For example, a 2016 American Evaluation Association guide  stated that having annual and multi-year evaluation plans is useful in  guiding program decision-making in such areas as program management  and budgeting, and responding to issues concerning program  effectiveness. Finally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government state more broadly that program managers may need to  conduct periodic assessments to evaluate the effectiveness of their  actions. These may include but are not limited to formal evaluations.  However, without a long-term evaluation plan developed in consultation  with key stakeholders, DOL may not learn whether its actions to improve  E&T program coordination and integration are working, and thus may  continue undertaking activities that are not leading to desired results."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With the enactment of WIOA in 2014, steps were taken toward aligning  employment and training programs and ensuring greater cross-agency  coordination.

However, without knowing whether  these actions are working to improve program coordination and  integration, agencies may persist in activities that are ineffective, fail to  expand those that work, or ignore unintended consequences. Further, the  lack of evaluation focused on program coordination has resulted in a void  of information on programs\u2019 collective impact.

In addition to these methods, we reviewed relevant  federal guidance and other program documents; and interviewed federal  agency officials at headquarters offices. The focus of this review was how  employment and training services are coordinated among programs  specifically designed to deliver such services. As such, our scope  excluded some programs that offer or finance employment and training  services, but for which this is not a program objective (for example,  student loan programs, which focus primarily on enhancing access to  postsecondary education).

After administering our survey, we excluded DOD\u2019s Troops to  Teachers Program because the program generally focused on teacher  quality rather than E&T services. We also excluded DOD\u2019s Hiring Heroes  Program because DOD officials told us the program does not receive a  specific appropriation and is a small program that is part of DOD\u2019s larger  effort to encourage the employment of servicemembers and veterans.
