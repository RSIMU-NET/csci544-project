Results of the 2013 annual assessment show that centers achieved an average score of about 92 out of 100, which generally indicates that centers have policies and procedures in place to implement key information sharing activities. The scores do not reflect if these activities have resulted in specific homeland security impacts. All 10 fusion center directors GAO contacted said that the annual assessment is a useful tool to identify capabilities and monitor progress.", "Since 2004, the federal government has issued guidance and related documents that define its expectations and key roles for fusion centers and also has taken steps to assess their contributions to homeland security. For example, DHS has developed 45 performance measures to help assess fusion center contributions, which generally align with attributes of successful measures. The measures include outputs\u2014such as the number of intelligence products\u2014and outcomes, such as how products have influenced key partners' security decisions.", "In 2013, federal agencies deployed a total of 288 personnel to fusion centers. The two agencies that provide the most support\u2014DHS's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)\u2014have developed nationwide guidance to help these agencies make fusion center support decisions and generally identified key roles and responsibilities for personnel deployed to centers. Other DHS components, including U.S. Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, have not developed such guidance and generally defer to field-level management to make deployment decisions.

Specifically, in fiscal year 2011, the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA)\u2014the lead DHS agency responsible for grant funding\u2014began to require that grant requests for fusion centers identify specific capabilities that proposed projects are to address. FEMA also requires that state grantees biannually report the amount of federal funds spent on fusion center projects. However, after further review of data provided to GAO, FEMA determined that states inaccurately categorized about $60 million in projects as related to fusion centers in 2012. Thus, FEMA could not reliably report on the amount of federal grants used to support centers, which is needed to help inform future investment decisions. FEMA is developing guidance to help grantees better categorize fusion center projects and improve the reliability of grant reporting, but an additional mechanism to verify that states act in accordance with the guidance could help FEMA ensure that projects are properly classified and more accurately account for grant funding provided to centers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FEMA develop a mechanism to verify that states act in accordance with proposed guidance, when implemented, to help ensure that data on fusion center projects are sufficiently accurate to provide a reliable accounting of the total amount of federal grant funding provided to centers.

That is, the assessment questions are intended to capture the extent to  which each fusion center\u2014regardless of size or staffing level\u2014has met  baseline capabilities to receive, analyze, gather, and disseminate  information. However, the actual output of products and services can vary  considerably by center based on risk environment, resource levels, or  other factors. For example, 11 individual attributes constitute the  \u201canalyze\u201d capability, and represent a broad range of activities, such as  having developed an analytical production plan, the ability to access  subject matter experts, and being able to contribute to local and national  threat assessments. A center may report the successful completion of  such activities and improve its overall assessment scores, but the scores  do not reflect if the center effectively administered these activities or if  they resulted in any considerable impact. For example, developing an  analytical production plan may not equate to effectively meeting the plan\u2019s  targets or producing the types of reports identified therein. This highlights  the importance of further validating these capabilities through other  mechanisms, such as the Fusion Center Readiness Initiative and targeted  performance metrics, which we discuss later in the report. Nevertheless,  the annual assessment process reflects a mechanism for systematically  assessing existing baseline capabilities and gaps, and provides fusion  centers an indicator of their progress in achieving baseline capabilities.

In general, the directors we  spoke with stated that the administrative requirements for completing the  assessment were reasonable and that center staff could generally  complete these steps in a few days. In addition to assessing capabilities  and related gaps, 2 directors noted that the assessment can serve as an  effective mechanism to familiarize a new director with the center, given  the relatively frequent turnover in directors across the National Network.  Two directors also said that they use the assessment results to brief  center management, such as state homeland security directors, on center  operations, and that these results provide information on progress the  center made toward achieving baseline capabilities. Further, 5 of the 10  directors we interviewed specifically noted the DHS requirement to utilize  the assessment results to inform annual federal grant funding requests.

However, upon further review of the individual project descriptions that  states reported, FEMA and SLPO officials determined that states  incorrectly categorized many fusion center projects. These include cases  in which projects supported broader capabilities not directly related to  fusion centers\u2014such as emergency management positions\u2014as well as  those that were not specifically supporting center operations. For  example, one urban area reported obligating $14 million to a fusion center  for automated license plate readers and video surveillance equipment,  although the center will be one of a number of system users. Given that  FEMA identified that the $124 million estimate contained non-fusion- center-related projects, the figure is unreliable for quantifying total federal  grant funding provided to support fusion center operations in 2012. As an  alternative estimate of fusion center grant funding, SLPO officials  provided us with data on annual fusion center budgets that they collected  via the annual assessment process. According to these data that fusion  center directors reported, centers received approximately $60 million in  DHS grant funding to support their operations in fiscal year 2012. We  did not independently evaluate the reliability of this estimate; however, an  SLPO official stated that the $60 million estimate was generally consistent  with the amount remaining from the $124 million figure provided once  non-fusion-center-related projects were subtracted.", "To address this issue, FEMA is planning additional efforts to help states  better categorize fusion center projects and improve the reliability of grant  reporting.

It is  important that projects be accurately categorized, as FEMA uses these  data to determine the overall level of federal investment in fusion centers.  FEMA officials stated that overall grant monitoring efforts are expected to  help improve the reliability of fusion center funding data, but they noted  that only a sample of fusion centers will be targeted through these  processes. While sampling remains a reasonable approach for FEMA to conduct monitoring across the large number of HSGP projects  implemented annually, this approach is not likely to provide FEMA with  sufficient visibility over fusion center projects because each state reports  information independently and any actions taken by one state to  recategorize projects are not generalizable to others. Given the past  problems related to data reliability and FEMA not knowing why states  may have initially miscategorized fusion center projects, additional actions  beyond the monitoring efforts currently planned are important. According  to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, monitoring is  important not only to assess the quality of performance over time but also  to ensure that audit findings are promptly resolved. Development of a  specific mechanism to ensure that states act in accordance with the  forthcoming guidance could provide FEMA reasonable assurance that  fusion center projects are properly classified and accurately account for  total grant funding provided to centers. Such a mechanism could include,  for example, having SPLO officials review those projects that states  identify as supporting fusion centers to verify that states have accurately  done so in accordance with the guidance. SPLO officials are in a position  to conduct this review based on their knowledge of the results of the  annual center assessments, input from DHS representatives at fusion  centers, and other means. Developing a mechanism to ensure that states  act in accordance with the proposed guidance could provide DHS,  congressional, and other decision makers with more accurate information  on the level of federal investment in centers to help decision makers  determine future levels of investment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As focal points within states and urban areas for the receipt, analysis,  gathering, and dissemination of law enforcement, homeland security, and  terrorism information, fusion centers are uniquely situated to help  enhance the national threat picture and help protect the country. As these  centers continue to mature, it remains important for DHS to identify the  results that centers are achieving and how federal agencies can help  support and leverage these centers. The recent expansion of  performance measures is a positive step in this process, as are plans to  move forward with additional exercises to further evaluate fusion center  capabilities. DHS grant funding also remains an important component of  federal support to fusion centers, but to date, FEMA has not been able to  accurately account for and report on the amount of funds it has provided  to centers. FEMA\u2019s proposed efforts to help ensure that grantees provide  more accurate information on fusion center projects remain critical to  improving reporting, but implementation of a specific mechanism to verify  that states have acted in accordance with the forthcoming guidance  would further help ensure that these efforts are achieving their intended  purpose and fusion center grant reporting is reliable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help provide reasonable assurance that data states report on the  amount of federal grant funding used to support fusion centers is reliable,  we recommend that the FEMA Administrator implement a mechanism to  verify that states act in accordance with the proposed grant reporting  guidance, when implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS and DOJ for review and  comment.
