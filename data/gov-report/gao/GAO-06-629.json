Among the provisions are means to simplify federal royalties on geothermal resources while overall collecting the same level of royalty revenue. The Act also changes how these royalties are to be shared with local governments (disbursements). This report describes: (1) the current extent of and potential for geothermal development; (2) challenges faced by developers of geothermal resources; (3) federal, state, and local government actions to address these challenges; and (4) how provisions of the Act are likely to affect federal geothermal royalty disbursement and collections."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Geothermal resources currently produce about 0.3 percent of our nation's total electricity and heating needs and supply heat and hot water to about 2,300 direct use businesses, such as district heating systems, fish farms, greenhouses, food-drying plants, spas, and resorts. Recent assessments conclude that future electricity production from geothermal resources could increase by 25 to 367 percent by 2017. The potential for additional direct use businesses is largely unknown because the lower temperature geothermal resources that they exploit are abundant and commercial applications are diverse. One study has identified at least 400 undeveloped wells and hot springs that have the potential for development. In addition, the sales of geothermal heat pumps are increasing. Developers of geothermal electricity plants face many challenges including a capital intensive and risky business environment, developing technology, insufficient transmission capacity, lengthy federal review processes for approving permits and applications, and a complex federal royalty system. Direct use businesses face unique business challenges, remote locations, water rights issues, and high federal royalties. The Act addresses many of these challenges through tax credits for geothermal production, new authorities for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, and measures that streamline federal leasing and that simplify federal royalties, which totaled $12.3 million in 2005. In addition, the Department of Energy and the state of California provide grants for addressing technology challenges. Furthermore, some state governments offer financial incentives, including investment tax credits, property tax exclusions, sales tax exemptions, and mandates that certain percentages of the electricity within the state be generated from renewable resources. Under the Act, federal royalty disbursement will significantly change because half of the federal government's share will now go to the counties where leases are located. Although the Act directs the Secretary of the Interior to seek to maintain the same level of royalty collections, GAO's analysis suggests this will be difficult because changing electricity prices could significantly affect royalty revenues. Also, MMS does not collect sales data that are necessary to monitor these royalty collections."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["American families and businesses rely heavily on electricity and natural gas  to heat and light homes and buildings, to power appliances, to manufacture  goods, and to supply services. Increasing demand and rising prices for  electricity and natural gas have increased interest in alternative forms of  energy, including geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is a unique type of  renewable resource in that it can provide power that is independent of  weather and climate, thereby enabling a consistent and uninterrupted  supply of heat and electricity. Geothermal energy also creates fewer  environmental impacts than the production of natural gas and other  conventional fossil fuels that are used to generate electricity. Because  many areas that have the potential to produce additional geothermal  energy are located on federal lands, the federal government is a major  participant in the future development of geothermal energy.", "Geothermal energy is literally the heat of the earth. This heat is abnormally  high where hot and molten rocks exist at shallow depths below the earth\u2019s  surface. Water, brines, and steam circulating within these hot rocks are  collectively referred to as geothermal resources. Geothermal resources  often rise to the surface naturally along fractures to form hot springs,  geysers, and fumaroles. For centuries, people have used naturally  occurring hot springs as places to bathe, swim, and relax. More recently,  some individuals have constructed buildings over these springs,  transforming them into elaborate spas and resorts, thereby establishing the  first direct use of geothermal resources for business purposes. Businesses  have also established other direct uses of geothermal resources by drilling  wells into the earth to tap the hot water for heating buildings, drying food,  raising fish, and growing plants. Where the earth\u2019s temperature is not high  enough to supply businesses with geothermal resources for direct use,  people have made use of the ground\u2019s heat by installing geothermal heat  pumps. Geothermal heat pumps consist of a heat exchanger and a loop of  pipe extending into the ground to draw on the relatively constant  temperature there for heat in the winter and air conditioning in the  summer.", "Geothermal resources can also generate electricity, and this is their most  economically valuable use today. Only the highest temperature geothermal  resources, generally above 200 degrees Fahrenheit, are suitable for  electricity generation. When companies are satisfied that sufficient  quantities of geothermal resources are present below the surface at a  specific location, they will drill wells to bring the geothermal fluids and  steam to the surface. Upon reaching the surface, steam separates from the  fluids as their pressure drops, and the steam is used to spin the blades of a  turbine that generates electricity. The electricity is then sold to utilities in a  manner similar to sales of electricity generated by hydroelectric, coal-fired,  and gas-fired power plants.", "Geothermal resources are found throughout the world. In the United  States, geothermal resources are concentrated in Alaska, Hawaii, and the  western half of the country, primarily on public lands managed by the  Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The Congress set forth procedures in  the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 for leasing these public lands,  developing the geothermal resources, and collecting federal royalties.  Today, BLM leases these lands and sets the royalty rate, and the Minerals  Management Service (MMS)\u2014another agency within the Department of the  Interior (DOI)\u2014collects the federal geothermal royalties and disburses to  the state governments its share of these royalties as required by law. In  2005, the most recent year for which data are available, MMS collected  $12.3 million in geothermal royalties, almost all of which was derived from  the production of electricity.", "Since 1970, determining the amount of royalty payments has become  increasingly complex due to restructuring in the geothermal industry and  changing economic conditions. Government and industry representatives  formed a task force in late 2004 to devise a simpler royalty system that  would address these changes. During deliberations on the Energy Policy  Act of 2005 (Act), we briefed you on the findings of this task force and on  challenges facing geothermal development. Shortly thereafter, the  Congress passed the Act, which contains provisions to simplify the federal  royalties on electricity generation and reduce royalties on direct use. The  Act also contains other provisions designed to encourage the development  of geothermal resources. This report formalizes the content of our briefings  and our work since then, including: (1) the current extent of and potential  for geothermal development; (2) challenges faced by developers of  geothermal resources; (3) federal, state, and local government actions to  address these challenges; and (4) how provisions of the Act are likely to  affect federal geothermal royalty disbursements and collections.", "In responding to these objectives, we reviewed key studies on the extent  and potential of geothermal development and interviewed BLM and  industry officials in California, Nevada, and Utah. To identify the challenges  facing geothermal developers and to assess actions taken by federal, state,  and local governments, we interviewed a variety of government and  industry officials, reviewed substantial supporting documentation and the  Act, and toured geothermal electricity plants in California and Nevada and  direct use facilities in Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon. To assess how provisions  within the Act will affect federal geothermal royalties, we interviewed MMS  and BLM employees; reviewed a report authored by the Royalty Policy  Committee; and analyzed geothermal royalty, production, and sales data  from January 2000 through December 2004. We performed our work  between May 2005 and May 2006 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. A more detailed description of our  objectives, scope, and methodology is provided in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The temperature of geothermal resources generally dictates their use. Low  temperatures from 40 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (F) that occur in the ground  at shallow depths are best used for geothermal heat pumps. Geothermal  heat pumps, also known as ground-source heat pumps, are devices that  take advantage of the relatively constant temperature immediately beneath  the earth\u2019s surface to provide heat in the winter and air conditioning in the  summer. During the winter, a heat pump transfers the heat of the ground to  a fluid filled set of coils and then pumps this fluid to the building. A heat  exchanger then transfers the heat to another set of coils filled with a  refrigerant that boils. The resulting gas is then compressed and pumped to  a condenser, where it gives up its heat as a fan blows over the condenser  coils. During the summer, heat pumps work in reverse, extracting heat  from the building and transferring it to the ground. Although heat pumps  run on electricity, they produce three to four times the energy that they  consume. As a result, they can reduce energy consumption by 20 to 70  percent relative to conventional electrical heating and cooling systems.  They also can produce hot water for free during the summer and for about  half price during the winter.", "Direct use applications begin with geothermal resources that have  temperatures as low as 70 degrees F and can include geothermal resources  as hot as 300 degrees F. Geothermal waters can be mixed with groundwater  or surface water to achieve the most desirable temperature for the specific  application. Geothermal waters with temperatures between about 70 and  125 degrees F are best used in spas and resorts for recreational swimming  and bathing, in aquaculture operations for raising fish and other aquatic  animals (fig. 1), and within sidewalks and roads for melting snow.  Geothermal resources between about 125 and 300 degrees F can be used  for various applications, each of which has optimal temperature ranges.  Specific applications include food processing; fruit and vegetable drying;  space and district heating; raising flowers, plants, and trees in greenhouses;  processing pulp and paper; drying lumber, cement, and aggregate; curing  concrete blocks; pasteurizing milk; dyeing fabric; making ice; and providing  refrigeration.", "Electricity generation requires geothermal resources of at least 200 degrees  F, with higher generation capacity coming from temperatures above 350  degrees F. Geothermal power plants extract geothermal fluids\u2014hot water,  brines, and steam\u2014from the earth by drilling wells to depths of up to  10,000 feet (fig. 2). The geothermal resources are then used, in lieu of  running water or the burning of fossil fuels, to produce a vapor that turns  the blades of a turbine that spins a generator to produce electricity.  Geothermal resources with temperatures from about 200 to 350 degrees F  are best suited for binary power plants. In a binary plant, the geothermal  fluids are passed through a heat exchanger to heat a secondary fluid, like  isopentane, that vaporizes at a lower temperature than water and spins the  power-producing turbines. The fluid is then condensed back into a gas and  recycled, and the geothermal resources are injected back into the reservoir.  When geothermal resources have temperatures over about 350 degrees F,  flash plants are most appropriate. In flash power plants, highly pressurized  hot water is brought to the surface, where the pressure decreases and part  of the water explosively boils, or \u201cflashes,\u201d into steam. The steam is then  separated from the remaining hot water and used to turn the turbines.  Residual water is injected back into the reservoir. In some rare geothermal  systems with temperatures above 455 degrees F, as at an area known as  The Geysers Geothermal Field (The Geysers) in northern California, the  geothermal resources may consist entirely of steam within the reservoir.  Dry steam power plants use the steam directly to spin the turbines.  Although some of the steam condenses back to water that can be injected  back into the reservoir, much water is lost to evaporation in this process.  Flash and binary power plants can also be combined in sequence for the  most efficient generation of electricity. In these hybrid power plants, hot  water is first flashed within a flash plant and then the steam is condensed,  combined with the lower temperature water, and routed to a binary plant  for further generation of electricity.", "The leasing of federal lands for geothermal resources is governed by the  Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended. To explore and develop  geothermal resources on federal lands, developers must first obtain a  federal lease from BLM. The lease is a contract between the federal  government and the lessee that specifies certain terms for development  and payment of rents and royalties. Regardless of the federal agency  managing the lands where the geothermal resources are located, BLM has  responsibility for issuing these leases after obtaining concurrence from the  federal land managing agency. Before passage of the Act, BLM designated  certain areas that it believed to have a reasonable potential for the  commercial development of geothermal resources as \u201cknown geothermal  resource areas (KGRA).\u201d Within a KGRA, BLM was required to lease lands  to the highest qualified bidder under a formal competitive bidding process,  as long as the highest bid equaled or exceeded fair market value. For land  outside of a KGRA, BLM was required to issue a lease noncompetitively to  the first qualified buyer applying for the lease. Under provisions of the Act,  BLM no longer establishes KRGAs, but instead accepts nominations from  parties interested in leasing available lands and holds a competitive auction  at least once every 2 years. If bids are not received for lands offered in the  sale, the Secretary is to make them available for 2 years for noncompetitive  leasing. BLM issues geothermal leases for 10 years and requires lessees to  pay an annual rental of at least $1 per acre until commercial production is  established. Thereafter, lessees pay a royalty from 10 to 15 percent of the  value of production.", "BLM will not issue federal geothermal leases until the federal land  management agency completes an extensive environmental review  process. The leasing and development of these lands must be consistent  with the management objectives for the lands as documented in the  appropriate resource or forest management plan. Should these plans not  adequately address exploration and development of geothermal resources,  the appropriate agency personnel may need to amend or rewrite the plans.  Prior to leasing, agency officials must also comply with provisions of the  National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (NEPA). NEPA  requires federal agencies to prepare an environmental impact statement  (EIS) for major federal actions that may have a significant affect on the  quality of the human environment. When an agency is not sure whether an  activity will have significant impact on the environment, the agency  prepares a less detailed environmental assessment (EA). If an EA  determines that the activity will significantly affect the environment, the  agency then prepares an EIS. During these analyses, agency personnel  analyze potential impacts of geothermal leasing to various resources such  as air and water quality, vegetation, wildlife, threatened and endangered  species, and visual and cultural resources. In California, state laws also  require a similar environmental review. Agency personnel may also need to  comply with provisions of other federal legislation, such as the Endangered  Species Act of 1973, as amended, and the National Historic Preservation  Act, as amended.", "Under the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970, as amended, calculating  geothermal royalties was relatively simple because the developers of the  geothermal fields sold steam and hot water to power plants, establishing a  sales price upon which royalties could be based. The statutory royalty rate  specified in the lease, which was from 10 to 15 percent, was multiplied by  the sales value of the geothermal resource each month to yield royalties  due. In the 1980s, the developers sold the fields to the power plants, and  this basis for valuing the geothermal resource was lost. In 1991, MMS  issued new regulations that were in effect until passage of the Act. These  regulations established the value of the geothermal resource based on the  value of the electricity sold. The regulations called for subtracting, or  \u201cnetting back\u201d from the electricity\u2019s sales revenues, the costs of generation  and transmission. Formulas for netting back these costs were complex due  to different methods of accounting for depreciation, uncertainty over  which costs qualified for deduction, and commingling of federal and  nonfederal resources. The Act contains provisions aimed at simplifying this  process by allowing lessees the option on existing leases to pay royalties  based on a percentage of gross sales revenue and by prescribing a set  schedule of royalty rates for future leases. In addition, royalties due on  direct use facilities prior to passage of the Act were based on the price of  natural gas, which has risen substantially in recent years, making the direct  use of federal geothermal resources unattractive. The Act provides for  replacing this system of direct use royalties with a schedule of fees that  encourages the development of geothermal resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Geothermal Development Is Limited, and Estimated Potential for Additional Development Varies", "paragraphs": ["Electricity generated from geothermal resources is small, about 0.3 percent  of the total electricity produced in the United States, with about half of this  amount coming from federal resources.

By  2025, two of these sources estimate that electrical generation from these  known resources will increase to between 6,800 and 13,000 megawatts. The  difference in estimates could also be due to the different methodologies  used to make the forecasts, such as surveys of experts in the geothermal  industry and/or detailed economic modeling.

While most users heat one or several  buildings, some users have formally organized heating districts that pipe  hot water from geothermal wells to a central facility that then distributes it  to heat many buildings more economically than other available sources of  energy. The largest concentration of geothermal heating districts occurs in  Boise, Idaho, where four heating districts distribute geothermal waters to  over 50 buildings, including the Capitol and City Hall (fig. 3). Geothermal  heating districts supply heat to about 20 commercial and government  buildings in Klamath Falls, Oregon, and to 400 homes in Reno, Nevada.

Geothermal groups reported that most  attempts to develop geothermal resources are unsuccessful, that costs to  develop geothermal power plants can surpass $100 million, and it can take  3 to 5 years for plants to first produce and sell electricity. The development  of geothermal resources for electricity generation follows a series of  phases, starting with finding the geothermal resources through exploration,  then confirming the magnitude and extent of the resource, and ending with  full field development and power plant installation. Although some  resources are easy to find because they produce telltale signs such as hot  springs or fumaroles, most resources are buried deep within the earth\u2014at  depths sometimes exceeding 10,000 feet\u2014and finding them often requires  an in-depth knowledge of the area\u2019s geology, geophysical surveys, remote  sensing techniques, and at least one test well. The Geothermal Energy  Association estimates that average wells cost from $2 million to $5 million  and that only about 25 percent of the initial test wells are successful in  finding commercial geothermal fields.

Since geothermal systems are geologically more  complex than oil and gas systems, exploration tools commonly used in the  oil and gas industry, such as geophysical surveys, are less effective. In  general, geothermal reservoirs are located in very hard and fractured rocks  that make drilling difficult. Operators often experience difficulty in drilling  because drill bits wear quickly and because the medium used to lubricate  the borehole and remove rock fragments, called drilling fluid, is commonly  lost into the many fractures in the rock. Compared with oil and gas wells,  the temperatures encountered when drilling are considerably higher and  the geothermal resources are more corrosive, resulting in corrosion of  drilling equipment and production casing and the failure of electronic  components. Geothermal wells are also larger in diameter than oil and gas  wells drilled to the same depth, which drives up drilling costs.

In  the summer of 2005, FERC denied a request from a utility to pass the costs  for transmission lines on to ratepayers. According to utility officials, this  reaffirms that developers must pay for the costs since utilities will not  voluntarily absorb the costs directly. Under current rules, when a developer  requests new transmission capacity, the bulk of the costs are assigned to  the project that first pushes the transmission system beyond its existing  capacity. In addition, federal, state, and industry officials note that small  geothermal plants are discouraged from connecting to these large  transmission lines because utilities do not want to bother with the small  amounts of electricity unless there are many of them in the same area.", "Cumbersome planning and permitting processes have hindered the  addition of necessary transmission capacity. In a July 2005 report, a  consultant for the Edison Electric Institute noted that nationally the task of  getting a transmission project planned, approved, permitted, and financed  remained daunting. The authors stated that the investment climate for  transmission remained fragmented by different procedures, incentives, and  constraints from one region of the country to another. The California  Energy Commission noted in a November 2005 report that the state\u2019s  inefficient transmission planning and permitting processes were  contributing to worsening the state\u2019s transmission problems. Addressing  the same issue, an official of a large California utility told us that obtaining  agreement on where to construct transmission lines, addressing  environmental issues, obtaining approvals, and a \u201cnot in my backyard\u201d  philosophy, contributed to the uncertainty and long lead times in building  additional transmission capacity. In addition, a geothermal developer  complained about extensive hearings and an inability to determine  jurisdictions between the state and the federal government and between  agencies within California."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Geothermal Power Plants on Federal Lands Face Delays in Processing Applications, Fragmented Lease Holdings, and a Complex Royalty System", "paragraphs": ["Geothermal developers state that the process for approving leases and  issuing permits to drill wells and construct power plants has become  excessively bureaucratic. BLM and Forest Service officials often have to  amend or rewrite resource or forest management plans, which can add up  to 3 years to the approval process, depending upon the complexity of the  proposal and when the last plan was written. Delays in finalizing resource  and forest management plans and in conducting environmental reviews  have resulted in a backlog of 31 lease applications in California, with an  average age of 7.4 years, and 136 lease applications in Nevada, with an  average age of about 2 years. Despite the high backlog in Nevada, BLM  officials noted that they processed 177 lease applications from January  2001 through June 2005. In contrast, during the same period, BLM did not  process any lease applications in California. Nevada BLM officials reported  that they can generally make decisions on whether to allow leasing and  development faster because the public raises fewer issues and BLM  documents its decision within a shorter document known as an EA. In  California, however, the public raises more environmental issues and  concerns involving Native American spirituality so BLM often prepares a  more detailed document called an EIS, which typically takes 2 years to  complete. While geothermal developers told us that they support  environmental analyses, they complained about the duplication of federal  and state documentation in California and of the appeals and lawsuits filed  by groups opposing the federal and state decisions, citing that it often takes  years for their resolution. The California Energy Commission reported in a  June 2005 report that the entire process from exploration to the first  production of electricity can take more than a decade and that it was not  unusual to redo environmental documents because they became outdated.", "Geothermal applications, permits, and environmental reviews are also  delayed because of a lack of staff and budgetary resources at the BLM state  and field offices that conduct the necessary work. Nevada and California  BLM officials noted that lack of funding and dedicated staff to work on  lease applications was a constant problem. Lack of funding in California  has slowed completion of BLM resource management plans and EISs  necessary for lease approvals and drilling permits. BLM officials noted in  California that they received only $90,000 to conduct two extensive EISs  for which staff had requested $1.2 million while Nevada BLM received a  one-time allocation of $700,000 for processing a backlog of lease  applications and writing several less extensive EAs, which generally cost  $80,000 to $90,000 each.", "Approvals for leases and permits may also be delayed when BLM must  coordinate with the Forest Service, which manages land in some project  areas. The Forest Service manages significant lands on geothermal projects  in Oregon, Washington, California, and Nevada. Although BLM is the lead  federal agency for geothermal development, the Forest Service must  concur with leasing and development, and it has its own permitting  process. BLM and industry officials report that there can be a lack of  coordination between the Forest Service and BLM because of differing  objectives and directives. While both agencies manage their lands  according to the multiple use doctrine, they may have different priorities  for land use and the public often submits more negative comments  concerning geothermal development on Forest Service lands. A Forest  Service official noted that it is important to balance the competing issue of  geothermal development with other land uses such as preservation and  recreation. He cited a limited budget for updating forest management  plans, which can lead to delays, and noted that since geothermal  development generates far less revenue than logging and coal mining on  Forest Service Lands, geothermal development receives less priority.", "Companies may also encounter difficulties in developing geothermal  resources for electricity production due to a patchwork of lease ownership.  Geothermal resources within a project area may be owned by the federal  government, state government, or private entities. Even when all resources  within a project are under federal lease, several lessees with competing  interests and objectives may own these leases. Some BLM officials noted  that some developers have reported difficulty in consolidating the various  geothermal leases into an economically viable project that can recover the  costs of the power plant and transmission line. These developers,  according to these BLM officials, say that speculators often lease  geothermal resources not for development purposes but rather to resell the  leases at a significant profit, running up the cost of the project.", "Geothermal developers, BLM officials, and MMS officials concur that the  complex federal royalty system in effect before passage of the Act was a  challenge to the development of geothermal electricity plants. While  developers did not consider this royalty system to be a major obstacle in  constructing a geothermal power plant, some described calculating royalty  payments as burdensome and reported expending considerable time and  expense on royalty audits. Several industry officials cited the complex  royalty system as a reason for advocating revisions to the Geothermal  Steam Act of 1970, as amended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Direct Uses of Geothermal Resources Face Business Challenges, Remote Locations, Water Rights, and Royalty Issues", "paragraphs": ["The small business owners, operators of heating districts, and individuals  who commonly develop geothermal resources for direct use face a variety  of business challenges. Foremost among these challenges are obtaining  capital, overcoming specific challenges unique to their industry, containing  costs, and securing a competitive advantage. While the amount of capital to  start a business that relies on geothermal resource is small compared with  the amount of capital necessary to build a geothermal power plant, this  capital can be large relative to the financial assets of the small business  owner or individual. Unforeseen problems in well construction, piping, and  water disposal can also increase original funding estimates. Obtaining  funding is difficult as commercial banks are often reluctant to loan money  for unproven projects and ideas that appear risky. Even district heating  systems that are operated by municipalities have encountered financing  difficulties as city or state legislatures may be reluctant to provide funding  or customers may be reluctant to pay for modifications that are necessary  to use geothermal resources in their current heating systems. We observed  a number of business challenges unique to various industries that the  successful owners of direct use businesses were able to overcome. They  used their extensive knowledge of their respective industries to combat  diseases in fish farms; to combat corrosive waters used in space heating;  and to control temperature, humidity, and light according to the  specifications of the various plant species they grew in nurseries.", "Escalating costs also pose a challenge to direct use operations. Rising labor  costs and cheaper imports closed a food processing plant in Nevada.  Greenhouses in Idaho and Oregon remained profitable by shifting from  high-cost natural gas to cheaper geothermal resources for heating.  Successful operators of direct use businesses have secured competitive  advantages by entering specialty niches (see figs. 5 and 6). For example,  the operators of two aquaculture facilities in Idaho and Oregon sell  alligator meat, tilapia, and freshwater shrimp to restaurants. Also, a resort  operator in Alaska that relies on geothermal resources constructed and  markets an \u201cice museum\u201d where guests can spend the night with interior  furnishings sculptured from ice. We noticed that some greenhouse  operators gained a marketing advantage by selling from their retail outlet  rather than selling at a lower price to wholesalers.", "The remote location of many geothermal resources hampers their  development for direct use. Geothermal direct use is constrained because  the geothermal waters cannot be economically transported over long  distances without a significant loss of heat. An official with the Geo-Heat  Center noted that for space heating, spas, and resorts, the geothermal  resources should be located within 5 miles of the location where they will  be used. While some greenhouses, aquaculture operations, and food  processors that rely on geothermal resources have successfully produced  their products far from consumers, they still need access to adequate  transportation and a cheap labor market, both of which are generally  dependent on proximity to population centers. The distant location from  major population centers of geothermal resources on federal lands  contributes to their unattractiveness for direct use applications.", "Obtaining water rights can be a significant challenge to direct use  development. Western states are not uniform in classifying geothermal  resources, considering them legally to be mineral, water, or having  characteristics of both minerals and water. Depending sometimes on the  depth and/or the temperature at which they occur, geothermal resources  can be subject to state water laws in the western states and are then  managed by the state agency responsible for protecting groundwater. Even  when not legally classified as water, the production of geothermal  resources for direct use applications may still fall under regulations  enforced by a state agency responsible for groundwater protection. In  areas of high groundwater use, the western states generally regulate  geothermal water according to some form of the doctrine of prior  appropriations, under which specific amounts of water are appropriated to  users in the order when they first made beneficial use of the water.  Additional amounts, if available, are appropriated in the future to  applicants on a first-come basis. Those that have more senior rights have  priority in using the water when use exceeds supply, such as during a  drought. Western states that generally follow the prior appropriations  doctrine when managing the production of geothermal water for direct use  include Utah, Idaho, Oregon, New Mexico, and Nevada. Developers of  geothermal resources for direct use would face problems obtaining  appropriations in the Snake River Basin of Idaho, which consists of much  of the state below the panhandle, because groundwater is fully  appropriated there and used predominantly for irrigation. Over half of the  state of Utah also includes areas in which geothermal resources for direct  use would be excluded or restricted due to prior appropriations, and the  state water engineers in Nevada and New Mexico may also restrict  appropriations in some areas of their states. In addition, applications for  development of geothermal resources for direct use on federal lands may  also be subject to state water laws. Unless the federal government has  reserved water rights on land in which a geothermal developer is interested  and the geothermal development fulfills the specific purpose of the federal  reservation, the development may still be subject to restrictions under state  water laws.", "Developers interested in using federal geothermal resources for direct use  were concerned about high federal royalties prior to passage of the Energy  Policy Act of 2005. Royalties were computed according to a formula that  relies on the amount of heat extracted from the resource and the cost of a  reasonably available alternative form of energy. Since most inquiries into  the use of federal resources have been by operators of greenhouses, this  alternative form of energy\u2014natural gas\u2014has been the source generally  used to heat greenhouses. Average wellhead natural gas prices in recent  years have increased about two and a half times from $3.68 per million  British thermal units in 2000 to $9.50 in September 2005. Operators of  greenhouses have told us that heating greenhouses with natural gas is no  longer economically feasible as the costs of raising plants would exceed  the price they obtain for these plants. During meetings between BLM, MMS,  state, and industry officials, general consensus was reached that natural  gas was too expensive an energy source upon which to base royalties, and  a working group was formed to propose an alternative energy source. In  the report they drafted, the group proposed Powder River Basin coal,  which averages about 30 cents per million British thermal units\u2014a fraction  of the price of natural gas. The report states that lower royalties on direct  use may encourage development and result in higher royalty revenues in  the long run. However, based on other challenges facing the development  of direct use applications, the lowering of federal royalties alone is unlikely  to stimulate the direct use of federal geothermal resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Efforts by Federal, State, and Local Governments to Address Challenges Show Promise", "paragraphs": ["The Act includes a variety of provisions designed to help the geothermal  industry address numerous challenges, including the high risk and financial  uncertainty of developing renewable energy projects, lack of sufficient  transmission capacity, delays in federal leasing, and complex federal  royalties.

Through the Department of Energy (DOE) and the California  Energy Commission, the federal government and the state of California are  attempting to overcome technical challenges by awarding cost-share grants  for research and development.

The credit is now 1.9 cents per kilowatt-hour and has  future adjustments for inflation. Although government and industry  officials praised this provision, they told us that for the credit to be more  effective, the date by which plants must produce electricity needs to be  extended. They explained that since it can take 3 years or longer for the  construction of geothermal electricity plants, plants probably will not  qualify unless they are ready to break ground immediately. The Act also  provides a financial incentive for tax-exempt entities that cannot take  advantage of the production tax credit. Section 1303 of the Act permits the  issuance of clean renewable energy bonds by tax-exempt entities, such as  municipalities and rural electric cooperatives, for the construction of  certain renewable energy projects, including geothermal electricity plants.  Investors can purchase the bonds, which pay back the original principal  and also provide a federal tax credit instead of an interest payment.

The Act directs the Secretary of the Interior, acting  through the USGS, to update the 1978 Assessment of Geothermal  Resources made by the USGS. This assessment, published as Circular 790,  is widely considered to be out of date and in need of revision. USGS  officials reported that, since 1978, there have been significant  advancements in technology that are not reflected in Circular 790. Now,  electricity can be generated from lower temperature resources and from  resources located deeper within the earth. Today, according to USGS  officials, scientists and engineers can make more accurate resource  estimates because they are more knowledgeable of reservoir  characteristics and have benefited from the knowledge gained during the  27 years of exploration and development that has occurred since the  original study.", "State governments are also offering financial incentives to the geothermal  industry by creating additional markets for their electricity through  Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS). An RPS is a state policy directed at  electricity retailers, including utilities, that either mandates or encourages  them to provide a specific amount of electricity from renewable energy  sources, which may include geothermal resources. To date, 22 states plus  the District of Columbia have RPSs, and three other states have set RPS  targets. Requirements for the program vary by state as each RPS is unique,  and not all states have significant geothermal resources. California and  Nevada, which have large geothermal production and potential, have each  established an ambitious RPS. California law mandates that retailers must  supply 20 percent of their electrical energy from renewable energy by 2017,  and the state is currently seeking to move this date up to 2010. Nevada  requires certain percentages of its electricity to be generated from  renewable energy each year, with 20 percent by 2015. Since California and  Nevada requirements were implemented, one 20 megawatt-geothermal  plant in Nevada, which has gone on line, and geothermal developers have  signed contracts for three plants in California for as much as 260  megawatts of future geothermal power, which can be attributed to RPSs.  Nevada utilities currently are not meeting their annual RPS requirements.  Officials from two large California utilities told us that they are interested  in purchasing electricity generated from geothermal resources specifically  because of RPS and noted that the RPS may be instrumental in  constructing a new transmission line from the Imperial Valley to utilities in  southern California.", "Additional state programs also provide tax credits and other financial  incentives for renewable energy development, including electricity  generation from geothermal resources.

In this case, the lessee will continue to  calculate and pay royalties just as the lessee did before passage of the Act.  Royalty revenues from a geothermal lease currently producing electricity  should also remain about the same if the lessee does convert to the simpler  method of calculating royalties in the Act, provided that DOI negotiates  with the lessee a future royalty percentage based on past royalty history  and provided that electricity prices remain relatively constant. This  situation is illustrated in table 4, which uses data based on actual royalty  data from a geothermal project on federal lands. According to table 4, the  lessee pays royalties equal to $20,000 under the netback process. Royalties  are equal to the production of 8,000 megawatt hours times the sales price of  $100 per megawatt hour less $600,000 in expenses times the statutory  royalty rate of 10 percent. Figures in table 4 represent averages over a 5- year period and show that royalties are equal to 2.5 percent of gross sales  revenue. If production remains the same and if electricity prices average  $100 per megawatt hour, future royalty revenues will remain the same  whether royalties are calculated under the netback process or if royalties  are calculated at 2.5 percent of gross sales revenues.", "However, if electricity prices increase and royalties are based on historic  percentages of gross sales revenues, royalty revenues will actually  decrease relative to what the federal government would have collected  prior to passage of the Act. More revenue would have been received under  the netback process because expenses for generation and transmission do  not increase when electricity prices increase and the higher 10 percent  statutory royalty rate would have applied to all of the increase in sales  revenues. This impact is illustrated in table 5. Using the historic average of  2.5 percent computed in table 4, the royalties will actually be $12,000 less  than what would have been collected under the netback process when the  average price increases by $20 per megawatt hour. On the other hand, if  average electricity prices drop by $20 per megawatt hour, royalty revenues  will increase by $12,000 relative to what would have been collected under  the netback process.", "For the second type of lease\u2014leases that were issued before the Act and  that will first produce electricity within 6 years after the Act\u2019s passage\u2014 royalty revenues are likely to drop somewhat because lessees are likely to  take advantage of an incentive within the Act. The Act allows for a 50  percent decrease in royalties for the first 4 years of production so long as  the lessee does not elect to pay royalties based on a percentage of gross  sales revenues and continues to use the netback process. Because of the  substantial reduction in royalties, it is likely that lessees owning leases  issued before passage of the Act will elect to pay only 50 percent of the  royalties due on new production for the 4-year period allowed by the Act.  This incentive also applies to sales revenues from the expansion of a  geothermal electricity plant that exceeds 10 percent. Owners of geothermal  electricity plants currently paying royalties under the netback process may  elect to take the production incentive for new plant expansions if they  perceive that the royalty reduction is worth the additional effort and  expense in calculating payments under the netback process and worth the  possibility of being audited. BLM officials said that leases in Utah,  California, and Nevada may become subject to the royalty reduction  provisions within the Act for new production and new plant expansions.", "It is difficult to predict exactly how royalty revenue from the third type of  lease\u2014leases that have not yet been issued\u2014will change, but it appears  that revenue impacts are likely to be minor, based on our review of historic  royalty data. The Act specifies that the Secretary of the Interior should seek  to collect the same level of royalty revenues over a 10-year period as before  passage of the Act, but it will be difficult for DOI to compare an estimate of  what royalty revenue would have been without the Act with royalty  revenues after the Act because the production and expenses of future  plants could vary substantially due to their unique geological, engineering,  and economic attributes. The Act provides that, for future leases, royalties  on electricity produced from federal geothermal resources should be not  less than 1 percent and not greater than 2.5 percent of the sales revenue  from the electricity generated in the first 10 years of production. After 10  years, royalties should be not less than 2 percent and not greater than 5  percent of the sales revenue from the electricity.", "We attempted to analyze the revenue impact on future leases by using  historic royalty data maintained by MMS and sales revenue data maintained  by BLM. A detailed description of our methodology is in appendix II. First,  we attempted to analyze revenue impacts on the first 10 years of electricity  production, but we had difficulty obtaining relevant royalty data so we  could not complete this analysis. Next, we examined the impact on  royalties after the first 10 years of production by analyzing data for seven  geothermal projects from 2000 through 2004. In analyzing royalty data, we  found that MMS did not maintain gross sales revenue data so we used data  that BLM supplied to MMS. We also found that 40 percent of the royalty  data maintained by MMS was erroneous or missing so we corrected or  obtained these data as necessary. We then calculated royalties paid as a  percentage of gross sales revenues for each project. This analysis showed  that lessees were paying a wide range of percentages\u2014from 0.2 to 6.3  percent. Three of the seven projects paid under the minimum 2 percent  royalty rate prescribed in the Act, suggesting that some projects in the  future could pay more under the Act\u2019s new provisions than they would  otherwise have paid. On the other hand, one project paid greater than the  maximum 5 percent prescribed in the Act, suggesting that it is possible for  a plant to pay less in the future than it would otherwise have paid.  However, both the royalty revenue that the one plant would have overpaid  and the total of the royalty revenues that the three plants would have  underpaid are small\u2014about 0.2 percent and 0.01 percent, respectively, of  all geothermal royalties reportedly paid during the period of our analysis.", "Even though provisions within the Act may decrease royalties on direct use  applications, the impact of these provisions is likely to be small because  total royalty collections from direct use applications are minimal. In fiscal  years 2000 through 2004, MMS reported collecting annually about $79,000  from two direct use projects, or less than 1 percent of total geothermal  royalties. In addition, MMS reported collecting an additional $222,000  during this period in settlement for royalties owed on a direct use project  from 1987 through 2003. While a provision within the Act may encourage  the use of federal geothermal resources for direct use by lowering the  federal royalty rate, we believe based on challenges facing developers that  it is unlikely that this royalty incentive alone will stimulate substantial new  revenues to compensate for the loss in revenue due to the lower royalty  rate. We believe that, in order to substantially increase the development of  federal direct use applications, developers must overcome the relatively  high capital costs for investors, unique business challenges, and water  rights issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MMS Does Not Routinely Collect the Royalty Data Necessary to Maintain the Same Level of Royalty Collections", "paragraphs": ["MMS does not routinely collect meaningful data on the revenue from  electricity sales. Since the Act requires the Secretary of the Interior to seek  to achieve the same level of royalty revenues when issuing new royalty  regulations, these data are necessary to know how future royalties will  compare with what would have been collected before passage of the Act.  To make these comparisons, MMS needs to calculate the percentage of  gross sales revenues that lessees pay in royalties. MMS requires royalty  payors to record sales revenue data on Form MMS-2014 under the data field  \u201csales value.\u201d MMS\u2019s Geothermal Payor Handbook instructs royalty payors  using the netback method to record in this field its net sales revenue, which  is equal to gross sales revenues less deductions for expenses such as  generation and transmission. As such, this sales value cannot be used as  one of the factors to calculate the percent of gross sales revenues paid in  royalties.", "In preparing an analysis for the Royalty Policy Committee, MMS obtained  gross sales revenue data from BLM for many of the geothermal projects.  While BLM regulations require geothermal plant operators to report to BLM  the amount of electricity produced, these regulations do not require the  reporting of gross sales revenues. Nevertheless, BLM officials said that they  collect the sales revenue data. BLM officials in Nevada and southern  California reported examining the production and gross sales revenue data  for reasonableness and patterns in order to check on the accuracy of  royalty reporting. A BLM official also reported collecting sales revenue and  production data at The Geysers in northern California, but he said that BLM  lacked the resources to examine these data and was unable to compile  these data either for MMS or for us. These data from The Geysers are  important because they represent about 61 percent of total federal  geothermal royalties. Some royalty data from The Geysers were obtained  and audited by the state of California, but an MMS official said that it would  be more efficient and timely if MMS collects gross sales revenue data  directly, rather than having to ask BLM or the states for these data. The  official also said that MMS could use the gross sales revenue data in the  future to conduct general compliance audits by comparing the percent of  gross sales revenue paid in royalties with percentages prescribed within  the Act and by examining trends in the data, without having to undertake  lengthy and expensive on-site visits to the geothermal plants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Energy Policy Act of 2005 addresses a wide variety of challenges facing  developers of geothermal resources. The Act incorporates many of the  lessons learned by state governments and federal agencies in an attempt to  make federal processes more efficient and provide financial incentives for  further development.

Several of the Act\u2019s major provisions will  be left to the federal agencies within DOI for implementation, and the  drafting and public comment period for regulations that implement these  provisions will take time. Agencies will also need to spend considerable  time and effort in working out the details for implementation and securing  the necessary budgets to implement the new system. To assist in these  efforts, the Congress has authorized the agencies to use the federal  government\u2019s share of royalty collections to implement the geothermal  program for 5 years.", "All the while, the Act directs the Secretary of the Interior to seek to  maintain the same level of geothermal royalty revenues over the next 10  years as would have been collected prior to the Act. This is a tall mandate,  as one of the factors that can most affect geothermal royalty revenue\u2014the  price of electricity\u2014is outside the control of the managing agencies.  Although it is impossible to predict with reasonable assurance how these  prices will change in the future, the federal agencies must make their best  effort to mitigate the impact of changing prices if federal royalty revenue  are to remain the same.

We  contacted and visited the authors of the studies prepared by the  Department of Energy in Golden, Colorado; the California Energy  Commission in Sacramento, California; and the Geo-Heat Center in  Klamath Falls, Oregon. We also visited the Geothermal Resources Council  in Davis, California. We obtained statistics on federal geothermal leases  from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and data on geothermal heat  pumps from the Geothermal Heat Pump Consortium, the Department of  Energy\u2019s Geothermal Technologies Program, and the General Services  Administration.", "To identify the challenges facing geothermal developers and to assess  actions taken by federal, state, and local governments, we interviewed a  variety of government and industry officials, reviewed substantial  supporting documentation and the Act, and visited geothermal facilities.  We interviewed BLM officials in Washington, D.C.; California; Nevada; and  Utah, as well as Forest Service officials in Washington, D.C.; Minerals  Management Service (MMS) officials in Lakewood, Colorado; and  Department of Energy officials in Washington, D.C.; and Golden, Colorado.  We contacted state officials in California, Nevada, and Idaho. We also  interviewed geothermal industry representatives in Washington, D.C.;  California; Nevada; and New Mexico and toured geothermal electricity  plants in California and Nevada and direct use facilities, including heating  districts, food processing plants, greenhouses, aquaculture operations, and  a spa in Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, and Colorado. Specifically to assess  financial challenges faced by the geothermal industry, we also interviewed  officials with public utilities and officials who specialize in arranging  financing for geothermal plants. In assessing challenges specific to federal  lands, we also reviewed processes for approving lease applications and  conducting environmental analyses under the National Environmental  Policy Act of 1969; examined federal regulations addressing leasing,  geothermal operations, and royalty valuation for both electricity  production and direct use; and read the 148-page Geothermal Valuation  Handbook.", "To assess how provisions within the Act will affect federal geothermal  royalties, we interviewed MMS employees in Lakewood, Colorado, and  BLM employees in California, Utah, and Nevada and reviewed a report  authored by the Royalty Policy Committee. We reviewed in detail how  provisions of the Act address the disbursement of federal geothermal  royalties and specifications for geothermal royalty collections from leases  that are currently producing electricity, leases that will first start to  produce electricity within the 6 years following passage of the Act, and  leases that have not yet been issued.", "To assess how provisions of the Act could impact royalty revenue from the  sale of electricity, we started by trying to obtain monthly geothermal  royalty data and sales revenue data from MMS for January 2000 through  December 2004 for 10 geothermal projects paying royalties according to  the netback process. We discovered that MMS does not require payors to  submit gross sales revenue data but instead collects these data from BLM.  We assessed whether MMS\u2019s royalty data and BLM\u2019s sales revenue data  were complete enough and accurate enough for MMS to determine what  percentage of gross sales revenues is equivalent to the current level of  royalties being paid, should lessees elect to convert to paying a percentage  of gross sales revenues, as allowed by the Act. We reviewed MMS\u2019s and  BLM\u2019s data for reasonableness and completeness. While we found BLM\u2019s  data to be reasonably complete and accurate for the 10 geothermal  projects, we found that BLM could not furnish us with sales revenue data  for the 2 steam projects at The Geysers Geothermal Field in northern  California. We also found that about 40 percent of the monthly royalty data  maintained by MMS for the 10 projects was missing or erroneous. The most  common error, accounting for 73 percent of erroneous and missing data,  was not paying the 0.1 percent minimum royalty required by MMS  regulations. This error did not result in significant monetary  underpayments; monthly underpayments for this type of error generally  amounted to less than $500. After assuming that the correct royalty due  was 0.1 percent of net sales revenue for those months in which  underpayments were less than the minimum royalty calculation, we  determined that royalty data was reasonably accurate and complete for  January 2000 through December 2004 for 6 of the projects and for January  2003 through December 2004 for one additional project.", "In assessing revenue impacts from leases that were currently issued and  producing electricity, we considered MMS\u2019s past history of approving  royalty calculations based on a percentage of gross sales revenues at The  Geysers. We also reviewed MMS\u2019s calculations of the percentages of gross  sales revenues that appear in the report to the Royalty Policy Committee.  Based on these considerations, we assumed that MMS could determine a  percentage of gross sales revenues equal to what would have been  collected prior to the Act if electricity prices do not change. We also  determined the impact of changing prices on royalty revenues as illustrated  in table 5. In assessing revenue impacts from leases that were currently  issued and not producing, we contacted BLM officials to ascertain the  likelihood for these leases to first start producing in the next 6 years and  the likelihood of producing leases to expand their production by more than  10 percent. We also discussed with industry officials their opinions on  paying royalties according to the netback process.", "To assess how royalty collections from future leases could be impacted, we  began to examine royalty data from the first 10 years for the 15 federal  geothermal projects, all of which first started producing prior to 1987. We  abandoned this attempt after conversing with MMS officials. MMS officials  noted that contracts for the sale of electricity prior to 2000 were different  and would probably not be representative of future situations. In addition,  sales in the 1980s often involved the sale of geothermal resources such as  steam and hot water rather than electricity, complicating the use of MMS\u2019s  royalty data. Although some industry officials said that their projections  suggest that royalties during the first 10 years of a project\u2019s life are  substantially less than the royalties during the remainder of the project\u2019s  life, we could not verify this estimate without actual royalty data.", "To assess how royalty collections from future leases could be impacted 10  years after they first produce, we proceed with examining royalty data for 7  of the projects from our original sample of 10 geothermal projects. We  calculated royalties as a percentage of gross sales revenues from January  2000 through December 2004 and compared their range with the range of  percentages prescribed within the Act for production after the first 10  years. We also compared royalties as the percentages of gross sales  revenues for five of the flash plants with royalties as a percentage of gross  sales revenues for two of the binary plants. We found that flash plants paid  royalties from 0.6 to 6.3 percent of gross sales revenues while binary plants  paid from 0.2 to 2.6 percent of gross sales revenues. It appeared to us that  each project, whether flash or binary, faces unique geological, economic,  and engineering situations that can combine to yield different percentages  of gross sales revenues. In addition, the small number of observations and  the significant overlap in range of the data indicated to us that  generalizations about the difference in percentages between the two types  of plants would be inaccurate.", "To determine the impact of the Act on royalties from direct use of  geothermal resources, we obtained direct use royalty data from MMS and  reviewed the calculations on an alternative to the current calculation of  direct use royalties that appears in the report to the Royalty Policy  Committee."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of the Interior", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Dan Haas, Assistant Director;  Jeanne Barger; Ron Belak; John Delicath; Randy Jones; Frank Rusco; Anne  Stevens; and Barbara Timmerman made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
