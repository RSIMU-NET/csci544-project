In addition to simplifying the procurement process, the MAS program is designed to take advantage of the government's significant aggregate buying power. While GSA seeks to negotiate best pricing for its MAS contracts by analyzing vendor-provided information--such as discounts given to other customers and recent sales data for the same or similar items--past reports have found that GSA has not always used pricing tools effectively and that management controls for better ensuring fair and reasonable pricing had been reduced. This report discusses GSA's process for negotiating most favored customer prices for MAS contracts and its efforts to improve the overall quality of negotiations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Contract negotiators at the four MAS acquisition centers that GAO reviewed use a variety of tools for obtaining most favored customer pricing--that is, the prices vendors offer their best customers. However, the GAO analysis of GSA's review of selected fiscal year 2004 MAS contract files found that nearly 60 percent lacked the documentation needed to establish clearly that the prices were effectively negotiated. Specifically, the contract documentation did not establish that negotiated prices were based on accurate, complete, and current vendor information; adequate price analyses; and reasonable price negotiations. GSA's efforts to ensure most favored customer pricing have been hindered by the significant decline in the use of pre-award and postaward audits of pre-award pricing information, two independent pricing tools that have helped GSA avoid or recover hundreds of millions of dollars in excessive pricing. In fiscal year 1995, GSA conducted 154 pre-award audits; by 2004 the number of pre-award audits fell to 40. Postaward audits--which resulted in an average annual recovery of $18 million in the early 1990s--were discontinued in 1997 when GSA revised its MAS contract audit policies to increase the use of pre-award audits--an increase that has not materialized. In March 2003, GSA established the Acquisition Quality Measurement and Improvement Program, initiating the use of prenegotiation panels and postaward quality reviews of contracts. However, the effectiveness of these initiatives has been limited due to insufficient oversight. For example, three of the MAS acquisition centers that GAO visited had not reported the results of their 2003 prenegotiation panels--information needed by management to identify problems and make needed improvements. Moreover, the fourth acquisition center--which accounted for about 56 percent of the fiscal year 2004 MAS sales--has yet to hold a panel. While the postaward quality reviews--the second program initiative--have identified deficiencies in contract file documentation, they did not determine the underlying causes of these deficiencies or prescribe actions needed to address them. As a result of these weaknesses, GSA cannot be assured that fair and reasonable prices have been negotiated for its MAS contracts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, the federal government spends billions of dollars to buy  commercial products and professional services through the General  Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) multiple award schedules (MAS)  program.

MAS, the largest FSS program, is designed to provide federal  agencies with a simplified method for acquiring varying quantities of a  wide range of commercially available goods and services, such as office  furniture and supplies, personal computers, scientific equipment, library  services, network support, and laboratory testing services. The MAS  program provides several advantages to both federal agencies and  vendors. Agencies can use a simplified method of acquisition and avoid  other procurement methods to purchase these items, which can be time- consuming and administratively costly. Vendors can receive wider  exposure of their commercial products and expend less effort to sell their  products.", "In administering the MAS program, GSA is responsible for ensuring that all  procurement regulations are followed and MAS prices reflect the  government\u2019s aggregate buying power. GSA awards indefinite-quantity  contracts to multiple vendors supplying comparable commercial goods  and services and provides the contracts categorized under various  schedules to federal agencies.  MAS contract awards are based on the  results of price negotiations between contract negotiators and individual  vendors. GSA negotiators seek to obtain discounts from a vendor\u2019s  commercial price list, which are equal to or greater than the vendor\u2019s most  favored customer\u2019s discounts. The most favored customer is a customer or  category of customers that receives the best discounts from the vendor\u2019s  commercial price list when purchasing quantities comparable to the  government\u2019s under similar terms and conditions.

Beginning in the late 1990s, MAS program sales  increased significantly (see fig. 1).", "In fiscal year 2004, the Information Technology Acquisition Center had the  largest MAS sales volume with more than $18 billion (about 56 percent) of  total MAS sales. Figure 2 shows the MAS sales for fiscal year 2004 by GSA  acquisition center. (See app. II for a description of the products and  services offered through each of the acquisition centers.)", "As MAS sales volume skyrocketed over the last decade, the number of  contracts offering goods and services to federal agencies also increased.

For  example, in August 2001, the GSA Inspector General reported that a  photocopier vendor offered state and local governments a price that was  $5,582 less than its price to GSA for the same type copier; the Inspector  General estimated that the higher price paid by GSA customers could cost  them nearly $4 million more in just one year. In another example, the  Inspector General found that a major distributor of information  technology products sold its top 10 GSA-selling computer models to  commercial customers at an average price that was 6 percent less that the  price offered under the MAS contract.

Between fiscal years  1998 through 2004, the total savings reported had dropped to about $125.9  million\u2014an average of nearly $18 million per year (see fig. 7).", "According to Inspector General and MAS contracting officials, the decline  in pre-award audits was largely due to an organizational culture that  stressed making awards quickly and because pre-award audits were not  emphasized institutionally in GSA. For example, the performance goal for  negotiating and awarding MAS contracts for the Office Supply and  Administrative Services Acquisition Center is 79 days\u2014a goal that would  be difficult to meet if pre-award audits, which take on average 90 or more  days to complete, were to be conducted.

In June 2003, GSA issued  guidance that recognized the importance of pre-award audits to the  evaluation of MAS price proposals and a clear determination regarding fair  and reasonable pricing. The guidance instructs contract negotiators to  request audit assistance for new contract offers and extensions when the  dollar value for estimated sales exceeds $25 million for the 5-year contract  period. We applied the $25 million threshold to MAS contracts awarded or  extended in fiscal year 2003 and identified about 34 new contracts and 37  contract extensions that were subject to pre-award audits.

Inspector General officials told  us that they believe postaward audits of negotiation information are a key  pricing tool and a deterrent to vendor pricing abuse.", "Despite the significant recoveries, postaward audits of pre-award pricing  information have not been conducted since 1997\u2014when GSA issued a  final rule, changing its policy.  Specifically, GSA removed language from  the examination of records clause that automatically granted postaward  audit rights for pre-award pricing information in every MAS contract.  GSA expected the reduction in these postaward audits to be offset by an  increase in the number of pre-award audits. However, the anticipated  increased use of pre-award audits has not materialized.", "While the policy changes greatly limited the use of postaward audits of  pre-award pricing information, we found that it did not expressly eliminate  its use. Under GSA\u2019s revised regulations, the contracting officer can  modify the examination of records clause to provide for access to pre- award pricing information for 2 years after contract award or  modification. To modify the examination of records clause, the  contracting officer must, first, determine that there is a likelihood of  significant harm to the government without access to verify the  information.  Such determination must be made on a schedule-by-schedule  basis.  Secondly, the contracting officer must obtain the senior  procurement executive\u2019s approval to modify the examination of records  clause of the contract.

However, we found five contracts that exceeded the threshold and,  therefore, were subject to a clearance panel.  Specifically, in fiscal year  2003, GSA awarded four contracts with total estimated sales values  ranging from $102.5 million to $700 million and extended one contract  with an estimated sales value of $20.3 billion. Each of these met the  threshold for a panel.", "Each of the remaining three centers\u2014which, combined, administered $6.5  billion, or about 20.1 percent, of fiscal year 2004 MAS sales\u2014had  conducted a small number of panels in the past year.  The Office Supplies  and Administrative Services Center held 10 panels, the Services  Acquisition Center held 9 panels, and the National Furniture Center held 6  panels. According to the management officials and contract negotiators at  these centers, the panels helped prepare them to successfully negotiate  most significant MAS contracts. For example, officials at the Office  Supplies and Administrative Services Center stated that the panels helped  contract negotiators learn how to better negotiate large, sensitive, and  controversial contracts. The officials at all three centers also stated that  clearance panels helped in identifying inconsistencies in the  documentation and analyses used to develop their negotiation objectives.  The officials further noted that because these reviews have been a  valuable prenegotiation technique, they lowered the dollar threshold  required for a panel review to increase the number of panel reviews.  For  example, the Office Supplies and Administrative Services Center officials  reduced the center\u2019s threshold from $5 million to $2 million so that more  contracts would qualify for panel review.", "While these efforts helped centers prepare for negotiating their most  significant MAS contracts, GSA officials responsible for overseeing the  MAS program were unaware of the effectiveness of the panels.

For  example, GSA completed its review at only one of its seven centers\u2014the  Services Acquisition Center. According to MAS program managers, a lack  of resources and reviewers and concerns about the independence of the  available reviewers prevented them from conducting more reviews.

More important, we are concerned that GSA\u2019s position  understates the seriousness of the problem it has in ensuring that GSA  contracting officials are effectively negotiating MAS contract prices.  In  addition to its own quality reviews, our report shows the use of pre-award  audits and the millions of dollars in savings from such audits have  declined dramatically in recent years.  We also reported that the use of  prenegotiation clearance panels, designed to ensure quality of significant  contract negotiations, has been limited.  Such problems are not new.  For  example, the GSA Inspector General reported in August 2001 that (1) GSA  contracting officials were not consistently negotiating most favored  customer prices, (2) contracts were being extended with little negotiation  or price analysis, and (3) pre-award audits had decreased significantly in  recent years.  Clearly, these problems are serious, longstanding, and have  significant financial consequences.  Thus, we believe GSA needs to place  priority attention on obtaining adequate documentation to ensure its  contracting officials are effectively negotiating MAS contract prices.", "Third, GSA commented that while our report points to a significant decline  in the number of pre-award and postaward audits, it does not address the  factors that contributed to this decline.  We disagree. As discussed in our  report, MAS contracting officials and Inspector General officials identified  a number of factors that in the past contributed to the reduction of the  number of pre-award audits.  These factors include an organizational  culture that stresses making contract awards quickly and performance  measures that focus on timeliness.  The reduction of the number of  opportunities for conducting pre-award audits caused by the extension of  contract performance period from 1 year\u2014the contract period in the mid- 1990s\u2014to 5 years was also cited as a factor. However, according to GSA it  receives more than 3,000 new MAS contract offers each year.  Despite  these opportunities to conduct pre-award audits, the number of pre-award  audits has only increased from 14 in fiscal year 2003 to 40 in fiscal year  2004.", "Fourth, GSA expressed concern about our understanding of the regulatory  framework required for postaward audits of commercial contracts and  that we underestimated the risk and overestimated the savings associated  with these postaward audits.  We are aware that the 1997 change to GSA\u2019s  regulations stimulated substantial disagreement and discussion  concerning the extent of GSA audit authority.  GSA received numerous  comments asserting that the Clinger-Cohen Act (PL 104-106) eliminated its  authority to conduct postaward audits of pre-award pricing information.   Similar views were expressed in post enactment language by the House  Armed Services Committee in House Report 104-563.  Although GSA  concluded that it retained authority for postaward audits, GSA\u2019s final rule  restricted the use of postaward audits.  Specifically, the final rule allows  the contracting officer to modify the Examination of Records by GSA  (Multiple Award Schedule) clause to provide for postaward audits only  \u201cafter the contracting officer makes a determination that there is a  likelihood of significant harm to the Government without access to verify  the information and obtains the Senior Procurement Executive\u2019s  approval.\u201d  We have not recommended that GSA change the postaward  audit restriction.  Rather, we have noted that contracting officers do not  understand the rule and need guidance to fulfill their responsibilities  under the rule.  Regarding the savings associated with postaward audits,  the estimates were produced and reported by GSA\u2019s Inspector General.", "Fifth, GSA commented that because the Acquisition Quality Management  and Improvement Program has yet to be fully implemented, it is not  reasonable to evaluate the adequacy of the program in achieving  improvements. This misses the point.  We believe that improvements  should be made when the need for them are identified regardless of the  program\u2019s implementation stage.  For example, we found that the program  when it was launched in March 2003 was limited to two initiatives\u2014 prenegotiation panels and quality reviews\u2014and that other initiatives key  to a successful improvement program, such as training, were not formally  included as an initiative under the program.  Coincident with our finding,  GSA has initiated a training program.", "Finally, GSA commented that it had made a commitment to establishing a  culture of quality contracting and identified 12 improvement actions taken  since November 2001.  Our report identifies five of these actions:  establishing the Acquisition Quality Measurement and Improvement  Program; implementing a contract quality measure in the individual  performance plan for each contracting associate; developing on-line and  classroom training courses and modules for FSS contracting professionals  via FSS Center for Acquisition Excellence; forming an IG Working Group  to focus on the need for pre-award audits; and increasing the number of  contracting associates.  The remaining seven improvement actions either  were not directly related to the issues in our report or were implemented  after we completed our fieldwork.  Therefore, we are not in a position to  comment on these improvement actions.", "GSA also made a number of technical comments, which we respond to in  appendix III.", "As agreed, unless you publicly announce its contents earlier, we plan no  further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date. At that  time, we will send copies of this report to the Honorable Stephen A.

We discussed implementation of GSA  policies, procedures, and management controls with agency officials at  GSA\u2019s Office of Acquisition Management in Arlington, Virginia; Office of  Performance Improvement and the Office of Government-wide Policy in  Washington, D.C.; and the GSA\u2019s Office of Inspector General in  Washington, D.C. Also, we visited the Office Supplies and Administrative  Services Acquisition Center in New York, New York; and the National  Furniture Acquisition Center, Services Acquisition Center, and Information  Technology Center in Arlington, Virginia. We obtained and analyzed GSA  data on MAS contract awards and sales volume as recorded in the Federal  Supply Service Automated Supply System FSS-19 used by GSA to procure  and distribute supplies across the federal government. To help ensure  reliability of FSS-19 data, we reviewed the results of the GSA Inspector  General\u2019s audit of the system\u2019s internal controls and tests of application  controls completed in support of GSA\u2019s fiscal year 2003 consolidate and  combined financial statements. Also, we reviewed GSA Inspector General  reports, analyzed cost avoidance and cost recovery estimates, and  discussed these data with GSA Inspector General officials.", "Further, we reviewed contract files and discussed price negotiation  practices and tool use with management officials and contract negotiators  responsible for selected MAS contracts at four of GSA\u2019s seven MAS  acquisition centers.  At these centers, we reviewed the contract files that  GSA had randomly selected for review under their Acquisition Quality  Measurement and Improvement Program. Based on our review of price  negotiation procedures and discussions with acquisition center  management officials concerning the GSA selected MAS contracts, we  developed a flowchart of the contract price negotiation process identifying  tools used and controls over their use.", "To determine how GSA assesses the overall effectiveness of MAS contract  price negotiations, we reviewed GSA policies, procedures, and efforts to  evaluate the quality of MAS contract negotiations and awards, identify and  implement needed improvements, and communicate best practices  throughout the acquisition community.

We  reviewed prior GAO and GSA Inspector General findings on GSA\u2019s MAS  contract price negotiations. Further, we analyzed the 2003 and 2004 results  of GSA\u2019s Post Award Contract Reviews and for selected contracts,  interviewed responsible acquisition center and contract negotiation  officials to evaluate the quality of GSA\u2019s review, identify underlying cause  for unacceptable price negotiations, and document corrective actions  taken."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: MAS Acquisition Centers\u2019 Products and Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  The language in our report is consistent with the language in the  General Services Administration Acquisition Manual (GSAM).   Specifically, GSAM 538.270 Evaluation of multiple award schedule  (MAS) offers states :\u201c(a) The Government will seek to obtain the  offeror\u2019s best price (the best price given to the most favored  customer).  However, the Government recognizes that the terms and  conditions of commercial sales vary and there may be legitimate  reasons why the best price is not achieved.\u201d  Further, GSA states in the  supplementary information to its final rule, 62 Fed. Reg. 44,518, 44,519  (August 21, 1997) that; \u201cThe pursuit of \u201cmost favored customer\u201d pricing  as a goal is consistent with commercial practice and totally consistent  with the objective of negotiating a fair and reasonable price.\u201d   2.  Technical revision has been made.  3.  Technical revision has been made.  4.  The language in our report is consistent with the language cited in  comment 1; however, we added the language that notes GSA\u2019s pricing  goals.  Also, while GSA encourages its customer agencies to negotiate  further discounts at the time they place an order, the focus of our work  was on how GSA negotiates MAS contract prices, not on the  responsibilities of GSA\u2019s customer agencies.  5.  The language in our report is consistent with the language cited in  comment 1.    6.  Technical revision has been made.  7.  Without documentation that establishes clearly that the contract  negotiations were conducted using accurate, complete, and current  pricing information and adequate price analyses; GSA cannot ensure  that negotiation objectives were properly established and the prices  were effectively negotiated. Historically, pre-award audits have  allowed GSA to avoid hundreds of millions of dollars in overpricing.   Between fiscal years 1992 and 1997 the GSA Inspector General  averaged about 125 pre-award audits each year and reported a total of  nearly $496 million in savings\u2014an average of nearly $83 million per  year.  In August 2001, as pre-award audits continued to decline, the  Inspector General reported that contracting officers were not  consistently negotiating most favored customer pricing because they  often failed to evaluate and quantify differences between commercial  pricing and schedule terms and conditions.  As discussed in our report,  the Inspector General provided specific examples of overpricing with  millions of dollars in potential overpayments by GSA customers. While  the number of pre-award audits GSA completed increased from 14 to  40 between fiscal years 2003 and 2004, we do not view this increase as  significant\u2014especially given the skyrocketing MAS sales.    8.  In fiscal year 2003, GSA was to complete quality reviews of 11 GSA  activities, including all 7 of the MAS acquisition centers.  However,  GSA completed and reported on only one center\u2014the Services  Acquisition Center.  According to GSA officials, the results of its fiscal  year 2004 review would be issued in October 2004.  This date slipped  several times to December 31, 2004, to January 7, 2005, and now to  sometime in February 2005.  We believe that better oversight early in  the program\u2019s implementation could have helped the program better  meet its established milestones.     9.  Our review focused on how GSA negotiates most favored customer  prices for MAS contracts and assesses the overall effectiveness of  these price negotiations.  We did not look at how GSA\u2019s customer  agencies order items and services from MAS contracts.  10.  The language in our report is consistent with the language cited in  comment 1.    11.  Technical revisions have been made.  12.  We support the use of quality reviews and believe they are a good first  step to improved MAS contact negotiations, as we noted in our report.   However, we also believe that identifying specific causes of  documentation deficiencies and the requirement for action plans  addressing these causes would increase the effectiveness of GSA\u2019s  quality reviews.", "GSA asserts that the improvement in contract documentation at the  Service Acquisition Center is a direct result of their quality reviews.   The evidence we have been provided does not support this assertion.   While GSA\u2019s June 2004 quality review of the Service Acquisition Center  found that contract documentation had improved since its fiscal year  2003 review, we learned during the course of our review that the  Service Acquisition Center began a continuous improvement program  about 4 years ago and that one of the Center\u2019s divisions had been  developing tools and standardized documents to have an audit trail of  the information that was used and how decisions were made in  negotiating the contract.  Because the Center\u2019s efforts pre-date GSA\u2019s  quality reviews, it is unclear to what extent the Center\u2019s improvement  efforts and the reviews had on the documentation improvements.", "GAO recognizes that GSA has initiated a number of efforts to better  ensure contract quality, and our report identifies those that are  relevant to our review.  However, because these efforts were recently  implemented, we did not assess and cannot comment on their  effectiveness.  13.  Our findings are based on the 28 contract reviews completed as of  September 2004.  For these reviews, the GSA reviewers stated that  most favored customer pricing was not clearly established for 27.  The  additional seven reviews and reexaminations were expected in  October 2004, they were not completed until February 2005.   Therefore, we have no basis to comment on either GSA\u2019s additional  seven reviews or their reexamination of the September 2004 consensus  reports.   14.  Our report describes the use of pre-award audits and their conduct by  the GSA Inspector General for contract negotiators.  15.  As discussed in our report, MAS contracting officials and Inspector  General officials identified a number of factors that in the past  contributed to the reduction of the number of pre-award audits.  These  factors include an organizational culture that stresses making contract  awards quickly and performance measures that focus on timeliness.   The reduction in the number of opportunities for conducting pre- award audits caused by the extension of contract performance period  from 1 year\u2014the contract period in the mid-1990s\u2014to 5 years was also  cited as a factor.  However, despite the 5-year contract period, GSA  increased the number of pre-award audits from 14 in fiscal year 2003 to  40 in fiscal year 2004 and plans to complete 70 in fiscal year 2005.   Moreover, according to GSA, it received more than 3,000 new MAS  contract offers each year, presenting GSA with numerous  opportunities for pre-award audits.  Therefore, we do not believe that  the extension of MAS contracts from 1 to 5 years was a major  underlying cause of the dramatic decline in pre-award audits over the  last decade.  16.  We asked contract negotiators why they did not request pre-award  audits on new contract offers, as required by GSA.  According to the  contract negotiators, the performance goal for awarding a new  contract did not allow enough time for pre-award audits. While we  agree that establishing a performance measure to reduce cycle times  may be warranted, it must be balanced with other measures of quality,  as GSA points out.", "We also agree that increasing the number of pre-award audits from 14  to 40 shows progress; however, we do not believe that this increase  can be characterized as \u201csignificant\u201d\u2014especially when an average of  125 audits were completed annually in the early 1990s and GSA  receives more than 3,000 new schedule offers annually.  17.  We agree with GSA\u2019s proposed actions.  18.  Identifying underlying or \u201croot\u201d causes is essential for correcting  process deficiencies.  While GSA notes that FSS management intends  to identify such causes, we believe GSA missed an opportunity to do so  through its formal review. Further, it is unclear how FSS management  plans to identify the underlying causes.  Regardless, we believe that  expending resources to resolve deficiencies without first determining  the causes of the deficiencies unnecessarily increases the risk that  improvement efforts will not succeed and resources spent will be  wasted.  19.  The acquisition letter implementing the quality reviews identifies the  seven critical factors.  While all of these critical factors could involve  contracting pricing in some manner, only three factors specifically  address pricing."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
