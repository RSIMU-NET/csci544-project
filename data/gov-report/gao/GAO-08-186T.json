These projects are critical to the success of the overall program, which will return humans to spaceflight after Space Shuttle retirement in 2010. To reduce the gap in human spaceflight, NASA plans to launch Ares I and Orion in 2015--5 years after the Shuttle's retirement. GAO has issued a number of reports and testimonies that touch on various aspects of NASA's Constellation Program, particularly the development efforts underway for the Orion and Ares I projects. These reports and testimonies have questioned the affordability and overall acquisition strategy for each project. NASA has revised the Orion acquisition strategy and delayed the Ares I preliminary design review based on GAO's recommendations in these reports. In addition, GAO continues to monitor these projects on an ongoing basis at the request of members of Congress. Based on this work, GAO was asked to testify on the types of challenges that NASA faces in developing the Ares I and Orion vehicles and identify the key indicators that decision makers could use to assess risks associated with common trouble spots in development. The information in this testimony is based on work completed in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NASA is currently working toward preliminary design reviews for the Ares I and Orion vehicles. While this is a phase for discovery and risk reduction, there are considerable unknowns as to whether NASA's plans for these vehicles can be executed within schedule goals and what these efforts will ultimately cost. This is primarily because NASA is still in the process of defining many performance requirements. Such uncertainties could affect the mass, loads, and weight requirements for the vehicles. NASA is aiming to complete this process in 2008, but it will be challenged to do so given the level of knowledge that still needs to be attained. The challenges NASA is facing pose risks to the successful outcome of the projects. For example: both vehicles have a history of weight issues; excessive vibration during launch threatens system design; Uncertainty about how flight characteristics will be impacted by a fifth segment added to the Ares I launch vehicle; Ares I upper stage essentially requires development of a new engine; no industry capability currently exists for producing the kind of heat shields that the Orion will need for protecting the crew exploration vehicle when it reenters Earth's atmosphere; and existing test facilities are insufficient for testing Ares I's new engine, for replicating the engine's vibration and acoustic environment, and for testing the thermal protection system for the Orion vehicle. All these unknowns, as well as others, leave NASA in the position of being unable to provide firm cost estimates for the projects at this point. Meanwhile, tight deadlines are putting additional pressure on both the Ares I and Orion projects. Future requirements changes raise risks that both projects could experience cost and schedule problems. GAO's past work on space systems acquisition and the practices of leading developers identifies best practices that can provide decision makers with insight into the progress of development at key junctures, facilitate Congressional oversight, and support informed decision making. This work has also identified common red flags throughout development, which decision makers need to keep in mind when assessing the projects. They include: Key indicators: Weight growth is often among the highest drivers of cost growth. Unanticipated software complexity, often indicated by increases in the number of lines of code, can portend cost and schedule growth. Key junctures: The preliminary design review, critical design review, and production review are key junctures that involve numerous steps and help focus the agency on realistic accomplishments within reachable goals. A disciplined approach aligned with key indicators can provide the knowledge needed to make informed investment decisions at each review."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss challenges that the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) faces in developing the  systems to achieve its goals for the President\u2019s Vision for Space  Exploration. We have been focusing our work primarily on the Ares I  Crew Launch Vehicle and the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle, as they are  among the first major efforts conducted as part of NASA\u2019s Constellation  Program to support implementation of the Vision and represent a  substantial investment for NASA. Over $7 billion in contracts has already  been awarded\u2014and nearly $230 billion is estimated to be ultimately spent  over the next two decades. Moreover, NASA is under pressure to develop  the vehicles quickly, as the Space Shuttle\u2019s retirement in 2010 means that  there could be at least a 5-year gap in our nation\u2019s ability to send humans  to space.", "In summary, NASA is currently working toward preliminary design  reviews for the vehicles\u2014a milestone that successful development  organizations use to make hard decisions about whether a program should  proceed with development. While this is a phase for discovery and risk  reduction, there are considerable unknowns as to whether NASA\u2019s plans  for the Ares I and Orion vehicles can be executed within schedule goals, as  well as what these efforts will ultimately cost. In fact, we do not know yet  whether the architecture and design solutions selected by NASA will work  as intended. This is primarily because NASA is still in the process of  defining both of the projects\u2019 performance requirements and some of these  uncertainties could affect the mass, loads, and weight requirements for the  vehicles. It is also working through significant technical risks, such as  oscillation within the first stage of the Ares I vehicle, which computer  modeling indicates could cause unacceptable structural vibrations.", "NASA is aiming to complete preliminary design reviews for the Ares I and  Orion this year, scheduled for August 2008 Ares I and September 2008  respectively, but it will be challenged in doing so given the level of  knowledge that still needs to be attained. In addition, to minimize the gap  in human spaceflight caused by the shuttle\u2019s retirement, there is a high  degree of concurrency within the projects. Our prior work has shown that  concurrent development, especially when new technologies are involved,  increases the risk that significant problems will be discovered as the  systems\u2019 designs are integrated that could result in cost and schedule  delays. NASA\u2019s schedule leaves little room for the unexpected. If  something goes wrong with the development of the Ares I or the Orion, the  entire Constellation Program could be thrown off course and the return to  human spaceflight delayed.", "NASA recognizes the risks involved with its approach and has taken steps  to mitigate some of these risks.  It is important that, in mitigating risks,  NASA continually assess the viability of its plans for the Ares I and Orion.  The current state of play requires that NASA remain open to the possibility  that it may need to revisit decisions on its architecture and design as these  vehicles are expected to be in use for decades to come and decisions made  now will have long-term consequences.", "Moreover, with additional significant investment decisions still ahead, it is  important that agency decision makers and Congress maintain clear  insight into the progress the projects are making as well as any potential  problems. This type of oversight is important, not just for the Ares I and  Orion vehicles, but for the entire future exploration effort\u2014since  resources available to fund the Vision are constrained, as competition for  resources increases within the federal government over the next several  decades. In this regard, our work has identified specific markers that can  be used to (1) assess NASA\u2019s progress in closing critical knowledge gaps  and (2) identify issues that could result in cost growth, schedule delays, or  decreased performance. In other words, they can be used to assess  whether there is a viable business case for pressing forward with the  projects.", "We have issued a number of reports and testimonies that touch on various  aspects of NASA\u2019s Constellation Program and in particular the  development efforts underway for the Orion and Ares I projects. These  reports and testimonies have questioned the affordability and overall  acquisition strategy for each project. In July 2006 we recommended that  NASA modify the Orion Crew Vehicle acquisition strategy to ensure the  agency did not commit itself to a long-term contractual obligation prior to  establishing a sound business case.  Although initially NASA disagreed  with our recommendation, the agency subsequently revised its acquisition  strategy to address some of the concerns we raised. In October 2007 we  recommended that NASA develop a sound business case supported by  firm requirements, mature technologies, a preliminary design, a realistic  cost estimate, and sufficient funding and time\u2014before proceeding beyond  preliminary design review.  NASA concurred with this recommendation  and subsequently slipped the Ares I preliminary design review from July  2008 to August 2008.", "My statement today is based on these products, as well as updated  information based on our continual monitoring of the projects at the  request of members of Congress.  To conduct these reviews, we analyzed  relevant project documentation, prior GAO reports, NASA documents, and  contractor information; interviewed program and project officials; and  reviewed NASA\u2019s risk management system for the Constellation Program.  Based on this work, my statement will specifically address the challenges  that NASA faces developing the Ares I and Orion vehicles with regard to  requirements definition, technology and hardware gaps, cost and schedule  estimates, and facilities needs. Further, I will provide key indicators that  decision makers could use to assess risks as the two development efforts  move forward.

Since  2005, however, NASA has made changes to the basic architecture for the  Ares I and Orion designs that have resulted in the diminished use of  heritage systems. This is due to the ability to achieve greater cost savings  with alternate technology and the inability to recreate heritage technology.  For example, the initial design was predicated on using the main engines  and the solid rocket boosters from the Space Shuttle Program. However,  NASA is no longer using the Space Shuttle Main Engines because greater  long-term cost savings are anticipated through the use of the J-2X engine.  In another example, NASA increased the number of segments on the Ares I  first-stage reusable solid rocket booster from four to five to increase  commonality between the Ares I and Ares V, and eliminate the need to  develop, modify, and certify both a four-segment reusable solid rocket  booster and an expendable Space Shuttle main engine for the Ares I.  Finally, according to the Orion program executive the Orion project  originally intended to use the heat shield from the Apollo program as a  fallback technology for the Orion thermal protection system, but was  unable to recreate the Apollo material.", "NASA has authorized the Ares I and Orion projects to proceed with  awarding development contracts.  In April 2006, NASA awarded a $1.8  billion contract for design, development, test, and evaluation of the Ares I  first stage to Alliant Techsystems. NASA also awarded a $1.2 billion  contract for design, development, test, and evaluation of the Ares I upper  stage engine\u2014the J-2X\u2014to Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne in June 2006.  NASA is developing the upper stage and the upper stage instrument unit,  which contains the control systems and avionics for the Ares I, in-house.  However, NASA awarded a $514.7 million contract for design support and  production of the Ares I upper stage to the Boeing Company in August  2007. In August 2006, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin a $3.9 billion  contract to design, test, and build the Orion crew exploration vehicle.  According to NASA, the contract was modified in April 2007, namely by  adding 2 years to the design phase and two test flights of Orion's launch  abort system and by deleting the production of an cargo variant for the  International Space Station. NASA indicates that these changes increased  the contract value to $4.3 billion. Federal procurement data shows that an  additional modification has been signed which increased the value of the  contract by an additional $59 million.", "NASA has completed or is in the process of completing key reviews on  both the Ares I and Orion projects. NASA has completed the system  requirements review for each project and is in the midst of finalizing the  system definition reviews. At the systems requirements review, NASA  establishes a requirements baseline that serves as the basis for ongoing  design analysis work and systems testing.  Systems definition reviews  focus on emerging designs for all transportation elements and compare the  predicted performance of each element against the currently baselined  requirements.

Such uncertainty  has created knowledge gaps that are affecting many aspects of both  projects. Because the Orion vehicle is the payload that the Ares I must  deliver to orbit, changes in the Orion design, especially those that affect  weight, directly affect Ares I lift requirements.  Likewise, the lift capacity  of the Ares I drives the Orion design. Both the Orion and Ares I vehicles  have a history of weight and mass growth, and NASA is still defining the  mass, loads, and weight requirements for both vehicles.  According to  agency officials, continuing weight growth led NASA to rebaseline the  Orion vehicle design in fall 2007.  This process involved \u201cscrubbing\u201d the  Orion Vehicle to establish a zero-based design capable of meeting minimal  mission requirements but not safe for human flight. Beginning with the  zero-based design NASA first added back the systems necessary to ensure  crew safety and  then conducted a series of engineering trade-offs to  determine what other systems should be included to maximize the  probability of mission success while minimizing the system\u2019s weight.  As a  result of these trade-offs, NASA modified the requirement for nominal  landing on  land to nominal landing in water, thereby gaining 1500 lbs of  trade space in the Orion design.", "NASA recognizes that continued weight growth and requirements  instability are key risks facing the Orion project and that continued  instability in the Orion design is a risk facing the Ares I project. The Ares I  and Orion projects are working on these issues but have not yet finalized  requirements or design. Our previous work on systems acquisition work  shows that the preliminary design phase is an appropriate place to  conduct systems engineering to support requirement and resource trade- off decisions. For the Ares I project, this phase is scheduled to be  completed in August 2008, whereas for the Orion project, it is September  2008\u2014leaving NASA only 4 and 5 months respectively to close gaps in  requirements knowledge. NASA will be challenged to close such gaps,  given that it is still defining requirements at a relatively high level and  much work remains to be done at the lower levels.

Resolving this issue could require redesigns to both the Ares I and  Orion vehicles that could ultimately impact cost, schedule, and  performance. Furthermore, the addition of a fifth segment to the Ares I  first stage has the potential to impact qualification efforts for the first  stage and could result in costly requalification and redesign efforts.  Additionally, the J-2X engine represents a new engine development effort  that, both NASA and Pratt and Whitney Rocketdyne recognize, is likely to  experience failures during development. Addressing these failures is likely  to lead to design changes that could impact the project's cost and  schedule. With regard to the Orion project, there is currently no industry  capability for producing a thermal protection system of the size required  by the Orion. NASA has yet to develop a solution for this gap, and given  the size of the vehicle and the tight development schedule, a feasible  thermal protection system may not be available for initial operational  capability to the space station.

NASA is working under a self-imposed deadline to deliver the  new launch vehicles no later than 2015 in order to minimize the gap in  human spaceflight between the Space Shuttle\u2019s retirement in 2010 and the  availability of new transportation vehicles. The Constellation Program\u2019s  budget request maintains a confidence level of 65 percent (i.e., NASA is 65  percent certain that the actual cost of the program will either meet or be  less than the estimate) for program estimates based upon a 2015 initial  operational capability. Internally, however, the Ares I and Orion projects  are working toward an earlier initial operational capability (2013), but at a  reduced budget confidence level\u201433 percent.

Due to  the tight schedule and long-lead nature of engine development, the J-2X  project was required to start out earlier in its development than the other  elements on the Ares I vehicle. This approach has introduced a high  degree of concurrency between the setting of overall Ares I requirements  and the development of the J-2X design and hardware. Consequently, the  engine development is out of sync with the first stage and upper stage in  the flow-down and decomposition of requirements, an approach our past  work has shown to be fraught with risk. NASA acknowledges that the  engine development is proceeding with an accepted risk that future  requirements changes may affect the engine design and that the engine  may not complete development as scheduled in December 2012. The J-2X  development effort represents a critical path for the Ares I project.  Subsequently, delays in the J-2X schedule for design, development, test,  and evaluation would have a ripple effect of cost and schedule impacts  throughout the entire Ares I project.", "The schedule for the first stage also presents a potential issue for the  entire Ares I project.

The  first critical design review is scheduled for November 2009, 5 months  before the Ares I project critical design review. At this point, however, the  project will not have fully tested the first stage development motors. The  second critical design review, in December 2010, occurs after additional  testing of developmental motors is conducted. By conducting the Ares I  critical design review before the first stage project critical design review,  the project could prematurely begin full-scale test and integration  activities a full 9 months before the first stage design has demonstrated  maturity.

Further, the Orion risk  system indicates that schedule delays associated with testing may occur.  The current Orion design has high predicted vibration and acoustic levels.  Historically, components designed and qualified for uncertain vibration  and acoustic environments have resulted in some failures and required  subsequent redesign and retest. Failures during qualification testing of  Orion components may lead to schedule delays associated with  redesigning components.", "NASA\u2019s Administrator has publicly stated that if Congress provided the  Agency an additional $2 billion that NASA could accelerate the  Constellation program\u2019s initial operational capability date to 2013.  We  believe that this assessment is highly optimistic.  The development  schedule for the J-2X engine, the critical path for the Ares I development,  is already recognized as aggressive, allowing less than 7 years for  development.  The development of the Space Shuttle Main engine by  comparison took 9 years. Further, NASA anticipates that the J-2X engine is  likely to require 29 rework cycles to correct problems identified during  testing.

These include areas commonly  underestimated in space programs, such as weight growth and software  complexity, as well as indicators used by best practice organizations to  assess readiness to move forward in the development cycle. Space  programs which we have studied in detail in the past have tended to  underestimate cost in some of these areas.", "Our previous work on government-funded space systems has shown that  weight growth is often not anticipated even though it is among the highest  drivers of cost growth for space systems. Weight growth can affect the  hardware needed to support a system, and, in the case of launch vehicles,  the power or thrust required for the system. As the weight of a particular  system increases, the power or thrust required for that system will also  increase. This could result in the need to develop additional power or  thrust capability to lift the system, leading to additional costs, or to  stripping down the vehicle to accommodate current power or thrust  capability. For example, NASA went through the process to zero-base the  design for the Orion to address weight concerns. Continual monitoring of  system weight and required power/thrust, as well as margins or reserves  for additional growth, can provide decision makers with an indicator of  whether cost increases can be anticipated.", "The complexity of software development on a system, often denoted by  the number of lines of code on a system, can also be used as an indicator  to monitor whether a program will meet cost and schedule goals. In our  work on software development best practices, we have reported that the  Department of Defense has attributed significant cost and schedule  overruns on software-intensive systems to developing and delivering  software. Generally, the greater the number of lines of code, the more  complicated the system development. Changes to the amount of code  needed to be produced can indicate potential cost and schedule problems.  Decision makers can monitor this indicator by continually asking for  information on the estimated amount of code needed on a system and  inquiring about any increases in need and their impact on cost and  schedule.", "There are other areas, such as the use of heritage systems and industrial  base capability that are commonly underestimated in space programs as  well.

In addition, we have reported that this  type of approach is being embraced by the Ares I project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["In conclusion, the President\u2019s Vision for Space Exploration is an ambitious  effort, not just because there will be technical and design challenges to  building systems needed to achieve the Vision\u2019s goals, but because there  are limited resources within which this can be accomplished.  Moreover,  the long-term nature of the Vision means that commitments for funding  and to the goals of the Vision will need to be sustained across presidential  administrations and changes in congressional leadership.  For these  reasons, it is exceedingly important that the right decisions are made early  on and that decision-makers have the right knowledge going forward so  that they can make informed investment decisions.", "In looking at the first major investments, the Ares I and Orion projects, it is  important to recognize that they are risky endeavors, largely due to their  complexity, scope, and interdependencies.  It is also important to  recognize that the desire to minimize the gap in human space flight adds  considerable risk, since it could limit NASA's ability to study emerging  problems and pursue alternative ways of addressing them.  For these  reasons, as well as the magnitude of investment at stake, it is imperative  that NASA be realistic and open about the progress it is making and to be  willing to make changes to the architecture and design if technical  problems can not be solved without overly compromising performance.  Additionally, Congress needs to be well-informed about the extent to  which knowledge gaps remain and what tradeoffs or additional resources  are needed to close those gaps and to support changes if they are  determined to be necessary.  The upcoming preliminary design review  milestones represent perhaps the most critical juncture where these  assessments can take place and where hard decisions can be made as to  whether the programs should proceed forward.  It may well be the last  opportunity to make significant adjustments before billions of dollars are  spent and long term commitments become solidified.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
