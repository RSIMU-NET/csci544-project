The new process involves three steps. First, VA headquarters proposes medical center allocation amounts to networks using a standardized resource allocation model. The model includes a standardized measure of workload that recognizes the varying costs and levels of resource intensity associated with providing care for each patient at each medical center. Second, network officials review the proposed amounts and have the flexibility to adjust them if they believe that certain medical centers' resource needs are not appropriately accounted for in the model. Third, networks report final medical center allocation amounts to VA headquarters and any adjustments made to the allocation amounts proposed by the model. VA headquarters did not ask networks to report reasons for each adjustment made to allocation amounts; networks reported reasons for some adjustments, but not for others. VA officials said that the new network resource allocation process was not intended to be used to question networks' decision making, but to increase the transparency of networks' allocation decisions to VA headquarters while maintaining network flexibility. However, absent rationales from networks on all adjustments made to medical center allocation amounts, transparency for decisions made through the allocation process is limited. Furthermore, understanding why networks make adjustments is key in determining if any modifications to the model are needed for subsequent years. VA officials told GAO that they intend to conduct annual assessments of the new resource allocation process, including a review of adjustments to the model, to identify areas for improvement. VA centrally monitors the resources networks have allocated to medical centers to ensure spending does not exceed allocations, but does not have written policies documenting these practices for monitoring resources. VA monitors resources through two primary practices--automated controls in its financial management system and regular reviews of network spending. Specifically, VA's financial management system electronically tracks the amount of resources that networks and medical centers have available--the resources allocated, less the resources already spent--and prevents medical centers from spending more than what they have available by rejecting spending requests in excess of available resources. In addition, each month VA headquarters officials compare each network's spending with what the network planned to spend and determine whether spending is on target, and whether any differences from the plan are significant. However, VA headquarters does not have written policies documenting the agency's practices for monitoring resources, which is not consistent with federal internal control standards. These standards state that internal controls should be documented, and all documentation should be properly managed, maintained, and readily available for examination. Without written policies, there is an increased risk of inconsistent monitoring of VA network and medical center resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA (1) require networks to provide rationales for all adjustments made to allocations proposed by VA's resource allocation model, and (2) develop written policies to document practices for monitoring resources.

We assessed  the reliability of the fiscal year 2011 allocation data by interviewing agency  officials knowledgeable about the data and the new process used to  determine the allocations. We also interviewed VA officials about the tests  of reliability that they conducted on the data. We determined that the data  we used were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.

Seventy-eight  percent, or approximately $37.8 billion, of the nearly $48.2 billion in VA\u2019s  advance appropriations for health care services for fiscal year 2011 were  allocated to VA\u2019s 21 networks for general purpose patient care. VA also  allocates resources to networks and medical centers for specific purposes,  such as prosthetics, transplant care, and preventive and primary care  initiatives. For fiscal year 2011, 22 percent, or approximately $10.4 billion,  of VA\u2019s advance appropriations for health care services were provided to  networks and medical centers for specific purposes.

VERA  determines how much each network will receive according to each  network\u2019s activities and needs in the following areas: patient care,  equipment, nonrecurring maintenance, education support, and research  support. We have previously reported that VERA is a reasonably sound  methodology for VA to allocate resources to networks, although we have  made recommendations to improve the methodology, some of which VA  has incorporated.

(See fig. 1.) Networks do not provide resources  directly to medical centers; rather VA headquarters retains responsibility  for providing these resources based on network allocation decisions.", "Prior to fiscal year 2011, VA permitted networks to develop and use their  own methodologies for determining how to allocate general purpose  resources to medical centers. VA headquarters provided general guidance  to networks on the principles they should use when determining their  allocation methodologies. For fiscal year 2010, for example, VA\u2019s guidance  stated that networks were expected to allocate resources to medical  centers in a manner that must, among other things, be readily  understandable and result in predictable allocations, and support the goal  of improving equitable access to care and ensure appropriate allocation of  resources to facilities to meet that goal.", "Given the relative autonomy that the 21 networks have under VA\u2019s  decentralized health care system, they developed varying allocation  methodologies. For example, networks varied in the factors they  considered in determining medical center allocations. These factors  included prior year funding, patient workload, performance, and facility  square footage. Nonetheless, VA headquarters required networks to report  descriptions of their allocation methodologies, including a description of  how the methodology met VA\u2019s guiding principles for network allocation.  Each network was also required to report the total amount of resources it  retained at the network level\u2014the portion of network general purpose  resources set aside before allocations were made to medical centers at the  beginning of the fiscal year\u2014such as resources for network operations,  network initiatives, and emergencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s New Allocation Process Uses a Standardized Model, but Transparency of Networks\u2019 Allocation Decisions Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2011, VA implemented a new resource allocation process that  includes a standardized model for networks to use in allocating general  purpose resources to their medical centers. The model was designed to  provide consistency in the allocation process across networks and still  allow networks the flexibility to make adjustments to medical center  allocations. However, VA headquarters did not require networks to report  reasons for all of the adjustments networks made to their medical centers\u2019  allocations, which limits the transparency of networks\u2019 allocation  decisions.", "The new process involves three steps\u2014first, VA headquarters proposes  medical center allocation amounts to networks using a standardized  resource allocation model; second, network officials review these  amounts and can adjust them based on the needs of their medical centers  that are not reflected in the initial allocation amounts proposed by  headquarters; and third, after making any adjustments, networks report  final medical center allocation amounts to VA headquarters in a consistent  format. (See fig. 2.)", "Step One: VA Proposes Allocation Amounts. VA headquarters  provides networks with a spreadsheet that includes a standardized model  that proposes allocation amounts for each medical center. The model  includes four main components covering different aspects of the resources  needed for network and medical center operations, which combined  determine the amount of resources allocated to each medical center.", "Resources Retained for Network Initiatives. The new model requires  networks to report the amounts and purposes of all resources they do not  allocate to medical centers at the beginning of the fiscal year. Networks  retain and manage resources for network-level initiatives that are  allocated to medical centers throughout the fiscal year, such as to offset  start-up costs for new medical centers or clinics or for the network\u2019s  consolidation of services shared across medical centers including  contracting services, accounting, and laundry. Additionally, networks  retain resources for the administrative costs associated with operating the  network, such as salaries for network employees. Historically, VA had  asked networks to identify the amount of resources retained at the  network level, but they did not ask networks to report the purposes of  these resources.", "Resources Retained for the Network\u2019s Emergency Reserve.", "Networks may retain resources in an emergency reserve to respond to  medical center emergencies throughout the year. The new model limits the  amount of resources retained by each network to respond to medical  center emergencies to 1.5 percent of the total allocation amount. Networks  may reduce the amount retained for emergencies, but they cannot exceed  the 1.5 percent limit. Networks have used these resources to help cover  unanticipated medical center costs, such as those associated with natural  disasters, which required resources beyond what a medical center had  been initially allocated. In our review of the fiscal year 2011 allocation  models, the 21 networks\u2019 reserve amounts ranged from about 0.1 percent  to the 1.5 percent limit, with an average reserve amount of 1.2 percent.  While networks were asked in prior years to report their emergency  reserve amounts, VA had not required that this amount be reported  separately from other resources retained at the network level, making it  challenging in the past for VA headquarters to know how much the  network retained in reserve specifically for emergencies. In fiscal year  2010, 1 network did not put any resources in reserve, and the remaining  networks\u2019 reserves ranged from 0.2 percent to 3.7 percent of their total  allocation. Furthermore, VA had not established a cap on emergency  reserve amounts prior to fiscal year 2011.", "Resources for Research Support, Education, and High Cost  Patients. Under the new model, medical centers\u2019 resources for research  support, education, and high cost patients\u2014patients whose treatment  costs exceed a VA established threshold\u2014are determined solely by  VERA. VERA calculates these amounts based on specific medical center  characteristics. For example, the amount of resources allocated to medical  centers for education is based on the number of residents at each medical  center in the current academic year. Although these amounts were also  calculated using VERA in prior years, networks had the ability to adjust  them. Under the new model, networks are no longer involved in  determining how to allocate these resources, which allows VA  headquarters to ensure that these resources are allocated consistently  across all networks.", "Resources for Patient Care Determined by a Standardized Measure  of Workload. The new model uses a standardized measure of patient  workload\u2014which VA refers to as patient weighted work. Prior to fiscal  year 2011, each network was allowed to use its own preferred workload  measure, and the measures used ranged from a simple count of individual  patients to a more complex statistical regression model. In fiscal year  2010, 9 of the 21 networks used a workload measure similar to patient  weighted work. VA officials told us they chose patient weighted work  because it establishes an equitable measure of workload among medical  centers that vary significantly in their geographic location, and types and  costs of services provided. According to VA officials, the patient weighted  work measure lessens the impact of cost differences between medical  centers, by recognizing the varying costs and levels of resource intensity  associated with providing care for each patient at each VA medical center.  For example, patient weighted work would result in more resources being  allocated to a medical center that provides more complex care, such as  open heart surgery, than a workload measure based solely on a count of  each individual patient, which would not account for the additional costs  associated with more complex care. Furthermore, officials told us that the  patient weighted work measure is easily understandable by networks,  medical centers, and stakeholders, such as veterans or VA employees.", "Step Two: Networks Review and Can Adjust Proposed Medical  Center Allocation Amounts. After receiving the spreadsheet from  headquarters, network officials determine the allocation amounts for  network initiatives and reserves, which affect the total amount of  resources available for allocation to medical centers. Network officials  then review and can make adjustments to the model\u2019s proposed allocation  amounts for medical centers, as needed. According to VA headquarters  officials, these adjustments allow each network the flexibility to change  the allocation amounts if they believe that certain medical centers\u2019  resource needs are not appropriately accounted for in the model.", "We reviewed the 21 networks\u2019 allocation spreadsheets, including the  adjustments networks made to the medical center allocation amounts  proposed by the new model. In our review, we found that, for fiscal year  2011, of the 140 medical center allocations, 122 were adjusted from  amounts proposed by the model\u201477 medical center allocations received  an upward adjustment and 45 received a downward adjustment. The  remaining 18 medical center allocations were not adjusted. (See fig. 3 for  networks\u2019 percentage adjustments to proposed allocations for medical  centers.)", "Officials from the six networks we interviewed told us that they adjusted  the allocation amounts when they anticipated that one or more of their  medical centers\u2019 resource needs would not be met by the amounts  proposed in the model. Without these adjustments, network officials  believed that some medical centers may not have been able to maintain  the level of medical services for veterans in their service areas as they did  previously. For example,    Officials from one network told us they made adjustments that resulted in  redistributing resources from other medical centers in the network to a  rural medical center because the new model\u2019s measure of workload would  not have appropriately determined the resources that the rural medical  center needed to operate. According to network officials, this medical  center has several community-based outpatient clinics that have not been  cost effective to operate but nonetheless provide critical access to care for  rural veterans. Therefore, the network made adjustments to the amounts  proposed in the model to ensure the medical center had sufficient  resources to continue to provide access to veterans in these areas.", "Officials from another network told us that the fiscal year 2011 amount  proposed in the model for one of its medical centers was 11 percent lower  than the medical center\u2019s fiscal year 2010 allocation, and for another  medical center, the fiscal year 2011 allocation amount was 18 percent  higher than the amount in fiscal year 2010. Network officials told us that  the former medical center would not be able to absorb such a cut in  resources without negatively impacting services offered, and the latter  medical center would not be able to spend the additional resources it  would have received under the model within the fiscal year. Network  officials told us that the model\u2019s proposed decreases to allocation amounts  for some of its medical centers may have been due to inefficiencies in  medical center operations, but adjustments were necessary to ensure  these medical centers got the resources they needed to continue to  operate. Network officials stated that they will likely continue to make  adjustments in the future, but they plan to work with their medical centers  to increase their efficiency and ensure that their resource needs are more  in line with what the model provides.", "More generally, VA headquarters officials stated that some medical centers  have resource needs that set them up to be recurring outliers to the model.  For example, officials said that the outpatient clinic in Anchorage, Alaska,  has significantly higher costs of care and therefore its resource needs  likely will continue to exceed the amounts generated by the model. VA  headquarters officials explained that the Anchorage clinic and other  outlier medical centers exist to ensure equitable access to care for  veterans in all areas and that VA therefore expects that some will incur  unavoidable high costs. Network officials described certain factors  contributing to particularly high costs at this clinic, including a heavy  reliance on expensive community-based care and relatively high  transportation costs associated with transporting patients from their  homes to the medical center or between medical centers for more  complex care or available services.", "VA headquarters officials told us they expected networks to make  adjustments to the amounts proposed in the model for fiscal year 2011, but  they also expected networks\u2019 allocations to medical centers to come  closer to the amounts provided by the model over time. If certain medical  centers continue to require significant adjustments to the amounts  proposed in the model, this could be an indicator that the medical centers  warrant further review or attention. VA officials said adjustment  information could be used together with information from VA\u2019s managerial  accounting systems (designed to help identify areas for management  improvement or redesign) to identify areas for improving the medical  centers\u2019 efficiency.", "Step Three: Networks Report Final Allocation Amounts to VA  Headquarters. Lastly, networks report to VA headquarters their final  medical center allocation amounts, including the amounts and purposes of  resources retained for network initiatives and the amount retained for  network emergency reserves, using the original allocation spreadsheet  that VA provided. Additionally, networks report any adjustments to the  medical center allocation amounts proposed by the model. VA  headquarters officials told us that the spreadsheets submitted by the  networks provide headquarters with consistent information on all 21  networks\u2019 medical center allocations to more easily track network  allocation decisions. However, VA did not collect information on the  reasons for each adjustment networks made to proposed allocation  amounts through the spreadsheet. Although VA provided networks a list of  acceptable rationales for adjustments for fiscal year 2011, VA did not  require networks to report these rationales for their adjustments in the  spreadsheet. As such, networks may have reported rationales for some  adjustments, but networks also made adjustments for which they may not  have reported a rationale. For example, one network reported detailed  rationales for all adjustments to its medical center allocations (ranging  from -13 percent to 34 percent), while another network did not report  rationales for any of the adjustments it made to its medical center  allocations (ranging from -14 percent to 17 percent). Officials said that the  new network resource allocation process was not intended to be used to  question networks\u2019 decision making, but rather to increase the  transparency of networks\u2019 allocation decisions to VA headquarters while  maintaining network flexibility for allocation decisions. However, absent  rationales from networks for each adjustment made to medical center  allocation amounts, transparency for decisions made through the new  allocation process is limited.", "VA officials told us they have begun to review the fiscal year 2011  allocation process and intend to conduct annual assessments of the  network allocation process. VA officials said that this review will help  them identify potential ways to improve the model for fiscal year 2012. VA  officials told us they plan to complete their assessment by the end of fiscal  year 2011. Additionally, VA officials told us that they plan to conduct an  assessment of the network allocation process each subsequent year,  including a review of adjustments to the model, to identify areas for  improvement.

If the amount entered exceeds what is available to them, the request is  rejected by the system, and cannot be processed.", "VA headquarters officials also told us they monitor resources by regularly  reviewing network spending\u2014which includes the total spending of all  medical centers within a network. On a monthly basis, they monitor  resources by comparing each network\u2019s spending with its operating plan,  which shows the network\u2019s plan for its medical centers\u2019 spending of  resources for each month of the fiscal year, summarized at the network  level and broken down by spending category\u2014such as travel, personnel,  and equipment costs\u2014and appropriations account. Each network submits  an operating plan to VA headquarters at the beginning of the fiscal year  and revises the plan throughout the year as needed. VA headquarters  officials told us they determine whether spending is on target with the  operating plan or not, and whether any differences from the plan are  significant. VA headquarters officials told us that if they find differences  that are significant, they contact network officials to discuss the  differences, such as if the network appears to be behind on its spending in  a particular category, based on what the network planned to spend in its  operating plan. For example, a network may mention that one of its  medical centers has a large contract pending that will be awarded later in  the year. VA headquarters officials told us that they do not have specific  criteria for which differences between what has been spent and what the  network had planned to have spent would warrant further investigation;  rather, they rely on their experience and judgment to know when a  network may be in danger financially, based on their review of the  network\u2019s spending and their regular communication with network  officials. Officials also told us that they have biweekly teleconferences  with network financial officers and meet with them in person on a  quarterly basis to discuss any financial concerns.", "However, VA does not have written policies documenting the agency\u2019s  practices for monitoring the resources networks allocate to medical  centers.
