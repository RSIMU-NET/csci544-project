GAO was asked to determine (1) the extent to which states have set aside these funds and used other resources for school improvement, (2) which schools received improvement funds and the extent funds are tracked, (3) the activities states and schools have undertaken and how activities are assessed, and (4) how Education supports states' improvement efforts. GAO administered a survey to state education officials and received a 100 percent response rate, matched survey data to an Education database, and conducted site visits to five states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A statutory requirement--known as a hold-harmless provision--has limited some states' ability to target the full 4 percent of Title I funds for school improvement to low-performing schools. However, many states have used other federal and state funds for this purpose. While the hold-harmless provision is designed to protect school districts from reductions in their Title I funding, it has also kept 22 states from setting aside the full portion of Title I school improvement funds since 2002 because they did not have enough funds to do so after satisfying the hold-harmless provision. To address this, Education has proposed repealing the hold-harmless provision. However, it is not known how removing this provision would affect districts protected by it. In addition to Title I funds, 38 states have dedicated other federal funds, and 17 have contributed state funds for school improvement. Though states generally target improvement funds to the most persistently underperforming schools, some states did not fulfill key NCLBA requirements. Specifically, 4 states did not follow all requirements to ensure that schools most in need of assistance received funds. Although Education monitors how states allocate improvement funds, it did not identify this issue. Also, 4 states were unable to provide a complete list of schools that received improvement funds, as required by law. Education has not provided guidance on this requirement and does not monitor compliance with it. Schools and states are engaged in a variety of improvement activities, and most states use student data and feedback to assess activities. Most states reported that schools receiving improvement funds used the funds for professional development and for reorganizing curriculum or instruction time. Nearly all states assisted schools with school improvement plans and professional development. Most states use student achievement data and feedback from schools and districts to assess improvement activities. Education provides a range of support for school improvement, including technical assistance and research results. Nearly all states want more help, such as more information on promising improvement practices. Education has a new Web site to provide additional resources and plans to collect more information on promising practices through a new grant program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 40 years, the federal government has invested billions of  dollars annually in grants to states and school districts to improve  educational opportunities for economically disadvantaged students. The  most recent reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education  Act of 1965 (ESEA), known as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001  (NCLBA), sought to hold schools, districts, and states accountable for  student progress. Specifically, states are required to develop academic  standards and tests, measure student proficiency in certain grades and  subjects, and determine whether schools are meeting proficiency goals.  Schools that fail to meet state academic goals for 2 or more years are to be  identified for improvement and are required to take a series of actions  intended to improve student performance. The number of schools  identified for improvement under NCLBA increased from about 8,400 in  school year 2004-2005 to over 10,700 in 2006-2007, and if this trend  continues, more schools will be identified for improvement in the future.  To assist these schools, NCLBA requires states to set aside 4 percent of  their Title I funds to help pay for school improvement efforts, which in  fiscal year 2005-2006 totaled close to $500 million nationally. States are  required to target funds to districts that serve the lowestachieving schools,  have the greatest need for assistance, and are committed to using funds to  help their lowest performing schools meet annual goals. However, the  availability of these funds may be limited because of a hold-harmless  provision that prevents states from giving any district less Title I funds  than it did in the previous year as a result of setting aside improvement  funds.", "While states have spent over a billion federal dollars on school  improvement since NCLBA was enacted in 2002, questions remain about  how Title I school improvement dollars are allocated and expended, or the  types of improvement activities schools use and find effective. Further, in  a report accompanying the fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill for the  Department of Education (Education) and other departments, the Senate  Appropriations Committee expressed concern about the hold-harmless  provision and its effect on high-poverty districts as well as states\u2019 ability to  set aside the full 4 percent. To shed light on these issues and to assist  Congress in the reauthorization and funding of NCLBA, you asked GAO to  determine (1) the extent to which states have been able to set aside Title I  school improvement funds and dedicated other federal and state funds to  school improvement since NCLBA was enacted, (2) the schools to which  states targeted school improvement funds and the extent to which these  funds are tracked, (3) the types of activities that states and schools have  undertaken to improve schools and how the these strategies are being  assessed, and (4) how Education provides support to help states make the  best use of school improvement funds.", "To do this work, we administered a survey to state education agency  officials in all 50 states and the District of Columbia between July and  October 2007 and received a 100 percent response rate. Because national  information is not available on states\u2019 expenditures of school improvement  funds, we collected this information through our survey. In addition, we  requested information from each state on the schools receiving  improvement funds and linked data on these schools to Education\u2019s  Common Core of Data (CCD) to identify school characteristics. Three  states were unable to provide this information, and 1 state provided partial  information, so our data on school characteristics are presented for only  those states that provided this information. We reviewed both the survey  data and the lists of schools receiving improvement funds for obvious  inconsistencies, errors, and completeness. When we found discrepancies,  we brought them to the attention of state officials and worked with them  to correct the discrepancies before conducting our analyses. On the basis  of these efforts, we determined that the survey data and lists of schools  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We also  conducted site visits to 5 states\u2014California, Georgia, Michigan, New  Mexico, and Ohio\u2014which were selected based on having high percentages  of schools identified for improvement, variation in Title I set-aside funding  allocation methods and administrative structures, and geographic  diversity. We met with state officials in each state and, to understand the  local perspective, we met with officials in 12 districts and 22 schools.  Districts and schools were selected to provide variety in student  demographics, locale, and stage of improvement. We interviewed  Education officials and reviewed relevant federal laws, guidance, and  monitoring tools to learn about federal requirements for school  improvement funds and efforts to monitor these funds and activities. We  also interviewed officials from national interest groups and researchers  and reviewed published research and reports about school improvement  funding and activities. See appendix I for more information about our  survey and other data collection methods. We conducted our work from  January 2007 through February 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.

However, Title I funding growth  slowed between 2004 and 2007. (See fig. 1.) Title I funds are allocated  through state educational agencies to districts using statutory formulas  based primarily on Census Bureau estimates of the number of students  from families below the poverty line in each district. States retain a share  for administration and school improvement activities before passing most  of the funds on to school districts. In turn, districts are required to allocate  Title I funds first to schools with poverty rates over 75 percent in rank  order, with any remaining funds distributed at their discretion to schools  in rank order of poverty either districtwide or within grade spans.

To measure their  progress, states administer an annual assessment to students in most  grade levels. In addition, each school\u2019s assessment data must be  disaggregated in order to compare the achievement levels of students  within certain designated groups with the state\u2019s performance goals. These  student groups include the economically disadvantaged, major racial and  ethnic groups, students with disabilities, and those with limited English  proficiency, and each of these groups generally must make AYP in order  for the school to make AYP.", "The last reauthorization of ESEA prior to NCLBA\u2014the Improving  America\u2019s Schools Act of 1994 (IASA)\u2014required that schools be identified  for improvement if they did not make AYP for 2 consecutive years and that  they take certain actions to improve student performance. NCLBA also  includes a timeline for implementing specific interventions based on the  number of years a school fails to make AYP and adds some interventions  that were not required under IASA. (See table 1.) Under NCLBA, schools  that fail to make AYP for 2 consecutive years are identified for  improvement and must develop an improvement plan in consultation with  the district, school staff, parents, and outside experts. This plan, which is  subject to district approval, must incorporate strategies to address the  specific academic issues that caused the school to be identified for  improvement. At this stage districts also must offer students in the school  the opportunity to transfer to a higher-performing public school in the  district\u2014an option that is called offering public school choice. After the  third year, districts must also offer supplemental educational services  (SES), such as tutoring. Under NCLBA, if a school fails to make AYP for 4  consecutive years, it is required to implement one of the corrective actions  identified in the law, such as implementing a new curriculum or extending  the school year or day. Finally, if a school fails to make AYP for 5 or more  years it must make plans to restructure its governance and implement  those plans. Schools exit improvement status if they make AYP for 2  consecutive years.

However, states may not always be able to  reserve the full amount for school improvement because of a hold- harmless provision that prevents states from reducing the amount of Title  I funds any district receives from what it received the prior year. The hold- harmless provision is intended to protect school districts from declines in  Title I funding from year to year, by preventing the state from giving them  less funds than the year before. If the total increase in Title I funds from  districts with increasing allocations is less than 4 percent of a state\u2019s total  Title I allocation, then that state would not be able to set aside the full 4  percent of Title I funds for school improvement.", "States are generally required to allocate 95 percent of the 4 percent set-aside  to districts for schools identified for improvement.

When states cannot set aside the full 4  percent for school improvement, it is difficult for them to plan and provide  consistent assistance to these schools. In addition to Title I funds for  school improvement, many states have dedicated other federal funds and  state funds to school improvement efforts. In the period since NCLBA was  enacted, state funds used for this purpose totaled almost $2.6 billion,  compared to $1.3 billion in federal Title I funds."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Statutory Requirement Limits Some States\u2019 Ability to Target School Improvement Funds to the Lowest-Performing Schools", "paragraphs": ["While the hold-harmless provision is designed to protect school districts from  reductions in their Title I funding, it has prevented some states from being able  to set aside the full amount of funds for school improvement, which are  intended for the lowest-performing schools. While the total amount of Title I  funds a state receives does not decrease in any one year as a result of  calculating the 4 percent set-aside, the hold-harmless provision can affect how  those funds are allocated within a state. Specifically, when states set aside  funds for school improvement, the hold-harmless provision prevents the state  from reducing the Title I funding for any school district from the previous year.  Sometimes, after taking into consideration the hold-harmless provision, there  are not enough funds available from those districts with increasing Title I  allocations to cover the full 4 percent set-aside. Specifically, 22 states have been  unable to set aside the full portion of Title I funds for school improvement for 1  or more years since NCLBA was enacted because they did not have enough left  over after satisfying the hold-harmless provision. Six of these\u2014Florida,  Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, and Michigan\u2014have been unable to  set aside the full amount for 3 or more years. (See fig. 3). Title I allocations are  distributed through states to school districts based on poverty levels, and the  hold-harmless provision protects districts from receiving less than they  received the previous year. In other words, if a district\u2019s population of low- income students decreases, the hold-harmless provision ensures that a district  does not receive less Title I funds than the previous year as a result of the  school improvement set-aside. Consequently, states can only set aside funds  for school improvement that would otherwise have been allocated to school  districts slated for Title I increases. In addition to the 22 states affected by the  hold-harmless provision, 4 states did not set aside the full portion of Title I  school improvement funds for other reasons. For example, 1 state reported that  it did not set aside the entire set-aside amount because it had few schools  identified for improvement. In 2006, 12 states were unable to set aside the full 4  percent of Title I funds for school improvement due to the hold-harmless  provision, with set-asides ranging from as little as 0.2 percent in Kansas to 3.75  percent in Florida.", "The lowest-performing schools\u2014schools identified for improvement\u2014are  affected when states cannot set aside the full 4 percent for school  improvement. These schools\u2014which are the targets of the school  improvement funding\u2014have failed to meet state performance goals and  are, by definition, performing worse than other schools. Effectively, the  hold-harmless provision prioritizes preserving the Title I funding of all  eligible Title I districts over ensuring that the lowest-performing schools  receive funds for school improvement. Furthermore, schools identified for  improvement may be among the neediest. In fiscal year 2006, schools  identified for improvement in the 12 states that were unable to set aside  the full 4 percent had higher average percentages of students in poverty  and minority students compared to other Title I schools that were in need  of improvement in those states. (See table 4.)", "When states cannot set aside the full portion of Title I funds for school  improvement, it is difficult for states to provide consistent assistance to  schools identified for improvement. States that were unable to set aside  the full 4 percent for school improvement experienced large decreases in  their school improvement funds from year to year compared to all other  states. (See table 5.) For example, Ohio officials told us that they  experienced a decline of $14 million in Title I allocations to districts  between fiscal years 2004 and 2005 due to a decrease in census estimates  of the number of low-income students. Since the state still had to provide  all districts with no less Title I funds than the year before, it set aside 58  percent, or $9.3 million, less in school improvement funds than it had in  the previous year. An Ohio official said this variability made it difficult to  commit school improvement assistance to districts. To address this issue,  Ohio now retains a portion of its total Title I school improvement set-aside  each year to help ensure that school improvement funds will be available  if there are future decreases in school improvement funds as a result of  the hold-harmless provision.", "There is also wide variation among states in the average amount of school  improvement money available per school in improvement. (See fig. 4).  The average amount per school in improvement varies due to differences  in overall Title I allocations as well as the number of schools identified for  improvement in each state. For example, Massachusetts received over  $200 million in Title I funds in fiscal year 2006 and set aside less than  $780,000 for its 455 schools identified for improvement, for an average of  approximately $1,700 available per school identified for improvement. In  contrast, Texas received over $1 billion in Title I funds in fiscal year 2006  and set aside $47 million for its 291 schools identified for improvement,  averaging approximately $163,000 per school identified for improvement.", "Education, recognizing challenges associated with the hold-harmless  provision, has proposed eliminating the provision as part of its 2007  budget justification and again as part of its proposals for reauthorization  of NCLBA. In its 2007 budget justification, Education estimated states\u2019  ability to set aside the full 4 percent of Title I funds for school  improvement for fiscal year 2005 and contended that the hold-harmless  provision, in conjunction with Title I funding fluctuations, limited many  states\u2019 ability to reserve these funds. Additionally, the department pointed  out that districts slated for Title I increases disproportionately contribute  to the Title I school improvement set-aside.

Several states we visited reported incorporating CSR funds and Reading  First funds into their school improvement strategies. For example, in Ohio,  CSR funds were prioritized toward school improvement purposes under  NCLBA.

For example, Michigan officials told us that their  allocation formula includes the year of school improvement as well as  overall student enrollment. The state also differentiates between schools  that failed to make AYP for academic reasons and those that missed AYP  targets for other reasons, such as graduation rate or attendance. Of the 14  states that used methods other than state-established criteria to allocate  funds, 2 states\u2014Colorado and Idaho\u2014distributed funds through a  competitive grant process. Eight states used other allocation methods  such as distributing funds to districts by ranking the schools identified for  improvement based on school performance and the number of low-income  students. However, we found that Delaware, New Hampshire, Virginia, and  the District of Columbia reported they required districts to provide each  school receiving school improvement funds an equal amount of funding,  and, thus, may not have prioritized the allocation of funds as required  under NCLBA. In addition to their various allocation methods, 9 states  gave districts flexibility in determining which schools received funds.

With the approval of districts, a state may  retain more than 5 percent to directly provide school improvement  services for schools or arrange for other entities to provide these services.  In 2006, 10 states retained more than 5 percent. (See fig. 7.) For example,  New Mexico officials told us that eligible districts agreed that the state  could retain the entire set-aside amount to support a systematic reform  model for school years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008. For participating schools,  state officials paid a contractor to provide leadership and instructional  training, reading and math interventions, and materials needed to support  the interventions for schools identified for improvement.", "While most states retained the allowed 5 percent of the Title I school  improvement funds to carry out their state responsibilities, 23 states  reported that they have fully implemented their statewide system of  support. Of the remaining 28 states, 18 reported that their system was  mostly implemented and 10 reported they have partially implemented their  system. Education officials offered several reasons why states may not  have fully implemented these systems. For example, some states may not  have had enough funds to fully implement their statewide system of  support. In other states, statewide strategies may only reach a portion of  the schools identified for improvement because services are prioritized for  the lowest-achieving schools and districts. In addition, officials said some  states have experienced large increases in the number of schools  identified for improvement, necessitating significant changes to their  statewide system of support.", "Additionally, 21 states allocated some of their Title I school improvement  funds to districts for district-level activities, including at least 1 state that  may not have met NCLBA requirements for doing this. Districts have a  major responsibility for providing technical assistance to schools  identified for improvement. According to Education officials, while  NCLBA does not explicitly set aside funds for district-level activities, it  does allow for districts to use improvement funds to provide services to  these schools. In addition, Education officials said that funds can be used  for building district capacity if the funds are focused on providing services  for schools identified for improvement. In Massachusetts, for example,  some funds supported district-level specialists who provided direct  assistance to schools identified for improvement in areas such as data  analysis and implementing the school improvement plan. In addition,  according to Education officials, states have authority to use some of the  95 percent funds for districts identified for improvement but without  schools in improvement if the state determines that the amount of 95  percent funds exceeds the amount needed to provide assistance to schools  identified for improvement. In this situation, a state may take excess funds  from one district and give those funds to other districts based on state- determined need. Education officials told us that states must consult with  districts before claiming unused funds and have evidence that these  discussions took place. However, we found that 1 state may have  allocated Title I improvement funds to districts identified for improvement  without schools identified for improvement without first determining it  had excess funds. We identified this issue through our site visits and are  uncertain if other states may have also done this. Education officials said  they did not identify this issue during their recent monitoring visit. We  referred this matter to Education, which is following up on it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While States Collect Some Information to Track Funds, Many States Are Not Able to Provide Information on Which Schools Receive Funds", "paragraphs": ["Most states collect and track information on the use of school  improvement funds. Forty-eight states reported on our survey that they  collect information on the expenditure of Title I school improvement  funds at least annually from schools, districts, or other sources. Twenty- four states reported collecting expenditure information on each school  receiving improvement funds. Other states reported collecting expenditure  information from districts that provide aggregate information for all  schools that received improvement funds in the district, rather than for  each school receiving improvement funds. Seventeen states reported that  district officials monitor school improvement funds by comparing  activities that were funded to those identified in school improvement  plans. For example, some district officials we visited said they compare  school improvement expenditures to the school improvement plan before  approving disbursements. Forty-five states reported that state or district  officials conduct visits or monitor through other means how school  improvement funds were expended and what school improvement  activities were funded. State officials from 14 states reported that  monitoring was conducted in multiyear cycles rather than annually or that  a portion of schools were monitored annually. For example, as part of  Ohio\u2019s monitoring and review process, officials said that district cohorts  are reviewed every 3 years with on-site reviews conducted at a minimum  of 10 percent of the cohort.", "While most states monitor funds, 4 states were unable to make publicly  available the complete list of schools receiving improvement funds, as  required under NCLBA, because these states do not collect information on  each school receiving improvement funds, and Education has not provided  guidance on this requirement.

State officials said that they would take steps  to address this issue, and we referred this matter to Education, which is  following up on it. Though Education monitors the allocation of school  improvement funds through its 3-year Title I monitoring cycle, Education  officials told us they had not uncovered these issues.

School officials in each state we visited also cited using  school improvement funds for professional development activities. For  example, at one school in California, staff received intensive training in  instructional strategies and data analysis software, which was designed to  help teachers analyze instructional practices and provided teachers with  specific steps to increase student achievement. In addition, schools and  districts in every state we visited mentioned using coaches who are  generally former principals, teachers, or other subject area specialists who  work with school administrators or teachers. School officials in Michigan  noted that coaches had served as a key resource in the development of  school improvement plans. In some of the schools and districts we visited,  officials pointed to the importance of examining test scores and student  data in helping schools improve. For example, a school district in Ohio  provided school leaders and teachers immediate access to test scores and  other information such as curriculum, professional development  resources, and student records online to help track student achievement.", "While over 40 states reported that they assisted schools identified for  improvement with the school improvement plan, professional  development, and data analysis, or provided help from school support  teams, states generally reported providing more assistance to schools in  later stages of improvement (See fig. 8). In New Mexico, for example, all  schools identified for improvement are required to conduct certain  activities such as short cycle assessments several times a year, while  schools in restructuring are also required to send staff to training in areas  such as principal leadership. As another example, 44 states reported that  they provided assistance from school support teams to schools in  corrective action and restructuring, compared to 34 states that reported  providing this assistance to schools in earlier stages of improvement. The  only area in which states said they provided slightly more assistance to  schools in earlier stages of improvement was helping with the school  improvement plan.", "Forty-two states considered helping schools identified for improvement  with the school improvement plan and professional development to be  somewhat to very effective forms of state support. For example, many  states provided schools and districts a template for improvement plans,  which can help ensure some consistency in plans across the state.

We also found that some states we visited conduct more  extensive reviews of schools in corrective action and restructuring that  include site visits, assessments, and observation of staff and leadership.  Most districts and schools we visited also focus on student achievement  data to assess activities. One school in Georgia has students take interim  practice tests using questions similar to those of the state\u2019s annual  assessment to track students\u2019 progress.

Each of the 5 content centers focuses on one of the following areas:  accountability, instruction, teacher quality, innovation and  improvement, or high schools. The content centers provide expertise,  analysis, and research in the five content areas. According to an  Education official, a key focus of the comprehensive centers is helping  states build their statewide systems of support. Currently, the  comprehensive centers have 8 regional initiatives and 35 individual  state initiatives related to this topic. In addition, there are 2 regional  initiatives and 26 individual state initiatives to address district and  school improvement.", "One content center, the Center on Innovation and Improvement,  provides a variety of services related to school improvement. The  center gathers data and information on districts and schools making  sustained gains to identify successful improvement strategies. It has  developed two guides on this topic, a Handbook on Restructuring and  Substantial School Improvement and a Handbook on Statewide  Systems of Support, which it has distributed to regional centers, state  educational agencies, and other organizations. The center also  facilitates information sharing on school improvement topics through  its annual 2-day training for representatives of the regional centers and  additional workshops throughout the year. In addition, the center  collaborates with the Council of Chief State School Officers to issue  monthly School Improvement e-newsletters, which focus on school  improvement efforts at the state and district levels.", "Education also compiles and disseminates relevant research on  effective educational interventions. Education operates 10 Regional  Education Laboratories to provide research on a variety of topics, such  as statewide systems of support and factors that have helped schools  make AYP. The laboratories are also available to provide assistance to  any entity, such as school districts or schools, if they request  assistance. Education also funds the Center for Comprehensive School  Reform and Improvement to assist schools and districts in  implementing comprehensive school reform and improvement by  providing information about research-based strategies and assistance  in using that information to make changes. In addition, Education  developed the What Works Clearinghouse to review studies of  educational interventions to determine which studies were conducted  with a sound methodology and to what extent the interventions are  effective. In November 2007, Education implemented a Doing What  Works Web site to help educators adapt and use the research-based  practices identified by the What Works Clearinghouse.", "State officials reported that Education\u2019s written guidance, national  meetings or conferences, and comprehensive centers were the most  helpful forms of assistance and the What Works Clearinghouse was  relatively less helpful (See fig. 11.)

Although 15 states reported that  the What Works Clearinghouse was moderately to very helpful, 20 states  reported that it provided some to no help. District officials said that it has  not been useful for reasons such as it is difficult to figure out how to  translate the research on the What Works Clearinghouse into practical  application at the classroom level.", "Almost all states also reported that they could benefit from additional  assistance from Education. Fifty states reported that they could benefit  from more tool kits and sample documents, and 48 states said they could  benefit from more national or regional conferences to share lessons  learned and promising practices.

To do this, the Doing What Works Web site provides the  following: (1) information to help make the research on effective practices  more understandable for educators, (2) links to real-life examples such as  interviews with teachers and pictures from classrooms to help show the  practices in action, and (3) tools and resources that educators can use in  their own planning and training efforts. As far as providing more help on  monitoring and evaluating school improvement activities, Education  officials told us that they plan to collect additional information about  successful school improvement practices as part of the new school  improvement grants\u2014authorized under NCLBA and funded for the first  time in 2007. States receiving these grants will be required to track and  report outcomes such as increased student proficiency and how school  improvement activities helped schools improve. Education plans to  compile this information and discuss this topic at a meeting of state Title I  directors in early 2008.

When states cannot set aside the full 4 percent of Title I for  school improvement, their ability to target funds at the lowest-performing  schools is diminished. Effectively, the hold-harmless provision prioritizes  preserving the Title I funding of all eligible Title I districts over ensuring  that the lowest-performing schools receive funds for school improvement.  Furthermore, the variability from year to year in state Title I funds can  affect some states\u2019 ability to sustain a steady stream of support for low- performing schools. Removing the hold-harmless provision, as Education  has proposed, would clearly increase states\u2019 ability to target improvement  funds to the lowest-performing schools. However, while Education points  out that set-aside funds come from districts with increasing Title I  allocations, it is still not known how removing the hold-harmless provision  would affect those districts protected by it. It would be helpful for  Congress as it deliberates reauthorization of NCLBA to know the  characteristics of districts that contribute to the set-aside compared to  those that are protected by the hold-harmless provision, particularly in  terms of student characteristics and school performance.", "Thousands of schools have received Title I school improvement funds  intended to help schools raise student achievement, and states have  generally targeted these funds to schools with the most persistent  achievement problems. However, without additional monitoring steps by  Education to ensure that states are appropriately allocating funds for  district-level activities and prioritizing funds to the lowest-achieving  schools, some schools most in need of assistance may not receive funding.  While Education monitors every state\u2019s improvement program every 3  years, it has not uncovered several compliance issues that we identified.  Further, because some states do not track which schools receive  improvement funds and could not make this information publicly  available, as required under NCLBA, Education and others have not been  in the best position to ensure that school improvement funds are used only  for Title I schools and targeted to the lowest-performing schools.
