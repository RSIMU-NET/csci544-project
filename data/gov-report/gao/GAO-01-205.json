In addition, from 1990 to 1997 both the number of beneficiaries and the amount of services they received increased sharply, raising concerns about Medicare expenditures and the appropriateness of services being provided. As early as 1987, the Congress began to address the need for greater oversight of home health care by requiring that the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) implement an outcome-based quality monitoring system. Ten years later, to address the mounting cost of home health care, the Congress directed HCFA to develop a new payment system for home health care that would shift from cost-based reimbursement to a prospective payment system (PPS).", "As part of fulfilling both of these provisions, HCFA has begun requiring home health agencies (HHA) to collect and report data on all their patients using a standardized assessment instrument known as the Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS). However, HHAs have expressed concern that the OASIS data collection requirement is overly burdensome. Also, some patients\u2019 rights advocates contend that the confidentiality of individual patient information may not be adequately protected. HCFA officials respond that the OASIS data are essential to accurately monitor home health care quality and to implement plans to achieve quality improvements, as well as to determine payments for individual patients. Furthermore, the agency has said that the cost and privacy implications of using OASIS are minimal.", "The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA) mandated that we examine the cost and privacy concerns associated with OASIS data collection requirements. We addressed the following key questions in our review: 1.  How does HCFA plan to use the OASIS-generated information? 2.  Since the implementation of OASIS, have patient assessments changed and have additional costs been incurred by HHAs? 3.  What has HCFA done to safeguard the confidentiality of OASIS data?", "To answer these questions, we interviewed industry representatives, home health experts, HCFA and state officials, and state surveyors in several states. We also obtained perspectives on OASIS implementation by visiting several HHAs in urban and rural areas and interviewing agencies with reputations for high-quality practices. Because reliable data are not available, we could not obtain a comprehensive accounting of all possible costs associated with complying with the OASIS mandate. Rather, we conducted a survey of a representative sample of 50 HHAs regarding ongoing OASIS-related costs beyond those that the HHAs previously incurred for patient assessments. We asked specifically for the agencies\u2019 estimates of changes in staff time for data collection and reporting and for training new staff. (For more detail on our survey methodology, see app. I.) Finally, we reviewed relevant documents, including HCFA regulations and manuals. Our review was conducted from May 2000 to November 2000 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Medicare\u2019s home health care benefit enables beneficiaries with post-acute- care needs and chronic conditions to receive certain skilled nursing, therapy, and aide services in their homes rather than in other settings. To qualify for Medicare\u2019s home health benefit, a beneficiary must be confined to his or her residence (\u201chomebound\u201d), must be under a physician\u2019s care,and must require physical therapy, speech therapy, continued occupational therapy, or skilled nursing on an intermittent basis. Beneficiaries are not liable for any coinsurance or deductibles for these services and may receive care as long as they meet the eligibility criteria. Until recently, Medicare has reimbursed HHAs for their costs, subject to limits, for services they provide to the program\u2019s beneficiaries.", "Between 1990 and 1997, Medicare expenditures for home health services went up three times faster than spending for the program as a whole. This rapid rise has been attributed to many factors, including a liberalization of home health benefit criteria and a lack of sufficient controls to protect the program from potential billing practice abuse. In combination, these factors created conditions where providers could deliver more services than necessary to beneficiaries in order to increase their revenues. In response to these problems, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 required, by October 1, 1999, the implementation of a new home health PPS, and, until then, the implementation of an interim payment system (IPS) to slow spending growth. The IPS incorporated tighter per-visit cost limits than previously in place and subjected each agency to an annual Medicare revenue cap (based on a per-beneficiary amount and the number of patients it served).", "The home health PPS, which replaced the IPS on October 1, 2000, is designed to align payments with anticipated service needs. HHAs now receive a single payment for each 60-day episode of care for a Medicare beneficiary. The base payment is adjusted to reflect patient characteristics that have been shown to affect service use. For fiscal year 2001, the base amount per episode has been set at $2,115, but payment rates range from about $1,100 to nearly $6,000, depending on the functional and clinical severity of each beneficiary. Each episode payment is adjusted for differences in labor costs across geographic areas, and certain extremely high cost episodes receive outlier payments. Once the payment is determined, the amount of service provided to that beneficiary does not change the amount of reimbursement.", "In order to qualify as providers eligible to bill Medicare for home health services, HHAs have to comply with the program\u2019s conditions of participation. These standards seek to ensure that HHAs have the appropriate staff, policies, procedures, medical records, and operational practices to deliver acceptable quality care. HCFA contracts with state survey and certification agencies to oversee the adherence of HHAs in their states with these standards. However, our previous work has shown that state agencies\u2019 reviews of HHAs to be certified to provide Medicare services did little to ensure quality care and that there was almost no oversight of the actual care provided to home health patients.", "In the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Congress mandated that HCFA develop a standardized patient assessment instrument to assist in monitoring HHAs. HCFA used information from years of research and demonstrations in the development of OASIS, which contains 79 demographic, clinical, and functional data items for assessing patients and measuring outcomes. (The process of developing and testing OASIS is described in app. II.) In January 1999, HCFA issued final rules requiring HHAs to conduct comprehensive patient assessments incorporating the OASIS data elements and electronically report the OASIS data collected. The requirement covers most private pay as well as Medicare and Medicaid patients. Collection of the information relies on both observation of patient function by a nurse or therapist and patient responses. For each patient receiving skilled care, the data are generally collected at the initial visit, every 60 days thereafter for the duration of treatment, and at discharge. HHAs report the data to their state survey and certification agencies, which then report the data to a central repository maintained by HCFA.", "Concerns regarding the privacy of OASIS information were expressed shortly after HCFA issued its rules on OASIS data collection and reporting in January 1999. Some privacy advocates expressed concerns that some questions were irrelevant or delved too deeply into the personal lives of patients. They cited the mental status questions, including one that asks about depressive feelings reported or observed in the patient, as well as a question regarding financial factors that could limit the patient\u2019s ability to meet his or her own basic health needs.", "HHAs, advocacy groups, and others suggested that patient identifiers be removed from OASIS data before transmission to HCFA or that HCFA not require OASIS data to be reported on non-Medicare/Medicaid patients. In the spring of 1999, these concerns led HCFA to postpone the effective date of OASIS reporting until it reviewed the privacy issues involved. The outcome of this review was HCFA\u2019s decision to leave the OASIS assessment instrument intact. HHAs would continue to be required to collect all OASIS information on all patients, because HCFA believes it is valuable to HHAs in patient assessments and care planning. However, HCFA put limits on the transmission of certain OASIS data elements, and it has postponed data reporting, but not collecting, for non- Medicare/Medicaid patients.", "Under the new conditions of participation effective July 1999, HHAs participating in Medicare must (1) incorporate OASIS data items into the assessment process for Medicare, Medicaid, and private pay patients, (2) electronically transmit accurate OASIS data to the state survey agency or HCFA OASIS contractor, and (3) maintain the privacy of their OASIS data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OASIS Designed for Quality Monitoring and Payment Purposes", "paragraphs": ["The OASIS data instrument serves both to monitor home health care quality and to adjust payments to account for differences in patient characteristics.

Although none of these approaches has been implemented, planning for the first two is under way, and the third is to be developed in the future.", "HCFA intends to use OASIS data to strengthen its oversight of state survey agency monitoring of HHA outcomes. It requires the state survey agencies to examine the OASIS data in preparation for surveys of individual HHAs.Survey agencies have begun checking the OASIS data submitted by HHAs in their states to ensure HHA compliance with OASIS reporting requirements. HCFA expects the survey staff to review OASIS-based reports to identify indicators of potential concern (such as high rates of infection) that would warrant further investigation and ongoing monitoring.", "When HCFA mandated that HHAs begin collecting OASIS data, it emphasized that this requirement was intended to set in motion a process of continuous quality improvement within each HHA. Based on the OASIS data collected, each HHA will be granted electronic access to customized reports displaying its own patients\u2019 outcomes in relation to those of home health patients nationally, with statistical adjustments to take account of the clinical characteristics of the patients served by that agency. The HHA will be able to examine outcomes for specific types of care (such as wound care and pain management) and types of patients (such as those with diabetes or those recovering from surgery). This way, each agency will be able to assess its performance over time and compare it to national benchmarks. These reports will enable HHAs to identify areas where their performance was suboptimal and thus provide a basis for planning initiatives to improve patient health status.", "The first reports, based on the OASIS data that have been collected nationwide since July 1999, show individual HHAs the demographic and clinical profiles of their patient population and adverse events. These reports are expected to be available by late January 2001, followed by detailed risk-adjusted outcome reports in 2002. Before the reports are made electronically accessible to the HHAs, OASIS education coordinators in each state will provide training and technical assistance for HHAs on how to analyze and act on the information. In addition, HCFA has funded a 2-year pilot project in five states to explore the feasibility of using peer review organizations to help HHAs in interpreting their reports and developing from them effective quality improvement initiatives.", "Another way HCFA plans to use OASIS data to promote quality is by providing information to assist physicians and patients in selecting HHAs. HCFA expects that making such comparative information on outcomes publicly available could encourage HHAs to compete for patients on the basis of the quality of care they provide. HCFA has recently initiated planning on how to release this information. The first step will be to evaluate alternative approaches for presenting and distributing these data to the public. One current example of HCFA\u2019s efforts to share comparative information on Medicare providers is its \u201cNursing Home Compare\u201d Web site. This site has information on facility and resident characteristics of nursing facilities as well as deficiencies reported in past survey inspections, though not on patient outcomes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OASIS Data Critical to Adjusting HHA Payments and Improving PPS Formulas", "paragraphs": ["A second major use of OASIS data collection is payment-related. Under the home health PPS, HHAs receive a specified payment per beneficiary for each 60-day episode of care. HCFA uses OASIS data to assign patients to one of 80 relative payment levels, called home health resource groups. This assignment is based on 23 patient descriptors from the OASIS assessment that measure clinical condition, functional status, and service utilization. Each payment group is assigned a relative weight that reflects the cost of the average beneficiary in that category relative to all home health care users.", "In addition to providing information necessary to implement the home health PPS in its current form, OASIS data will assist HCFA in (1) monitoring the effects of prospective payment on quality of care and (2) developing potential refinements in the formulas used to determine payments. Because of the change from cost-based reimbursement to prospectively determined payments for each episode of care, PPS creates a financial incentive to limit services per episode and increase the number of episodes billed. HCFA has pledged to undertake monitoring of OASIS data, along with data from other monitoring systems, as part of a surveillance system designed to assess the short- and long-term effects of PPS. For example, OASIS data should enable HCFA to detect unfavorable trends in outcomes for home health care patients, such as delayed or diminished recovery from a stroke.", "Questions have been raised about the potential vulnerability of the OASIS data to manipulation intended to maximize provider payments. HHAs could benefit financially from making their patients appear as sick and functionally impaired as possible when initially assessed, in order to be assigned a higher payment group. HCFA was aware of the risk of \u201cgaming\u201d and sought to minimize this risk when it selected the specific OASIS data elements used to assign patients to different PPS payment groups. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission has nonetheless expressed concern that the OASIS assessments submitted to HCFA will reflect these financial incentives to exaggerate patient severity at admission. To address concerns about data quality, HCFA has undertaken an accuracy demonstration program. This program will evaluate alternative methods to ensure the accuracy of the OASIS data submitted by HHAs. In addition, state surveyors will check a sample of patient assessments against medical records.", "Medicare fiscal intermediaries\u2014contractors to HCFA that process HHA claims for payment\u2014are also expected to use OASIS data. The information will help them decide which HHAs to include in focused medical reviews that determine the appropriateness of payment of individual claims for home health services provided to beneficiaries. One aspect of this review strategy involves determining whether OASIS information is supported by documentation in the medical record. If the intermediaries determine that the OASIS data are not appropriate, they will adjust the payment grouping accordingly."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Almost All OASIS Data Elements Collected Will Be Used for Quality or Payment Purposes", "paragraphs": ["HCFA has sought to limit the amount of OASIS data collected to that needed for monitoring quality and payment purposes. The research group that developed OASIS under contract to HCFA\u2014the University of Colorado Center for Health Services and Policy Research (CHSPR)\u2014 explicitly set out to identify the key data elements that would enable HHAs to measure their outcomes while minimizing the data collection burdens. CHSPR identified a set of 73 core data items needed both to compute quality indicators and to risk-adjust the outcomes reported. (See app. II for more details on this process.) An advisory group appointed by HCFA reviewed CHSPR\u2019s core data set. This Standard Assessment work group was made up of 13 members, including HHA administrators, practicing clinicians, a clinical assessment expert, a state official, and representatives of industry and professional organizations. It recommended that HCFA adopt the core data set, with the addition of several more elements. The feasibility of collecting and using OASIS data was subsequently tested in two demonstration studies that documented improved outcomes for the participating HHAs.", "Nearly all the OASIS data elements that emerged from this process will be used to generate the specific outcome measures presented in the HHA customized quality improvement reports. Six of the 79 items currently have no intended use. Four of these, described as \u201cpotential risk adjustment factors,\u201d assess environmental and safety issues in the patient\u2019s home, and another item relates to the patient\u2019s financial ability to meet treatment needs. All four were among those added to the data set at the behest of HCFA\u2019s advisory work group. Concerns were subsequently raised by some privacy advocates about the sensitivity of some of these data elements. The financial question in particular was so sensitive that HCFA decided to exclude it from the data transmitted by the HHAs to the states. However, HCFA maintained the obligation of the HHAs to obtain this information for all home health patients.", "HCFA also required the HHAs to collect, but not initially transmit, OASIS information on patients receiving skilled care who were not covered by Medicare or Medicaid. HCFA has stated that it is important to collect OASIS data on patients served by HHAs from all payor sources in order to evaluate the quality of care provided. In addition, HHS must ensure that the conditions of participation are adequate to protect all individuals under the care of the HHA. Although HCFA has developed techniques for masking the identity of non-Medicare/Medicaid patients, it has postponed having these data transmitted to the state repositories. HCFA officials told us that the notice to begin transmission of these data could be published in the spring of 2001.

Before the OASIS mandate took effect, Medicare rules required HHAs to perform both of these steps, but called for specific documentation for the plan of care only. Now they require the collection and reporting of the OASIS assessment data for each patient as well as plan-of-care documentation. Thus, what constitutes a comprehensive assessment under the long- standing requirement is now more clearly defined for HHAs.", "According to HHA and state officials, the assessments that HHAs performed in the past varied in both scope and format. They told us that while some agencies may have conducted thorough evaluations of their patients, others performed more cursory or narrowly focused assessments. Likewise, HHA documentation practices could vary substantially. For example, some agencies wrote narrative descriptions of the patient\u2019s condition, and others may have developed more structured instruments with short answers or checklists.

Of special concern was the start-of-care comprehensive assessment, when clinicians would have to obtain answers to all the OASIS questions from a new patient for the first time.", "CHSPR gathered data from 10 agencies participating in a HCFA-sponsored study. Overall, CHSPR found that the median total time taken by these HHAs for start-of-care visits using OASIS was 150 minutes, a few minutes less than start-of-care visits without OASIS. In a second study, Abt Associates measured the time taken for start-of-care visits with a longer version of OASIS, but recorded only the time spent in the patient\u2019s home and not time spent on associated paperwork performed elsewhere. This study of more than 20,000 visits found that start-of-care visits using OASIS required a median of 90 minutes. However, there were no comparable data from start-of-care visits without OASIS.", "In contrast to the CHSPR study, officials of the 32 agencies responding to our survey of a representative sample of Medicare HHAs estimated that start-of-care visits incorporating OASIS assessments did take more time than those conducted prior to OASIS. The median total time estimated to complete start-of-care visits with OASIS was 150 minutes, matching the figure obtained in the CHSPR study. However, HHAs reported that this amount represented a median increase of 40 minutes relative to time for start-of-care visits prior to OASIS.", "In each of these studies, data from individual HHAs on the amount of time required for start-of-care visits with OASIS varied widely. This variation may reflect differences in how responding HHAs have integrated the new assessment instrument and how it is administered in the patient\u2019s home. Many of the HHAs we interviewed told us that they had followed HCFA\u2019s instructions to replace items requesting similar information on their patient assessment forms with OASIS items. However, one agency had not yet completed this task, requiring the nurse conducting an initial visit to complete the OASIS form separately. To varying degrees, clinicians administer the OASIS assessment through a combination of questioning, examining the patient, and observing patient behavior and home environment.", "HHAs also have to perform new tasks related to the submission of OASIS data to the state repositories in electronic form. Both the mandate for HHAs to collect and report OASIS data and the transition to prospective payment based on OASIS information have heightened the concern of HHAs with the validity and completeness of these data. To help ensure that patient assessments are correctly recorded in a form that HCFA\u2019s data repositories will accept, HHAs need to review the data as they proceed from initial recording by the clinician to electronic transmission to the state repository. The steps in this process include the following:   Heightened supervisory review of the assessment forms completed by the clinician performing the assessment.", "Entering, rechecking, and correcting OASIS data from paper records into the computerized records.", "Batching and then electronically transmitting the data to a centralized state data repository.

Eighty-four percent of our survey respondents said they provide training for newly hired staff, with modules focused specifically on OASIS data collection and documentation. Those HHAs offering OASIS- related training reported providing a median of 8 hours to new staff. However, how much additional time is due specifically to the OASIS requirement is not clear, because OASIS-related training could substitute for some prior assessment-related training as well as add new elements.", "Many HHAs may find that their additional OASIS-related costs are offset by payments they receive under the new payment system. We recently reported that PPS payment rates are based on 1998 rates of home health care utilization, which have since declined. Therefore, they are likely to be generous in comparison with current use patterns. In our view, the episode payments could provide an ample cushion for many agencies, which can be used to offset the costs associated with the OASIS mandate.", "In addition, Congress and HCFA have taken several actions to assist HHAs in complying with OASIS mandates. For example, for each Medicare beneficiary served from October 1, 1999, to September 30, 2000, Congress provided HHAs with $10 to help defray OASIS costs. Also, the prospective payment base was increased by $4.32 per 60-day episode as an ongoing adjustment for OASIS reporting costs. HCFA has taken other steps to reduce the costs imposed on HHAs by the OASIS mandate.

In addressing the use of OASIS for payment purposes, HCFA considers the OASIS data elements to be crucial to refining payment rates, and if data collection were limited to those elements currently needed for payment, its ability to refine PPS in the future would be constrained. Regarding our discussion of data confidentiality protections, HCFA highlighted several specific steps it has taken to ensure patient privacy. HCFA\u2019s comments appear in appendix IV. The agency made technical comments that we incorporated where applicable.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Robert A. Berenson, Acting Deputy Administrator of HCFA, and others who are interested. We will also make copies available to others on request. Rosamond Katz, Eric Peterson, and Victoria M. Smith developed the information contained in this report.

This appendix describes how the survey was conducted and discusses the strengths and limitations of the information provided."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Survey Design", "paragraphs": ["Determining how much it has cost HHAs to implement HCFA\u2019s mandate to collect and report OASIS data on individual patients is complex, for three main reasons. First, the OASIS mandate could lead to additional costs in many different areas, including additional staff time to perform a variety of tasks. HCFA required that the OASIS items be integrated with other assessment forms, which could involve the development of both new forms and new procedures to complete them. The process of encoding and transmitting the OASIS data electronically led many HHAs to expand their use of computers, which could have called in turn for capital investments and the recruitment of new staff.", "Second, the home health care industry was undergoing radical change. The ongoing transition from cost-based reimbursement to prospective payment fundamentally altered the financial circumstances and incentives of many agencies. The characteristics of patients seeking and receiving home health care may also have changed as a result. Staff recruitment, training, computerization, and revamped procedures were all affected by these market and payment-related changes as well, making it very difficult to isolate an independent effect from the OASIS mandate.", "Third, no cost data specifically linked to patient assessment activities were systematically and consistently maintained either before or after the implementation of the OASIS mandate. Instead, such activities are integrated into the clinical and administrative functions of HHAs. Thus any attempt to estimate the specific effect of OASIS on costs necessarily would involve some reconstruction of such data after the fact.", "Our survey of HHAs was designed with these factors in mind. Rather than attempt to obtain a comprehensive accounting of all possible OASIS- related costs, we focused on the additional time spent on four major activities that appeared from our preliminary interviews with HHA officials to have had a substantial effect on total costs:   Clinicians\u2019 total time for the start-of-care visit,   Supervisors\u2019 time reviewing and monitoring patient assessment data   Time for training new hires on OASIS, and   Time entering and transmitting OASIS data electronically.", "We asked the executive directors of the HHAs we surveyed to provide both current and pre-OASIS time figures from more than a year ago. It is common for agencies to maintain logs with time spent at different types of visits. While most HHAs said they were able to draw on relevant and specific recorded data, others provided rough estimates. However variable in quality, these data recorded by the HHAs for their own purposes represent the best available data we found for estimating the cost implications of the OASIS mandate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sample Selection", "paragraphs": ["To select our sample, we used 1999 data extracted from HCFA\u2019s Provider of Service File and associated claims data. We started with a list of each HHA that had been paid for at least one Medicare home health visit in 1999. We excluded those agencies that had not begun providing home care under Medicare prior to January 1, 1999, and those that served fewer than 15 Medicare patients in 1999. We then selected a simple random sample from the remaining agencies. Thus, the sample represents the universe of HHAs, not patients.", "Although our sample was not stratified, we did take precautions to ensure that the agencies in the sample did not have a highly skewed distribution along several major dimensions. Specifically, we observed the distribution among all the HHAs in our sampling universe for five characteristics\u2014 caseload size (number of Medicare patients treated annually), urban/rural, geographic region, organizational affiliation (Visiting Nurse Association (VNA), facility-based, freestanding), and tax status (nonprofit, for-profit, government). (See table 1.) We then took a series of independent random samples of 50 agencies each. (Every agency had an equal chance of being selected for each of these samples.) We used the sample that best matched the distribution found in the sampling universe."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sample Response Rate", "paragraphs": ["We received usable responses from 32 HHAs. Three of the 50 surveyed had ceased to operate as separate agencies, either by going out of business or by merging with another entity. That gave us an effective response rate of 68 percent (32 out of 47). As shown above, the respondent group generally matched the characteristics of the sampling universe and the sample. The main exception was an underrepresentation of the Northeast region and overrepresentation of the West. Facility-based agencies were also somewhat overrepresented among the respondents compared to freestanding HHAs.", "Because our sample was randomly selected, it provides unbiased estimates of the results we would have received had we been able to survey the entire universe. Still, a sample of 50 (with 32 respondents) is likely to have considerable sampling error compared to that of a larger sample. The standard errors and 95 percent confidence interval for the main survey items presented in the report are provided below. These confidence intervals indicate the range within which there is a 95 percent chance the mean would fall if the full universe had been surveyed. They therefore show that there is imprecision in the estimates of the means due to the relatively small size of our sample. For example, the estimate for the mean time required for start-of-care visits using OASIS was 143 minutes, but the 95-percent confidence interval for that estimate ranged from 125 minutes to 160. In the text of the report we chose to present medians rather than means, since they are less sensitive to outliers. Table 2 below shows both means and medians."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Measurement Error", "paragraphs": ["Apart from the imprecision introduced by sampling considerations, numerous factors are likely to have influenced the estimates provided to us by the HHAs we surveyed:   The surveyed HHAs varied in the extent to which they relied on written records to calculate the amount of time taken for start-of-care visits pre- and post-OASIS. We asked them to draw on such records if possible, but available records varied from one agency to another.", "To the extent that the respondents believed that higher estimates of time spent on post-OASIS visits might promote more generous payments for home health care under Medicare, there could be an upward bias in the figures provided.", "The comparison of current visit times with those preceding the OASIS mandate incorporates the effects of all the changes that affected home health care over that period, such as shifts in payment methods and amounts by Medicare and other payers, fluctuations in market demand for nursing and therapist staff, and the sharp decline in the number of agencies providing care (following an earlier period of rapid growth), as well as OASIS."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Development and Testing of the OASIS Data Set", "paragraphs": ["OASIS was developed by the University of Colorado Center for Health Services and Policy Research (CHSPR) for the purpose of measuring home health care outcomes. This effort involved first a review of the existing approaches for assessing the quality of home health care, including both a literature review and consultations with clinical experts. A series of studies examined the data that could be obtained from clinical records as well as secondary data sources such as Medicare claims and plan-of- treatment forms. The subsequent empirical testing of candidate measures collected data from 3,427 Medicare and non-Medicare patients treated in 49 HHAs.", "The data elements collected were tested for their statistical reliability. The measures based on those data elements were assessed on a range of criteria, including their clinical meaningfulness (as judged by clinical review panels), coverage across multiple dimensions of health status, minimization of redundancy, and ability to detect differences among HHAs. At the end of this process, CHSPR arrived at a set of 73 core data items needed both to compute core quality indices and to adjust the outcomes reported for different agencies to take account of relevant differences in the circumstances of the patients that they treat (that is, risk adjustment).", "In late 1994, HCFA convened a 13-member Standard Assessment work group made up of HHA administrators, practicing clinicians, a clinical assessment expert, a state official, and representatives of industry and professional organizations. Its charge was to assess CHSPR\u2019s core data items for inclusion in a patient assessment instrument to be mandated under revised conditions of participation for HHAs under the Medicare program. This group recommended that HCFA adopt the core data items with modifications. Specifically, they suggested that HCFA expand three of the data elements, convert one item to three more detailed items, and add eight new items, including cognitive functions, financial ability to meet treatment needs, and hearing, speech, and vision capabilities.", "This expanded core data set, now named OASIS, was then tested in several demonstration studies conducted by CHSPR. Beginning in 1995, a group of 50 HHAs nationwide, plus another 67 in New York State, were selected to see whether HHAs could in fact use OASIS assessments to identify dimensions of care with suboptimal outcomes and then take measures to improve those outcomes. Empirical testing of the OASIS data and measures continued, including a second round of reliability assessments. In addition, a demonstration conducted by Abt Associates also collected OASIS data elements for the purpose of identifying appropriate criteria for setting rates in a home health PPS. A separate set of reliability assessments took place as part of this study. The interim results published by Abt and CHSPR indicate that the OASIS data set is generally reliable, although a few data items had poor reliability according to the standards adopted in these studies. Both CHSPR and Abt are planning to report additional reliability results based on larger numbers of patients, but these findings are not yet available.", "The Medicare Quality Assurance Demonstration and the New York State Outcome Based Quality Improvement Demonstration showed that HHAs could use OASIS data to improve home health care outcomes. Based on their initial OASIS results, the HHAs examined their processes of care in order to develop plans of action designed to enhance two specific outcomes: reducing the hospitalization rate of their patients, and another outcome selected by each participating HHA. Overall, the rate of hospitalization among patients treated by the Medicare Quality Assurance Demonstration HHAs declined in one year from 31.4 percent to 28.3 percent, a decrease of 10 percent. The corresponding decline in hospitalization rates among patients in the New York State Demonstration HHAs was 9 percent. However, no similar decrease in hospitalizations was observed for home health patients nationally during this period. Thus HCFA concluded that outcome-based quality improvement initiatives adopted by the demonstration HHAs were effective in achieving their stated objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: OASIS Data Privacy Protections", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Privacy Act Protections Applicable to OASIS", "paragraphs": ["In protecting the confidentiality of health information of its beneficiaries, HCFA\u2019s activities, like those of other federal agencies, are governed by the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a, P.L. 93-579).

In this notice, HCFA outlined several precautionary measures it was taking to minimize risks of unauthorized disclosure. For example, HCFA stated that it will collect only that information necessary to perform the functions for which it plans to use the OASIS data, such as creating patient outcome reports for HHAs. Similarly, HCFA said it will disclose only the minimum amount of OASIS data necessary to achieve purposes compatible with these functions.

First, HCFA will retain information on individuals who have non-Medicare/Medicaid payment sources in a format that does not identify particular patients. For these patients, the HHA will submit OASIS information with certain patient identifiers \u201cmasked.\u201d According to HCFA officials, masking involves obscuring items such as the patient\u2019s name, Social Security number, and HHA patient identification number, while still allowing data for individual patients to be linked. These officials told us that they cannot decode masked identifiers or re-identify the information based on nonmasked identifiers, and therefore neither the state nor HCFA will know the identity of the non-Medicare/Medicaid patients who are the subjects of transmitted OASIS information.", "Second, HHAs are currently required to submit OASIS data through a private telephone line. HCFA officials told us that they required HHAs to transmit OASIS data via the Medicare Data Communications Network (MDCN) as of October 1, 2000. The MDCN system includes an encryption standard for increased protection from unauthorized access while the data are in transit. According to HCFA officials, the MDCN\u2019s 128-bit encryption standard will guard against unauthorized access to OASIS data, such as by computer hackers, while in transit.", "HCFA and state OASIS automation coordinators also told us that the use of the MDCN network is subject to numerous password protections. In order to access the MDCN, a user needs to know three different items of information, all of which are subject to confidentiality policies: (1) the phone number of the MDCN network, (2) the individual user identification number and password for the MDCN, and (3) the HHA-specific user identification code and password for the applicable state system. In addition, the MDCN passwords must be changed on a periodic basis.", "Third, according to HCFA officials, the agency has implemented physical safeguards and record retention policies to reduce the risk of unauthorized access over time. For instance, the HCFA OASIS data computer server is kept in a secure room, and only personnel with designated access may enter. HCFA officials told us that although they do not inspect the privacy safeguards in place at the state level, guidelines issued to the state agencies require server safeguards. The state OASIS coordinators we spoke with said their server rooms are locked and access restricted.
