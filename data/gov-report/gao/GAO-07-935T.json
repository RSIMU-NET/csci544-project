Personally identifiable information about millions of Americans has been lost, stolen, or improperly disclosed, thereby exposing those individuals to loss of privacy, identity theft, and financial crimes. The wide range of incidents involving data loss or theft, computer intrusions, and privacy breaches underscore the need for improved security practices. As illustrated by these security incidents, significant weaknesses in information security controls threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information and information systems used to support the operations, assets, and personnel of federal agencies. Almost all of the major federal agencies had weaknesses in one or more areas of information security controls. Most agencies did not implement controls to sufficiently prevent, limit, or detect access to computer networks, systems, or information. For example, agencies did not consistently identify and authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access, apply encryption to protect sensitive data on networks and portable devices, and restrict physical access to information assets. In addition, agencies did not always manage the configuration of network devices to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity, such as patching key servers and workstations in a timely manner; assign incompatible duties to different individuals or groups so that one individual does not control all aspects of a process or transaction; and maintain or test continuity of operations plans for key information systems. An underlying cause for these weaknesses is that agencies have not fully or effectively implemented agencywide information security programs. Nevertheless, federal agencies have continued to report steady progress in implementing certain information security requirements. However, IGs at several agencies sometimes disagreed with the agency's reported information and identified weaknesses in the processes used to implement these and other security program activities.

Information  security is a critical consideration for any organization that depends  on information systems and computer networks to carry out its  mission or business. It is especially important for government  agencies, where the public\u2019s trust is essential. The need for a vigilant  approach to information security is demonstrated by the dramatic  increase in reports of security incidents, the wide availability of  hacking tools, and steady advances in the sophistication and  effectiveness of attack technology. Proper safeguards are essential  to protect systems from malicious insiders and external attackers  attempting to gain unauthorized access and obtain sensitive  information, commit fraud, disrupt operations, or launch attacks  against other systems. Over the past year, federal agencies have  reported numerous security incidents.", "For many years, we have reported that poor information security is  a widespread problem with potentially devastating consequences. In  reports to Congress since 1997, we have identified information  security as a governmentwide high-risk issue. Concerned by reports  of significant weaknesses in federal computer systems, Congress  passed the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)  of 2002, which permanently authorized and strengthened  information security program, evaluation, and annual reporting  requirements for federal agencies.", "In my testimony today, I will summarize (1) security incidents  reported at federal agencies, (2) the effectiveness of information  security at federal agencies, (3) agencies\u2019 reported progress in  performing key control activities, and (4) opportunities to enhance  FISMA reporting and independent evaluations. In preparing for this  testimony, we relied on our previous reports and ongoing work on  information security at federal agencies. We also analyzed agencies\u2019  inspectors general (IG) reports pertaining to information security;  congressional reports; annual FISMA reports for 24 major federal  agencies; the performance and accountability reports for those  agencies; and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) FISMA  guidance and mandated annual reports to Congress.

Hence, the degree of  risk caused by security weaknesses is high. For example, resources  (such as federal payments and collections) could be lost or stolen,  data could be modified or destroyed, and computer resources could  be used for unauthorized purposes or to launch attacks on other  computer systems. Sensitive information, such as taxpayer data,  Social Security records, medical records, and proprietary business  information could be inappropriately disclosed, browsed, or copied  for improper or criminal purposes. Critical operations could be  disrupted, such as those supporting national defense and emergency  services. Finally, agencies\u2019 missions could be undermined by  embarrassing incidents, resulting in diminished confidence in their  ability to conduct operations and fulfill their responsibilities.", "Recognizing the importance of securing federal systems and data,  Congress passed FISMA, which sets forth a comprehensive  framework for ensuring the effectiveness of security controls over  information resources that support federal operations and assets.  FISMA\u2019s framework creates a cycle of risk management activities  necessary for an effective security program, and are similar to the  principles noted in our study of the risk management activities of  leading private sector organizations\u2014assessing risk, establishing a  central management focal point, implementing appropriate policies  and procedures, promoting awareness, and monitoring and  evaluating policy and control effectiveness. More specifically,  FISMA requires agency information security programs that, among  other things, include  \u25cf  periodic assessments of the risk;  \u25cf  risk-based policies and procedures;  \u25cf  subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for  networks, facilities, and systems or groups of information systems,  as appropriate;  \u25cf  security awareness training for agency personnel, including  contractors and other users of information systems that support the  operations and assets of the agency;  \u25cf  periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information  security policies, procedures, and practices, performed with a  frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually;  \u25cf  a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting  remedial action to address any deficiencies;  \u25cf  procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security  \u25cf  plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations.", "In addition, agencies must develop and maintain an inventory of  major information systems that is updated at least annually.", "OMB and agency IGs play key roles under FISMA. FISMA specifies  that, among other responsibilities, OMB is to develop policies,  principles, standards, and guidelines on information security, and is  required to report annually to Congress. OMB has provided  instructions to federal agencies and their IGs for FISMA annual  reporting. OMB\u2019s reporting instructions focus on performance  metrics such as certification and accreditation, testing of security  controls, and security training. Its yearly guidance also requests IGs  to report on their agencies\u2019 efforts to complete their inventory of  systems and requires agencies to identify any physical or electronic  incidents involving the loss of, or unauthorized access to, personally  identifiable information.", "FISMA also requires agency IGs to perform an independent  evaluation of the information security programs and practices of the  agency to determine the effectiveness of such programs and  practices. Each evaluation is to include (1) testing of the  effectiveness of information security policies, procedures, and  practices of a representative subset of the agency\u2019s information  systems and (2) assessing compliance (based on the results of the  testing) with FISMA requirements and related information security  policies, procedures, standards, and guidelines.

Personally identifiable  information about millions of Americans has been lost, stolen, or  improperly disclosed, thereby exposing those individuals to loss of  privacy, identity theft, and financial crimes. Agencies have  experienced a wide range of incidents involving data loss or theft,  computer intrusions, and privacy breaches, underscoring the need  for improved security practices. The following reported examples  illustrate that a broad array of federal information and assets are at  risk.  \u25cf  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced that computer  equipment containing personally identifiable information on  approximately 26.5 million veterans and active duty members of the  military was stolen from the home of a VA employee. Until the  equipment was recovered, veterans did not know whether their  information was likely to be misused. In June, VA sent notices to the  affected individuals that explained the breach and offered advice  concerning steps to reduce the risk of identity theft. The equipment  was eventually recovered, and forensic analysts concluded that it  was unlikely that the personal information contained therein was  compromised.  \u25cf  A Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services contractor reported the  theft of a contractor employee\u2019s laptop computer from his office.  The computer contained personal information including names,  telephone numbers, medical record numbers, and dates of birth of  49,572 Medicare beneficiaries.  \u25cf  The Department of Agriculture (USDA) was notified that it had  posted personal information on a Web site. Analysis by USDA later  determined that the posting had affected approximately 38,700  individuals, who had been awarded funds through the Farm Service  Agency or Rural Development program. That same day, all  identification numbers associated with USDA funding were removed  from the Web site. USDA is continuing its effort to identify and  contact all those who may have been affected.   \u25cf  The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) announced a data  security incident involving approximately 100,000 archived  employment records of individuals employed by the agency from  January 2002 until August 2005. An external hard drive containing  personnel data, such as Social Security number, date of birth,  payroll information, and bank account and routing information, was  discovered missing from a controlled area at the TSA Headquarters  Office of Human Capital.   \u25cf  The Census Bureau reported 672 missing laptops, of which 246  contained some degree of personal data. Of the missing laptops  containing personal information, almost half (104) were stolen,  often from employees\u2019 vehicles, and another 113 were not returned  by former employees. Commerce reported that employees were not  held accountable for not returning their laptops.   \u25cf  Officials at the Department of Commerce\u2019s Bureau of Industry and  Security discovered a security breach in July 2006. In investigating  this incident, officials were able to review firewall logs for an 8- month period prior to the initial detection of the incident, but were  unable to clearly define the amount of time that perpetrators were  inside its computers, or find any evidence to show that data was lost  as a result.  \u25cf  The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration reported  that approximately 490 computers at the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) were lost or stolen between January 2003 and June 2006.  Additionally, 111 incidents occurred within IRS facilities, suggesting  that employees were not storing their laptop computers in a secured  area while the employees were away from the office. The IG  concluded that it was very likely that a large number of the lost or  stolen computers contained unencrypted data and also found other  computer devices, such as flash drives, CDs, and DVDs, on which  sensitive data were not always encrypted.  \u25cf  The Department of State experienced a breach on its unclassified  network, which daily processes about 750,000 e-mails and instant  messages from more than 40,000 employees and contractors at 100  domestic and 260 overseas locations. The breach involved an e-mail  containing what was thought to be an innocuous attachment.  However, the e-mail contained code to exploit vulnerabilities in a  well-known application for which no security patch existed at that  time. Because the vendor was unable to expedite testing and deploy  a new patch, the department developed its own temporary fix to  protect systems from being further exploited. In addition, the  department sanitized the infected computers and servers, rebuilt  them, changed all passwords, installed critical patches, and updated  their anti-virus software.", "Based on the experience of VA and other federal agencies in  responding to data breaches, we identified numerous lessons  learned regarding how and when to notify government officials,  affected individuals, and the public. These lessons have largely been  addressed in guidance issued by OMB. OMB has issued several  policy memorandums over the past 13 months. For example, it sent  memorandums to agencies to reemphasize their responsibilities  under law and policy to (1) appropriately safeguard sensitive and  personally identifiable information, (2) train employees on their  responsibilities to protect sensitive information, and (3) report  security incidents. In May 2007, OMB issued additional detailed  guidelines to agencies on safeguarding against and responding to the  breach of personally identifiable information, including developing  and implementing a risk-based breach notification policy, reviewing  and reducing current holdings of personal information, protecting  federal information accessed remotely, and developing and  implementing a policy outlining the rules of behavior, as well as  identifying consequences and potential corrective actions for failure  to follow these rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses Persist at Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["As illustrated by numerous security incidents, significant  weaknesses continue to threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of critical information and information systems used to  support the operations, assets, and personnel of federal agencies.

Our audits continue to identify similar conditions in both financial  and non-financial systems, including agencywide weaknesses as  well as weaknesses in critical federal systems.", "Persistent weaknesses appear in five major categories of  information system controls: (1) access controls, which ensure that  only authorized individuals can read, alter, or delete data;  (2) configuration management controls, which provide assurance  that only authorized software programs are implemented;  (3) segregation of duties, which reduces the risk that one individual  can independently perform inappropriate actions without detection;  (4) continuity of operations planning, which provides for the  prevention of significant disruptions of computer-dependent  operations; and (5) an agencywide information security program,  which provides the framework for ensuring that risks are  understood and that effective controls are selected and properly  implemented.

Our analysis of IG, agency, and our own reports  uncovered that agencies did not have adequate access controls in  place to ensure that only authorized individuals could access or  manipulate data. Of the 24 major agencies, 22 had access control  weaknesses. For example, agencies did not consistently (1) identify  and authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access, (2) enforce  the principle of least privilege to ensure that authorized access was  necessary and appropriate, (3) establish sufficient boundary  protection mechanisms, (4) apply encryption to protect sensitive  data on networks and portable devices, and (5) log, audit, and  monitor security-relevant events. Agencies also lacked effective  controls to restrict physical access to information assets.

Our analysis  determined that at least 18 of the 24 major federal agencies had not  fully implemented agencywide information security programs.  Results of our recent work illustrate that agencies often did not  adequately design or effectively implement policies for elements key  to an information security program.", "We identified weaknesses in information security program activities,  such as agencies\u2019 risk assessments, information security policies  and procedures, security planning, security training, system tests  and evaluations, and remedial actions. For example,  \u25cf  One agency had no documented process for conducting risk  assessments, while another agency had outdated risk assessments.   Another agency had assessed and categorized system risk levels and  conducted risk assessments, but did not identify many of the  vulnerabilities we found and had not subsequently assessed the  risks associated with them.   \u25cf  Agencies had developed and documented information security  policies, standards, and guidelines for information security, but did  not always provide specific guidance on how to guard against  significant security weaknesses regarding topics such as physical  access, Privacy Act-protected data, wireless configurations, and  business impact analyses.   \u25cf  Instances existed where security plans were incomplete or not up- to-date.    \u25cf  Agencies did not ensure all information security employees and  contractors, including those who have significant information  security responsibilities, received sufficient training.   \u25cf  Our report on testing and evaluating security controls revealed that  agencies had not adequately designed and effectively implemented  policies for testing their security controls in accordance with OMB  and NIST guidance. Further, agencies did not always address other  important elements, such as the definition of roles and  responsibilities of personnel performing tests, identification and  testing of security controls common to multiple systems, and the  frequency of periodic testing. In other cases, agencies had not tested  controls for all of their systems.   \u25cf  Our report on security controls testing also revealed that seven  agencies did not have policies to describe a process for  incorporating weaknesses identified during periodic security control  testing into remedial actions. In our other reviews, agencies  indicated that they had corrected or mitigated weaknesses;  however, we found that those weaknesses still existed. In addition,  we reviewed agencies\u2019 system self-assessments and identified  weaknesses not documented in their remedial action plans. We also  found that some deficiencies had not been corrected in a timely  manner.", "As a result, agencies do not have reasonable assurance that controls  are implemented correctly, operating as intended, or producing the  desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements  of the agency, and responsibilities may be unclear, misunderstood,  and improperly implemented. Furthermore, agencies may not be  fully aware of the security control weaknesses in their systems,  thereby leaving their information and systems vulnerable to attack  or compromise. Until agencies effectively and fully implement  agencywide information security programs, federal data and  systems will not be adequately safeguarded to prevent disruption,  unauthorized use, disclosure, and modification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples Illustrate Weaknesses at Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Recent reports by GAO and IGs show that while agencies have made  some progress, persistent weaknesses continue to place critical  federal operations and assets at risk. In our reports, we have made  hundreds of recommendations to agencies to correct specific  information security weaknesses. The following examples illustrate  the effect of these weaknesses at various agencies and for critical  systems.    \u25cf  Independent external auditors identified over 130 information  technology control weaknesses affecting the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) financial systems during the audit of the  department\u2019s fiscal year 2006 financial statements. Weaknesses  existed in all key general controls and application controls. For  example, systems were not certified and accredited in accordance  with departmental policy; policies and procedures for incident  response were inadequate; background investigations were not  properly conducted; and security awareness training did not always  comply with departmental requirements. Additionally, users had  weak passwords on key servers that process and house DHS  financial data, and workstations, servers, and network devices were  configured without necessary security patches. Further, changes to  sensitive operating system settings were not always documented;  individuals were able to perform incompatible duties such as  changing, testing, and implementing software; and service  continuity plans were not consistently or adequately tested. As a  result, material errors in DHS\u2019 financial data may not be detected in  a timely manner.  \u25cf  The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) had not  consistently implemented effective electronic access controls  designed to prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to  sensitive financial and medical information at its operating divisions  and contractor-owned facilities. Numerous electronic access  control vulnerabilities related to network management, user  accounts and passwords, user rights and file permissions, and  auditing and monitoring of security-related events existed in its  computer networks and systems. In addition, weaknesses existed in  controls designed to physically secure computer resources, conduct  suitable background investigations, segregate duties appropriately,  and prevent unauthorized changes to application software. These  weaknesses increase the risk that unauthorized individuals could  gain access to HHS information systems and inadvertently or  deliberately disclose, modify, or destroy the sensitive medical and  financial data that the department relies on to deliver its services.  \u25cf  The Securities and Exchange Commission had made important  progress addressing previously reported information security  control weaknesses. However, 15 new information security  weaknesses pertaining to access controls and configuration  management existed in addition to 13 previously identified  weaknesses that remain unresolved. For example, the Securities and  Exchange Commission did not have current documentation on the  privileges granted to users of a major application, did not securely  configure certain system settings, or did not consistently install all  patches to its systems. In addition, the commission did not  sufficiently test and evaluate the effectiveness of controls for a  major system as required by its certification and accreditation  process.  \u25cf  The IRS had made limited progress toward correcting previously  reported information security weaknesses at two data processing  sites. IRS had not consistently implemented effective access  controls to prevent, limit, or detect unauthorized access to  computing resources from within its internal network. These access  controls included those related to user identification and  authentication, authorization, cryptography, audit and monitoring,  and physical security. In addition, IRS faces risks to its financial and  sensitive taxpayer information due to weaknesses in configuration  management, segregation of duties, media destruction and disposal,  and personnel security controls.  \u25cf  The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) had significant  weaknesses in controls that are designed to prevent, limit, and  detect access to those air traffic control systems. For example, the  agency was not adequately managing its networks, system patches,  user accounts and passwords, or user privileges, and it was not  always logging and auditing security-relevant events. As a result, it  was at increased risk of unauthorized system access, possibly  disrupting aviation operations. While acknowledging these  weaknesses, agency officials stated that because portions of their  systems are custom built and use older equipment with special- purpose operating systems, proprietary communication interfaces,  and custom-built software, the possibilities for unauthorized access  are limited. Nevertheless, the proprietary features of these systems  do not protect them from attack by disgruntled current or former  employees, who understand these features, or from sophisticated  hackers.  \u25cf  Certain information security controls over a critical internal Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) network were ineffective in protecting  the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and  information resources. Specifically, FBI did not consistently  (1) configure network devices and services to prevent unauthorized  insider access and ensure system integrity; (2) identify and  authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access; (3) enforce the  principle of least privilege to ensure that authorized access was  necessary and appropriate; (4) apply strong encryption techniques  to protect sensitive data on its networks; (5) log, audit, or monitor  security-related events; (6) protect the physical security of its  network; and (7) patch key servers and workstations in a timely  manner. Taken collectively, these weaknesses place sensitive  information transmitted on the network at risk of unauthorized  disclosure or modification, and could result in a disruption of  service, increasing the bureau\u2019s vulnerability to insider threats.  \u25cf  The Federal Reserve had not effectively implemented information  system controls to protect sensitive data and computing resources  for the distributed-based systems and the supporting network  environment relevant to Treasury auctions. Specifically, the  Federal Reserve did not consistently (1) identify and authenticate  users to prevent unauthorized access; (2) enforce the principle of  least privilege to ensure that authorized access was necessary and  appropriate; (3) implement adequate boundary protections to limit  connectivity to systems that process Bureau of the Public Debt  (BPD) business; (4) apply strong encryption technologies to protect  sensitive data in storage and on its networks; (5) log, audit, or  monitor security-related events; and (6) maintain secure  configurations on servers and workstations. As a result, auction  information and computing resources for key distributed-based  auction systems maintained and operated on behalf of BPD were at  an increased risk of unauthorized and possibly undetected use,  modification, destruction, and disclosure. Furthermore, other  applications that share common network resources with the  distributed-based systems may face similar risks.  \u25cf  Although the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services had many  information security controls in place that had been designed to  safeguard the communication network, key information security  controls were either missing or had not always been effectively  implemented. For example, the network had control weaknesses in  areas such as user identification and authentication, user  authorization, system boundary protection, cryptography, and audit  and monitoring of security-related events. Taken collectively, these  weaknesses place financial and personally identifiable medical  information transmitted on the network at increased risk of  unauthorized disclosure and could result in a disruption in service."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Improvements Reported in Performance Metrics, but Shortcomings Exist", "paragraphs": ["Despite having persistent information security weaknesses, federal  agencies have continued to report steady progress in implementing  certain information security requirements.

However, on average, high-risk systems had the  smallest percentage of tested contingency plans compared to other  risk levels \u2014only 64 percent of high-risk systems had tested  contingency plans.", "Several agencies had specific weaknesses in developing and testing  contingency plans.

The total number of agency systems  is a key element in OMB\u2019s performance measures, in that agency  progress is indicated by the percentage of total systems that meet  specific information security requirements such as testing systems  annually, testing contingency plans, and certifying and accrediting  systems.

IGs identified  some problems with agencies\u2019 inventories. For example, IGs at two  large agencies reported that their agencies still did not have  complete inventories, while another questioned the reliability of its  agency\u2019s inventory since that agency relied on its components to  report the number of systems and did not validate the numbers.  Without complete, accurate inventories, agencies cannot efficiently  maintain and secure their systems.

In addition, 23 agencies reported  certifying and accrediting more than 75 percent of their systems, an  increase from 21 agencies in 2005.", "Although agencies reported increases in the overall percentage of  systems certified and accredited, results of work by their IGs  showed that agencies continue to experience weaknesses in the  quality of this metric. For fiscal year 2006, ten IGs rated their  agencies\u2019 certification and accreditation process as poor or failing\u2014 an increase from last year. In at least three instances of agencies  reporting certification and accreditation percentages over 90  percent, their IG reported that the process was poor. Moreover, IGs  continue to identify specific weaknesses with key documents in the  certification and accreditation process such as risk assessments and  security plans not being completed per NIST guidance or finding  those items missing from certification and accreditation packages.  IG reports highlighted weaknesses in security plans such as  agencies not using NIST guidance, not identifying controls that were  in place, not including minimum controls, and not updating plans to  reflect current conditions. In other cases, systems were certified and  accredited, but controls or contingency plans were not properly  tested. Because of these discrepancies and weaknesses, reported  certification and accreditation progress may not be providing an  accurate reflection of the actual status of agencies\u2019 implementation  of this requirement. Furthermore, agencies may not have assurance  that accredited systems have controls in place that properly protect  those systems.", "Agencies had not always implemented security configuration  policies. Twenty-three of the major federal agencies reported that  they currently had an agencywide security configuration policy.  Although 21 IGs agreed that their agency had such a policy, they did  not agree that the implementation was always as high as agencies  reported. To illustrate, one agency reported implementing  configuration policy for a particular platform 96 to 100 percent of  the time, while their IG reported that the agency implemented that  policy only 0 to 50 percent of the time. Another IG noted that three  of the agency\u2019s components did not have overall configuration  policies and that other components, which had the policies, did not  take into account applicable platforms. If minimally acceptable  configuration requirements policies are not properly implemented  and applied to systems, agencies will not have assurance that  products are configured adequately to protect those systems, which  could increase their vulnerability and make them easier to  compromise.", "Shortcomings exist in agencies\u2019 security incident reporting  procedures. According to the US-CERT annual report for fiscal  year 2006, federal agencies reported a record number of incidents,  with a notable increase in incidents reported in the second half of  the year. However, the number of incidents reported is likely to be  inaccurate because of inconsistencies in reporting at various levels.  For example, one agency reported no incidents to US-CERT,  although it reported more than 800 incidents internally and to law  enforcement authorities. In addition, analysis of reports from three  agencies indicated that procedures for reporting incidents locally  were not followed\u2014two where procedures for reporting incidents  to law enforcement authorities were not followed and one where  procedures for reporting incidents to US-CERT were not followed.  Several IGs also noted specific weaknesses in incident procedures  such as components not reporting incidents reliably, information  being omitted from incident reports, and reporting time  requirements not being met. Without properly accounting for and  analyzing security problems and incidents, agencies risk losing  valuable information needed to prevent future exploits and  understand the nature and cost of threats directed at the agency.", "Remedial Actions to Address Deficiencies in Information Security Policies, Procedures, and Practices  IGs reported weaknesses in their agency\u2019s remediation process.  According to IG assessments, 16 of the 24 major agencies did not  almost always incorporate information security weaknesses for all  systems into their remediation plans. They found that vulnerabilities  from reviews were not always being included in remedial actions.  They also highlighted other weaknesses that included one agency  having an unreliable process for prioritizing weaknesses and  another using inconsistent criteria for defining weaknesses to  include in those plans. Without a sound remediation process,  agencies cannot be assured that information security weaknesses  are efficiently and effectively corrected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opportunities Exist to Enhance Reporting and Independent Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["Periodic reporting of performance measures for FISMA  requirements and related analysis provides valuable information on  the status and progress of agency efforts to implement effective  security management programs; however, opportunities exist to  enhance reporting under FISMA and the independent evaluations  completed by IGs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limited Assurance of the Quality of Agency Processes", "paragraphs": ["In previous reports, we have recommended that OMB improve  FISMA reporting by clarifying reporting instructions and requesting  IGs to report on the quality of additional performance metrics. OMB  has taken steps to enhance its reporting instructions. For example,  OMB added questions regarding incident detection and assessments  of system inventory. However, the current metrics do not measure  how effectively agencies are performing various activities. Current  performance measures offer limited assurance of the quality of  agency processes that implement key security policies, controls, and  practices. For example, agencies are required to test and evaluate  the effectiveness of the controls over their systems at least once a  year and to report on the number of systems undergoing such tests.  However, there is no measure of the quality of agencies\u2019 test and  evaluation processes. Similarly, OMB\u2019s reporting instructions do not  address the quality of other activities such as risk categorization,  security awareness training, or incident reporting. OMB has  recognized the need for assurance of quality for agency processes.  For example, it specifically requested that the IGs evaluate the  certification and accreditation process.

For  example:  \u25cf  According to their FISMA reports, certain IGs reported interviewing  officials and reviewing agency documentation, while others  indicated conducting tests of implementation plans (e.g. security  plans).  \u25cf  Multiple IGs indicated in the scope and methodology sections of  their reports that their reviews were focused on selected  components, whereas others did not make any reference to the  breadth of their review.   \u25cf  Several reports were solely comprised of a summary of relevant  information security audits conducted during the fiscal year, while  others included additional evaluation that addressed specific  FISMA-required elements, such as risk assessments and remedial  actions.   \u25cf  The percentage of systems reviewed varied; 22 of 24 IGs tested the  information security program effectiveness on a subset of systems;  two IGs did not review any systems.  \u25cf  One IG noted that the agency\u2019s inventory was missing certain Web  applications and concluded that the agency\u2019s inventory was only   0-50 percent complete, although it also noted that, due to time  constraints, it was unable to determine whether other items were  missing.  \u25cf  Two IGs indicated basing a portion of their template submission  solely on information provided to them by the agency, without  conducting further investigation.  \u25cf  Some reviews were limited due to difficulties in verifying  information provided to them by agencies. Specifically, certain IGs  stated that they were unable to conduct evaluations of their  respective agency\u2019s inventory because the information provided to  them by the agency at that time was insufficient (i.e. incomplete or  unavailable).", "The lack of a common methodology, or framework, has culminated  in disparities in audit scope, methodology, and content. As a result,  the collective IG community may be performing their evaluations  without optimal effectiveness and efficiency. A commonly used  framework or methodology for the FISMA independent evaluations  is a mechanism that could provide improved effectiveness,  increased efficiency, and consistency of application. Such a  framework may provide improved effectiveness of the annual  evaluations by ensuring that compliance with FISMA and all related  guidance, laws, and regulations are considered in the performance  of the evaluation. IGs may be able to use the framework to be more  efficient by focusing evaluative procedures on areas of higher risk  and by following an integrated approach designed to gather  evidence efficiently.

Almost all major agencies exhibit  weaknesses in one or more areas of information security controls.  Despite these persistent weaknesses, agencies have continued to  report steady progress in implementing certain information security  requirements.
