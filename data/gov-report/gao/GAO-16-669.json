Examples of the programs' results include: for CERC, as of the end of 2015, the launch of 15 products, such as software for enhancing energy efficiency of buildings; and for the USTDA program, through fiscal year 2015, about $230 million in U.S. exports from its clean energy projects. Based on performance monitoring principles in the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010, it is a leading practice for federal programs to link goals to performance measures with established targets. Without targets, it is unclear how results compare with intended performance and what improvements may be needed; this is particularly important as DOE and State officials are planning the next phases of their programs and USTDA emphasizes the role of data in program decisions.", "DOE identified intellectual property (IP) risks CERC participants may face, such as participants not having a clear plan for protecting IP, and took steps to manage them. These steps included requiring agreements clarifying IP rights and providing training, in part to encourage participants to share IP created outside of CERC projects. DOE officials said this IP sharing is important for valuable research and development collaboration. CERC participants GAO spoke with reported no significant issues with DOE's management of IP risks but, nonetheless, have been reluctant to share IP.

Concerns over rising emissions  of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, and their effects on the  climate have led most countries to adopt or consider adopting policies to  reduce these emissions. In part for these reasons, the United States and  China are seen as instrumental in multilateral efforts to address climate  change. Individually, in an attempt to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,  both the United States and China are investing in renewable resources  and also in efforts to increase the efficiency of traditional fossil fuel  sources. In 2015, China led the world in renewable energy investments  with an estimated $102.9 billion in new investments, while the United  States invested approximately $44.1 billion.

Because of these issues, the commission recommended that we conduct  an assessment of government-led U.S.-China collaborative initiatives on  clean energy; subsequently, you requested that we do so. In this report,  we examine (1) how much funding U.S. agencies have obligated to clean  energy cooperation with China, (2) what is known about the results of key  U.S.-China cooperation programs and the extent to which these programs  follow leading practices in performance monitoring, and (3) the extent to  which the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) manages risks that may face  U.S. participants in the U.S.-China Clean Energy Research Center  (CERC).", "To address these objectives, we analyzed funding data and documents,  interviewed agency officials, and conducted site visits to locations in  California, Michigan, and West Virginia and phone conferences to  interview program participants, including from the three organizations  leading collaborative research under CERC. The U.S. government has no  uniform definition of clean energy that is applied government-wide.  However, based on consultation with participating agencies and review of  the White House\u2019s June 2013 Climate Action Plan, we determined that  the following types of energy technologies are relevant for this review:  renewable energy (including  solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and  biofuels); energy efficiency technologies (i.e., technologies that decrease  the intensity of energy usage); nuclear power; natural gas; clean coal  (e.g., coal with carbon capture, utilization, and storage); clean vehicle  technologies; and improved energy infrastructure (e.g., smart grids).", "To identify the funding obligated to clean energy cooperation with China  from fiscal years 2008 through 2015, we sent a questionnaire to agencies  that we identified as being involved in these efforts.

According to staff from think tanks  and business associations and other individuals knowledgeable about  U.S.-China clean energy cooperation that we interviewed, U.S.  cooperation with China on clean energy could yield benefits such as  building trust between the countries, helping both countries advance their  efforts to meet environmental challenges, and creating opportunities for  U.S. businesses in China. According to these individuals, the sharing of  any IP through this cooperation is a potential risk due to possible IP theft.", "In November 2014, the two countries\u2019 presidents issued a U.S.-China  Joint Announcement on Climate Change, which included targets to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, and for China to  intend to reach peak carbon dioxide emissions around 2030 and increase  the share of non-fossil fuels in its energy consumption. The  announcement also emphasized the countries\u2019 commitment to a  successful climate agreement at the United Nations Climate Change  Conference in Paris in 2015, and the countries\u2019 presidents reaffirmed this  commitment in a U.S.-China Joint Presidential Statement on Climate  Change in September 2015. In December 2015, more than 190 member  states under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate  Change came together to adopt the Paris Agreement, which aims to hold  the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees  Celsius above pre-industrial levels through countries setting their own  nonbinding targets for emissions reductions. In Paris, some of the  countries that adopted the Paris Agreement also committed to initiatives  to substantially increase public and private investment in climate change  mitigation and adaptation activities. For example, through the Mission  Innovation initiative, 20 countries, including the United States and China,  will seek to double their governmental clean energy research and  development investment over 5 years to accelerate clean energy  innovation and make it widely affordable.", "In addition to its bilateral cooperation with China, the United States  cooperates bilaterally and multilaterally with other countries on initiatives  related to climate change and clean energy. For example, the United  States has a Clean Energy Dialogue with Canada to encourage the  development of clean energy technologies to reduce greenhouse gases  and combat climate change. Also, in 2009, the United States launched  the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy with India, which is working to  accelerate inclusive, low carbon growth by supporting research and  deployment of clean energy technologies. Both the United States and  China, along with 21 other countries and the European Commission,  participate in the Clean Energy Ministerial, a high-level global forum to  promote policies and programs that advance clean energy technology, to  share lessons learned and best practices, and to encourage the transition  to a global clean energy economy.

Officials said that USTDA\u2019s  Office of Program Monitoring and Evaluations provides the East Asia  Program and the agency with data that can be used to examine program  performance and identify areas for improvement.", "USTDA assesses its projects while they are ongoing and soon after they  have been completed. These assessments focus on several areas,  including the implementation potential of the project; feedback from  project participants; and project impacts, such as U.S. exports and the  development impact on the recipient country. USTDA also uses an  independent evaluator to evaluate almost all its projects. These  evaluations occur on an annual basis to determine whether the projects  have resulted in additional exports or development impacts until USTDA  determines that no further results are likely to occur, which can take 5  years or longer. USTDA follows these same monitoring practices for all of  its programs throughout the agency. See appendix III for more  information on USTDA\u2019s organization and reporting relationships.", "USTDA has agency-wide goals used to evaluate its performance.  Officials further stated that these goals flow down from the agency to the  East Asia Program. The goals are to  create U.S. jobs by supporting exports of U.S. goods and services for  priority development projects in emerging economies, foster opportunities for U.S. small businesses through significant  involvement in USTDA\u2019s programs, and utilize evidence and evaluation data to guide agency programming  decisions.", "Each agency-wide goal has associated performance measures. These  same measures are also used to monitor the East Asia Program,  according to USTDA officials. USTDA set a target for one of the agency- wide performance measures\u2014to exceed the Small Business  Administration\u2019s benchmark of 23 percent of federal prime contracts  awarded to U.S. small businesses\u2014although USTDA officials said that  they do not break down this target by program. None of the other  agency-wide or program-level performance measures had targets,  although the agency does set targets at the project level for some  performance measures reflecting certain goals such as potential exports.", "USTDA officials said that there are several reasons why they do not have  targets for most of their performance measures at the agency or program  level. Because USTDA is a demand-based agency, with projects  generally proposed by industry, officials said that it is difficult to know  what kinds of projects will be proposed and ultimately approved and  funded. Furthermore, officials said that having a precise target for each  performance measure could produce a perverse incentive by encouraging  them to fund a project in order to meet a given target, even if they did not  think it was the project most worthy of being funded. USTDA officials are  also concerned that targets would reduce their flexibility in allocating  USTDA\u2019s resources. For example, officials said that they have strategic  reasons for investing in certain countries, including responding to U.S.  government policy priorities, even if those projects will not necessarily  produce the most exports, and targets could limit their ability to fund those  projects. However, as GAO has previously reported, if an agency has  measurable, balanced performance measures that cover all an agency\u2019s  priorities, this should prevent an overemphasis on one or two priorities at  the expense of others that may skew an agency\u2019s performance. Without  published agency-wide targets, as required by GPRAMA, it is unclear if  agency managers have the information they need to determine if they are  making sufficient progress toward achieving their goals, to identify  performance shortfalls and options for improvement, and to provide  Congress and the public with information needed to enhance their  oversight and better ensure the agency\u2019s accountability.

For example, some of  the U.S. and Chinese organizations participating in the clean vehicles  track agreed to share battery testing data.

Upon receipt of the  agencies\u2019 responses, we took multiple steps to ensure that responses  were complete, including comparing all responses against each other to  determine if activities were reported by one agency but not others that  also participated in the activity, comparing responses against other  agency documentation describing U.S.-China clean energy cooperative  efforts, and following up with the agencies to ask for clarifications  regarding any activities that seemed that they may have been missing.  We also sent each agency a set of questions to help determine the  reliability of the sources of the data and to ensure that the agencies  considered the information provided as a complete and accurate  characterization of their agency\u2019s participation in and funding of U.S.- China clean energy cooperation. Our analysis of these responses showed  there were some activities that had been reported but for which the  funding was not solely for the purpose of clean energy cooperation with  China.

In addition to interviewing CERC participants and DOE  officials, we interviewed eight individuals we learned to be knowledgeable  about U.S.-China cooperation on clean energy to get their perspective on  the potential IP risks for CERC participants and, in some instances, the  steps DOE has taken to address those risks. To determine the extent to  which DOE has taken steps to manage these risks, we identified the risk  management steps DOE has taken and then compared these steps to  federal internal control standards for risk assessment, which state that  agencies should assess the risks the agency faces from both internal and  external sources and decide how to manage those risks and what actions  should be taken. Specifically, we analyzed relevant documents, including  the CERC Protocol and IP Annex, the Technology Management Plan for  each CERC track, the CERC \u201cResearchers\u2019 Guide to IP and Technology  Transfer,\u201d and the results of a CERC IP survey. We directed clarifying  questions about the IP survey to DOE officials and a CERC participant  and determined that the survey information is accurate and reliable for  our purposes. We also interviewed knowledgeable DOE officials to  understand what steps DOE took to identify and respond to any risks that  U.S. participants in CERC may face, and we interviewed CERC  participants to get their feedback on the effectiveness of these steps.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2015 to July 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
