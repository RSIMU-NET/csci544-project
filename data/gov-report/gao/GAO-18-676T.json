At the same  time, several government-wide initiatives hold great promise for  advancing the transparency, efficiency, and effectiveness of federal  grants. These are important and challenging issues and I am pleased to  have the opportunity to share observations from our large body of work  on federal grants management as well as suggestions for moving forward  with grant reform initiatives.", "As we have previously reported, federal grants to state and local  governments are an important tool of government. This policy tool  provides funding for national priorities in many areas including health  care, transportation, education, and social services. Federal outlays for  grants to state and local governments totaled more than $674 billion in  fiscal year 2017, equivalent to 3.5 percent of the gross domestic product  (GDP) in that year. Grants vary greatly in numerous ways including size,  the nature of their recipients, and the type of programs they fund. In  addition, substantial variation in the way federal agencies administer  these programs has further increased their complexity. This diversity and  complexity contributes to the challenge of government-wide efforts to  address crosscutting grants management reforms.", "Recent initiatives\u2014including the administration\u2019s establishment of the  Results-Oriented Accountability for Grants Cross-Agency Priority (CAP)  goal through the President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA)\u2014present an  opportunity for the federal government to help address long-standing  grants management challenges. Congress has often asked us to evaluate  grants management issues to inform efforts that focus on accountability,  while maximizing the investment of billions of dollars in federal grant  funding. Our work also reflects the intergovernmental perspectives  inherent in the administration of these grants and includes insights from  reviews of federal government agencies as grantors as well as the  perspectives of grantees in their role as implementers of these grants.", "Drawing on our prior federal grants management work as well as our  work on managing for results across the federal government, my remarks  today address: (1) observations on long-standing challenges for federal  grants management and (2) opportunities to effectively advance current  grant modernization initiatives.

Officials from universities and  stakeholder organizations we interviewed identified common factors that  added to their administrative workload and costs for complying with  selected requirements. These factors included:  variation in agencies\u2019 implementation of requirements, pre-award requirements for applicants to develop and submit detailed  documentation for grant proposals, and  increased prescriptiveness of certain requirements.", "We have also reported on a number of initiatives intended to address the  challenges grantees encounter throughout the grants lifecycle. These  initiatives include consolidating and revising grants management  circulars, simplifying the pre-award phase, promoting shared information  technology solutions for grants management, and improving the  timeliness of grant closeout and reducing undisbursed balances. Our  work includes reviews of efforts to submit the Consolidated Federal  Financial Report through a single system and to standardize notices of  award to reduce reporting burden. In addition, the Digital Accountability  and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) required the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) to establish a pilot program to develop  recommendations for reducing reporting burden for recipients of federal  awards. In 2016 and 2017, we reported on the design and  implementation of the OMB pilot program, known as the Section 5 Pilot,  aimed at developing recommendations for reducing reporting burden for  grant recipients and contractors. We made a number of  recommendations to improve the design of the Section 5 Pilot to ensure  its consistency with leading practices for pilot design, which OMB has  implemented. We continue to monitor implementation of the Section 5  Pilot through ongoing work and look forward to keeping the subcommittee  informed about our findings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transparency of Grant Spending Can Inform Decision Making", "paragraphs": ["To provide increased transparency to agencies, Congress, and the public,  the DATA Act required OMB, the Department of the Treasury (Treasury),  and other federal agencies to increase the types of information available  on the more than $3.7 trillion in annual federal spending, including federal  spending on grants. The law requires OMB and Treasury to establish  data standards to enable the reporting and tracking of agency spending at  multiple points in the spending lifecycle. Since enactment, OMB,  Treasury, and federal agencies have addressed many of the policy and  technical challenges presented by the act\u2019s requirements, including  standardizing data elements across the federal government, linking data  contained in agencies\u2019 financial and award systems, and expanding the  types of data reported. However, in a 2017 report, we found  inconsistencies in key award data elements and issues with the  completeness and quality of the information reported. We made a number  of recommendations to OMB and Treasury to clarify guidance to help  agencies fully comply with DATA Act requirements and report accurate  data and to disclose known data quality issues. OMB and Treasury  generally agreed with our recommendations.

A  lack of collaboration among and between federal agencies, state and  local governments, and nongovernmental grant participants presents a  challenge to effective grants implementation. Given the complexity of  managing intergovernmental grants, collaboration among the grant  participants, particularly with regard to information sharing, is an  important factor in effective grants management. For example, one of the  lessons learned in our work on the American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) is that increased accountability requirements  and aggressive timelines require coordination\u2014both vertically among  levels of government and horizontally within the same level of  government\u2014to share information and work toward common goals during  implementation. Intra- and intergovernmental networks facilitated efforts  to achieve the purposes of the act in an effort to efficiently and effectively  spend the grant funds.", "Our work on interagency grants management reform initiatives also found  that inadequate ongoing communication with grantees sometimes  resulted in poor implementation and prioritization of initiatives. Our 2014  work on the Recovery Act illustrated how agencies can effectively  approach ongoing communication. For example, the developers of  Recovery.gov used input from user forums, focus groups, and usability  testing with interested citizens to collect feedback and  recommendations. This information then informed the development of  the website from its initial stages. More recently, in our 2014 work on the  DATA Act, we have noted OMB and Treasury efforts to allow the public to  share their views and comment on the development of federal data  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying Fragmentation, Overlap and Duplication Could Result in Greater Efficiencies", "paragraphs": ["Our prior work has shown that numerous federal grant programs created  over time without coordinated purposes and scope can result in grants  management challenges. Addressing these challenges may achieve cost  savings and result in greater efficiencies in grant programs. Our work has  underscored the importance of identifying fragmentation, overlap, or  duplication in a number of federal programs, including grants  management practices. For example, in January 2017, we found that  the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Food and Nutrition  Service, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had not  established guidance and formal processes to avoid duplication and  overlap among grants in their agencies before awarding grants. We  recommended that these agencies do so, and they agreed. In response,  these agencies have taken a number of actions to address the  recommendation. For example, the Department of the Interior provided us  documentation showing that the Fish and Wildlife Service now requires  that discretionary grant applicants provide a statement that addresses  whether there is any overlap or duplication of proposed projects or  activities to be funded by the grant. The Fish and Wildlife Service also  updated its guidance to grant awarding offices instructing them to perform  a potential overlap and duplication review of all selected applicants prior  to making grant awards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strong Internal Controls and Oversight Facilitate Effective Use of Grant Funds", "paragraphs": ["Our prior work has shown that when awarding and managing federal  grants, effective oversight and internal control is important to provide  reasonable assurance to federal managers and taxpayers that grants are  awarded properly, recipients are eligible, and federal grant funds are used  as intended and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.  Internal control comprises the plans, methods, and procedures agencies  use to be reasonably assured that their missions, goals, and objectives  can be met. In numerous reviews, we and agency inspectors general  identified weaknesses in agencies\u2019 internal controls for managing and  overseeing grants. Specifically, we found that when such controls are  weak, federal grant-making agencies face challenges in achieving grant  program goals and assuring the proper and effective use of federal funds  to help avoid improper payments. Our work has identified weaknesses in  grants oversight and accountability issues that span the government  including undisbursed grant award balances, single audit submissions  that are late, and significant levels of improper payments in grant  programs. Key grants management challenges related to internal controls  and oversight that we have identified include:", "Timeliness of grant closeouts. Federal grant-making agencies must  close out grants when the grantee\u2019s period of performance has ended  in order to ensure that grantees have met all financial requirements  and provide final reports as required. Closing out grants also allows  agencies to identify and redirect unused funds to other projects and  priorities as authorized or to return unspent balances to the Treasury.  These accounts, and, in some cases, the undisbursed balances  associated with them, persisted as an issue for agencies, as we  reported in 2008, 2012, and 2016. In January 2016, the Grants  Oversight and New Efficiency Act (GONE Act) was signed into law.", "The act, passed in part in response to our work, required government- wide reporting of undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts.", "The GONE Act requires that agencies report on the grants for which  the grantee\u2019s period of performance had expired for more than 2  years, including those with undisbursed balances and with zero dollar  balances remaining in the accounts. In the fall of 2017, many  agencies included in their annual Agency Financial Reports an  appendix providing information required by the GONE Act. For  example, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  reported almost $2 billion in undisbursed funds remaining in 16,603  grant accounts that were two years or more past their periods of  performance and 6,512 grant accounts that had no funds remaining in  them. HHS grant officials told us that they intend to close as many of  these grant accounts as possible during this fiscal year.", "Timely submission of single audits. As we have previously  reported, one key way that federal agencies oversee nonfederal  grantees is through an audit of their expenditures of federal awards,  referred to as a single audit. The single audit is an audit of the award  recipient\u2019s expenditure of federal awards and of its financial  statements. A single audit can identify deficiencies in the award  recipient\u2019s compliance with the provisions of laws, regulations,  contracts, or grant agreements and in its financial management and  internal control systems. Correcting such deficiencies can help  reasonably assure the effective use of federal funds and reduce  federal improper payments. In 2017, we reported that of the five  departments we reviewed\u2014the Departments of Agriculture,  Education, HHS, Housing and Urban Development, and  Transportation\u2014some of the departments\u2019 subagencies did not  effectively design policies and procedures to reasonably assure the  timely submission of single audit reports by award recipients. In this  report, we made 21 recommendations to these departments. Some  action has been taken to date in response to these recommendations.", "Avoiding improper payments of federal grants. As we have  previously reported, improper payments\u2014payments that should not  have been made or that were made in an incorrect amount\u2014have  consistently been a government-wide issue. Since fiscal year 2003\u2014 when certain agencies were required by statute to begin reporting  estimated improper payments for certain programs and activities\u2014 cumulative improper payment estimates have totaled about $1.4  trillion. Our reviews of Medicaid, a joint federal-state health care  program and significant source of federal grant funding to state  governments, have shown that the program is particularly vulnerable  to improper payments, given its size, diversity, and complexity. For  example, Medicaid accounted for more than 26 percent ($36.7 billion)  of the nearly $141 billion government-wide improper payment  estimate in fiscal year 2017. We have also reported that federal  spending for Medicaid is expected to significantly increase, so it is  especially critical that appropriate measures be taken to reduce  improper payments in this program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Opportunities to Effectively Advance Current Grants Management Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["Recent and proposed legislative- and executive-sponsored initiatives  aimed at grants management reform, present opportunities to improve the  efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of federal grants.

Those features include:", "Establishing implementation goals and tracking progress. Our  work highlighted the importance of establishing an implementation  schedule and tracking progress toward priorities to help pinpoint  performance shortfalls and suggest midcourse corrections, including  any needed adjustments to future priorities and milestones.", "Identifying and agreeing on leadership roles and responsibilities.  Our work has shown that when interagency councils clarify who will  do what, identify how to organize their joint and individual efforts, and  articulate steps for decision making, they enhance their ability to work  together and achieve results.", "Developing an effective communication strategy. We reported on  the importance of two-way communication that allows for feedback  from relevant stakeholders. For example, our work showed that  grantees felt that a lack of opportunities to provide timely feedback  resulted in poor implementation and prioritization of streamlining  initiatives and limited grantees\u2019 use and understanding of new  functionality of electronic systems.", "In addition, given the number and diversity of grantor agencies and  grantmaking programs, we believe it is important that any grant reform  initiative integrate with other government-wide reform efforts on related  issues. One such reform initiative is the PMA, which lays out a long-term  vision for modernizing the federal government and improving the ability of  agencies to achieve results. The PMA identified a set of CAP goals to  target areas where multiple agencies must collaborate to effect change  and report progress in a manner the public can easily track. According  to the PMA, one of the goals included in the agenda\u2014the Results- Oriented Accountability for Grants CAP goal\u2014is intended to maximize the  value of grant funding by applying a risk-based data-driven framework  that balances compliance requirements with demonstrating successful  results for taxpayers. The PMA further states that this CAP goal seeks to  standardize grant reporting data and improve data collection in ways that  will increase efficiency, promote evaluation, and reduce reporting burden.  Effectively advancing results-oriented accountability for grants will require  that implementation of this CAP goal moves forward in tandem with  related efforts to implement the DATA Act and advance the use of  evidence to inform grant policy, highlighted below:", "DATA Act implementation. As our work has shown, the DATA Act  will continue to be a critical driver of grants management change and  reform. When fully implemented, the act will improve the  accountability and transparency of federal spending data by (1)  establishing government-wide financial data standards so that data  are comparable across agencies and (2) holding federal agencies  more accountable for the quality of the information disclosed. Such  increased transparency provides opportunities for improving the  efficiency and effectiveness of federal spending; increasing the  accessibility of data to benefit the public and the business community;  and improving oversight to prevent and detect fraud, waste, and  abuse of federal funds. As efforts to implement the DATA Act move  forward, we will continue to monitor implementation efforts and  coordinate our efforts with agency inspectors general.", "Evidence-based policy. To better integrate evidence and rigorous  evaluation in budget, management, operational, and policy decisions,  OMB has encouraged federal agencies to expand or improve the use  of grant program designs that focus federal dollars on effective  practices while encouraging innovation in service delivery. For  example, OMB\u2019s efforts to foster a culture of evidence-based policy  resulted in several federal agencies\u2019 implementation of tiered  evidence grant programs. Under this approach, agencies establish  tiers of grant funding based on the level of evidence of effectiveness  provided for a grantee\u2019s service model. Agencies award smaller  amounts to promising service models with a smaller evidence base,  while providing larger amounts to those with more supporting  evidence. In our 2016 report, we recommended that OMB establish a  formal means for federal agencies to collaborate on tiered evidence  grants. In response, in 2017, OMB launched the Tiered Evidence  Grants Working Group to collaborate and share lessons learned, for  example, on the use and dissemination of evaluation results.", "These efforts should complement each other. A lack of integration could  result in duplication of effort or run the risk of working at cross-purposes.  For example, the integration of the Results-Oriented Accountability for  Grants CAP goal with ongoing DATA Act implementation and efforts to  advance evidence-based approaches to federal grant funding and  administration presents a complex governance challenge.", "In conclusion, designing and implementing grants management policies  that strike an appropriate balance between ensuring accountability for the  proper use of federal funds without increasing the complexity and cost of  grants administration for agencies and grantees is a longstanding  governance challenge. As the initiatives above demonstrate, meeting this  challenge and successfully implementing grants management reforms will  require intragovernmental coordination at the federal level,  intergovernmental collaboration with state and local governments and  other partners, and ongoing integration to ensure that grants  management reforms and related DATA Act and evidence-based policy  implementation efforts are complementary and do not exist in separate  silos.", "We look forward to continuing our ongoing work to review implementation  of the CAP goals, the DATA Act, and the infusion of evidence-based  policy in federal grant programs. We also look forward to working with this  and other committees as we assist Congress in identifying additional  opportunities to advance grants management reform through reviews of  individual grant programs and crosscutting analysis of grant  implementation and grants management reform efforts.", "Chairman Palmer, Ranking Member Raskin, and members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared remarks.
