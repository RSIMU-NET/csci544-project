GAO found that about half of the 35 metrics generally included elements as called for by the NDAA, while 17 metrics differed, such as in scope or calculation. For example, DHS only provided information on the southwest border for some metrics, such as the estimate of undetected unlawful border crossers for which a methodology for estimating unlawful crossings for the northern border had not yet been completed. DHS components responsible for collecting the metric data generally have processes in place to ensure the reliability of the data and the quality of the information provided. DHS also identified and disclosed limitations for some, but not all, of the data elements and metrics used. For example, GAO found that DHS did not disclose limitations on data related to apprehensions of individuals that were assisted by unmanned aerial systems. By developing and implementing a process to systematically review the reliability of the data and comprehensively identify and communicate limitations, DHS would improve the quality of the information provided.", "DHS used a statistical model to estimate three metrics on unlawful border entries but did not validate some assumptions the model employs through sensitivity analyses and provide measures of statistical uncertainty in accordance with standards for federal agencies. For example, DHS's model assumes that 100 percent of families unlawfully crossing the border will be apprehended, but DHS did not provide information on the extent to which the assumption affected its metrics. DHS also did not provide information on the level of statistical uncertainty for the metrics, such as margins of error. Providing such information would allow Congress and the public to better understand the potential limitations and accuracy of these metrics of unlawful entry.

The majority of the 43 metrics are counts and rates of  border security activities, such as the number of detected unlawful entries  between POEs and a rate that measures traffic volume at land POEs  against the physical and staffing capacity at each land POE. The  remaining metrics are estimates, such as the number of undetected  unlawful entries, or were not specifically described. DHS issued its first  report to respond to the NDAA requirement in May 2018, titled Border  Security Metrics Report. The NDAA also includes a provision for us,  within 270 days of receipt and biennially for the following 10 years, to  review and report to Congress on DHS\u2019s report. Specifically, the provision  directs us to analyze the suitability and statistical validity of the data and  methodology contained in the report, and, as appropriate, include  recommendations on improvements needed to the metrics and the  feasibility of other suitable metrics. This report addresses the following  questions:  1.  To what extent has DHS reported metrics as outlined in the NDAA  using quality information?  2.  To what extent has DHS validated the assumptions and conveyed  statistical uncertainty for its unlawful entry metrics?  3.  What, if any, other metrics have been identified that may be used to  measure the effectiveness of border security?", "To determine the extent to which DHS reported metrics outlined in the  NDAA using quality information, we first determined which of the 43  metrics DHS included in its first annual report and which it did not. For  metrics DHS included, we identified the specific data sources and sets  DHS used to develop them, such as administrative data collected by DHS  components (e.g., data on apprehensions, POE wait times, drug seizures,  and flight hours). We also interviewed officials from DHS offices and  components involved in developing the metrics, including the Office of  Immigration Statistics (OIS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP)  Office of Field Operations, U.S. Border Patrol (Border Patrol), and Air and  Marine Operations (AMO); and the U.S. Coast Guard (Coast Guard). In  these interviews we obtained information about the methodologies DHS  components used to develop the metrics, including any limitations they  identified and their plans to update or revise existing metrics in the future.  To determine the extent to which DHS reported metrics as outlined in the  NDAA, we assessed how, if at all, the metrics DHS presented and the  methods DHS used to calculate the metrics were similar to, or different  from, the metrics listed in the NDAA. Where we identified clear  differences between the metrics DHS reported and those described in the  NDAA, we reviewed documentation and obtained additional perspectives  from DHS officials, as necessary, to determine the reasons for the  differences.", "To determine the quality of the information used for the metrics, we  assessed the extent to which DHS has processes to ensure data  reliability and quality. Specifically, we reviewed any of our ongoing or  completed work relevant to the metrics, relevant DHS Office of Inspector  General (OIG) reports, and the metrics included in DHS\u2019s Annual  Performance Reports to determine which data we had previously  assessed or which had been assessed by the OIG or DHS, and the  results of those assessments. For data that had not previously been  assessed, we collected information from DHS to determine what  processes are in place to ensure the overall reliability and quality of the  data. We reviewed this information to determine the extent to which  DHS\u2019s processes are consistent with Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, good practices for verifying and validating  performance information we have identified in our prior work, and DHS\u2019s  Management Directive on Information Quality.", "To determine the extent to which DHS validated the assumptions and  conveyed statistical uncertainty for its unlawful entry metrics, we first  identified the metrics for which DHS utilized a statistical model (i.e., the  use of a capture-recapture model to estimate the number of undetected  unlawful entries). We interviewed officials from DHS Office of Immigration  Statistics (OIS) and the Institute for Defense Analyses, DHS\u2019s contractor,  to obtain information on the statistical model used to estimate unlawful  border entry metrics, including assumptions made and how, if at all, they  were validated. We further analyzed DHS\u2019s use of the statistical model  and compared it against practices for the use of statistical models  outlined in the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Standards and  Guidelines for Statistical Surveys. Using OMB\u2019s standards, we identified  principles and practices to determine the extent to which DHS\u2019s modeling  was consistent with them and what, if any, improvements could be made.  We also analyzed DHS\u2019s modelling assumptions on the composition of  the unlawful migrant population to determine the extent to which  assumptions DHS made about the unlawful migrant population reflect  data on individuals apprehended between POEs. We interviewed Border  Patrol officials and reviewed documentation to obtain information on  possible alternative approaches DHS is considering for modelling  unobserved events.", "To identify other metrics that may be used to measure the effectiveness  of border security, we reviewed our prior work and DHS OIG reports  related to border security to identify open recommendations focused on  establishing border security measures in the four domains listed in the  NDAA.

Within DHS, CBP  and the Coast Guard have primary responsibility for border security within  these four domains. CBP and its subcomponents are to secure U.S.  borders at and between POEs by preventing inadmissible people and  illicit goods from entering the United States, among other responsibilities.  Within CBP, the primary offices and components involved in border  security are the Office of Field Operations at POEs, Border Patrol  between POEs, and Air and Marine Operations for air and marine security  in the land and maritime domains. The Coast Guard and CBP\u2019s Air and  Marine Operations share responsibility for security of the nation\u2019s  maritime borders. Table 1 shows examples of border security metrics by  domain and responsible DHS component.", "According to DHS officials, within DHS, two subcomponents within the  Office of Strategy, Policy, and Plans were responsible for coordinating the  department\u2019s effort to develop the fiscal year 2017 Border Security  Metrics Report. A senior DHS official explained that the report was initially  tasked to the Unity of Effort Integration Office, which was part of the Unity  of Effort initiative started in 2014 to better understand border security  efforts along the southwest border including exploring the development of  border security metrics. OIS assumed responsibility for the report in  2017. According to OIS officials, to prepare the report, they obtained  data and information related to each NDAA metric from the administrative  records of the DHS components with primary responsibilities for border  security in the four domains. For example, OIS requested data and  information on \u201cturn backs\u201d and \u201cgot aways\u201d from Border Patrol\u2014the lead  component for the between POE domain\u2014which records sector  estimates of turn backs and got aways based on direct and indirect  observations.", "Of the 43 metrics the NDAA listed for inclusion in the Border Security  Metrics Report, the majority were counts and rates of border security  activities. The remaining metrics were estimates or were not specifically  described. For example, the number of apprehensions in each Border  Patrol sector is a count metric. In contrast, a rate metric compares one  value or number against another. For example, the wait time ratio  compares the average wait times to total commercial and private  vehicular traffic volumes being processed at a land POE. An estimate is  used for metrics of flows or activities that are largely undetected and  therefore cannot be measured directly and must be estimated, such as  the number of undetected unlawful entries. A few metrics are a  combination of counts or rates with an estimate. For example, the metric  for total inadmissible travelers at POEs counts known inadmissible  travelers that are intercepted at POEs, and also requires an estimate of  how many inadmissible travelers may have successfully entered at a  POE without being detected, which cannot be directly measured. The  NDAA did not specifically describe some metrics. For example, while the  NDAA asked for an examination of each of the eight consequences under  the Consequence Delivery System, it did not specify how this examination  was to be carried out or what it was to include.", "While many of the metrics required by the NDAA can be addressed with  data from DHS\u2019s administrative records, certain metrics that rely on  estimates necessitate the use of alternative methodologies and in some  cases, specialized technical expertise. For example, DHS contracted with  the Institute for Defense Analyses to assist with the development of a  statistical model for estimating undetected unlawful entries. In its fiscal  year 2017 Border Security Metrics Report, DHS provided information on  its methodological approaches, such as how it estimated undetected  unlawful entries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Reported Information on Most Required Metrics and Generally Used Quality Information but Did Not Identify Some Limitations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS Reported Information on 35 of the 43 Required Metrics and Generally Included Elements Listed in the NDAA", "paragraphs": ["In its first Border Security Metrics Report, DHS reported information on 35  of the 43 metrics called for by the NDAA. The metrics DHS provided  spanned the four domains outlined in the NDAA and included a mix of  counts, rates, estimates, or a combination thereof as shown in figure 1.", "For 18 of the 35 border security metrics DHS included in its report, we  found DHS generally included elements listed in the NDAA. For example,  the NDAA asked for the number of detected unlawful entries between  POEs, and in its report DHS provided information on the number of  detected unlawful entries over a 10-year period. As another example,  the NDAA asked for the number of cargo containers at sea ports that  were identified to be potentially high-risk. In response, DHS provided  information on the number of potentially high-risk containers from fiscal  years 2013 through 2016 and also provided contextual information about  trends in the volume of such containers over time. See table 2 for more  information on these examples as well as other examples of the types of  information included in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2017 Border Security Metrics  Report.", "For some metrics, DHS also provided information in addition to the  elements listed in the NDAA. For example, the NDAA described the  \u201cAMO apprehensions assisted\u201d metric as a count of the number of  apprehensions that were assisted by CBP\u2019s AMO through the use of  unmanned aerial systems and manned aircraft. In addition to the counts  for such assists, DHS also provided data on the flight hours expended to  assist with these apprehensions.", "For 17 of the 35 reported metrics, we identified differences between the  metric as described by the NDAA and as reported by DHS. The  differences we identified generally fell into two categories:", "Metric differed in scope or calculation. Some of the metrics DHS  reported on differed in scope or in their calculation from what the  NDAA described for reasons such as data availability, among other  factors. For example, DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2017 Border Security Metrics  Report scoped three metrics on unlawful border crossings between  POEs (the \u201cattempted unlawful border crosser apprehension rate,\u201d the  \u201cestimated undetected unlawful entries,\u201d and the \u201cprobability of  detection rate\u201d) to only include data for the southwest border. In  these instances, the report noted that a methodology for estimating  data on unlawful crossings for the northern border had not yet been  completed but that research was underway to do so. As an example  of a difference in calculation, DHS presented the interdiction  effectiveness rate for each southwest border sector as an alternative  to the metric \u201cunlawful border crossing effectiveness rate in each  Border Patrol sector.\u201d According to DHS\u2019s report, the department  used the interdiction effectiveness rate because it had not yet  produced and validated sector-level estimates of unlawful entries  required to calculate the unlawful border crossing effectiveness rate.  In its report, DHS stated it expects these estimates to be available for  the 2019 report.", "Alternative metric provided. For the situational awareness in the  maritime environment metric, DHS stated that it is in a multi-year  process to develop a metric that meets the intent of the NDAA. As  an alternative, DHS instead provided data on the number of aircraft  and vessel operational hours that contributed to maritime domain  situational awareness.", "See appendix I for additional information about any differences we  identified for each metric.", "The eight metrics on which DHS did not provide information spanned all  four domains.

Quality information is derived from relevant and reliable data  and is considered to be, among other things, complete, accurate, and  timely. The specific processes DHS components use to ensure data  reliability vary from metric to metric. Examples of processes DHS or its  components have implemented to help ensure the reliability of the data  and the quality of information provided include:  Issuing guidance and monitoring implementation. In September  2012, Border Patrol headquarters officials issued guidance to help  provide a more consistent, standardized approach for the collection  and reporting of turn back and got away data by Border Patrol  sectors. Each sector is individually responsible for monitoring  adherence to the guidance. According to DHS\u2019s report, command staff  at Border Patrol stations ensure agents are aware of and utilize  proper definitions for apprehensions, got aways, and turn backs at  their respective stations and also ensure that the necessary  communication takes place between and among sectors and stations  to minimize double-counting when subjects cross over multiple areas  of responsibility.", "Supervisory reviews of data entries. With regard to data on AMO  vessel and aircraft missions, AMO guidance mandates that  supervisors perform a review of all pre- and post-mission data entries  to help ensure accurate entry of mission information. AMO officials  confirmed that supervisors review the data being entered into the  database. Additionally, officials said AMO data teams run monthly  validation checks of data entered to check for completeness and  accuracy, such as out-of-range values.", "Using built-in electronic safeguards. CBP\u2019s databases for entering  and maintaining data elements\u2014including travelers or passengers  seeking admission, known inadmissible aliens at POEs, referrals for  secondary examinations, major infractions, and private vehicles  processed at a POE\u2014have built-in processes to detect and prevent  potential data entry errors. More specifically, as an officer enters a  record, the systems check for valid entries into relevant fields and  provide an error message to the officer for entries that appear to be  invalid (e.g., if an officer leaves a mandatory field blank or enters  contradictory information such as charging an individual with a crime  while also entering a request for expedited removal). In some cases,  the systems will prevent a record from being saved if any required  fields are blank.", "Comparing data against other sources. As part of the Coast  Guard\u2019s data reliability processes for data on maritime migrant  interdictions used in the \u201cknown maritime migrant flow rate\u201d metric,  Coast Guard officials said that analysts cross-check the data entered  into their database with other Coast Guard reporting documents, such  as internal spreadsheets, to ensure accuracy.", "Independent assessment of performance measure data. Some  border security metrics are similar to, or use the same data elements  as, performance measures DHS reports annually in response to the  Government Performance and Results Act Modernization Act  (GPRAMA) of 2010. For those performance measures, DHS  annually assesses a subset of measures and their data for  completeness and reliability using independent review teams. For  example, in May 2017 an independent review team assessed the  \u201cmigrant interdiction effectiveness in the maritime environment\u201d  performance measure, which uses the same data as the border  security metric, \u201cknown maritime migrant flow rate.\u201d The review team  found the measure to be complete and reliable and the data to be of  good quality overall, but also recommended that the Coast Guard and  DHS continue work on an improved database to enhance the  consistency of data collection, among other things.", "In addition to the components having processes to help ensure the  reliability of the data and the quality of the information used in the report,  DHS took steps to be transparent in its presentation of the metrics by  identifying and disclosing known limitations with some of the data  elements or methodologies used for the metrics in its report.  Communicating the extent to which such limitations exist and their  potential impact is important to help facilitate the appropriate use and  understanding of the data and the metrics. DHS identified and disclosed  limitations related to the potential for misclassification of observations, the  potential for cases not being entered or recorded correctly, and  methodological limitations, among other things. For example, one of the  key limitations DHS\u2019s report identified for the data on turn backs and got  aways is that they are based on potentially subjective observations of  agents who have to make a determination on how to classify them based  on what they observed or the available evidence (e.g., tracks, sensor  activations, interviews with apprehended subjects, camera views, etc.).  Further, DHS\u2019s report explained that agents may face challenges in  making that determination because some unlawful border crossers may  enter the United States to drop off drug loads or to act as decoys to lure  agents away from a certain area and then return to Mexico, and therefore  may be misidentified as turn backs, for example. As another example,  DHS identified limitations due to cases not being entered or recorded  correctly. For the \u201cknown maritime migrant flow rate\u201d metric, DHS used  data on the total number of maritime migrants interdicted. In its report,  DHS explained that a potential limitation of this data element is that the  Coast Guard relies on international and domestic partners to report their  interdictions for compilation in its database. Consequently, the accuracy  and completeness of the data depend on whether those reports are made  by those partners and the accuracy of their reports. See appendix I for  additional information about the limitations identified for each metric.", "Even as DHS identified and disclosed limitations related to some of its  metrics, we identified at least one additional limitation for 21 of the 35  metrics on which DHS reported where DHS did not disclose such  limitations or could have been more transparent about the limitations in its  report. Examples of such instances include:", "Potential for cases not being entered or recorded correctly. In our  previous work we found that mission data for unmanned aerial  systems were inconsistently collected across operation locations.  Specifically, in February 2017 we reported that there were instances  where no assist information was recorded in AMO\u2019s data system even  though such assets participated in investigations and operations.  Because AMO\u2019s data may not reflect all asset assists, we  recommended that AMO update and maintain guidance for recording  mission information in its data collection system and provide training  to users of the system. For its fiscal year 2017 Border Security  Metrics Report, DHS used asset assists data in metrics such as the  \u201cAMO individuals detected,\u201d \u201cAMO apprehensions assisted,\u201d and \u201cillicit  drug seizures assisted by AMO,\u201d but did not disclose this limitation in  its report.", "Potential for data to be changed over time. Border Patrol officials  told us that data on the apprehension of unaccompanied alien  children may change over time because original apprehension  records from a shared database have, in some instances, been  updated by staff from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO). Officials said  that in January 2015 they noticed that ERO staff were inadvertently  overwriting Border Patrol\u2019s original data entries about the status of  apprehended children when they made updates to those children\u2019s  records. For example, if a child was unaccompanied at the time of his  or her apprehension and was recorded as such by Border Patrol in  the initial record entry, ERO may have changed the \u201cunaccompanied\u201d  status in the system after they matched the child with a family  member or sponsor. As a result, data may not be reconcilable with  initial apprehension counts over time.", "DHS did not fully disclose limitations for some metrics. We  identified instances where DHS could improve transparency about the  assumptions or limitations of the data presented in its report. For  example, in 2014 Border Patrol implemented a standard, southwest  border-wide methodology to improve reporting of turn backs and got  aways. While DHS made mention of this change in the text of the  report, the data for these metrics are presented in tables without any  table notes or disclosures within the table about this change. Further,  DHS\u2019s report does not discuss how the change may affect  comparability of the data. Consequently, a reader may not be aware  that data for before 2014 in a table are not necessarily comparable to  the data for 2014 and after in the same table.", "Without a comprehensive identification of the limitations of the metrics  and their associated data, and without an adequate disclosure of those  limitations, the value of DHS\u2019s report as a source of information to  Congress, policymakers, and the public may be diminished. The metrics  in the report were specifically identified and requested by Congress in the  NDAA, and provide Congress with important information about the  outputs and outcomes of DHS\u2019s border security policies and investments  that could be used to inform decision-making. However, those reading the  report may not be aware of important contextual information because  DHS did not identify and disclose some limitations, thereby creating the  potential for the data to be misinterpreted.", "According to DHS officials who prepared the report, while they took steps  to identify methodological limitations of the metrics, no process currently  exists to systematically review the reliability of operational data used for  public reporting purposes, such as in the metrics report. Specifically, DHS  officials within OIS told us that while they were responsible for leading  and managing the preparation of the report, they largely relied on the  DHS components from which they collected the data to assess the data\u2019s  reliability and communicate identified limitations. OIS officials explained  that many of the data elements used, such as those from AMO or the  Coast Guard, were ones with which they were not familiar or had not  worked with previously in their area of immigration statistics. OIS officials  also noted that in some cases, the data had previously been used in  performance measures or had been collected and tracked for several  years, so they trusted the components\u2019 processes for ensuring their  reliability and identifying limitations, but reviewed the data provided where  possible and consulted with the components as needed. However, OIS  officials said that while they included as much information in the report as  was known about identified limitations with the existing operational data,  no additional effort was made to systematically review the underlying  reliability of the data to comprehensively identify limitations that should be  acknowledged when publicly reported because no department-wide  process exists to do so.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management officials should evaluate data sources for reliability and  communicate quality information, including relevant data from reliable  sources, to achieve an agency\u2019s objectives. The quality information can  then be used by agency management and external stakeholders such as  policymakers, to make informed decisions and evaluate performance,  among other things. Further, DHS\u2019s Management Directive on Information  Quality states that data and information disseminated by the department  should, among other things, have full, accurate, transparent  documentation, and error sources affecting data quality should be  identified and disclosed to users. Additionally, our previous work on  approaches for verifying and validating performance information found  that communicating significant data limitations and their implications  allows stakeholders to judge the data\u2019s credibility for their intended use  and to use the data in appropriate ways. By developing and  implementing a process to systematically review the reliability of the data  or consider the results of assessments components have completed,  comprehensively identify any limitations, and communicate the data or  methodological limitations with the metrics, DHS would improve the  quality of the information available to Congress, DHS leadership, and the  public.

DHS also used the Model- based Apprehension Rate to develop two other metrics in the fiscal year  2017 Border Security Metrics Report:  (1)  A \u201cprobability of detection rate,\u201d which is the estimated proportion of  the number of detected unlawful border entries to the total number of  unlawful entries between land POEs.

Originally developed and utilized in biological  and ecological sciences, capture-recapture models have been applied to  other disciplines, including social science. According to the Institute for  Defense Analyses, capture-recapture models have been the core  approach for academic efforts to model the process of unlawful entry into  the United States across land borders for several decades.", "To develop its statistical model, DHS used a capture-recapture  methodology to calculate a probability of apprehension by counting the  number of unlawful border crossers that were apprehended multiple  times. At a high-level, capture-recapture involves taking an initial sample  of the population of interest, in this case individuals attempting to cross  the border unlawfully. Then, separately, a second, independent sample of  the same population is taken. The samples are then compared to  determine the number of individuals who appear in both samples. When  the number of individuals who appear in both samples (e.g., individuals  who have been apprehended twice) is low, it can be inferred that the  overall population of interest (e.g., total unlawful border crossers) is much  larger than the total number of individuals in the two samples. On the  other hand, if the recapture rate is high, then it can be inferred that the  overall population of interest is not much larger than the total number of  individuals in the two samples.", "In the context of unlawful border crossing, when an individual\u2019s first  attempt at unlawfully crossing the border is successful, the individual  enters the United States and no apprehension is made. However, if an  individual is apprehended, Border Patrol records an apprehension of this  individual in a DHS data system and the individual is potentially subject to  consequences for entering unlawfully, such as administrative  enforcement and removal, criminal prosecution, or being barred from  legally entering the United States in the future. The individual is then  returned to his or her home country, where the individual can then choose  whether or not to make another attempt to unlawfully cross the border.  During a second attempt to unlawfully cross the border, the individual  faces the same possible outcomes (enter the United States unlawfully or apprehension by Border Patrol). Figure 2 provides the framework for  DHS\u2019s Model-based Apprehension Rate.", "DHS modified the traditional capture-recapture methodology by  calculating a deterrence rate of 60 percent in fiscal year 2016 to account  for individuals who choose not to make another unlawful border crossing  attempt. The deterrence rate accounts for an individual being deterred  from attempting to unlawfully cross the border again; that is, DHS  assumed that some percentage of apprehended individuals, once  returned to their country, will remain in their home country. DHS  calculated the deterrence rate based upon a survey of Mexican  individuals who were apprehended and returned to the border region of  Mexico by U.S. immigration authorities. DHS assumed the remaining 40  percent of individuals who were apprehended and removed to their home  country in fiscal year 2016 remain undeterred and will attempt to  unlawfully cross the border again.", "Historically, DHS (and its predecessor the Immigration and Naturalization  Service) did not use statistical models to calculate an apprehension rate  but relied on apprehensions as a proxy measure for all unlawful entries  (both observed and unobserved) between POEs. DHS also included in its  report information on the apprehension rate using this method.  Specifically, DHS also calculated an Observational Apprehension Rate  based on direct observations (unlawful border crossers observed by  Border Patrol) and indirect observations (residual evidence of a border  crosser, i.e., footprints) of attempted unlawful border crossers. Using the  observational apprehension rate, DHS calculated that in fiscal year 2016,  it apprehended 79 percent of unlawful border crossers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Statistical Model Uses Assumptions about Border Crossers that Have Not Been Validated and May Affect Results", "paragraphs": ["DHS made assumptions about border crossers to develop its statistical  model and described these assumptions in its report; however, DHS did  not validate some of these assumptions or determine how they potentially  could affect the accuracy of the Model-based Apprehension Rate through  the use of sensitivity analyses.", "More specifically, DHS\u2019s model incorporates several assumptions related  to border crossers. Among others, these assumptions include:  the rate at which individuals will be deterred from crossing again  remains the same, regardless of the number of attempts an individual  has made;   individuals who indicate an intent to stay near the U.S.-Mexico border  will attempt re-entry; a single apprehension rate applies to diverse groups of border  crossers, regardless of their nationality or the number of attempts an  individual has made; and  certain individuals will not evade Border Patrol.", "However, the validity of some of these assumptions\u2014which affect the  Model-based Apprehension Rate\u2014is uncertain. For example, DHS\u2019s  model estimates the rate at which a diverse group of border crossers  attempting to evade detection will be apprehended by Border Patrol. This  group includes both Mexicans and non-Mexicans and individuals who  attempt to cross again after varying amounts of time. Despite this  diversity, the model assumes that all crossers have the same chance of  apprehension on each attempt to cross the border. This assumption  allows DHS to apply the estimated apprehension rate developed based  on a sample of Mexicans re-apprehended within 90 days\u2014the group for  whom relevant data exist\u2014to a broader population of individuals  regardless of the number of attempts the border crossers have made or  their nationality. However, DHS did not make efforts to determine the  extent to which an apprehension rate based on Mexican citizens re- attempting entry within 90 days would reflect apprehension rates for non- Mexicans and individuals crossing again after longer periods.", "Additionally, DHS assumes that the apprehension rate never varies  between an individual\u2019s attempts at crossing the border. For example,  DHS assumes that an individual making a first attempt at crossing the  border faces the same odds of apprehension as an individual making a  fourth or fifth attempt at crossing the border. However, DHS has not  explored the possibility that, for example, individuals may gain experience  and knowledge from border-crossing attempts that could help them better  evade Border Patrol on subsequent attempts.", "Further, DHS\u2019s model assumes that certain individuals unlawfully  crossing the border, such as those seeking asylum, will not evade  apprehension and will turn themselves in to Border Patrol. Specifically, in  addition to individuals who ultimately do seek asylum, DHS also includes  within this group and applies this assumption to individuals apprehended  as a family unit and unaccompanied minors. Under this assumption, 100  percent of such individuals are apprehended. According to DHS\u2019s fiscal  year 2017 Border Security Metrics Report, these individuals have  historically been released into the United States with a Notice to Appear  in immigration court for legal proceedings on a future date, rather than  being subject to immediate DHS enforcement consequences such as  voluntary return. Therefore, DHS assumes that 100 percent of these  individuals will self-present to Border Patrol because, in doing so, they  are able to claim asylum or other protection and potentially remain in the  United States.", "However, representatives from the Institute for Defense Analysis stated  that while anecdotally self-presenting rates of these individuals are high,  more rigorous analysis is needed to accurately estimate a self- presentation rate. For example, it is possible that not all families crossing  the border unlawfully may seek to self-present to Border Patrol; some  may attempt to evade capture and enter the United States undetected. In  this case, DHS may be underestimating the number of individuals who  unlawfully cross the border and enter the United States by assuming 100  percent of these individuals will self-present to Border Patrol agents.  Additionally, DHS noted in its fiscal year 2017 Border Security Metrics  Report that this assumption does not reflect the actual behavior of all  border crossers in this group. OIS officials stated that they based this  assumption on interviews with Border Patrol agents but had not done  formal or quantitative analysis to support this assumption. Further, OIS  officials stated that they did not have a strong alternative assumption to  use instead and therefore assumed that 100 percent of individuals within  this group are apprehended.", "DHS described these assumptions in its report but did not provide  quantitative information on the extent to which these assumptions  affected the Model-based Apprehension Rate through the use of  sensitivity analyses. Sensitivity analyses help to convey the extent to  which changing the values of variables, assumptions, data, or other input  affects statistical estimates. For example, sensitivity analyses could  provide information on how different assumptions about unlawful border  crossers\u2019 behavior and other inputs to the statistical model could have  affected the Model-based Apprehension Rate. OIS officials stated that  while they had started to run sensitivity analyses by modifying certain  assumptions, they had not completed the analysis and did not include  results of the sensitivity analyses in the report.", "The Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) statistical standards for  federal agencies include providing the results of sensitivity analyses for  key methodological assumptions to ensure that these assumptions do not  unduly affect the results of the model.

Specifically, using the Model- based Apprehension rate, DHS estimated that 65 percent of unlawful  border crossers were apprehended in fiscal year 2016, and the remaining  35 percent entered the United States. However, like all statistical models,  DHS\u2019s estimate is based upon a limited sample of data and may be  affected by random variation, meaning that DHS does not have complete  certainty that its rate is accurate.

Including measures of  statistical uncertainty in future reports would allow Congress, policy  makers, and the public to more fully evaluate the extent to which the  metrics that use the Model-based Apprehension Rate are valid. Further,  while DHS may ultimately adopt a new, simulation-based model in the  future, described later in this report, it plans to use the current Model- based Apprehension Rate for estimates in its Border Security Metrics  Report for the foreseeable future. Therefore, providing this additional  information about the estimates would allow DHS to more accurately  convey how limitations in available data and methods could affect the  results and provide more useful information about migration and border  enforcement.

Specifically, DHS\u2019s current statistical model does not fully account for the  changing population of unlawful border crossers. The capture-recapture  methodology, which underlies the Model-based Apprehension Rate, was  developed to sample homogenous populations that behave in set,  uniform ways. However, those crossing the border have become  increasingly diverse in recent years. Our analysis of DHS data used to  develop the Model-based Apprehension Rate shows that the number of  unlawful border crossers whose characteristics and behavior are best  reflected in the statistical model has declined. For example, our analysis  illustrated that the population that conforms best to the model\u2019s  assumptions\u2014adult Mexicans travelling without dependents who do not  plan to claim asylum and who are returned to Mexico in a short amount of  time\u2014has fallen from over 60 percent of apprehensions in fiscal year  2000 to less than 25 percent of apprehensions in 2016, as shown in  figure 3.", "Conversely, the number of individuals who are excluded from the  statistical model such as non-Mexicans, and individuals whose behavior  may not reflect the model\u2019s assumptions, such as asylum-seekers or  those who have not departed the United States (e.g., because they are  awaiting immigration court proceedings) have increased over time, as  shown in figure 4. For example, the percentage of individuals  apprehended at the border who are excluded from the model because  they await immigration court proceedings increased from 26 percent in  fiscal year 2000 to almost 70 percent in fiscal year 2016.", "DHS acknowledged these trends in its fiscal year 2017 Border Security  Metrics Report and noted them as a limitation to the effectiveness of its  model. OIS officials further noted that some of these limitations are  difficult to address within the bounds of the statistical model. For example,  to properly account for non-Mexicans, OIS officials stated that they would  need information on the rate at which non-Mexicans are deterred from  crossing the border. However, it would be difficult and costly to obtain this  information through the use of a survey and real-world data does not  already exist, according to OIS officials.", "To help address limitations of its current statistical model, DHS has  invested in another research project to estimate the number of unlawful  border crossers between land POEs, including unknown border entries.  Border Patrol contracted with Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory  to undertake a project that aims to use a combination of statistical  modeling and data from sensors along the border to estimate the total  number of unlawful border entries between land POEs, including entries  both detected by Border Patrol and those not detected by Border Patrol.  According to project documentation we reviewed, the project plans to  leverage the CBP Tactical Simulation, an agent-based simulation of  tactical border operations. CBP Tactical Simulation incorporates  information on terrain at the border based on geographic information  systems and sensors along with probability models that reflect how  Border Patrol agents and unlawful border crossers behave in given  circumstances.", "Border Patrol and OIS officials told us that this project would be more  adaptable to changing border conditions and could help the agency  address limitations associated with the Model-based Apprehension rate.  Specifically, according to OIS officials, a simulation-based estimate would  rely upon fewer assumptions about the types of individuals who unlawfully  cross the border as compared to the current Model-based Apprehension  rate. However, Border Patrol officials noted that estimates of  unobservable phenomena, such as unobserved border entries, always  face some limitations in their accuracy and that the new model may still  rely upon samples of data that would have associated uncertainty as well  as assumptions that would need to be validated. Ultimately, though,  Border Patrol officials stated that the simulation-based model may be an  improvement upon the current Model-based Apprehension rate.", "Border Patrol officials stated that the first iteration of the model would be  presented to Border Patrol leadership for their review at the end of fiscal  year 2019 and if at that time Border Patrol leadership approves the  model, the earliest the simulation-based estimate could potentially be  incorporated into the DHS Border Security Metrics Report would be for  fiscal year 2020.

For example,", "Between POEs domain. In February 2017, we reported on the use of  border fencing along the southwest border and found that CBP  collects data that could help provide insight into how border fencing  contributes to border security operations, including the location of  illegal entries. For example, we found that CBP collects data it could  potentially use to determine the extent to which border fencing diverts  illegal entrants into more rural and remote environments, and border  fencing\u2019s impact, if any, on apprehension rates over time. However,  CBP had not developed metrics that systematically use these data to  assess the contributions of border fencing to its mission. To better  position CBP to make resource allocation decisions with the best  information available to inform competing mission priorities and  investments, we recommended that the Chief of the Border Patrol  develop metrics to assess the contributions of pedestrian and vehicle  fencing to border security along the southwest border using CBP data.  DHS agreed with the recommendation and stated that it planned to  develop metrics for use in its operational control framework for  southwest border security operations. As of October 2018, DHS  stated that the department planned to test the metrics and implement  them in the framework by September 2019.", "At POEs domain. In July 2017, we reported on the Importer Security  Filing (ISF) program and found that while ISF rule data have  improved the program\u2019s ability to identify high-risk cargo shipments,  CBP could collect additional performance information to better  evaluate program effectiveness. While evaluating the direct impact  of using ISF rule data to assess shipment risk is difficult, we identified  examples of how CBP could better assess the ISF program\u2019s  effectiveness. For example, CBP could track the number of containers  not listed on a manifest\u2014which could pose a security risk\u2014it identifies  through reviewing vessel stow plans. Collecting this type of additional  information would help CBP better assess whether the ISF program is  improving its ability to identify high-risk shipments. Therefore, we  recommended that CBP identify and collect additional performance  information on the impact of the ISF rule data, such as the  identification of shipments containing contraband, to better evaluate  the effectiveness of the ISF program. DHS agreed with the  recommendation and reported that it is working to assess additional  performance metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of the ISF program  and anticipates completing the assessment by end of December  2019.", "Maritime border domain. In October 2017, we reported on the Coast  Guard\u2019s performance goals and found that although the Coast  Guard\u2019s performance goals are generally aligned with its statutory  missions, the Coast Guard does not explain why certain aspects of  mission performance are measured while others are not. For  example, we found that while the Coast Guard\u2019s mission is to interdict  all illegal drugs, the agency\u2019s two performance goals related to that  mission were for cocaine interdiction only, excluding many other  substances. We recommended that the Coast Guard either develop  new performance goals to address mission activity gaps, or explain in  the Coast Guard\u2019s Annual Performance Report why certain aspects of  mission performance are measured while others are not. Developing  new goals to address missions, or describing how existing goals  sufficiently assess mission performance, could better convey the  Coast Guard\u2019s progress in achieving its missions.", "DHS agreed with the recommendation and in February 2018, the  Coast Guard provided us with its updated fiscal year 2017 Annual  Performance Report. We found that while the updated report  explained why performance goals related to its drug interdiction  mission focus solely on cocaine interdiction, for the four other  performance goals we previously identified as not fully addressing all  related mission activities, the updated report did not include additional  goals or explain why certain aspects of mission performance are not  measured. We continue to believe that in instances in which  performance goals do not fully address all of the respective mission  activities, the Coast Guard\u2019s Annual Performance Report should  include an explanation.", "Air and marine security in the land domain. In May 2017, we  reviewed DHS\u2019s efforts to address subterranean, aerial, and maritime  smuggling of drugs and humans.

Additionally, we found that DHS  had similarly not assessed smuggling methods such as tunnels,  panga boats (a fishing vessel), and recreational vessels. We  recommended that DHS direct CBP, ICE, and Coast Guard to  establish and monitor performance measures and targets related to  ultralight aircraft, cross-border tunnels, panga boats, and recreational  vessel smuggling to help provide reasonable assurance that efforts to  address these smuggling methods are effective. By establishing  measures and monitoring performance against targets, managers  could obtain valuable information on successful approaches and  areas that could be improved to help ensure that technology  investments and operational responses to address these smuggling  methods are effective.", "DHS agreed with the recommendations for measures related to  ultralight aircraft and cross-border tunnels.

As of June 2018, DHS reported that  ICE was leading the development of measures related to cross-border  tunnels. DHS did not agree with the recommendation to establish  measures and monitor performance against targets for smuggling by  panga boats and recreational vessels because the department  believed measures and targets would not provide the most useful  strategic assessment of operations to prevent all illicit trafficking,  regardless of area of operations or mode of transportation. We  continue to believe that the recommendation is valid and recognize  the value of high-level strategic performance measures. However,  such high-level measures may not provide sufficiently detailed  performance information to allow DHS to identify successful  approaches to addressing smuggling by panga boats and recreational  vessels and areas for improvement.
