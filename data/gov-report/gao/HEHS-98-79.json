Medicare\u2019s physician fee schedule payments totaled about $43 billion in 1997. Since many other insurers base their payments on Medicare\u2019s, the fee schedule allowances also influence physicians\u2019 non-Medicare income.", "Before implementation of the physician fee schedule in 1992, Medicare based payments on each physician\u2019s charges and the charges of other physicians in the same locality. The fee schedule system was instituted to relate payments to the resources physicians use to provide a service, rather than to physicians\u2019 charges for a service. For each of three categories of resources\u2014physician work, practice expenses, and malpractice expenses\u2014each medical procedure is ranked against all other procedures according to the amount of resources used. The fee schedule allowance for a procedure equals the sum of the three rankings, expressed as relative value units (RVU), multiplied by a conversion factor that translates RVUs into dollars. Currently, only the physician work RVUs, which account for about half the total RVUs for each procedure, are resource based. The practice expense and malpractice expense RVUs, which account for about 41 percent and 5 percent, respectively, of the fee schedule allowances, are still based on historical charges for physician services. The reason for this is that a new system for calculating resource-based values for these components was not available at the time the fee schedule was implemented by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA). (App. I provides additional information on the Medicare fee schedule.)", "The Social Security Amendments of 1994 required the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to revise the fee schedule by 1998 so that the practice expense RVUs would reflect the relative amount of applicable resources physicians expend when they provide a service or perform a procedure. The Congress required that the revision be budget neutral, so total Medicare payments to physicians for practice expenses would not change. However, Medicare payments could increase for some services and procedures and decrease for others. Furthermore, depending upon their mix of services and procedures, members of different physician specialties could experience gains or losses in their Medicare payments.", "On June 18, 1997, HCFA published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register that described HCFA\u2019s proposed practice expense revisions to the fee schedule. HCFA estimated that the revisions would generally increase Medicare payments to physician specialties that provide more office-based services. For example, HCFA estimated that Medicare payments to family practice physicians would increase by 12 percent, and payments to thoracic surgeons, who perform more hospital-based procedures, would decrease by 28 percent. In total, HCFA estimated that its revisions, had they been in effect in fiscal year 1997, would have reallocated $2 billion of the $18 billion Medicare paid for physician practice expenses that year. The revisions could also affect physicians\u2019 non-Medicare income if other insurers adopt the Medicare revisions.", "Some physician groups argued that HCFA based its proposed revisions on invalid data and that the reallocations of Medicare payments would be too severe. Subsequently, the Congress included provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that delay the resource-based practice expense revisions until 1999; establish a 3-year phase-in period for the revisions; and require HCFA to publish a revised proposed rule by May 1, 1998. The act also required us to evaluate HCFA\u2019s June 1997 proposed rule, report to the Congress within 6 months, and consult with representatives of physicians\u2019 organizations during our evaluation.", "This report provides our evaluation of HCFA\u2019s proposed practice expense revisions and also includes information on HCFA\u2019s ongoing efforts to refine its data and methodologies. Specifically, this report focuses on (1) HCFA\u2019s approach for estimating the practice expenses directly associated with each medical service or procedure, (2) two methodologies HCFA used to adjust the direct expense estimates, (3) practice expenses excluded or limited by HCFA, (4) HCFA\u2019s method for assigning indirect practice expenses to each medical service or procedure, and (5) the potential impact of the new fee schedule allowances on beneficiary access to care.", "We reviewed HCFA\u2019s proposed revisions, comments received on the proposal, and selected documentation on the data and methodologies HCFA and its contractor used. We also held extensive meetings with HCFA staff to gain an understanding of the methodologies they used and the rationale behind some of their key decisions and assumptions. We did not gather new data on physician practice expenses, test the reliability of HCFA\u2019s data, or independently verify HCFA\u2019s data sources or calculations; but we did our own calculations, using HCFA\u2019s data, to analyze some aspects of HCFA\u2019s methodology. We also met with researchers, representatives of physician organizations, and others to obtain their views on HCFA\u2019s proposal and to discuss potential alternative data sources and methodologies. We performed our evaluation from August through December 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The physician groups and others that we met with are listed in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A resource-based, relative-value payment system ranks procedures on a common scale, according to the resources used for the procedure. The need to estimate and rank practice expenses for thousands of medical procedures, coupled with the complex structure of the Medicare program, presented HCFA with some enormous challenges.", "Cost data for physician practices are available in the aggregate and for individual items, including the wages and salaries of receptionists, nurses, and technicians employed by the physician; the cost of office equipment such as examining tables, instruments, and diagnostic equipment; the cost of supplies such as face masks and wound dressings; and the cost of billing services and office space. For most physician practices, the total of each of these expenses is probably readily available. However, Medicare pays physicians by procedure, such as a skin biopsy. Therefore, HCFA had to develop a way to estimate the portion of practice expenses associated with each procedure\u2014information that is not readily available.", "Another difficulty inherent in developing a resource-based fee schedule is that significant variations in practice expenses exist among physicians and their practice settings. For example, a general practice physician in a solo practice likely has expenses different from those of a physician in a group practice.", "Both these problems\u2014the difficulty in allocating expenses to procedures and the variation in expenses among physician practices\u2014are mitigated somewhat by basing the fee schedule allowances on relative rankings of practice expenses. Even though the absolute expenses associated with a procedure cannot be precisely measured and will vary among physicians, the expense of one procedure relative to another is easier to estimate and less likely to vary across physician practices.", "Because of these issues, revising the practice expense component of the fee schedule has been a difficult task for HCFA, and the revisions HCFA proposed in June 1997 have been the subject of widespread controversy among physician specialty groups. This controversy is not unexpected, since the legislative requirement that fee schedule changes be budget neutral means that some physician specialty groups would benefit from the changes at the expense of other groups. Among the physician specialty groups that we met with, groups representing physicians whose Medicare payments were projected to increase generally supported HCFA\u2019s proposal, while groups whose members\u2019 payments were projected to decrease were far more critical of HCFA\u2019s approach and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overview of HCFA\u2019s Methodologies", "paragraphs": ["In the spring of 1994, HCFA staff and leading researchers discussed potential approaches for developing detailed estimates of the practice expenses associated with each medical procedure. On the basis of these discussions, HCFA decided to use a variety of data gathering and mathematical methods to estimate the direct and indirect practice expenses at the procedure level. HCFA used those estimates as the basis for its June 1997 proposed revision to the physician fee schedule. The key aspects of HCFA\u2019s approach were the use of (1) expert panels to estimate direct costs, (2) a series of HCFA\u2019s own methods to adjust the direct cost estimates, and (3) another HCFA method to allocate indirect expenses to procedures. Since then, HCFA has continued to refine both its data and its methodologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing Direct Expense Estimates", "paragraphs": ["To estimate the direct expenses for individual procedures, HCFA convened 15 clinical practice expense panels (CPEP), organized by specialty. Each panel included 12 to 15 members. About half the members of each panel were physicians, and the remaining members were practice administrators and nonphysician clinicians such as nurses. HCFA provided national medical specialty societies an opportunity to nominate the panelists, and over 60 specialties and subspecialties were represented on the panels.", "HCFA and contractor staff identified more than 6,000 procedure codes for which direct expense data would be developed. The contractor arranged these codes into families of clinically related codes. Within each family of codes, the contractor also selected \u201creference codes\u201d that formed a basis for ranking the other codes within the family. HCFA and its consultants reviewed the contractor\u2019s work and made the family grouping and reference code information available to medical specialty societies for their review and comment. Some codes, called \u201credundant codes,\u201d were assigned to two or more CPEPs so that HCFA and its contractor could analyze differences in the estimates developed by the various panels. For example, HCFA included the repair of a disk in the lower back among the procedures reviewed by both the orthopedic and neurosurgery panels.", "Within each panel, the members attempted to reach consensus on the type and quantity of nonphysician labor, medical equipment, and medical supplies required to perform each procedure. The CPEP members were instructed to base their estimates on the typical patient\u2014the patient who most frequently undergoes a particular procedure\u2014not necessarily a Medicare patient. For example, most women receiving hysterectomies are in their 40s and 50s and are not Medicare patients.", "Once the CPEPs completed their work, HCFA\u2019s contractor calculated the dollar costs of the labor, medical equipment, and medical supplies that the CPEPs had estimated for each procedure. Nonphysician labor costs were calculated using about 100 occupational categories of clinical and administrative staff. For example, if a CPEP estimated that a procedure required 10 minutes of a registered nurse\u2019s time, the associated cost was calculated from the salaries and benefits paid to registered nurses. For equipment, the contractor estimated costs using the price of the item, an applicable finance rate, and a depreciation schedule for that item based on an assumed utilization rate. For medical supplies, the contractor identified a representative cost for each item on the basis of information from catalogues, suppliers, and CPEP members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adjusting Direct Expense Estimates", "paragraphs": ["For several reasons, HCFA applied a series of adjustments to the direct expenses estimated by the CPEPs. First, HCFA reviewed the data to ensure that the costs arrived at were allowable under Medicare policy and revised the costs where necessary. Next, HCFA used a process called \u201clinking\u201d to convert the direct expense estimates of the different CPEPs to a common scale. HCFA also adjusted the revised estimates for labor, equipment, and supply costs to make them consistent with national practice expense data collected by the American Medical Association (AMA), a process that HCFA called \u201cscaling.\u201d Lastly, HCFA adjusted estimates that appeared to be unreasonable.

HCFA originally intended to survey a random sample of approximately 5,000 physician practices, obtain data on their direct and indirect practice expenses, and use those data to develop a method for allocating indirect expenses. However, HCFA abandoned this effort because few practices responded with the detailed information HCFA requested.", "After exploring several alternatives, HCFA decided to allocate indirect expenses to procedures on the basis of the physician work, direct practice expense, and malpractice expense RVUs associated with the procedure.

In November 1997, HCFA asked representatives of physician groups to review and comment on its methodology for estimating and assigning indirect expenses. Then, in December 1997, HCFA convened a \u201ccross-specialty\u201d panel comprising 38 members nominated by various medical specialty societies.

After considering this option and the limitations of survey data already gathered by other organizations, HCFA decided to use expert panels to estimate the relative resources associated with medical procedures.

The Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), which advises the Congress on health care policy issues, also supports HCFA\u2019s approach and asserts that the CPEP process is an adequate way to collect credible direct expense data for use in developing practice expense RVUs.", "Some of the national medical societies we met with also support the CPEP process. For example, AMA representatives told us that they believe the use of expert panels is an acceptable method for estimating the direct expenses associated with a procedure. Also, American Society of Internal Medicine representatives said that the feedback they received indicated that their members thought the CPEP meetings were an effective way to develop direct expense data for procedures. The American Academy of Family Physicians has also been supportive of HCFA\u2019s use of practice expense panels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Groups Criticize the CPEP Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Some medical specialty groups have criticized HCFA\u2019s design and implementation of the CPEP process. As discussed below, these criticisms focus on three issues.", "First, some physician groups stated that the panels were not representative of the different practice settings or types of physicians who provide a particular service. That is, the panels did not contain a broad spectrum of small and large practices or those from rural and urban areas, nor did they include representatives from all of the medical specialties. This criticism ignores the efforts HCFA made, working closely with the major medical societies, to constitute representative panels. HCFA asked the societies to nominate physicians and others who the medical societies believed could appropriately represent their membership. Although the number of individuals representing each medical specialty was small, collectively the panels included about 180 physicians from 61 medical specialties and subspecialties, and those physicians worked in different types and sizes of practices. The benefits to be gained by further expanding the panels could be outweighed by the problems that would be encountered in structuring and moderating much larger groups.", "Second, some groups believe the CPEP data are invalid because they represent the \u201cbest guesses\u201d of physicians rather than actual practice expense data. This criticism implies that the panelists lacked the knowledge to make informed judgments about the nonphysician labor, medical supplies, and equipment associated with individual procedures and that they were not prepared to participate in the panel discussions. However, panelists based their judgments on a wide variety of factors, such as their knowledge of their own practices and results of surveys conducted by medical specialty societies; this demonstrates that the panelists\u2019 collective knowledge about practice expenses was broader than their individual knowledge about their own practices.", "Third, the CPEP process has been criticized because some of the panels used different assumptions and definitions than other panels, leading to differences in the resources identified by different panels for the same procedures. For example, one panel\u2019s estimates included time for staff to resubmit denied claims, while another panel did not include this activity in its estimates. In another case, two panels differed on the type of patient on which to base their estimates; one considered \u201ctypical\u201d patients, while the other considered \u201cproblem\u201d patients. HCFA officials acknowledge these differences but note that each panel was consistent internally when it identified the resources associated with individual procedures. Because different panels identified different resources for the redundant procedures, and because HCFA believed that the panels used different scales to rank their procedures, HCFA made a number of adjustments to the data. The adjustments HCFA made are addressed separately in this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Methods for Estimating Direct Expenses Have Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Several medical specialty groups have recommended that HCFA use actual practice expense data, rather than the CPEP process, as the basis for estimating direct expenses and calculating RVUs. They propose that HCFA obtain these data by either asking physician practices to complete a survey instrument mailed to them or collecting data on-site. These approaches have their own limitations, some of which they share with the CPEP process. Starting over and using one of these approaches as the primary means for developing direct expense estimates, we believe, would needlessly increase costs and further delay implementation of the fee schedule revisions.", "Surveys to gather procedure-level information require either the physician or other practice staff to use their best judgment to identify the expenses associated with procedures, since cost accounting systems do not allocate expenses in this manner. Also, once the results of a survey are received, analysts must adjust the data in order to make valid comparisons among respondents, since responses will likely vary by the type and size of responding practice. The CPEP process shares both these problems\u2014CPEP members were asked for their best judgment on the resources associated with specific procedures, and HCFA staff adjusted the CPEP data to ensure consistency in the data reported by different panels.", "A greater problem with surveys of physicians and physician practices is low response rates. HCFA and its contractor developed a lengthy survey that asked physician practices to provide detailed data on their direct and indirect expenses for the procedures they billed to Medicare. For example, the survey asked practices to provide information on the number and types of clinical and administrative staff they employed, the frequency with which they provided each service in a year, and the square footage of office space that they leased or purchased. After an initial test involving approximately 1,700 practices, HCFA canceled the survey because only about a quarter of the practices surveyed responded.", "Low response rates have also been encountered in national surveys conducted by the AMA and the Medical Group Management Association (MGMA). The AMA\u2019s annual Socioeconomic Monitoring System (SMS) survey polls about 4,000 physicians and asks them for information on a number of topics; the survey includes eight general questions about practice expenses. For example, the survey asks respondents for their share of the practice\u2019s total nonphysician payroll expenses and total expenses. About one-third of the respondents are resurveyed the following year. Generally, about 40 percent of the physicians surveyed respond and provide complete information on the practice expense questions. MGMA collects practice expense data through a membership survey. Its 12-page survey instrument asks for information on a practice\u2019s current assets and liabilities; operating costs; total number of patients treated in a year; and percentage of income from Medicare, Medicaid, and managed care plans. The response rate for this survey is less than 30 percent.", "Moreover, estimates derived from existing or specially designed surveys may be biased because the respondents may not be representative of the broader population of physician practices. For example, the practice expense portion of the AMA\u2019s SMS survey is addressed only to self-employed physicians\u2014about 60 percent of the total physician population, according to AMA officials. Also, this survey is not sufficiently large to statistically project estimates to smaller medical specialties. Similarly, MGMA\u2019s survey does not cover all types of physician practices and is sent only to MGMA members. Regarding HCFA\u2019s own attempt to survey practices, HCFA officials told us they were concerned that the respondents may be primarily from larger practices. As a result, any estimates derived from the survey would likely not have reflected the expenses incurred by smaller practices.", "Gathering expense data on-site at physician practices also has limitations. In the early 1990s, PPRC contracted with three multispecialty group practices to collect detailed data on the resources they used in delivering selected services. Staff at the practices filled out schedules showing the activities they performed and the time spent on these activities. The practices also developed information on the medical equipment and supplies used for particular procedures. The problem with this approach is its cost. PPRC spent about $135,000 collecting data at just one multispecialty group practice. It is unlikely that HCFA could fund this type of data collection effort in sufficient magnitude to use the information as its primary data source. And basing new practice expense RVUs on data gathered at only a few practices would raise legitimate concerns about adequate representation of the diverse range of physician practices.", "Several medical specialty societies have urged HCFA to gather practice expense data using activity-based costing, a method that was developed for use by manufacturing companies in the 1980s and has subsequently been applied in some health care organizations. Using this approach to identify costs for individual procedures involves several steps. First, all of a practice\u2019s costs are obtained from information such as financial statements and tax returns. Next, the major processes within a practice, such as serving patients in the office, maintaining medical records, and billing, are identified by conducting on-site interviews and having staff complete worksheets that capture the time staff spend on their daily activities. Costs are then identified with, or allocated to, each process and, in turn, to the procedure codes associated with the process. Activity-based costing generally does not distinguish between individual procedure codes; rather, it groups codes together and then assigns costs to the group of codes. As a result, it does not provide the specificity needed to adjust the Medicare fee schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HCFA\u2019s Plan for Refining the CPEP Data Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["After the June 1997 publication of HCFA\u2019s proposed fee schedule revisions, HCFA used additional expert panels to review some of the data obtained from the 15 original panels. In October 1997, HCFA convened 17 \u201cvalidation\u201d panels composed primarily of physicians and again organized by specialty. Each panel was assigned between 14 and 36 procedures for which to review the original nonphysician labor, equipment, and supply estimates. The validation panels generally increased the estimates of nonphysician labor identified by the original CPEPs. Then, in December 1997, HCFA convened a cross-specialty panel that included representatives from all the major medical specialty societies and medical directors from HCFA\u2019s claims processing contractors. HCFA asked this panel to reach consensus on the direct labor estimates for 57 high-cost, high-volume procedures previously reviewed by the CPEP and validation panels. The cross-specialty panel failed to reach consensus, but it did provide HCFA with some insight into the reasons for differences among the estimates of previous panels.", "At this time, it is unclear what approach HCFA will take in preparing its next proposed role, which is due in May 1998. HCFA has not yet decided whether to rely on the direct cost estimates developed by the original CPEPs, the refinements made by the validation panels, or its own adjustments to the data (which have come under strong criticism from some specialty groups). Various physician groups have advocated that HCFA validate its CPEP data through means other than the expert panel process. Given HCFA\u2019s time and resource constraints, using surveys and on-site data gathering methodologies as the primary means to estimate the direct expenses associated with procedures is not practicable. However, these methods could be used on a limited basis to check the basic accuracy of the CPEP data. HCFA could conduct a small number of on-site reviews, similar to PPRC\u2019s approach, to test the validity of the CPEP data. Gathering some direct expense data through either surveys or on-site reviews would enable HCFA to identify any egregious problems with the direct expense relative rankings and help focus its efforts on correcting those problems.

One CPEP estimated the administrative labor associated with this code at 375 minutes and the clinical labor at 697 minutes. In contrast, the other CPEP estimated administrative labor at 465 minutes and clinical labor at 1,647 minutes. Such variations support the need for adjusting the CPEP estimates. HCFA staff believe that some CPEPs had higher labor time estimates than others primarily because the CPEPs included activities performed by physicians or because they double-counted some activities that staff may do simultaneously.", "While recognizing these differences in labor estimates, HCFA staff concluded that the CPEPs ranked the procedures similarly. That is, while two CPEPs may have developed different labor estimates for the same codes, HCFA staff believe that the ratios between the estimates were generally constant. For example, one CPEP\u2019s estimates were generally twice as high as those of another. To correct for these differences between CPEPs, HCFA used a statistical regression methodology to standardize the different CPEP labor estimates and \u201clink\u201d them, that is, place them on a common scale. HCFA\u2019s methodology separately adjusted the administrative labor estimates and the clinical labor estimates developed by the panels.", "HCFA\u2019s linking significantly reduced some of the original CPEP estimates. For instance, linking reduced the administrative estimates for one CPEP by 80 percent and the clinical estimates of another CPEP by 50 percent. As a result of these changes, linking also affected the ranking of codes among CPEPs. For example, before linking, code A might have had a higher ranking than code B; but after linking, the two might have been ranked equally or code B might have been ranked higher. HCFA officials told us that linking\u2019s impact on the rankings was appropriate because it adjusted for some of the incorrect assumptions used by the panels, such as the assumption that a staff person always performs tasks sequentially.", "Representatives from several medical societies believe that HCFA\u2019s linking methodology is seriously flawed and is unwarranted. The American College of Surgeons, for example, believes that the higher labor time estimates developed by the panels reviewing surgical procedure codes are not necessarily inflated and therefore do not need to be adjusted. Rather, the American College of Surgeons believes that these estimates reflect higher practice expenses incurred by surgeons, such as expenses associated with the need to obtain prior authorization for surgeries and with updating referring physicians on a patient\u2019s status. On the other hand, the American Society of Internal Medicine believes that linking is necessary. Representatives told us that some CPEP labor time estimates are overstated because panelists on some CPEPs uniformly assigned higher labor time estimates to the codes they reviewed than did other CPEPs and that HCFA therefore needed to adjust these estimates downward to make them comparable across all panels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HCFA\u2019s Linking Methodology Raises Some Questions", "paragraphs": ["In developing its linking methodology, HCFA wanted to generate separate adjustment factors for a panel\u2019s clinical labor estimates and its administrative labor estimates.

According to HCFA, these linking adjustments are most appropriate when the actual relationships between CPEPs conform to certain patterns.", "HCFA staff told us that their review suggested that the data generally followed these patterns, but we found that in a number of cases the CPEP data departed considerably from these patterns. For example, the ratios between any two panels\u2019 estimates for redundant codes generally have to be similar. An intuitive test of this assumption is to examine the related assumption: that the CPEPs rank the redundant codes generally in the same order. If this were true, all the CPEPs would, for example, rank codes A, B, and C in the order first, fifth, and tenth. We found that, on the contrary, some CPEPs ranked redundant codes in very different orders.", "As a second example, HCFA asserted that its linking methodology is more appropriate when the actual CPEP data conform to a second pattern\u2014that the ratios of estimates between CPEPs are generally constant. If two CPEPs evaluated codes A and B, the first CPEP\u2019s labor estimates might generally be twice those of the second CPEP\u201470 minutes versus 35 minutes for code A and 120 minutes versus 60 minutes for code B. If roughly constant ratios were found for all pairs of CPEPs, then all the labor estimates by a particular CPEP could be adjusted by a constant percentage without significantly affecting their relationship or ratios. However, we found a number of cases that did not display generally constant ratios.", "HCFA believes that such discrepancies do not compromise its model\u2019s reliability. Rather, it believes these discrepancies reflect real-world deviations from its model as a result of random differences between the CPEPs. However, our review of an analysis of HCFA\u2019s statistical model identified potentially significant problems that signal omission of a systematic factor. This suggests the regression estimates may be statistically biased\u2014too high or too low. This same analysis, though, points to modifications of the HCFA regression that might yield a satisfactory linking method. HCFA staff acknowledge that their regression model has some anomalies, but they do not believe the anomalies are serious enough to negate the overall validity of the model.", "In addition, HCFA\u2019s linking methodology relies on CPEP estimates for redundant codes, but critics have questioned the characteristics of the redundant codes selected and HCFA\u2019s process for selecting them. HCFA\u2019s linking methodology assumes that the practice expenses associated with a redundant code are the same, no matter which medical specialty provides the service. For example, the methodology assumes that, for an office visit, a cardiologist and a primary care physician incur the same labor expenses. Several medical specialties criticized this assumption, noting that the higher labor expense estimates of some CPEPs may reflect that different tasks are performed or that more time is needed for similar tasks. For example, administrative labor expenses for an office visit to a cardiologist might be higher than those for an office visit to a primary care physician because the cardiologist\u2019s staff may have to spend more time obtaining precertification approval and handling a higher percentage of denied claims.", "To select redundant codes, HCFA and its contractor identified codes that were frequently billed by two different specialties. This approach differed from the one HCFA used to select redundant codes while developing physician work RVUs in the late 1980s. As part of that process, clinicians representing different medical specialties reviewed potential redundant codes to ensure that they involved equivalent physician work. In some cases, the clinicians determined that, because a code did not involve equivalent physician work between two specialties, its use as a linking code in the regression was not appropriate. HCFA staff told us that they did not use the same process for the practice expense RVUs. They believed that any code evaluated by two or more CPEPs was an appropriate redundant code because Medicare pays the same amount regardless of which specialty performs the procedure.", "Representatives from both PPRC and the AMA agree that HCFA needs to adjust the labor estimates from the different CPEPs to make them comparable. However, representatives from both organizations question the process HCFA used to select the redundant codes and believe that physician participation in the selection of redundant codes would have improved the linking adjustments. Nevertheless, PPRC staff do not believe that HCFA should select new redundant codes, assemble a new set of CPEPs, and estimate the linking regression on new data. Instead, PPRC staff agreed that it might be useful for HCFA to have physicians review the redundant codes used, eliminate any questionable codes, and rerun its regression model on this subset of the original CPEP data.

HCFA found that the aggregate CPEP estimates for labor, supplies, and equipment each accounted for a different portion of total direct expenses than the AMA data did. For instance, labor accounted for 73 percent of total direct expenses in the SMS survey data but only 60 percent of the total direct expenses in the CPEP data. To make the CPEP percentages mirror the SMS survey percentages, HCFA inflated the CPEPs\u2019 labor expenses for each code by 21 percent and the medical supply expenses by 6 percent and deflated the CPEPs\u2019 medical equipment expenses by 61 percent. HCFA staff told us that they believe this scaling was necessary to ensure that the proportions of practice expense RVUs devoted to labor, supplies, and equipment were consistent with an external benchmark. For example, without scaling, HCFA would have no means to ensure that the labor expense estimates, as adjusted by linking and other steps in HCFA\u2019s methodology, represented the appropriate labor expenses. In addition, inaccuracies in HCFA\u2019s estimates of supply and equipment prices, as well as HCFA\u2019s assumed equipment utilization rate, might have distorted the expenses among the three components. As a result, expenses associated with supplies and equipment might be overrepresented in total practice expense RVUs. (App. IV contains more details on HCFA\u2019s scaling methodology and its effects on the CPEP data.)", "The AMA believes that scaling was appropriate because the CPEPs, given their limited size, were not necessarily representative of all medical practices. Therefore, the CPEP data needed to be adjusted to reflect national averages. PPRC staff, too, believe that scaling is warranted. However, they said that modifications to scaling are needed to ensure that the CPEP data are consistent with the SMS survey data, because HCFA eliminated certain labor expenses developed by the CPEPs that are contained in the SMS survey data.", "Some physician groups believe that if HCFA utilizes a scaling methodology in the future, it should develop different scaling factors for each medical specialty, since the percentages of labor, medical supplies, and medical equipment to total practice expenses vary among medical specialties.

HCFA officials said that they disallowed the expenses for these services primarily because Medicare pays for them through other mechanisms. For example, Medicare\u2019s policy is to pay for assistants at surgery only if they are either physicians or physician assistants; Medicare does not pay for other medical professionals serving in this role. According to HCFA, hospitals are responsible for providing the nurses who work in the hospital setting, and Medicare\u2019s payments to the hospital for surgical procedures already cover the expense of scrub nurses who participate in surgeries.

First, it assigns indirect expenses on the basis of the variables that HCFA believes are the primary drivers of indirect expenses. For example, higher physician work RVUs generally reflect greater complexity of a procedure and more time required to carry it out\u2014meaning that a physician can perform fewer of these procedures in a day. This, in turn, means that a physician\u2019s indirect expenses associated with operating a practice, such as rent and utilities, must be allocated over a smaller pool of procedures. Second, HCFA\u2019s methodology reduced the redistribution effects of the proposed rule on various physician groups. For example, surgeons and other physicians who provide hospital-based services benefited because their commonly performed procedures typically have higher physician work RVUs than the procedures performed by physicians who provide office-based services.

Other nonregression approaches HCFA is considering may also be appropriate to deal with variations in the panels\u2019 estimates, but we cannot evaluate them until they are more fully defined. Scaling seems to be necessary because of various steps in HCFA\u2019s methodology that affected the proportion of RVUs allocated to labor, medical supplies, and medical equipment.

We did not expect to see such substantial and often striking deviations from the assumptions or patterns that HCFA staff had told us were the basis for their model. This point holds, especially with regard to deviations of the ordinal ranks from the expected pattern. Although it is possible that these deviations exclusively reflect the randomness in the estimates of the various CPEP panels, they may also reflect systematic factors that, omitted from HCFA\u2019s regression analysis, could make its linking factors too high or too low.

Specifically, the analysis of the residuals indicates that the broad types of procedure codes (for example, invasive procedures versus lab tests) reviewed by a CPEP affect the size and sign (positive or negative) of the residual associated with a procedure code. Consequently, the mix of procedure codes reviewed by a CPEP appears to affect the CPEP\u2019s estimates. Since HCFA\u2019s model does not account for this effect, the estimated coefficients drawn from HCFA\u2019s model may be statistically biased.

Specifically, after observing the CPEPs and reviewing different CPEPs\u2019 labor estimates for redundant codes, HCFA decided that, despite differences in the absolute labor time estimates for a given code, the relative rankings of redundant codes among CPEPs were generally similar. That is, the relationships or ratios between the estimates for pairs of codes were generally similar. For instance, if two CPEPs evaluated codes A and B, the first CPEP\u2019s labor estimates might always be twice those of the second CPEP; for example, 70 minutes versus 35 minutes for code A and 120 minutes versus 60 minutes for code B.

Similarly, the clinical and administrative labor estimates for the obstetrics and gynecology CPEP were reduced by multiplying them by factors of 0.88 and 0.51, respectively.

A linking methodology based on a regression analysis for developing physician work RVUs has been accepted by independent researchers, albeit with suggestions for improvements and alternative methodologies. Such a linking regression may be appropriate to use in developing adjustments to the CPEP data for practice expense RVUs. However, the appropriateness of HCFA\u2019s selected linking methodology is related to a number of features about the data, for example, that CPEPs generally ranked redundant codes in the same order. Our preliminary review of HCFA\u2019s methodology indicates that some of these assumptions are not true for all CPEPs.", "The remainder of this section compares the actual CPEP data with the assumptions underlying HCFA\u2019s regression model. The more the pattern of the CPEP data correspond to the actual pattern, the more appropriate HCFA\u2019s regression model is likely to be. Some discrepancies are to be expected because of random variability in sample data. However, our analysis of the CPEP data indicates that portions of the panels\u2019 data differ considerably from the assumptions HCFA used in developing its regression model and that HCFA needs to evaluate alternative specifications to its regression model. 1. HCFA\u2019s linking methodology relies on the CPEPs\u2019 ranking the redundant codes in generally the same order. A preliminary review of the labor estimates for redundant codes indicates that this consistent ranking of the codes may not be true for all of the CPEPs. For some pairs of CPEPs, we calculated correlation coefficients, which measure how strongly two CPEPs\u2019 rankings of redundant codes are correlated. The closer the correlation coefficient is to 1, the more highly correlated the CPEP rankings are. Table III.3 shows the correlation coefficients for 18 pairs of CPEPs.", "8 + 10 (AI) 1 + 3 (AI) 12 + 13 (CO) 5 + 9 (CO) 8 + 10 (AO) 3 + 15 (CO) 3 + 15 (AO) 7 + 10 (AI) 12 + 13 (AO) 8 + 12 (AO) 2 + 8 (AO) 1 + 8 (AI) 8 + 12 (CO) 2 + 8 (CO) 7 + 13 (AI) 10 + 12 (AO) 3 + 7 (AI) 6 + 13 (AO)", "The results of the correlation analysis for these 18 pairs of CPEPs indicate that some panels ranked redundant codes very differently from other panels and that HCFA\u2019s assumption about consistent ranking is questionable. Overall, few of the 18 CPEP pairs\u2019 rankings were strongly and positively correlated. Three of the CPEP pairs had negative correlations, which means that codes ranked high by one CPEP were ranked low by the other CPEP\u2014exactly the opposite of HCFA\u2019s assumption. Of the remaining CPEP pairs, we judged the four with coefficients of 0.32 or less to be weakly correlated. Six other CPEP pairs with coefficients of between 0.46 and 0.79 could be considered modestly correlated. Only five CPEP pairs had coefficients of over 0.80, which we would consider moderately to highly correlated. While we did not develop correlation coefficients for all of the possible CPEP pairs, the results from these 18 pairs contradict HCFA\u2019s assumption that the CPEPs generally ranked redundant codes in the same order. 2. In developing the linking regression, HCFA also relies on the CPEPs\u2019 having generally similar relative ranks for the redundant codes. In other words, the relationships or ratios between the codes were assumed to be similar. For example, if two CPEPs ranked codes A and B, the estimates of the absolute time for each code might be different. Nonetheless, the two codes would have the same relative rank if the labor estimate for code A was about twice as high as that for code B for both CPEPs. If this similarity in ranking between CPEPs were to hold for most codes, then the labor estimates of the two CPEPs would generally differ by a constant percentage. HCFA staff told us that they did a quick review of the redundant codes and observed, for example, that the estimates for redundant codes from one CPEP were usually about 16 percent greater than the estimates from a second CPEP. However, because of time constraints and other factors, HCFA staff did not conduct a formal, comprehensive analysis to confirm that this relationship was true across all CPEPs and all redundant codes.", "If labor time estimates for redundant codes generally differ between CPEPs by a constant percentage, then the ratios of the redundant estimates should be similar. However, our comparison of the ratios for redundant codes for selected CPEPs shows considerable variation. For instance, CPEPs 3 and 15 examined 81 redundant codes for their clinical, out-of-office estimates. The ratios of CPEP 3 to CPEP 15\u2019s clinical labor time estimates were not constant over the 81 codes. Instead, these ratios ranged from 0.71 to 2.48 (see table III.4). Not only is this a threefold difference in the ratios, but in some cases the labor estimates from CPEP 3 are higher than those from CPEP 15, and in some cases they are lower. This shift from ratios exceeding 1 to ratios of less than 1 indicates a lack of consistency in the relationship between the estimates of these two CPEPs. If the differences between CPEPs are not consistent, then adjusting all estimates within a CPEP by a fixed amount, as HCFA\u2019s linking regression does, may not be appropriate.", "CPEP 3\u2014 orthopedics (minutes)", "CPEP 15\u2014 neurosurgery (minutes)", "We note that HCFA\u2019s linking regressions are expressed in terms of the natural logarithm of the CPEP estimates, while our analysis is based on the actual CPEP estimates.

The logarithmic transformation simply compresses the range of variation, when the ratio of the estimates is compared to the ratio of the log of those estimates.

Under certain circumstances, statistical estimates can be inaccurate in a way statisticians term \u201cbiased.\u201d A correctly specified regression equation can yield unbiased estimates of its coefficients. These estimates then accurately reflect the average effect of an explanatory variable (in this case, the variable denoting the CPEP making the cost estimate) on the dependent variable (in this case, the CPEP labor cost estimates). While the predicted values (of the dependent variable) from any regression will differ from the actual values because of random variation caused by sampling error, differences between predicted and actual values should not be systematic\u2014that is, correlated with factors not included in the regression. However, when a factor omitted from the regression model is correlated with an explanatory factor that the regression does include, the estimated regression coefficients are biased. The omission of a factor from HCFA\u2019s linking regression that is correlated with both the dependent variable and the CPEP variable would mean that the estimated linking factors were biased.", "In HCFA\u2019s linking regression, the CPEP labor estimates should differ only by some constant percentage that reflects differences in CPEPs\u2019 implicit scales, and other factors should not contribute to differences. HCFA recently contracted with an external researcher to conduct a preliminary analysis of the residuals associated with the regression equation. The researcher found that other factors may influence differences among CPEP estimates. Because regression equations are based on a sample of data, their predictions are generally less than completely accurate, and their residuals signal the degree of accuracy and other properties of the regression equation. For the regression estimates to be unbiased and have other desirable properties, a plot of the residuals against the dependent variable (in this case, the natural log of the CPEP labor time estimates multiplied by wage rates) should be randomly distributed about the horizontal axis, which represents a residual equal to zero. Such a random pattern indicates that the actual data do not deviate from the regression model in any systematic way.", "Our review of the residual plots for HCFA\u2019s linking regressions indicates that, for some CPEPs, the residuals corresponding to the services evaluated by the CPEP are systematically related to the broad category within which a specific procedure code is found: A hernia repair belongs to the \u201cinvasive procedure\u201d category, while a mid-level office visit belongs to the \u201cevaluation and management\u201d category. For example, with respect to the clinical labor regression, when the residuals for CPEP 8 (general surgery) are analyzed, the residuals for evaluation and management codes tend to be positive but those for invasive procedures tend to be negative. This suggests that having fewer evaluation and management codes among the redundant codes would probably increase CPEP 8\u2019s linking adjustor for clinical labor. By contrast, the residuals for CPEP 8\u2019s administrative labor estimates display the opposite pattern\u2014more evaluation and management redundant codes would likely increase this CPEP\u2019s linking factor for administrative labor. The residuals for all CPEPs did not exhibit these differences. However, as the researcher points out, it appears that for some CPEPs, the mix of redundant codes by category of service influenced the estimated linking factors. Consequently, selection of a different set of redundant codes would likely lead to different values for the linking factors. The extent to which these values would differ from those that HCFA has published is unknown.", "In addition to differences in CPEP estimates related to the category of service, another factor may be the rating scales the CPEPs explicitly used. According to the researcher who conducted the residuals analysis, some differences among CPEPs\u2019 estimates might indicate that some CPEPs\u2019 rating scales were, in effect, more compressed, while other CPEPs evaluated codes using a scale with a wider spread. For example, in the regression for clinical labor costs, the residuals for invasive redundant codes for CPEP 12 (cardiothoracic and vascular surgery) increase with the size of the dependent variable (natural log of clinical labor costs). This association between residuals and labor costs suggests that, for invasive procedures, this CPEP underestimated costs for redundant codes whose estimated levels of clinical labor are small but overestimated costs for codes whose estimates of clinical labor are large (relative to other CPEPs). That is, this CPEP\u2019s scale is stretched out compared with those of other CPEPs.", "Such associations between residuals and the dependent variable constitute a problem in the linking regression as currently specified. In estimating and using its regression model, HCFA assumed that the difference between CPEPs\u2019 estimates is a constant percentage for any CPEP. If, however, some CPEPs rated the same services differently, depending on whether the service had high labor input or low labor input, then the CPEPs\u2019 relative rankings for redundant codes may not be similar. Consequently, a linking process that adjusts all estimates within a CPEP by a constant factor may not be appropriate.", "Although further analysis to replicate these preliminary findings would be desirable, alternate specifications of the regression approach to linking could mitigate the problems discussed above and could improve the accuracy and credibility of the linkage adjustment factors. Specifically, a more appropriate linking regression model would take into account potential differences in CPEPs\u2019 ratings related to the category of service (for example, invasive procedures) and the level of estimated labor input (low versus high). In addition, it might account for some of the deviations we noted between the CPEP data and the patterns identified by HCFA."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Description and Analysis of HCFA\u2019s Scaling Methodology", "paragraphs": ["After it linked the CPEP estimates, HCFA conducted a second series of data adjustments referred to as scaling. In the aggregate, the CPEPs\u2019 estimates imply that labor, medical supplies, and medical equipment constitute 60 percent, 17 percent, and 23 percent, respectively, of all direct expenses. HCFA compared these estimates with the AMA\u2019s Socioeconomic Monitoring System (SMS) survey data\u2014one of the few sources of national data on practice expenses\u2014and found that they differed. The SMS data attributed significantly higher proportions of practice expense to labor and less to equipment. According to the 1996 SMS data, labor, medical supplies, and medical equipment represented 73 percent, 18 percent, and 9 percent, respectively, of total direct expenses.", "To match the CPEP percentages with the SMS percentages, HCFA inflated CPEP labor expenses for each code by 21 percent, inflated CPEP medical supply expenses by 6 percent, and deflated CPEP equipment expenses by 61 percent.", "HCFA staff believed that scaling was necessary to ensure that the proportions of practice expense RVUs devoted to labor, supplies, and equipment were consistent with an external benchmark. For example, without scaling, HCFA would have no means to ensure that its total labor expense estimates, as adjusted by linking and other steps in HCFA\u2019s methodology, were appropriate. The amount of the total labor expenses depends upon the CPEP chosen as the reference panel because the labor expense estimates from all CPEPs are linked to the reference panel. If a different CPEP had been chosen as the reference panel, total labor expenses might have been much larger. Scaling thus enabled HCFA to use any CPEP as the reference panel and still arrive at the appropriate amount of total labor expenses.", "HCFA officials also told us that scaling was necessary because of their concerns regarding pricing of labor, supplies, and equipment. For example, HCFA used list prices as its basis for pricing both supplies and equipment, but officials believe that physicians and physician practices typically pay less than list price for these items. As a result, total practice expenses for supplies and equipment were likely overstated. Scaling, however, eliminated the effects of using inflated pricing estimates.", "HCFA officials also said that they needed to use scaling because the CPEPs did not provide them with data on equipment utilization rates, thus requiring HCFA to make assumptions regarding how often an item of equipment is used within physician practices. Utilization rates, in turn, affect how much of Medicare\u2019s practice expense payments relate to equipment expenses. Scaling provided HCFA with a cap on the total amount of practice expenses devoted to equipment that was not dependent upon the equipment utilization rate assumptions HCFA used.", "Table IV.1 illustrates the impact of the scaling adjustments by using a hypothetical example. Before scaling, both codes A and B have $100 of direct expenses, so they would receive the same number of direct expense RVUs. After scaling, however, code A\u2019s direct expenses increase to $109, while code B\u2019s decrease to $85. These changes reflect code A\u2019s higher labor expenses and lower equipment expenses compared with those of code B. Because of scaling, code A now receives 1.3 times as many direct practice expense RVUs as code B.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free. Additional copies are $2 each.
