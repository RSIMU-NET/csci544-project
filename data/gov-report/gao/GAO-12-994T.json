In July 2012, the White House released the National Strategy for Biosurveillance, which describes guiding principles, core functions, and enablers for strengthening biosurveillance. In June 2010, GAO recommended a national biosurveillance strategy to provide a unifying framework for building and maintaining a national biosurveillance capability. In October 2011, GAO also recommended the strategy account for the need to leverage resources and respond to challenges while partnering with nonfederal entities. The July 2012 strategy partially responds to the issues GAO called for such a strategy to address, but does not fully address them, as discussed below. A strategic implementation plan is to be published within 120 days of strategy issuance (October 2012), and may align the strategy more fully with the array of issues GAO identified.", "DHS approved the Generation-3 (Gen-3) acquisition in October 2009, but it did not fully engage its acquisition framework to ensure that the acquisition was grounded in a justified mission need and that it pursued an optimal solution. The performance, schedule, and cost expectations presented in required documents when DHS approved the acquisition were not developed in accordance with DHS guidance and good acquisition practices\u0097like accounting for risk in schedule and cost estimates.

The 2009 life-cycle cost estimate\u0097a point estimate unadjusted for risk\u0097was $2.1 billion. In June 2011, DHS provided a risk-adjusted estimate at the 80 percent confidence level of $5.8 billion.

Accordingly, the biosurveillance enterprise remains without a framework to guide the systematic identification of risk, assessment of resources needed to address those risks, and the prioritization and allocation of investment across the entire enterprise. In recommending a national strategy, GAO recognized the challenges individual federal programs and agencies face prioritizing resources to help ensure a coherent effort across the dispersed biosurveillance enterprise.

A  catastrophic biological event, such as a terrorist attack with a weapon of  mass destruction or a naturally occurring pandemic, could cause  thousands of casualties or more, weaken the economy, damage public  morale and confidence, and threaten national security. In recent years,  there has been an increasing awareness of the potential for biological  agents to be used as weapons of mass destruction and of the threat of  catastrophic effects arising from emerging strains of infectious disease.  For example, events like the 2001 Amerithrax incident, which killed 5  people and sickened 17, and the global pandemic resulting from  emergence of a novel strain of influenza in 2009, have brought increased  attention to intentional and naturally occurring biological threats.", "The U.S. government has a long history of employing disease  surveillance activities to help limit malady, loss of life, and economic  impact. Traditional disease surveillance activities involve trained  professionals engaged in monitoring, investigating, confirming, and  reporting in an effort to further various missions including, but not limited  to, detecting signs of pathogens in humans, animals, plants, food, and the  environment. However, in recent years, experts and practitioners,  reacting to an increasing awareness of the speed and intensity with which  a biological weapon of mass destruction or highly pathogenic strain of  emerging infectious disease could affect the nation, have sought to  augment traditional surveillance activities with biosurveillance programs  and systems. DHS\u2019s BioWatch program is an example of such an effort. It  aims to reduce the time required to recognize and characterize potentially  catastrophic aerosolized attacks by detecting the presence of five  biological agents\u2014considered to be at a high risk for weaponized  attack\u2014in the air.", "The currently deployed BioWatch technology\u2014Generation-2 (Gen-2)\u2014 can take 12 to 36 hours to confirm the presence of pathogens.

Expressing questions about  whether DHS had undertaken a rigorous effort to help guide its Gen-3  decision making, two subcommittees of this committee asked us to  examine issues related to the Gen-3 acquisition. Today, we released a  report that evaluates the acquisition decision-making process for Gen-3.  In addition, since December 2009, we have published three other reports  about efforts across the federal government and with nonfederal partners  to enhance the nation\u2019s biosurveillance capabilities. This statement (1)  describes recent federal efforts that align with our biosurveillance work  published from December 2009 through October 2011, (2) discusses our  Gen-3 acquisition findings, and (3) makes observations about our prior  strategy recommendations and the White House\u2019s recently released  National Strategy for Biosurveillance.", "To describe recent federal efforts that align with our work published from  December 2009 through October 2011, we reviewed the National  Biosurveillance Integration Center Strategic Plan and the National  Strategy for Biosurveillance, and obtained information from DHS officials.  To develop findings in the report released today about Gen-3, which this  statement is largely based on, we reviewed DHS\u2019s acquisition guidance,  including Acquisition Management Directive 102-01. Additionally, we  reviewed acquisition documentation and interviewed agency officials from  the BioWatch program and other DHS offices with development, policy,  and acquisition responsibilities. We then compared the information  developed from our documentation review and interviews against the  guidance. More detailed information on our scope and methodology  appears in our published work .To make observations about the National  Strategy for Biosurveillance, we analyzed the strategy and assessed its  alignment with findings and recommendations about a the need for a  national biosurveillance strategy in prior work. We conducted this work  from August 2012 to September 2012 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

We recommended that NBIC work  with its federal partners to develop a strategy to enhance collaboration\u2014 including sharing data, personnel, and other resources\u2014and to establish  effectiveness measures for that collaboration. DHS generally concurred  with our findings and recommendations and stated that NBIC would work  with its partners to develop a collaboration strategy to clarify both the  mission space and roles and responsibilities for all partners. In August  2012, DHS issued the National Biosurveillance Integration Center  Strategic Plan. According to DHS officials, the plan articulates a clear  approach with a series of measurable steps and initiatives to enhance the  nation\u2019s biosurveillance capability. In late August 2012, when providing us  with a copy of the strategy, officials stated that they believe it satisfies the  intent of our recommendations.

We  concluded that without such a framework and an entity with the authority,  resources, time, and responsibility for guiding its implementation, it would  be very difficult to create an integrated approach to building and  sustaining a national biosurveillance capability. We recommended that  the Homeland Security Council within the White House direct the National  Security Staff to identify, in consultation with relevant federal agencies, a  focal point to lead the development of such a strategy.", "Our June 2010 report also noted that a national biosurveillance capability  depends upon participation from state, local, and tribal governments,  because few of the resources required to support the capability are wholly  owned by the federal government. In October 2011, we reported on how  the federal government worked with its nonfederal partners to support  biosurveillance, activities those partners identified as essential to their  biosurveillance efforts, and particular challenges those partners faced.  We recommended that the strategy we called for in June 2010  incorporate a means to leverage existing efforts that support nonfederal  biosurveillance capabilities, consider challenges that nonfederal  jurisdictions face, and include a framework to develop a baseline and gap  assessment of nonfederal jurisdictions\u2019 biosurveillance capabilities.

As the study committee for a 2011 National  Academies evaluation of BioWatch noted, there is considerable  uncertainty about the likelihood and magnitude of a biological attack, and  how the risk of a release of an aerosolized pathogen compares with risks  from other potential forms of terrorism or from natural diseases. The  National Academies report also notes that while the BioWatch program is  designed to detect certain biological agents (currently five agents) that  could be intentionally released in aerosolized form, detecting a  bioterrorism event involving other pathogens or routes of exposure  requires other approaches.", "In the report we released today, we stated that given the total estimated  operating cost for the Gen-3 program, it is important, especially in an  increasingly resource-constrained environment, to consider the benefit\u2014 in terms of its ability to mitigate the consequences of a potentially  catastrophic biological attack\u2014that the investment provides. We noted  that the scope limitations of this kind of environmental monitoring provide  context in both the consideration of mission need and in analyzing cost  effectiveness.", "However, it was not within the scope of our BioWatch Gen-3 study nor  was it our intention to reach a firm conclusion about the value of this kind  of activity as part of a layered biosurveillance strategy. Rather, we believe  the need to consider value within the larger biosurveillance enterprise as  part of an effort to define mission need for a single federal program like  Gen-3 provides a timely and concrete illustration of the kind of issues we  sought to address with our June 2010 recommendation. The  recommendation for the Homeland Security Council to direct the National  Security Staff to identify a focal point to lead the development of a  national biosurveillance strategy was grounded in previous work on  desirable strategy characteristics for complex homeland security  missions. We recognized the difficulty that decision makers and program  managers in individual federal agencies face prioritizing resources to help  ensure a coherent effort across a vast and dispersed interagency,  intergovernmental, and intersectoral network. Therefore, we called for a  strategy that would, among other things, (1) define the scope and  purpose of a national capability; (2) provide goals, objectives and  activities, priorities, milestones, and performance measures; and (3)  assess the costs and benefits and identify resource and investment  needs, including investment priorities.", "We stated that one of the aims of a national biosurveillance strategy  should be to help prioritize where resources and investments should be  targeted and guide agencies to allocate resources accordingly. Further,  we reported that a national strategy could begin to address the difficult  but critical issues of who pays and how funding for biosurveillance will be  sustained in the future. Finally, we noted that in an environment with  competing priorities, a strategy could help address situations where  investments must be carefully weighed and sound judgments made about  the most cost-effective approaches, but doing so would require  information about the cost, benefits, and risks associated with the whole  biosurveillance enterprise.", "The National Strategy for Biosurveillance includes four guiding principles  that are designed to serve as a foundation for enterprisewide efforts, four  core functions that are designed to promote a deliberate and shared  approach, and four enabling capabilities that are designed to represent  areas for ongoing focus. These planks of the strategy align with our call  for a strategy that would help to clarify the scope and purpose of a  national biosurveillance capability and the goals of that capability. Our  June 2010 report described several categories of federal efforts to  improve the personnel, training, and systems and equipment that support  a national capability. These included responding to workforce needs,  facilitating information sharing, and applying technologies to enhance  surveillance. Among the planks of the National Strategy for  Biosurveillance, it is possible to discern support for each these  categories. For example, the enabling capability called build capacity,  discusses both workforce and information sharing issues. The four  guiding principles that serve as the strategy\u2019s foundation encourage  broad-based and cross-cutting actions to leverage constrained resources,  responding, in part, to our call for the strategy to help identify the  resources currently being used, additional resources that may be needed,  and opportunities for leveraging resources.", "However, the strategy does not yet offer a mechanism to identify resource  and investment needs, including investment priorities among these  various efforts. Accordingly, the enterprise is still without a framework to  guide the systematic identification of risk, assessment of resources  needed to address those risks, and the prioritization and allocation of  investment across the entire biosurveillance enterprise, as we  recommended in June 2010. For example, in the case of the broader  contextual information needed to inform the BioWatch Gen-3 mission  need, the strategy has language indicating that advances in science and  technology are a priority. In fact, the capability enabler called fostering  innovation specifically calls for science and technology capabilities,  including new detection approaches. However, the strategy does not  facilitate analysis or provide tools to assess the risks to be addressed\u2014in  the context of enterprisewide goals\u2014by such science and technology  approaches or the value they should offer the enterprise relative to their  costs. Without such a framework and tool set, it remains difficult for  decision makers\u2014in both the executive and legislative branches\u2014to help  ensure that their resource allocation decisions contribute to a coherent  enterprisewide approach.", "We are encouraged by the National Strategy for Biosurveillance and the  work the White House has done to date to provide a platform for  achieving a well-integrated national biosurveillance enterprise. We are  hopeful that the forthcoming strategic implementation plan which  promises to include specific actions and activity scope, designated roles  and responsibilities, and a mechanism for evaluating progress will help to  address the ongoing need for mechanisms to help prioritize resource  allocation.", "Chairmen Bilirakis and Lungren, this concludes my prepared statement.
