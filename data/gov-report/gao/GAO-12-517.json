GAO assessed DOJ\u2019s fiscal year 2010 announcements of grant award funding; categorized them according to key justice areas to identify any overlap; and interviewed DOJ officials about their grant making practices, systems, and assessment methods. Further, GAO interviewed officials from 11 states receiving DOJ grants, selected for the levels and types of funding received. Though not generalizable, the interviews provided their perspectives on funding."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) grant programs overlap across 10 justice areas contributing to the risk of unnecessarily duplicative grant awards for the same or similar purposes. For example, GAO reviewed all 253 grant award announcements that DOJ\u2019s Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Office on Violence Against Women (OVW), and the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office published on their websites for fiscal year 2010 and found overlap across the justice areas. For example, 56 of DOJ\u2019s 253 grant solicitations\u2014or more than 20 percent\u2014were providing grant funds for victim assistance and related research. GAO also found instances where applicants used the same or similar language to apply for funding from these overlapping programs. In one example, a grant recipient applied for, and received, funding from both OJP\u2019s Internet Crimes Against Children program and the COPS Office\u2019s Child Sexual Predator Program to provide training for cyber crime investigations and establish an Internet safety program. In some instances, DOJ may deem it appropriate for distinct grant programs to serve one goal, or for one community or grantee to benefit from multiple streams of grant funding. However, DOJ generally lacks visibility over the extent to which its grant programs overlap and thus is not positioned to minimize the risk of potential, unnecessary duplication before making grant awards.", "DOJ has taken some actions that address overlap in its grant programs; for example, by requesting statutory authorization in some instances to consolidate programs that are similar. However, DOJ has not conducted an assessment of its grant programs to systematically identify and reduce overlap. Doing so would enable DOJ to identify program areas where overlap may be desirable and where a consolidation of programs may be more efficient. Further, OJP and OVW use a separate grants management system than the COPS Office uses, limiting their ability to share information on the funding they have awarded or are preparing to award to a recipient. According to COPS Office officials, its mission and grant management processes are unique enough to necessitate a separate system. However, OJP officials told GAO that its system has been and can be modified with minimal investment to accommodate different grant processes. DOJ has initiated a study to assess the feasibility, costs, and benefits of unifying the systems among other options. By ensuring that such a study accounts for the effort necessary to harmonize departmental grant processes, DOJ could ensure that variations in such processes do not encumber system unification.", "DOJ\u2019s Office of Audit, Assessment, and Management (OAAM) oversees monitoring of grantees\u2019 compliance and conducts grant program assessments to gauge program effectiveness. GAO found that OAAM\u2019s program assessments yield richer information than its monitoring reports because they identify improvement areas. OAAM officials believe additional assessments could be beneficial. They also said they lacked resources to conduct more, but had not conducted a feasibility analysis to confirm this. By OAAM examining its mix of monitoring and assessment activities, including the costs and benefits of current resource allocations, it could better ensure continuous improvement in grant programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that the department assess its grant programs for overlap, ensure its comprehensive study of DOJ grant management systems also includes an analysis of steps necessary to harmonize business processes, and examine its mix of grant monitoring and program assessment activities.

In fiscal year 2010, DOJ  awarded nearly $3.6 billion in grants through its three granting agencies\u2014 the Office of Justice Programs (OJP), the Office on Violence Against  Women (OVW), and the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS)  Office. Many of the grant programs that OJP, OVW, and the COPS Office  administer are, pursuant to their originating statutes, similar in scope, and  grant applicants can apply for and receive grant awards from more than  one program. Moreover, statutes may also require that grant recipients  award a portion of their grants to subgrantees. Where statutes do not  require subgranting, a grantee may voluntarily choose to award all or a  portion of its funds to subgrantees. These subgrantees may also apply  directly to DOJ for funding through other grant programs for purposes that  are the same or similar to the purpose for which they received the  subgrant. The number of grant programs and recipients, and the billions  of dollars in funds awarded annually, present administrative challenges  for DOJ.", "We have identified management of programs that support state and local  crime reduction efforts as a major performance and accountability  challenge for DOJ. We previously reported on evaluations of grant  programs to assist communities in addressing gang problems, and the  quality of DOJ\u2019s tool to measure grantees\u2019 performances under Recovery  Act funding for one of OJP\u2019s largest grant programs. Moreover, the DOJ  Inspector General (IG) has listed grant management as one of the top 10  challenges for DOJ every year from 2000 through 2011 and has identified  overlap in grant programs and duplicative oversight and monitoring  services. Specifically, a 2003 IG audit found overlap in grant programs  between OJP and the COPS Office, which it noted resulted from statutes  that created multiple grant programs to fund similar justice areas. The IG  audit also found that no formal communication procedures between OJP  and the COPS Office existed to ensure that grantees did not receive  funds for similar purposes from both granting agencies and made  recommendations to address this coordination issue as discussed later in  this report. In addition, DOJ\u2019s Acting IG testified in June 2011 that certain  monitoring and oversight performed by OVW and the COPS Office are  duplicative of services that are available through OJP.", "As the United States experiences budgetary constraints, there is an ever- increasing need to ensure that governmental resources\u2014including those  awarded through grants and subgrants\u2014are appropriately targeted and  that overlap and unnecessary duplication are mitigated. In February 2012,  we reported that DOJ had not assessed its grant programs to identify  overlap and that DOJ did not routinely coordinate grant awards to avoid  unnecessary duplication. This report provides further elaboration on the  February 2012 report\u2019s findings, as well as addresses DOJ\u2019s ability to  assess the results of its grant programs.", "To examine overlap and potential duplication within DOJ\u2014and in support  of our ongoing efforts to explore duplication, overlap, and fragmentation  governmentwide(1) To what extent does overlap across DOJ grant programs exist and  contribute to the risk of unnecessary duplication in grant awards?

Overlap may  result from statutory or other limitations beyond an agency\u2019s control.", "Duplication occurs on multiple levels. It occurs when a single grantee  uses grant funds from different federal sources to pay for the exact  same expenditure. Duplication also occurs when two or more granting  agencies or grant programs engage in the same or similar activities or  provide funding to support the same or similar services to the same  beneficiaries. Duplication thus stems from overlap. When granting  agencies do not identify overlap, assess its impact, or coordinate their  activities in acknowledgment of the overlap, there is a heightened risk  of unnecessary duplication because one granting agency may not  be knowledgeable of the ways in which its funding decision duplicates  another\u2019s. At times, federal funding is leveraged by design to achieve  a single purpose through multiple federal funding streams. These  funding arrangements are not characterized as unnecessary  duplication for purposes of this review so long as federal agencies are  aware of them or have deliberately planned for grant programs to be  complementary.", "To determine potential areas of overlap across DOJ\u2019s grant programs, we  identified a total of 253 DOJ grant solicitations\u2014announcements to  applicants of funding opportunities\u2014for fiscal year 2010 by reviewing the  solicitation lists posted on the OJP, OVW, and COPS Office websites and  confirming the accuracy of the information with DOJ officials. We  established 10 categories of criminal justice areas and then sorted the  solicitations into each category to determine whether these solicitations  were announcing grant funding available for similar purposes. We  developed these 10 categories after reviewing comparable justice areas  identified within DOJ materials, such as a website it operates to discuss  criminal justice research and strategic planning documents. After  identifying solicitations with similar scopes, we reviewed a nonprobability  sample of 26 successful grant applications that were awarded under  similar solicitations to identify and assess specific examples of how the  recipients planned to use funds from multiple programs in the same or  similar manner and whether this creates the risk of unnecessary  duplication in DOJ grant funding. The sample was selected based upon  applicants receiving multiple grant awards from overlapping grant  programs. The sample we reviewed is not generalizable to all DOJ grant  programs because an ideal sample size based upon nearly 11,000  funded grant applications was impractical to select, review, and analyze.  However, the results from our sample illustrate the potential for  unnecessary duplication.", "To examine the extent to which DOJ has taken action to reduce or  mitigate overlap and ensure that DOJ does not unnecessarily award  funds from multiple grant programs to support similar purposes, we  analyzed agency policies, procedures, and guidance, current as of 2012,  on grant program design and award, such as the OJP Grant Manager\u2019s  Manual. In addition, we interviewed DOJ officials from OJP, OVW, and  the COPS Office to discuss, among other topics, their grant program  design and award processes and the extent to which they coordinate and  share information with one another. We also visited or conducted phone  interviews with officials from 11 states to discuss the type and timeliness  of information on grant awards and subawards that they provide to or  receive from DOJ. We selected these states based on the amount of  Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) funding they  receive and the existence of other recipients in their communities  receiving DOJ discretionary grants for potentially similar purposes. The  results of these contacts are not generalizable to all states, but provided  insight into how DOJ grant funds were used locally and communication  occurred between states and DOJ. We also compared agency grant  design and award practices against Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government and promising practices identified in the Domestic  Working Group Grant Accountability Project\u2019s Guide to Opportunities for  Improving Grant Accountability.", "To analyze the extent to which DOJ uses grant monitoring and  assessment to determine program effectiveness and uses the results to  enhance its grant programs, we analyzed DOJ documentation, such as  assessments DOJ conducted of its programs and specific programmatic  grant monitoring reports.

These  solicitations announced funding available to grantees for criminal and  juvenile justice activities, including direct assistance for crime victims and  the hiring of police officers. These solicitations also announced funding  available for grantees to collect criminal justice data, conduct research, or  provide related training and technical assistance. We developed these  10 categories of justice areas after reviewing comparable justice areas  identified within OJP\u2019s CrimeSolutions.gov website, which OJP officials  stated covers a variety of justice topics, including some topic areas that  OVW and the COPS Office fund; OJP\u2019s Fiscal Year 2010 Program Plan;  and other materials from OVW and the COPS Office, such as justice  program themes from their respective websites. Within the justice areas,  a variety of activities\u2014including research, direct service provision, or  technical assistance\u2014can be conducted. We examined the purpose  areas of the 253 grant solicitations and then categorized them by justice  area.", "In conducting this analysis, we recognize that overlapping grant programs  across common programmatic areas result in part from authorizing  statutes, and that overlap itself may not be problematic. However, the  existence of overlapping grant programs is an indication that agencies  should increase their visibility of where their funds are going and  coordinate to ensure that any resulting duplication in grant award funding  is purposeful rather than unnecessary. Overlap and the associated risk of  unnecessary duplication occur throughout the government, as we have  reported previously, and are not isolated to DOJ. However, when  coupled with consistent programmatic coordination, the risk of  unnecessary duplication can be diminished.", "As table 2 illustrates, we found overlap across the various DOJ grant  programs. For example, 56 of DOJ\u2019s 253 grant solicitations\u2014or more  than 20 percent\u2014were providing grant funds available for activities  related to victim assistance or to support the research and prevention of  violence against women. Eighteen of these 56 programs were  administered by offices other than OVW and OJP\u2019s Office for Victims of  Crime. In addition, more than 50 percent of all grant solicitations  provided funding that could be used in support of the same three justice  areas\u2014victim assistance, technology and forensics, and juvenile justice\u2014 indicating concentrated and overlapping efforts. The justice area with the  least overlap was juvenile justice, with 30 of 33 grant programs  administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention.", "There are some instances in which overlap occurs because of the statute  that established programs. Further, we recognize that overlap among  DOJ\u2019s grant programs may be desirable because such overlap can  enable DOJ\u2019s granting agencies to leverage multiple funding streams to  serve a single justice purpose. However, coordination across the  administering granting agencies is critical for such leveraging to occur. In  the section below, we discuss the ways in which overlapping grant  programs increase the risk of unnecessarily duplicative grant awards for  the same or similar purposes.

Applicants can apply directly to DOJ for funding through a variety of grant  programs that DOJ announces annually. Recipients of such grant awards  are referred to as prime grantees. Since many of DOJ\u2019s grant programs  allow prime grantees to award subgrants, applicants also can apply  directly to a prime grantee for award funding. As a result, prime grantees  receiving money from DOJ through one funding stream also can be  subgrantees receiving money from a prime grantee through another  funding stream. If an applicant, either as a prime grantee or as a  subgrantee, receives multiple grant awards from overlapping programs,  the risk of unnecessary duplication increases since the applicant may  receive funding from more than one source for the same or similar  purpose without DOJ being aware that this situation exists. Such  duplication may be unnecessary if, for example, the total funding received  exceeds the applicant\u2019s need, or if neither granting agency was aware of  the original funding decision.", "After reviewing a sample of 26 grant applications from recipients who  received funds from grant programs we identified as having similar  purpose areas, we found instances where applicants used the same or  similar language to apply for multiple streams of funding.

Further,  included in this applicant\u2019s proposed budgets for both funding streams  were plans to purchase equipment, such as forensic computers and the  same specialized software to investigate Internet crimes against children.  Another grant recipient from a different jurisdiction also applied for  funding from OJP and the COPS Office programs to support the same  types of investigations. In a third instance, an applicant received fiscal  year 2010 grant funding for planned sexual assault victim services from  both OJP\u2019s Office for Victims of Crime and OVW. The applicant used  similar language in both applications, noting that it intended to use the  funding to support child victim services through its child advocacy center.", "After we shared these examples with DOJ, DOJ officials followed up with  the grant recipients involved and reported to us that the grantees were  not using awarded funds for duplicative purposes\u2014which DOJ defines as  grantees using funds to pay for the exact same item.

DOJ supports all of these areas through JAG, as well as  through targeted grant programs specifically addressing each of these  topics. On the basis of survey responses, we found several instances  where SAAs reported that JAG funds were used to support activities that  could have been funded through other DOJ grants. For instance, 11 of 50  responding SAAs, or 22 percent, reported that they or their subgrantees  used JAG funding to support correctional officer salaries. Further, 23 of  the 50 SAAs, or nearly 50 percent, reported that they or their subgrantees  used JAG funding to hire police officers, even though a separate DOJ  program dedicates funding exclusively to hiring law enforcement  personnel.", "The COPS Office hiring grant awarded to this county was for fiscal year 2009.

The IG reported that while the COPS Hiring Grant program is  required to advance community policing, the Local Law Enforcement  Block Grant Program grants are sometimes used for the same or similar  purposes.

For example, they said that in some cases, statutes creating  what may appear to be similar programs also create very different  eligibility criteria for grant applicants. Thus, the officials stated, some  programs may not be easily merged through administrative efforts such  as announcing similar grant programs in a single solicitation. We agree  that similar grant programs may have unique features that could render  grant consolidation or coordination impractical, but DOJ has not taken the  steps to catalogue all of its programs across each of the three granting  agencies, and then determine which have the potential to be consolidated  or coordinated and what barriers might exist to achieve such changes.", "The IG continues to include DOJ\u2019s grants management among its list of  top challenges affecting the department, and in previous reports, has  identified fragmentation and duplication among DOJ\u2019s granting agencies  as an area of concern.

Thus, in the instances where DOJ made multiple grant awards to  applicants for the same or similar purposes, officials made these awards  without always being aware of the potential for unnecessary duplication or  whether funding from multiple streams was warranted. DOJ officials  stated that their annual process to formulate budgets for grant  administration, OJP\u2019s annual planning process to develop solicitations,  and the department\u2019s overall grant oversight functions address the risks  of unnecessary duplication in grant awards.

Additionally, officials stated they are currently developing a grant  special condition for all fiscal year 2012 grant awards that would require  grantees to report to OJP if they receive any funding for a specific project  cost that is duplicative of the funding OJP provides. OJP officials told us  that if grantees report duplicative funding for a specific project cost, OJP  staff will work with the grantees to ensure return of the OJP funds. We  believe this requirement will improve OJP\u2019s ability to limit the risks of  duplicative funding for single items; however, OJP continues to take a  more narrow view of the term \u201cduplication.\u201d OJP defines duplicative  funding to include only instances where grantees are using federal money  for the same exact item. In doing so, OJP excludes from its purview all  federal funding that grant applicants have been awarded to carry out the  same or similar activities within a proposed project. Thus, in making  funding decisions without asking for information about and considering  other sources of an applicant\u2019s federal funding to carry out the same or  similar activities, OJP may be awarding funds for proposed projects that  are already partially or fully funded. It may also be doing so at the  expense of other applicants who, in the absence of other funding sources,  may demonstrate to OJP greater financial need for their proposals.  Further, DOJ\u2019s new approach\u2014while an important step\u2014relies solely on  grantee reporting. By independently assessing its own lists of actual and  prospective grantees prior to awarding funds, DOJ could have additional  assurance that it is taking actions to mitigate the risk of unnecessary  duplication.", "In addition, OVW officials stated that for fiscal year 2013, they intend to  require those applying to four of its grant programs to identify in their  grant applications all federal funding that they recently applied for or have  received. By enhancing visibility over various sources of grant funding,  OVW would be better positioned to avoid unnecessary duplication in  awarding grants for these four programs. It could also provide OVW with  opportunities to best leverage OVW funding in a manner that  complements other funding streams the applicant already has available or  may soon receive. For example, if an applicant reports to OVW that it  already receives money through a non-OVW grant to provide counseling  services to victims, OVW can ensure that OVW funds are available for  other project-related activities such as providing training to counselors  who serve victims. However, beyond what OJP is piloting and what OVW  has proposed for four of its programs, DOJ generally does not require  grant applicants to identify other funding that they have received or any  pending funding yet to be awarded, including funding received through a  subgrant. Further, while the COPS Office\u2019s grants management system  automatically includes information on other COPS Office funding a COPS  Office applicant may already be receiving, it does not identify other DOJ  grant funding or any other federal funding sources. As a result, DOJ\u2019s  three granting agencies could take additional steps to increase their  visibility over what applicants may already be receiving before awarding  new funds.", "OJP, OVW, and the COPS Office have not established policies and  procedures requiring consistent coordination and information sharing  among its granting agencies. Having such policies and procedures would  provide guidance to DOJ granting agencies to help ensure they take  action to mitigate the risks of unnecessary duplication before finalizing  award decisions. By routinely coordinating to ensure the sharing of grant  applications and potential grant awards among DOJ granting agencies  prior to finalizing grant award decisions and documenting its methods for  doing so, DOJ could also improve its oversight and better leverage  information already at its disposal.", "The IG recommended in August 2003 that OJP and the COPS Office  establish procedures to coordinate to ensure that grantees do not receive  funds for the same purpose from both agencies.the COPS Office signed a memorandum of understanding to establish  procedures for avoiding duplication by coordinating grants and grant  programs that were identified by the IG and grant programs where the   In response, OJP and  potential for duplication exists. Further, the agencies committed to  reviewing any new guidance affecting grants or grant programs where the  potential for duplication exists. Specifically, for grants and grant programs  identified as having potential for duplication, OJP and the COPS Office  agreed to minimize potential duplicative grant awards in a manner  consistent with statutory provisions, and include a grant award special  condition requiring that grantees not use OJP and COPS Office grant  funds to pay for the same expenses. During the course of our audit  work, we asked COPS Office and OJP officials for examples of the type  of coordination they have been engaging in since the IG\u2019s  recommendations. Officials provided evidence from fiscal year 2009,  when they coordinated funding decisions with OJP prior to awarding  grants for two similar grant programs funded under the Recovery Act.", "However, in some cases, granting agencies continue to provide funding  for the same or similar purposes without each being aware of the others\u2019  actions. Further, we examined grant special conditions for the COPS  Office CSP program and OJP\u2019s ICAC grant program and neither agency  included special conditions in the grant awards requiring grantees to  identify and report duplication. However, the 2010 COPS Child Sexual  Predator Program Grant Owner\u2019s Manual did include a requirement that  grantees inform the COPS Office if they receive other funding for the  same cost or service already funded by the COPS Office while their grant  is underway. The Grant Manager\u2019s Manual used by OJP lists grant award  special conditions, and except for the duplication condition that  specifically applies to CTAS, there were no other grant duplication special  conditions listed.", "Officials from OJP and the COPS Office told us that state and local  communities have expansive criminal justice needs and therefore they  encourage applicants to seek out as much DOJ grant funding as possible,  including from grant programs that may have similar objectives or allow  for similar activities. In some instances, DOJ may deem it appropriate for  distinct grant programs to serve the same goal, or for one community or  grantee to benefit from multiple streams of grant funding. For example, if  DOJ granting officials are coordinating their activities across overlapping  grant programs and are aware that a grantee is receiving funds from  more than one DOJ program, making funding decisions of this kind may  be warranted. However, DOJ\u2019s granting agencies are not routinely  engaging in such coordination. Unless DOJ improves granting agencies\u2019  coordination, and considers information available on current, past, and  prospective funding, it cannot know where all of its funding goes, how it is  being or will be used, and whether it is awarding grant dollars in the most  efficient way possible. Further, if the granting agencies are not aware of  which recipients are receiving funds from multiple grants, they may be  inadvertently awarding multiple grants that exceed the demonstrated  need of a recipient or community at the expense of another applicant or  community with similar demonstrated needs. In addition, they may be  missing opportunities to award grants to recipients who may use funding  in a complementary way, whereby funding may be leveraged by a  grantee or a community to accomplish a single goal. With the exception of  OVW\u2019s plan to have four grant program recipients identify all federal  funding they receive and OJP\u2019s solicitation pilot and plan to have  applicants identify duplicative cost items, DOJ does not have policies and  procedures that require grant applicants to identify all sources of current  or pending DOJ funding in their grant applications in a manner that  provides DOJ a complete picture of DOJ grant project funding. If DOJ had  (1) a coordinated approach to share applicants\u2019 funding intentions, and  (2) policies and procedures to share lists of applicants that each granting  agency plans to fund, DOJ could improve its understanding in the pre- award phase as to whether its funding would complement or  unnecessarily duplicate other federal funding.", "DOJ officials told us that the timeline for reviewing applications, making  recommendations, and processing awards each year is compressed and  that it would be difficult to build in the extra time and level of coordination  required to complete an intradepartmental review for potentially  unnecessary duplication of funding prior to making awards. The officials  added that it would take even more time if granting agencies were to  attempt a pre-award duplication review at the subgrantee level. Thus,  officials told us that they rely upon post-award activities through grant  monitoring, Single Grant Audits, and IG audits to determine if duplicative  expenses have occurred after grants are under way. However, relying  upon monitoring and external audits to identify duplication after it has  occurred should not substitute for the mitigation of potential unnecessary  duplication in the pre-award phase. We acknowledge that the time  necessary to complete annual grant awards makes such a review  process more difficult; however, actions to make coordination more  consistent and efficient as well as the leveraging of grant award  information, including subgrants, could help overcome this challenge.  Moreover, using tools such as existing grant data available on  USASpending.gov, which we address later in this report, could aid DOJ in  validating other grant funding that grant applicants report and allow for an  expedient way to search for subgrant funding. In addition, DOJ could limit  its pre-award coordination to those grant programs that DOJ identifies as  overlapping with other DOJ grant programs. For certain grant programs,  OJP and OVW have taken important first steps to require grant applicants  to report other sources of funding, but expanding this requirement to all  grant programs across all granting agencies, such that every applicant  would report both past and prospective sources of DOJ grant funding,  could provide broader coverage and help DOJ better mitigate the risk of  unnecessary duplication."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ Uses Separate Grant Management Systems, a Fact That Limits Award Coordination", "paragraphs": ["While OJP and OVW use a single grants management system called  GMS, the COPS Office uses a separate grants management system\u2014 CMS\u2014which limits the sharing of grant award information across the  granting agencies. Specifically, OJP, OVW, and the COPS Office use  GMS and CMS to track and manage awards throughout the grant life  cycle. For example, agency grant staff in OJP, OVW, and the COPS  Office use their grant management systems to review and approve  applications and to plan and document grant monitoring activities.  Grantees use the grant management systems to submit financial status  reports that include summary information on grant expenditures and  program income as well as progress or performance reports. DOJ has  spent about $36 million from 2008 through 2010 to maintain and upgrade  these two separate grants management systems, including about $8  million for CMS and $28 million for GMS.", "DOJ\u2019s continued use of two systems to manage grant programs impedes  coordination because GMS and CMS are not linked with each other, and  the agencies\u2019 access is limited to the grants management systems they  utilize. OJP and OVW can access information through GMS about grants  awarded by each other, but they cannot access CMS to see the grantees  that have received COPS Office funds. As a result, these granting  agencies cannot use these grants management systems to inform  themselves of all of the funding DOJ has awarded or is preparing to  award to a recipient and consider this information before making  additional awards. According to an OJP official, over the long term, it  would be helpful if GMS could connect to CMS. Pursuant to the statute  establishing OAAM\u2014the office overseeing programmatic grant monitoring  and assessment across OJP and COPS Office programs\u2014the Director of  OAAM was required to establish and maintain a modern, automated  system for managing all information relating to grants made under  programs within its purview. grant management systems in the department.", "See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3712h(g) (providing that the OAAM Director shall establish and  maintain such a system in consultation with the chief information officer of the office). and monitoring, such as through remote access to CMS. The IG  concluded that oversight agencies should have direct, instant, and  complete access to grant information, which is not provided using the  current system, which relies on hard copies of documents. In response,  COPS Office officials reported that they would provide OJP with real-time  hard copy reports necessary to carry out oversight work and that CMS  could be accessed only by employees using remote access to the COPS  Office or through a COPS Office laptop.", "DOJ contractors completed a gap analysis of CMS and GMS in 2006 to  outline the differences\u2014or gaps\u2014between the two systems and propose  solutions for reconciling them. At the time, the contractor found key gaps  between the two systems related to business processes\u2014in particular,  programmatic grant monitoring, financial monitoring, and progress- reporting capabilities. Thus, the contractor recommended either building a  new single grants system or maintaining the status quo because in the  analysis, business process differences between OJP and the COPS  Office were reportedly obstacles that made using either one of the two  grants systems for both agencies untenable. Since 2007, OJP has  upgraded GMS, which has closed some of the system gaps that the  contractor initially identified, but the two systems remain distinct and  unlinked.", "According to COPS Office officials, CMS continues to better meet their  needs than GMS could because CMS captures and stores data in such a  way that it can be more easily queried than data in GMS and CMS  uniquely aligns with COPS Office grant processes. This is helpful to the  officials when the COPS Office is evaluating grant applications for its  largest program, the COPS Hiring Program. Rather than evaluating  qualitative grant project narratives through external peer review, the  COPS Office considers quantitative data related to applicant fiscal  distress, reported crime statistics, and community policing strategies  when determining where to award COPS Hiring Program grants. Because  COPS Hiring Program grant applicants use CMS to upload their data,  COPS officials are positioned to use CMS for automated aggregation and  analysis of applicant responses.", "In contrast, OJP officials said that because of recent upgrades, GMS  could be used or modified in order to query individual searchable  elements. They also stated that variation in the information required by  individual grant programs would not present an insurmountable barrier to  unifying systems. In addition, GMS has served multiple agencies in the  past and can be modified when circumstances warrant. For example, in  2010 and 2011, COPS Office officials successfully used GMS for  awarding purposes under CTAS. According to OJP officials, the initial  coordination with the COPS Office for CTAS purposes required additional  modifications to GMS, but these were not onerous or costly. The officials  said that with relative ease, after the modifications, OJP, OVW, and  COPS Office grant managers all accessed GMS to perform some of the  phases of the CTAS grant process. For example, GMS supports the  management of CTAS by storing all applications, managing peer review  comments, and registering awards once decisions are final. Besides  OVW\u2019s use of GMS to award and manage its grants, the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA) also uses GMS to award and manage grants, though it has future   Further, OJP officials stated that  plans to use a DHS grants system.GMS has a current storage capacity well in excess of what it currently  uses. They also emphasized that OVW and FEMA have grant business  processes that do not completely align with OJP\u2019s, but with small  investments, OJP has been able to adjust GMS to accommodate OVW  and FEMA.", "In June 2012, DOJ officials informed us they had engaged a contractor to  assess whether a single grants management system, among a range of  other options, can best serve DOJ\u2019s granting agencies. They plan for the  contractor to report back within 6 months of beginning the analysis and  said that they envision the assessment including an evaluation of costs,  benefits, and technical requirements, such as those needed to harmonize  business processes. Engaging a contractor for this purpose is an  important first step, and doing so could help DOJ make better investment  decisions about the most efficient way to manage its grants systems,  especially when it considers the costs and benefits of having fragmented  grants systems. In the interim, however, DOJ could take a more  immediate solution to foster information sharing across GMS and CMS by  providing system access to appropriate OJP, OVW, and COPS Office  staff\u2014for example, through common login names and passwords, just as  department staff have done in limited instances such as the CTAS  Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ Does Not Timely Submit Grant Data to USASpending.gov and Is Not Fully Leveraging the Website\u2019s Subgrant Award Information before Making Grant Award Decisions", "paragraphs": ["DOJ\u2019s granting agencies are not submitting grant award information to  USASpending.gov in a timely way.

OMB issued guidance on reporting the receipt and use of federal funds.

For fiscal  year 2011, DOJ submitted 4,346 distinct prime grant award records to  USASpending.gov; however, GSA rejected 1,152 of these because of  incomplete or inaccurate data associated with some of these grant files,  and DOJ did not resubmit the records within 5 working days as required  under OMB guidance. Specifically, DOJ did not correct and resubmit the  rejected records until December 22, 2011, which was after we raised this  issue with DOJ and 83 days after the end of the fiscal year. Five out of 11  DOJ prime grantees we interviewed who had awarded subgrants  indicated that, after searching, they could not view their prime DOJ grant  awards on FSRS.gov or USASpending.gov and indicated that DOJ had  not uploaded the information to the websites. Further, another prime  grantee among the 11 with whom we spoke indicated that it was unaware  that subgrant reporting was a requirement. As a result, these prime  grantees were unable to submit their subgrant award information and thus  were unable to comply with OMB subgrant reporting requirements. DOJ  has taken action to help ensure that prime grantees and DOJ grants staff  are aware of FFATA reporting requirements. For example, OJP offered  FFATA reporting training for all DOJ grants staff and grantees, and all  three granting agencies required a special condition in grant awards that  included FFATA reporting requirements.

Nevertheless, OJP officials stated that the current allotment of 5 days for  agencies to review and resubmit data that GSA originally rejected is an  unreasonable time frame given the time-intensive nature of checking and  correcting errors. Officials also noted that OJP would like to see GSA  allow for the posting of individual records that pass system validation  rather than waiting for entire blocks to be corrected at once before GSA  will post award information to USASpending.gov.

By DOJ ensuring that it submits its  grant award information to USASpending.gov in as timely a manner as is  possible, prime grantees\u2019 abilities to report their subgrant activities would  likely improve.

In the November 2011 report, OAAM  assessed the processes that BJA used to verify the eligibility and  accuracy of reimbursement requests submitted by grantees. The  assessment concluded that BJA is administering its payment programs  appropriately to verify the eligibility and accuracy of payments, but it also  determined that additional internal controls were necessary and that  procedures were not sufficient to identify duplicate payment requests from  grantees. As a result of the assessment, OAAM made six  recommendations to BJA, including implementing additional procedures  to identify duplicate requests for payments of detention expenses. In  particular, one of OAAM\u2019s recommendations was that BJA implement a  process to identify overlapping requests for reimbursement between two  of the programs for expenses related to detention of criminal aliens. In  response, BJA compared all of those programs\u2019 applications for  reimbursement for fiscal year 2011 to identify whether jurisdictions were  requesting reimbursement for the detention of the same individuals over  the same period of time.

OAAM\u2019s summaries of these reports then roll  up the statistics and ensure the compliance monitoring occurs as  required. However, OAAM\u2019s program assessments are more  comprehensive than both the individual grant monitoring reports and the  summary reports OAAM prepares because their broader perspective  allows for reporting on program successes, impediments, and potential  areas for improvement. While monitoring 10 percent or more of the  aggregate amount of grant funding awarded annually is important and  beneficial to the grant management process, the 7 program assessment  reports that OAAM has issued since 2008 have led to more than 50  recommendations for the improvement of OJP and COPS Office grant  programs.", "According to OAAM officials, additional program assessments would be  beneficial; however, they told us that OAAM does not have sufficient  resources to conduct more.

Instead, OVW staff in each  program area review the results of the biennial reports and the  semiannual summary data reports compiled from grantee progress  reports to identify priority areas where there is an unmet need. The OVW  reports contain sections on \u201cremaining areas of need\u201d identified by grant  recipients. However, the areas of need that OVW identified are based on  comments grant recipients provided on gaps in service, rather than being  based on an independent assessment that OVW conducted on the overall  grant programs. Moreover, unlike the grant program assessments that  OAAM conducts, beyond identifying areas of need, the biennial reports do  not result in concrete recommendations for improving OVW\u2019s grant  programs. OVW officials told us that for the upcoming 2012 biennial  report, they plan to focus more attention to the discussion of remaining  areas of need.", "According to OVW\u2019s 2010 Biennial Report to Congress on the  Effectiveness of Grant Programs Under the Violence Against Women Act,  demonstrating the effectiveness of services provided by agencies funded  under OVW presents a challenge for those charged with meeting the  reporting mandate of VAWA 2000. An OVW official told us that it is  difficult to discern between output and outcomes when dealing with the  grant programs in OVW and that it is difficult to measure outcomes with  service grant programs. For example, OVW might consider whether an  abuse victim not only gets a protective order but also receives additional  services. Additionally, according to OVW officials, it would be difficult to  track how many victims received different types of services in multiple  areas, because OVW service provider grantees only track the first  instance in which a victim receives services and do not follow up on  related services.", "According to the federal Domestic Working Group Grant Accountability  Project\u2019s Guide to Opportunities for Improving Grant Accountability,  agencies need a process for managing performance once grants are  awarded, and the ability to assess grant results and use those results  when awarding future grants.

These  activities are not part of OVW\u2019s current approach to program oversight.", "OVW conducts its grant program monitoring as well as IG audit follow-up.  Additionally, OVW has a Grant Assessment Tool (GAT)\u2014designed by the  same company that produced the GAT for OJP.conducts Single Audit follow-ups; manages the high-risk grantee list; and  oversees DOJ\u2019s combined programmatic and financial monitoring plan,  which is the combined monitoring list of all the sites that OJP, OVW, and  the COPS Office plan to visit for the year. In a March 2011 audit, the IG  found that OVW and the COPS Office perform certain monitoring and  oversight services that are duplicative of the services available through  OJP and recommended that DOJ standardize the oversight services   OAAM currently  provided to OVW and the COPS Office to eliminate such duplication and  provide uniformity in oversight among DOJ granting agencies. OAAM  provides certain administrative services that facilitate grant program  management, but DOJ officials told us the reason OAAM does not have  oversight over OVW is because the Attorney General has not extended  OAAM\u2019s purview. OJP officials told us that they have not been provided  the scope of work that OVW oversight may encompass and, as such,  OAAM has not conducted any analyses using a workforce model to  determine the staffing levels, associated resources, and other possible  impacts (i.e., costs and benefits) of having OVW under its purview on  OAAM operations.", "OVW officials expressed concern that OAAM staff would not have any  expertise in violence against women issues. However, OAAM currently  has oversight over specialized bureaus and offices such as the Office for  Victims of Crime and the Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring,  Apprehending, Registering, and Tracking. Additionally, OVW officials  stated that OAAM does not perform data collection and analysis activities,  which are the primary activities of the Measuring Effectiveness Initiative.  However, as a part of its assessments, OAAM has collected performance  measures and conducted analysis. For example, in its assessment of the  ICAC Training and Technical Assistance Program, OAAM collected and  analyzed national performance metrics related to training. Given the  nature of OAAM assessments, along with the other oversight services it  provides to OJP and the COPS Office, the information resulting from  OAAM assessments of OVW grant programs could better inform OVW  about its grant programs and funding to assist with future program design  and award decisions while also providing Congress with a more complete  picture on the effectiveness of programs funded under VAWA.  Accordingly, DOJ could benefit from assessing the feasibility, costs, and  benefits of OAAM providing grant program assessments for OVW."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The statutory design of DOJ\u2019s grant programs has contributed to overlap  across a number of justice areas. We recognize that even when programs  overlap, there may be meaningful differences in their eligibility criteria or  objectives, or they may be providing similar types of services in different  ways. We also recognize that a number of grant programs are formula- driven and therefore grantees\u2019 eligibility is predetermined. However,  because DOJ exercises independent judgment when making  discretionary awards and therefore has full responsibility for how it  conducts its pre-award reviews, it will be important for the department to  maximize visibility over how grantees plan to spend the funds they  receive from multiple funding streams. In some instances, DOJ may  deem it appropriate for large numbers of distinct grant programs to serve  one goal, or for the same communities to benefit from multiple streams of  its grant funding. In these cases, duplication may be warranted. However,  because we found routine coordination and consistent policies and  procedures for sharing information across the granting agencies during  DOJ\u2019s pre-award phase limited, we do not believe DOJ knows with  certainty if such duplication is always necessary.", "DOJ\u2019s three granting agencies have taken some steps to coordinate their  grant-related activities and have sought congressional approval in some  instances for grant program consolidation. Further, they have initiated  other, limited actions to ensure that grantees report additional streams of  funding. However, DOJ limits its view of duplication to instances where  grant applicants apply for and receive multiple streams of funding,  including DOJ funding, to support single costs associated with a single  grant project. Using this definition, DOJ believes that any unnecessary  duplication can be identified through monitoring grantees post-award. We  take a broader view of duplication and consider it potentially unnecessary  when DOJ is unaware that grantees have applied for and are receiving  funding for potentially the very same or similar purposes. Therefore, we  believe it is incumbent that DOJ take steps in the pre-award phase to  make purposeful judgments about funding necessity before finalizing the  awards. Doing so would help the department better mitigate this risk for  potential, unnecessary duplication. Specifically, by conducting a broad  examination of all DOJ grant programs to systematically identify justice  areas for which funding overlaps, DOJ would have greater visibility over  how its funding can be used and whether it is awarding grant dollars in  the most efficient way possible. Further, developing and implementing  policies and procedures to require granting agencies to routinely share  and consider information each may have about past or prospective  grantee funding could provide DOJ with more strategic visibility over its  awarding decisions. In addition, requiring all grantees to report current or  prospective federal funding sources when applying for DOJ grants could  provide DOJ with more information to better target its limited financial  resources before it finalizes new grant awards.", "Additionally, by taking interim steps to expand access to the two distinct  grant management systems\u2014CMS and GMS\u2014DOJ could better ensure  that grant managers and decision makers can leverage all existing tools  while a longer-term study to consider the feasibility, costs, and benefits of  potential options for DOJ grant management systems is underway. Such  options could include unifying the systems, creating a DOJ-wide system,  or using off-the-shelf software to bridge information gaps. Related, DOJ  can have greater confidence that any variation in how the granting  agencies are currently managing their portfolios does not hinder any  potential unification by ensuring that its planned study include an  assessment of the steps needed to harmonize DOJ grant processes.  Further, with additional steps to ensure that DOJ is submitting grant  award information to USASpending.gov in the most timely manner  possible, the department could facilitate prime grantees\u2019 uploading of  information on subgrantees\u2019 use of funds and therefore make the website  a more useful resource to DOJ\u2019s own grant decision makers. Finally,  recognizing the value of OAAM\u2019s role, assessing whether the office relies  on an appropriate mix of programmatic grant monitoring and program  assessment\u2014as well as considering expansion of OAAM\u2019s coverage to  include OVW\u2014could improve the overall operation of grant programs  departmentwide."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that DOJ can identify overlapping grant programs to either  consolidate or coordinate similar programs, mitigate the risk of  unnecessary grant award duplication in its programs, and enhance DOJ\u2019s  ability to gauge grant program effectiveness, we recommend that the  Attorney General take the following eight actions:  1.  Conduct an assessment to better understand the extent to which the  department\u2019s grant programs overlap with one another and determine  if grant programs may be consolidated to mitigate the risk of  unnecessary duplication. To the extent that DOJ identifies any  statutory obstacles to consolidating its grant programs, it should work  with Congress to address them, as needed.  2.  Coordinate within and among granting agencies on a consistent basis  to review potential or recent grant awards from grant programs that  DOJ identifies as overlapping, including subgrant awards reported by  prime grant awardees, to the extent possible, before awarding grants.  DOJ should also take steps to establish written policies and  procedures to govern this coordination and help ensure that it occurs. 3.  Require its grant applicants to report all federal grant funding,  including all DOJ funding, that they are currently receiving or have  recently applied for in their grant applications. 4.  Provide appropriate OJP and COPS Office staff with access to both  GMS and CMS and appropriate OVW staff with access to CMS.  5.  As part of DOJ\u2019s evaluation of its grant management systems, DOJ  should ensure that it assesses the feasibility, costs, and benefits of  moving to a single grants management system, including the steps  needed to harmonize DOJ grant processes, so that any variation in  how the granting agencies manage their portfolios is not an  encumbrance to potential system unification. 6.  Ensure the most timely reporting possible of grant award information  to USASpending.gov according to OMB guidelines, which would  enable its grantees to comply with their reporting responsibilities  according to the same guidelines. 7.  Assess whether OAAM relies on an appropriate mix of programmatic  grant monitoring and program assessment, and determine whether  the office could support additional program assessments. 8.  Assess the feasibility, costs, and benefits of OAAM providing  assessments for OVW, in addition to OJP and the COPS Office. If  DOJ determines that OAAM assessments of OVW grant programs  would be more cost-effective and provide greater insight into the  effectiveness of OVW grant programs than OVW\u2019s current approach,  then the Attorney General should extend OAAM\u2019s oversight to include  OVW."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOJ for comment.

DOJ stated it will explore  options for carrying out such an assessment in an effort to reduce the  risk associated with unnecessary or inappropriate program  duplication. For example, DOJ stated it is considering tasking OAAM  to conduct such an assessment. Since DOJ is developing options for  how it will implement this recommendation, it is too soon to know what  specific actions DOJ will take, when they will be completed, and  whether they will fully address the intent of the recommendation.", "DOJ agreed with the second recommendation that it coordinate within  and among granting agencies, to the extent possible, before awarding  grants. DOJ stated that its grant-making agencies will continue to  closely collaborate and share information prior to making grant  awards. DOJ also stated it plans to use the results of the assessment  referenced in the first recommendation to develop a targeted and  strategic approach for reviewing grant applications during the pre- award process. Since DOJ is considering how it will implement this  recommendation, it is too soon to know what specific actions DOJ will  take, when they will be completed, and whether they will fully address  the intent of the recommendation.", "DOJ agreed with the third recommendation that DOJ require its grant  applicants to report all federal grant funding, including all DOJ  funding, that they are currently receiving or have recently applied for  in their grant applications. DOJ stated it plans to use a risk-based  approach to implement this recommendation, using the results from  its assessment in response to the first recommendation. This is a  positive step toward ensuring that DOJ has a more complete picture  of an applicant\u2019s access to other federal funding. However, since DOJ  has not yet developed its approach, it is too soon to tell whether  DOJ\u2019s actions will address the intent of the recommendation.", "DOJ agreed with the fourth recommendation that DOJ provide  appropriate OJP and COPS Office staff with access to both GMS and  CMS and appropriate OVW staff with access to CMS. DOJ noted that  OJP will provide read-only GMS access to COPS Office staff and that  the COPS Office will provide reports to OJP and OVW from CMS,  given the technological barriers to providing external system access.  These actions, when implemented, should address the intent of this  recommendation.", "DOJ agreed with the fifth recommendation that as part of its  evaluation of its grant management systems, DOJ should ensure it  assesses the feasibility, costs, and benefits of moving to a single  grants management system. DOJ stated that it had initiated such a  study and plans to complete it within the next six months. When  effectively completed, this study, along with any actions taken to  implement its findings, should address the intent of this  recommendation.", "DOJ agreed with the sixth recommendation that DOJ ensure the most  timely reporting possible of grant award information to  USASpending.gov.

This is a positive first step, but it is too soon to  know whether the results of these discussions and any resulting  potential future actions will address the intent of the recommendation.", "In addition, DOJ raised concerns about the methodology we used to  identify overlap in DOJ\u2019s fiscal year 2010 grant program solicitations  across 10 broad justice themes. DOJ stated that our analysis of potential  overlap between DOJ funding solicitations substantially overstated the  number of programs that might be duplicative. DOJ commented that the  table we used to show the overlap was an indication that DOJ was  involved in \u201cwasteful duplication.\u201d Our analysis, as summarized in table 2  of this report, demonstrates overlap in the justice areas that DOJ\u2019s grant  programs aim to support. Having several overlapping grant programs  within individual justice areas requires greater visibility and pre-award  coordination on the part of DOJ to diminish the risk of unnecessary  duplication at the grant project level. As such, our analysis does not, on  its own, indicate unnecessary duplication among DOJ grant programs,  but instead identifies the potential risk of unnecessary duplication.  Implementing the recommendations in this report that DOJ assess grant  program overlap and coordinate grant award decisions will help DOJ  identify areas of overlap and mitigate the risk of unnecessary duplication  in grants. DOJ also considered the categories we developed for our  analysis such as \u201ccommunity crime prevention strategies\u201d as too broad  and exclusive of specialized programs such as community policing. We  developed our 10 broad justice areas based mainly on programmatic  information contained on DOJ granting agency websites and other DOJ  literature and believe they fairly demonstrate overlap among DOJ\u2019s  various grant programs. We recognize that the more detailed analysis we  recommended and DOJ agreed to undertake is necessary to determine  the extent of any unnecessary duplication.", "DOJ also commented that our sample size of grant applications was too  small in number and was not generalizable. As discussed in this report,  our sample size was not intended to be generalizable across the entire  scope of DOJ grant program awards, but instead was meant to illustrate  the potential for unnecessary duplication. DOJ further commented that  their investigation of the examples of unnecessary duplication we  provided proved that no duplication actually existed in the grant  programs. DOJ conducted its review after we provided our examples and  focused on how grantees were using the funds they had received. Our  analysis of potential duplication focused on grant applications\u2014how  applicants proposed to spend federal grant dollars\u2014and not on the  verification of activities grantees carried out once DOJ funded them.  DOJ\u2019s plans to improve pre-award coordination are positive steps and we  believe that by doing so, DOJ will be better positioned to make better  informed decisions about the financial needs of grantees and  communities for their proposed projects.", "Finally, DOJ expressed concern that the report implies that DOJ is not  tracking subgrantees\u2019 activities. Our analysis focused on pre-award  coordination, not DOJ\u2019s efforts to track subgrantee activities. As such, we  recommended that DOJ use the subgrant award information it does have  to help inform DOJ\u2019s grant award decision making. We believe that  subgrant award information could provide DOJ decision makers with a  more complete financial picture of applicants and the projects they  propose to be funded by DOJ.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General, selected  congressional committees, and other interested parties.

(2) To  what extent has DOJ taken steps to reduce overlap in its grant programs  and the potential for unnecessary duplication in grant awards? (3) To  what extent does DOJ use programmatic grant monitoring and  assessment to determine grant program effectiveness and use the results  to enhance its grant programs?", "To examine the extent to which overlap across DOJ grant programs  exists, we identified the total number of DOJ grant solicitations for fiscal  year 2010. To do this, we reviewed the lists posted on the Office of  Justice Programs (OJP), Office on Violence Against Women (OWV), and  Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Office websites and  confirmed the currency of the information with DOJ officials. To determine  whether these solicitations were announcing grant funding available for  similar or overlapping purposes, we first established 10 categories of  criminal justice areas. We developed these 10 categories after reviewing  comparable justice areas identified within OJP\u2019s CrimeSolutions.gov  website, which OJP officials stated includes themes addressed through  OVW and COPS Office programs; OJP\u2019s Fiscal Year 2010 Program Plan;  and other materials from OVW and the COPS Office, such as justice  program themes from their respective websites. Next, through analyst  consensus, we sorted the grant solicitations according to the 10 justice  categories. After identifying solicitations with similar scopes, we then  reviewed 26 successful grant applications that were awarded under  similar solicitations to identify and assess specific examples of how the  recipients planned to use funds from multiple programs in the same or  similar manner. The sample we reviewed is not generalizable to all DOJ  grant programs because we did not review all of the more than 11,000  grant applications that DOJ funded in fiscal year 2011, but it illustrates the  potential for unnecessary duplication. To determine if DOJ could take  more action to avoid program overlap that can lead to unnecessary  duplication, we applied the Domestic Working Group Grant Accountability  Project\u2019s Guide to Opportunities for Improving Grant Accountability.", "To examine the extent to which DOJ has taken steps to reduce overlap in  its grant programs and the potential for unnecessary duplication in grant  awards, we reviewed agency policies, procedures, and guidance on grant  program design and award, such as the COPS Office Program  Development Team charter and template, and the OJP Grant Manager\u2019s  Manual. Further, we interviewed DOJ officials from the three granting  agencies to obtain additional information on grant program design and  award processes, and the extent to which the three agencies coordinate  and share information. We also visited or conducted phone interviews  with officials from 11 states, including the five largest and five smallest  state recipients of Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant  (JAG) funding. These officials represent the state administering agencies  (SAA) responsible for distributing JAG and other DOJ formula block grant  funds to subrecipients in California, Florida, New York, North Dakota,  Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont,  and Wyoming. These officials provided their views regarding the type and  timeliness of information on grant awards and subawards they provide to  and receive from DOJ. We selected these 11 states based on the amount  of JAG funding they receive and the existence of other recipients in their  communities receiving DOJ discretionary grants for potentially similar  purposes. The results of these contacts are not generalizable to all states,  but provided insight into how DOJ grant funds are used locally and into  the communication between states and DOJ. To determine if JAG  recipients expended grant funds in fiscal year 2010 on sexual assault  services, bullet and stab-resistant vests, sex offender registry and  notification systems, Internet crime against children task forces, hiring  police officers, and correctional officer salaries, we conducted a web- based survey of all recipients of DOJ JAG grant funding who received an  award from fiscal years 2005 through 2010. The survey response rate  related to SAAs was 89 percent, with 50 out of 56 SAAs answering the  questionnaire.
