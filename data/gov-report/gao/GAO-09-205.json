To address these objectives, GAO reviewed selected rules issued between January 2006 and May 2008 and associated dockets and also interviewed knowledgeable agency and OIRA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The agencies GAO reviewed had little data on the time and resources used to comply with regulatory requirements making it difficult to evaluate the effects of these requirements on rulemaking. All the agencies set milestones for regulatory development. During our review, only the Department of Transportation (DOT) provided data showing that it tracked and reported on milestones, but EPA and FDA provided similar information in their agency comments. The agencies GAO reviewed also could provide little systematic data on the resources they used--such as staff hours, contract costs, and other expenses--in developing rules. DOT and SEC have attempted to identify staff time expended on individual rules but are encountering difficulties generating usable and reliable data. Despite the challenges they have encountered in attempting to track time and resources in rulemaking, agency officials identified potential benefits to the management of their processes if they had such information to evaluate. Systematic tracking and reporting by agencies on their schedules and milestones would also be consistent with internal control standards. Our review of 139 major rules including 16 case-study rules revealed that most triggered analytical requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA), Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), and Executive Order 12866, but few other requirements. Agency officials reported that requirements added to the rulemaking process by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) since 2003 sometimes required a learning period when first implemented, but their agencies either already performed the added requirements or recognized the revisions as best practices. The officials instead identified long-standing requirements of the PRA and the RFA as generally requiring a more significant investment of resources. Based on the limited information available, the average time needed to complete a rulemaking across our 16 case-study rules was about 4 years, with a range from about 1 year to nearly 14 years, but there was considerable variation among agencies and rules. OIRA's reviews of agencies' draft rules often resulted in changes. Of 12 case-study rules subject to OIRA review, 10 resulted in changes, about half of which included changes to the regulatory text. Agencies used various methods to document OIRA's reviews, which generally met disclosure requirements, but the transparency of this documentation could be improved. In particular, some prior issues persist, such as uneven attribution of changes made during the OIRA review period and differing interpretations regarding which changes are \"substantive\" and thus require documentation. Out of eight prior GAO recommendations to improve the transparency OIRA has implemented only one--to clarify information posted about meetings with outside parties regarding draft rules under OIRA review."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Regulation is one of the principal tools that the government uses to  implement public policy. Federal regulations affect many aspects of  citizens\u2019 lives, whether addressing issues featured in the headlines of the  past year, such as the safety of the food supply and the health of the  housing and financial markets, or other long-standing goals such as  environmental protection and workplace and transportation accident  prevention. Regulations also help ensure the effective distribution of funds  under a range of programs including Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security,  agricultural support, and disaster assistance programs. Underlying federal  regulatory actions is the long-standing rulemaking process established by  the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).", "As part of that process, Congresses and Presidents have required agencies  to comply with an increasing number of procedural and analytical  requirements prior to issuing a rule. Some requirements apply only to  cabinet departments and independent agencies, while others also apply to  independent regulatory agencies. The goals of these requirements include  promoting public participation in rulemaking, reducing regulatory  burdens, requiring more rigorous regulatory analysis, and enhancing  oversight of agencies\u2019 rulemaking. As we have previously reported, these  requirements entail a wide range of procedural, consultative, and  analytical actions on the part of the agencies. For example, the  Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) requires agencies to examine the impact  of their rules on small entities. The Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)  requires agencies to provide public notice, solicit comments, and request  approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) before imposing  new information collection requirements. Executive Order 12866 directs  agencies (other than independent regulatory agencies) to assess costs and  benefits of available regulatory alternatives and to submit significant rules  to OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) for review  before they are published. (See app. I for a summary of agencies\u2019  responsibilities under broadly applicable regulatory requirements relevant  to the rules we reviewed for this report.)", "In the past, Congress has asked us to review the implementation of  specific rulemaking requirements. For this report, you asked us to  examine how broadly applicable rulemaking requirements cumulatively  have affected (1) agencies\u2019 rulemaking processes and (2) the transparency  of the OIRA review process. Specifically, you asked us to address the  following aspects of the rulemaking process:    To the extent that information is available, how have changes in  requirements since 2003 affected the complexity, cost, and length of the  rulemaking process?", "How long do agencies take to issue rules?    What requirements must an agency comply with to issue a major rule?    What effect do agency interactions with OMB have on rulemaking?", "To address the first and second questions, we primarily relied on reviews  of 16 case studies and interviews with officials from regulatory agencies  and OMB. We chose a case-study approach because agency officials  informed us during initial meetings that little systematic information  existed within agencies on the time, staffing, and contracting costs  associated with the development of individual rules or the required  analyses that support rulemakings. To identify the rules for our case  studies, we relied on our Federal Rules Database. The database includes  information such as the type of rule (major or nonmajor), priority of the  rule (for example, whether it is a significant rule), and the publication date  of the rule. We drew a sample from final rules issued from January 2006  through May 2008, to increase the likelihood that the rules chosen were  affected by changes in regulatory requirements since 2003 and for which  the staff who were involved would be available to discuss the rulemaking  process. We randomly selected 16 major or other significant final rules  from executive branch agencies responsible for health, safety, and  environmental regulations and an independent regulatory agency for  purposes of comparison. We examined two case-study rules each from  the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) Office of Air a nd  Radiation (OAR) and Office of Water (OW), the Food and Drug  Administration\u2019s (FDA) Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER and Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN), and the  Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s (SEC) Division of Corporation  Finance (CF) and Division of Investment Management (IM). Although  these agencies and offices are not equivalent organizationally, we treate ) d  them as such for purposes of this report to obtain comparable volum major and significant final rules in our selection process. The agencies,  offices, and sample of rules that we assessed are not representative of all regulatory agencies and all rules.", "We reviewed the agencies\u2019 regulatory dockets for each rule selected using  a standardized data collection instrument and discussed what we found  with knowledgeable agency officials and OMB. We defined \u201cchanges in  requirements\u201d as changes that OMB identified as significant in its  September 2003 revision of OMB Circular No. A-4, which provides  guidance on conducting regulatory analysis, and also OMB\u2019s December  2004 Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review. These changes  were implemented since our 2003 report on OMB\u2019s role in the rulemaking  process.", "To answer the third question, we reviewed the statutory and executive  requirements broadly applicable to rulemaking. We also analyzed the 139  major rules, as defined by the Congressional Review Act (CRA), issued  from January 2006 through May 2008 to be consistent with the time period  used for selection of our case studies. To identify the rules, we again relied  on our Federal Rules Database. Based on our tests of the data in the  database, including confirming the quality control steps used to ensure  completeness of the database and tracing database information back to  source documents, we determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. To identify the requirements that  were discussed and that were triggered by the major rules, we reviewed  the relevant GAO major rule report on the rule and the published final  rule.", "To answer the fourth question, we analyzed the information collected  above and reviewed the dockets of the 12 selected case-study rules from  DOT, EPA, and FDA relying on the same basic methodology we previously  used to report on OMB\u2019s role in and affect on rulemaking\u2014reviewing  documents from agencies\u2019 and OMB\u2019s dockets and interviewing officials to  obtain information about the regulatory review process for selected rules.  We chose these rules because all were subject to review by OMB/OIRA  under Executive Order 12866 and the transparency requirements under the  order. The other 4 case-study rules were not subject to OIRA review  because SEC is an independent regulatory agency. As part of the fourth  question, you also asked us to review the status of GAO recommendations  from GAO-03-929 on improving the transparency of OIRA\u2019s regulatory  review process. To report on the status of those recommendations, we  relied on information from our annual update of open recommendations  and interviews with OMB officials.", "For reporting purposes, we discuss our findings on the first three  questions in objective one\u2014the effects of rulemaking requirements on  agencies\u2019 rulemaking processes, including the complexity, cost, and length  of their processes. Our findings related to the fourth question and updated  findings from our 2003 report are discussed in objective two\u2014the  transparency of OMB\u2019s role in the regulatory review process. We  conducted our review from August 2008 through February 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Regulatory agencies have authority and responsibility for developing and  issuing regulations. The basic process by which all federal agencies  develop and issue regulations is spelled out in the APA. This act  establishes procedures and broadly applicable federal requirements for  informal rulemaking, also known as notice and comment rulemaking.  Among other things, the APA generally requires agencies to publish a  notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. After giving  interested persons an opportunity to comment on the proposed rule by  providing \u201cwritten data, views, or arguments,\u201d the agency may then  publish the final rule. In addition to the requirements under the APA, an  agency may also need to comply with requirements imposed by other  statutes. The APA has been in place for more than 60 years, but most other  statutory requirements on rulemaking have been imposed more recently.", "OMB is responsible for the coordinated review of agency rulemaking to  ensure that regulations are consistent with applicable law, the President\u2019s  priorities, and the principles set forth in executive orders, and that  decisions made by one agency do not conflict with the policies or actions  taken or planned by another agency. OMB also provides guidance to  agencies. Some form of centralized review of rules by the Executive Office  of the President has existed for over 30 years. OIRA was created within  OMB by the PRA and given substantive responsibilities for reviewing and  approving agencies\u2019 information collection requests. Since 1981, various  executive orders also gave OIRA substantive regulatory review  responsibilities. OIRA\u2019s current regulatory review responsibilities are  detailed in Executive Order 12866 related to regulatory planning and  review. The order states that OIRA is to be the \u201crepository of expertise  concerning regulatory issues.\u201d", "Under Executive Order 12866, OIRA reviews agencies\u2019 significant  regulatory actions and is generally required to complete its review within  90 days after an agency formally submits a draft regulation. Each agency  provides OIRA a list of its planned regulatory actions, indicating those that  the agency believes are significant. After receipt of this list, the  Administrator of OIRA may also notify the agency that OIRA has  determined that a planned regulation is a significant regulatory action  within the meaning of the Executive Order. The order defines significant  regulatory actions as those that are likely to result in a rule that may  1.  have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or  adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the  economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public  health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;  2.  create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action  taken or planned by another agency;  3.  materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees,  or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or  4.  raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the  President\u2019s priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order  12866.", "The order further directs executive branch agencies to conduct a  regulatory analysis for economically significant regulations (generally  those rules that have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or  more). OIRA historical data show that since 1994 (the first full calendar  year that Executive Order 12866 was in effect), approximately 15 percent  of the rules that OIRA reviewed were economically significant. For other  significant rules, the order requires agencies to provide an assessment of  the potential costs and benefits of the rule. The executive order also  contains several transparency provisions that require both OIRA and  agencies to disclose certain information about the OIRA review process.  For example, the order requires agencies to publicly identify substantive  changes made to the draft at OIRA\u2019s suggestion, and it requires OIRA to  disclose information about communications between OIRA and persons  not employed by the executive branch pertinent to rules under OIRA\u2019s  review. The transparency requirements are discussed in more detail later  in this report.", "In addition to the responsibilities that OIRA exercises, OMB also provides  guidance to agencies on regulatory requirements. In 2003, for example,  OMB issued revised analytical guidelines for agencies to use in assessing  the regulatory impact of economically significant regulations in OMB  Circular No. A-4. In issuing the guidelines, OMB cited several significant  changes from its previous economic guidance. They included placing a  greater emphasis on cost-effectiveness analysis, using formal probability  analysis to assess uncertainty for rules with more than a billion-dollar  annual impact on the economy, and conducting a more systematic  evaluation of qualitative as well as quantified benefits and costs. In  addition, OMB\u2019s guidelines recommend that agencies estimate net benefits  using a range of discount rates instead of a single discount rate. In 2004,  OMB issued its Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review, which  established governmentwide guidance for conducting peer reviews of  government science documents. The bulletin directs agencies, including  independent regulatory agencies, to subject \u201cinfluential scientific  information,\u201d such as original data and formal analytic models used in  regulatory impact assessments, to an appropriate level of peer review.", "New administrations generally reexamine the rulemaking process and  OMB\u2019s role in the process. Most recently, in a memorandum of January 30,  2009, President Obama directed the Director of OMB, in consultation with  representatives of regulatory agencies, to produce within 100 days a set of  recommendations for a new executive order on federal regulatory  review. The memorandum stated that the recommendations should offer  suggestions for, among other things, the relationship between OIRA and  the agencies; provide guidance on disclosure and transparency; encourage  public participation in agency regulatory processes; offer suggestions on  the role of cost-benefit analysis; address the role of distributional  considerations, fairness, and concern for the interests of future  generations; identify methods of ensuring that regulatory review does not  produce undue delay; clarify the role of the behavioral sciences in  formulating regulatory policy; and identify the best tools for achieving  public goals through the regulatory process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Limited Data on the Time and Resources Used to Address Regulatory Requirements in Their Rulemaking Processes", "paragraphs": ["All agencies\u2019 rulemaking processes share three basic steps or phases:  initiation of rulemaking actions, development of proposed rules, and  development of final rules. Built into agencies\u2019 rulemaking processes are  opportunities for internal and external deliberations and reviews. Figure 1  provides an overview of these regulatory development steps.", "During initiation, agency officials identify issues that may potentially result  in a rulemaking. Potential rulemakings may result from statutory  requirements or issues identified through external sources (for example,  public hearings or petitions from the regulated community) or internal  sources (for example, management agendas). During this phase, agencies  gather information that would allow them to determine whether a  rulemaking is needed and to identify potential regulatory options. At this  time, the agencies will also identify the resources needed for the  rulemaking and may draft concept documents to present to agency  management that summarize the issues, present the regulatory options,  and identify needed resources. Agency officials reported that this initial  work on a rule is of indeterminate length and sometimes constitutes a  major portion of the process. While the point at which a rulemaking  officially commences may vary by agency and rule, as a general matter,  rulemaking begins only after management receives, reviews, and approves  the concept document. At the latest, according to OIRA, the rulemaking  will officially commence when agency officials assign a Regulation  Identifier Number (RIN) for the proposed rule.", "The second phase of the rulemaking process starts when an agency begins  developing the proposed rule. During this phase, an agency will draft the  rule, including the preamble (which is the portion of the rule that informs  the public of the supporting reasons and purpose of the final rule) and the  rule language. The agency will also begin to address analytical and  procedural requirements in this phase. Agency officials pointed out that  these initial analyses form the basis for other analyses completed later in  the process, including those prepared to address statutory and executive  order requirements. Agency officials stated that development of a rule is a  coordinated effort, with economists, lawyers, and policy and subject  matter experts contributing to individual rulemakings. Also built into this  phase are opportunities for internal and external deliberations and  reviews, including official management approval. OIRA may be involved  informally at any point during the process. For each rule identified by the  agency as, or determined by the Administrator of OIRA to be, a significant  regulatory action, the agency submits the rule to OIRA for formal review\u2014 including the coordination of interagency review. After OIRA completes its  review and the agency incorporates resulting changes, the agency  publishes the proposed rule in the Federal Register for public comments.", "In the third phase of the process, the development of the final rule, the  agency repeats, as needed, the steps used during the development of the  proposed rule. Once the comment period closes, the agency responds to  the comments either by modifying the rule to incorporate the comments or  by addressing the comments in the final rule. This phase also includes  opportunities for internal and external review. Again, if the agency  determines that the rule is significant or at OIRA\u2019s request, the agency  submits the rule to OIRA for review before publication of the final rule. In  the event that OIRA\u2019s review results in a change to the final rule, the  agency will revise the rule before publishing it in the Federal Register.  Officials noted that addressing analytical and procedural requirements is  faster with a draft of the proposed rule in hand, but analyses may need to  be modified if public comments change the rule substantially. The final  rule as published in the Federal Register includes the date that the rule  becomes effective.", "While the agencies share these basic process steps, there are inter- and  intra-agency variations in the management of the rulemaking process. For  example, EPA\u2019s OW generally designates one rulemaking team member as  the point of contact through the development of the rule. Officials at FDA  stated that their point of contact may change during the course of the  rulemaking based on the rule\u2019s development phase; as the office working  on the rule within the agency changes so does the point of contact.  Agencies also have differing numbers of required internal reviews, and  they may complete tasks within a phase in a different sequence."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Identified Milestones for Regulatory Development", "paragraphs": ["Officials we met with described agency-specific processes for regulatory  development and addressing the procedural and analytical requirements  that applied to their respective rulemakings.

Officials also identified some milestones common to the rulemaking  process that apply across the federal government, such as publishing the  proposed and final rule. In addition, officials at the agencies we spoke  with identified the following agency-specific internal milestones in their  regulatory development process.", "DOT officials at FAA and NHTSA identified common milestones, including  development of a draft concept, management reviews within  administrations, review by the Secretary\u2019s Office, and external review.", "EPA identified 14 milestones for nonroutine rulemakings from initiation to  publication of the proposed rule, including assigning a working group,  development and approval of an Analytic Blueprint and management  reviews. After the proposed rule is published, EPA tracks an additional 4  to 5 milestones to develop the final rule.", "FDA officials emphasized that regulatory development is similar  throughout FDA. CFSAN and CDER used milestones such as assigning a  working group, drafting, and conducting analyses and management  clearances.", "SEC officials stated that CF and IM identified as common milestones  generation (typically including public input), drafting, and approval by the  commissioners.", "During the course of our review, only DOT provided us with data that  showed it routinely tracked these milestones. In comments on our draft  report, EPA and FDA subsequently provided some documentation and  data that showed that these agencies also routinely tracked milestones.  However, we had requested this information during our review to address  our second research question, but the information was not forthcoming.  Also, they did not provide this information at the conclusion of our review  either in response to our statements of facts to the agencies or at our exit  conference with the agencies. Because this information was not provided  at the time of our review, we did not have the opportunity to discuss how  the information is used, whether it is useful, and, most importantly, if it  could be used to respond to our report objectives. We did not audit the  new information provided because of an approaching deadline for OMB to  provide recommendations to the President for a new executive order on  federal agency regulatory review.", "DOT sets target dates for major milestones, such as when the rule is  scheduled to move to OIRA for review. The agency uses the Rulemaking  Management System to monitor both the target and actual dates for these  major milestones in the development of rules for internal management  decision-making purposes. This allows DOT regulatory development staff  and managers to identify a rule\u2019s status and determine if the rule is on or  behind schedule, based on target dates. Some of the information captured  in the system includes the stage of the rulemaking (proposed rule, final  rule), a schedule of milestones with target and actual dates, and an  explanation for any delay. For significant regulatory actions, DOT makes  some milestone tracking information publicly available through the Report  on DOT Significant Rulemakings available on the agency\u2019s web site.", "Among the objectives that DOT officials attributed to their tracking and  reporting efforts were that they provide opportunities to assess their  schedule estimates and improve internal and external accountability. An  official noted, for example, that tracking and posting the information  helped the agency identify best estimates of schedules.", "EPA uses an internal tracking database\u2014Rule and Policy Information and  Development System (RAPIDS)\u2014that contains both projected and actual  dates for meeting major milestones in rule development. This database  provides background information and a timetable on each stage of the  rulemaking, including a schedule of the milestones with both projected  and actual dates. EPA uses the data in RAPIDS to develop management  reports used by EPA managers and executives as a planning and tracking  tool. The reports also serve as a tool to improve the regulatory  development process. EPA makes this tracking information available to  the public on a quarterly basis.", "FDA also tracks regulatory milestones through its Federal Register  Document Tracking System (FRDTS). FRDTS is an internal, Web-based  integrated system that allows FDA to track the preparation and approval  process of documents to be submitted to the Federal Register for  publication. Tracking the rulemaking approval process is done for all  rulemakings, however the system only tracks milestones for the latter  stages of the rulemaking\u2019s development and clearing process. FDA  management uses the information in FRDTS as one tool in the  management of its regulatory development process.", "SEC did not have such systematic tracking and reporting of its scheduled  and actual regulatory milestones. However, implementing such a system is  consistent with standards for internal control. According to the  standards, for an agency to run and control its operations, it must have  relevant, reliable information relating to external as well as internal  events. Moreover, an acknowledged expert on the regulatory process has  stated that a myriad of formal requirements and political expectations  requires sophisticated management of the rulemaking process. Among  other functional requirements, he noted that scheduling and budgeting for  rulemaking are useful tools for officials to manage regulation development  and control the resources needed to complete a rule. Monitoring and  assessing actual performance against planned targets, identifying reasons  for missed targets, and adjusting resource requirements to fit conditions  based on actual experience are among the ways that agencies could use  their rulemaking plans and milestones as management control and  accountability tools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Length of Time Required to Issue a Rule Varies by Agency and Rule with Few Common Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["We found variation in length of time required for the development and  issuance of final rules both within and among agencies. In general, agency  officials agreed that the publication of the final rule marked the end of the  rulemaking process. In contrast, identifying when a rulemaking begins is  less definite. All agencies identified milestones that marked the initiation  of a rulemaking in their agencies, but also asserted that agency staff  sometimes worked on certain issues related to the rulemaking years  before commencement of the actual rulemaking, either as part of earlier,  related rulemakings or policy development for the rule. Based on agency  milestones, officials we spoke with at three of the four agencies provided  estimates for the length of time for an average rulemaking. FDA officials  estimated that a straightforward rulemaking may take up to 3\u00bd to nearly 4  years from initiation to final publication. DOT officials estimated  approximately 1-\u00bd years from the end of the public comment period  following the publication of the proposed rule to final rule. SEC officials  estimated that some rules are completed within 6 months of publication of  a proposed rule to final rule. EPA officials declined to provide an estimate  for an average rulemaking at their agency, stating that there is too much  variation. However, some agency officials emphasized that the average  time required to issue any given rule could vary from these estimates, as  illustrated by the 16 case-study rules we reviewed (see fig. 2).", "Using two rulemaking milestones common among federal agencies\u2014 publication in the Federal Register of the proposed rule and publication of  the final rule\u2014the length of time for our 16 case-study rules ranged from  approximately half a year (SEC\u2019s Mutual Fund Data Reporting rule) to  nearly 5 years (FDA\u2019s Physician Labeling rule). As an illustration of the  time investment in regulatory development\u2014as measured from agency- specific internal milestones\u2014the entire rulemaking process for the same  two rules ranged from slightly over 1 year to 13 years, respectively. Overall  the average time from initiation to final publication of a rule for our 16  case-study rules was just over 4 years, with the average time for the 4 SEC  rules just over 1 year, the DOT rules taking an average of just over 3 years,  and the EPA and FDA rules taking longer than the overall average at 5-1/2  and 7 years, respectively. For most of our case study rules, the time to  develop the proposed rule was at least as much as the time between  publication of the proposed and final rules. We also found that the  complexity or magnitude of a major rule also did not explain all or most  variation, as some case-study rules that were not major took nearly as long  or longer to be published. (For more detailed information about the  timelines for each of the case-study rules, see app. II.)", "During our review we identified multiple factors that influence the time  needed to issue a rule, including  the complexity of the issues addressed by the rulemakings;    prioritizations set by agency management that can change when other  priorities, such as new congressional mandates, arise; and  the amount of internal and external review required at the different phases  of the rulemaking process.", "Some agency officials said that rulemaking for complex topics or for rules  that raise new issues typically takes longer to complete than for routine  rules. Rules that are a management priority or have a statutory or judicial  deadline may move more quickly through the rulemaking process, while  other rules may be set aside as agency staff members work on other  things. Also, rules that require OIRA and interagency review typically need  additional time for the external review process and, according to some  agency officials, trigger additional internal scrutiny. The priorities and the  pace of rulemaking have also been affected during transitions in  presidential administrations. Since 1948, the amount of rulemaking activity  has increased in the last months of every outgoing administration when  the party in control of the White House changed. During every recent  transition involving a change in the party controlling the White House  since 1981, this has been followed by the incoming administration  recommending that agencies delay effective dates for reconsideration of  rules published at the end of the previous administration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Have Limited Information on Resources Used in Regulatory Development", "paragraphs": ["There is little rule-specific tracking of resources used in regulatory  development. Agency officials were unable to identify the staffing or other  resources (such as contracting costs associated with preparing expert  analyses or convening public meetings) for regulatory development for all  rules or for the limited number of case-study rules. As noted above,  internal control standards call for relevant, reliable and timely  information. Regarding staffing, such management information was not  available from agencies we audited. Officials were able to generally  describe how they staff rulemaking, noting that rulemaking is a  coordinated effort, with many individuals from throughout the agency  contributing to specific rulemakings. However, none of the agencies  routinely tracked staff time associated with rulemakings or were able to  provide records of staff time devoted to case-study rulemakings or  supporting analyses. Moreover, agency officials stated that because many  staff within the agencies with different job functions\u2014attorneys,  economists, programs staff, as well as regulatory developers\u2014contribute  to individual rules, they could not provide after-the-fact estimates.", "However, based on their experiences, the agencies\u2019 officials identified  ways they have explored using existing agency information for purposes  of improving management of the rulemaking process. For example,  according to a DOT official responsible for rulemaking, having reliable  data on how long it takes to publish a proposed rule and identifying where  the time is spent is critically important for reengineering the process. The  official also pointed out that while the agency knows that the time of some  support staff is all devoted to rulemaking, there is no data for tracking  core program offices\u2019 involvement in technical and lead roles in the  rulemaking process. The official noted that these data could help  determine how much of certain staff members\u2019 time is reasonable and how  many additional staff days would be needed to speed up the process. EPA  officials stated that they use the tracking information in the agency\u2019s  RAPIDS system to help identify best practices as well as identify those  actions that need corrective measures. FDA officials stated that they track  the rulemaking process from a project management perspective.  According to these officials, this allows the agency to identify areas that  appear to \u201clogjam\u201d the process and to develop mechanisms that would  improve the rulemaking process. In addition, FDA officials stated that  agency management meets to discuss the major milestones reported in the  FRDTS to identify areas of improvement in the regulatory development  process. SEC officials also track some data from a project management  perspective. Officials stated that the former SEC Chairman was interested  in knowing how long it takes to conduct economic analyses. During the  course of our review, EPA, FDA, and SEC did not document these claims  or provide specific examples of how this information was used to improve  their rulemaking process. However, in response to our draft report, the  EPA and FDA provided both documentation and examples to support the  information provided above.", "Agency officials described additional details about their tracking efforts  and the limitations of this information. One DOT agency, FAA, is working  on a system, called Labor Distribution Reporting (LDR) that allows all  FAA managers and employees to better understand staff resources  required for achieving agency goals and objectives. However, using LDR to  assess the staff time devoted to rulemaking has proven challenging for  FAA officials responsible for rulemaking activity. Those officials said that  the data generated by LDR have not been reliable and the information  does not necessarily track rulemaking activity as distinct from other staff  responsibilities. Additionally, attempts to aggregate LDR information by  rule proved unwieldy as these costs are imbedded in agency-wide systems  that capture information at a higher level and for multiple purposes. FAA  is reengineering its use of LDR by consolidating and simplifying the codes  used with the goal of providing managers with reliable information on how  staff time is used and how it contributes to meeting agency performance  targets. SEC\u2019s CF also tried to do more detailed staff time coding for each  rulemaking project but has now instituted more generic tracking by  category of activity. A CF official also pointed out that CF\u2019s coding does  not cover all groups within SEC that contribute to rulemaking projects.  Another SEC official from the Division of Trading and Markets identified a  similar tracking challenge. Although the division has specific rulemaking  offices organized by subject area, not all the work done by these offices is  related to rulemaking.", "Similarly, there is limited information available regarding contract costs.  At three of the agencies in our case study\u2014DOT, FDA, and SEC\u2014 analytical and procedural requirements typically are addressed in-house  by agency staff. One agency, EPA, regularly supplements in-house staff  responsible for regulatory development by hiring contractors to conduct  analyses as part of the regulatory development process. The agency does  not track these costs by rulemaking; however, EPA officials were able to  identify some of the costs associated with regulatory development for four  case-study rules. For the two major OW rules\u2014the Surface Water  Treatment 2 rule and the Disinfection Byproducts 2 rule\u2014the costs related  to expert advisory panels, public meetings, travel, and regulatory analyses  for the microbial pathogens and disinfection byproducts cluster of rules  (that includes a total of seven rules including the two case study rules)  were more than $13 million. As mentioned above, EPA did not track the  costs of each of these rules separately throughout the course of rule  development. Identified costs for the two nonmajor rules\u2014the Ethylene  Oxide Emissions rule and the Hazardous Air Pollutants rule\u2014were less,  $100,000 and $780,000, respectively. EPA officials told us that funding for  regulatory analyses comes from a central budget within the program  developing the rule.", "As stated earlier, while it is difficult to pinpoint when the initiation phase  of rulemaking begins, agency officials reported that developing proposed  rules constitutes a significant portion of regulatory development, so that  much of the resource investment in a rulemaking occurs prior to  publication of the proposed rule. For example, NHTSA\u2019s Fuel Economy- Light Trucks rule was just one in a series of related rulemakings that dated  back to the 1970s, informed by decades of work by that agency. Also,  EPA\u2019s Disinfection Byproducts 2 rule and the Surface Water Treatment 2  rule were based on the work of an expert panel convened under the  Federal Advisory Committee Act years before these rules were proposed.  Another example mentioned by EPA officials was a stormwater  management rule for the oil and gas industry that supplemented and was  partially based on an earlier nationwide, multi-industry rulemaking.", "Reviews of published rules or rulemaking dockets provide little  information on the resources and level of effort needed for agencies to  comply with specific rulemaking requirements. As pointed out by DOT  officials, neither the text of the rule nor the materials in the agency\u2019s  rulemaking docket might indicate all of the resources and the decision- making process that the agency performed to make such determinations.  Specifically, they noted that dockets would not necessarily include copies  of the underlying analyses if the agency concluded that the rule did not  trigger that requirement. Also, each requirement that a rule triggers does  not necessarily require preparation of a separate analysis. Agencies can  use some analyses to address more than one requirement (for example,  using one benefit-cost analysis to address multiple analytical  requirements).", "Even if costs and resources were tracked at the individual rule level, the  resources used to meet general rulemaking requirements would still need  to be captured to provide a complete picture. Rulemaking is an integral  part of agency business, and it would be hard to separate all that is done  for rulemaking from what also contributes to other operational and policy  decisions. Further, given the many other demands on scarce agency  resources, the resources that would be needed to develop reliable tracking  data on individual rules or requirements must be weighed against other  investments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many of the Rules GAO Reviewed Triggered Few of the Broadly Applicable Rulemaking Requirements", "paragraphs": ["When issuing major rules, agencies must generally comply with the APA  and a number of other broadly applicable procedural and analytical  requirements specified in law.

EPA and the Occupational Safety and  Health Administration must also comply with a requirement to convene a  small business advocacy review panel under the Small Business  Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act if their rules would have a  significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities\u2014 business or governmental.

(App.  I provides additional information about these requirements.)", "Our review of the 139 major rules published from January 2006 through  May 2008 showed that many of the procedural and analytical requirements  that generally apply to the agencies were not triggered by specific rules.  An agency may not need to include specific analyses if the substance of  the rule or exceptions, exclusions, and thresholds in the requirement lead  the agency to determine that the requirement was not triggered by a  specific rule. For example, if the substance of a rule includes no new  information collections, the agency would not have to estimate burden  hours under the PRA. Exceptions and exclusions can be either categorical  or statute specific. As an example of a categorical exception, the APA  notice-and-comment requirements do not apply to any rule regarding a  military or foreign affairs function of the United States. Also, the RFA and  UMRA requirements do not apply if a rule was exempt from the APA  notice-and-comment requirements. An example of a statute-specific  exemption is section 1601(c) of the Farm Security and Rural Investment  Act of 2002 that generally exempted rules issued by the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Commodity Credit Corporation from the APA and the PRA  requirements. The applicability of certain requirements is also limited by  threshold provisions. For example, agencies only need to prepare UMRA  \u201cwritten statements\u201d for rules that the agencies believe include a federal  intergovernmental or private sector mandate that may result in  expenditures of $100 million or more (adjusted for inflation) in any year.  Taken as a whole, an agency may need to work through a series of  determinations for each rule under each requirement regarding substance,  exceptions, and thresholds.", "In the 139 major rules we reviewed, the agencies mentioned at least 29  different broadly applicable requirements, but most rules actually  triggered only a handful of the requirements. Our review of the major rules  showed that in addition to the procedural requirements under the APA and  the CRA, the only analytical requirements triggered by 45 percent or more  of all rules were the PRA, the RFA, and Executive Order 12866.  Collectively, however, the requirements resulted in agencies providing at  least some information on the costs, benefits, or both associated with 91  percent of the major rules. Agencies also frequently cited the UMRA and  Executive Order 13132 related to federalism, but the rules seldom  triggered those requirements.

Except for the rules promulgated by SEC,  all of the rules discussed UMRA and Executive Order 13132 requirements;  however, only 4 rules triggered an UMRA analysis and 3 a federalism  analysis. The 4 case-study rules from DOT, EPA, and FDA that were  economically significant rules also included quantitative cost-benefit  analyses required under Executive Order 12866.

For example, FDA had routinely circulated  the regulatory impact analyses of economically significant rules for peer  review before submitting the rules to OMB prior to the 2004 issuance of  the Peer Review Bulletin and while these regulatory impact analyses are  excluded from the requirements of the Bulletin, FDA continues to  circulate them for peer review. FDA officials agreed that the revised OMB  Circular No. A-4 helped to clarify expectations for their economic analyses  and in some cases resulted in less time needed for OMB review and  greater confidence in the regulatory choices.", "Initially incorporating certain aspects of the new requirement for formal  probability analysis to assess uncertainty lengthened the rulemaking  process for one agency. NHTSA officials reported that prior to issuance of  revised Circular No. A-4\u2014which requires formal probability analysis to  assess uncertainty for rules with more than a billion-dollar annual impact  on the economy\u2014NHTSA used a simpler form of uncertainty analysis,  called sensitivity analysis, rather than the more formal probability  analysis. When NHTSA performed its first probability analysis under OMB  Circular No. A-4, it took several weeks to complete and required  contracting resources outside the agency\u2014not a typical practice for  NHTSA. In addition, to meet its statutory deadline, the agency sent the rule  to OIRA for review before completing the probability analysis. In contrast,  EPA had incorporated probability analysis into its regulatory development  process on a case-by-case basis prior to the issuance of Circular No. A-4  and therefore did not find that requirement challenging.", "Officials from case-study agencies identified two long-standing analytical  and procedural requirements, the PRA regarding information collections  and the RFA regarding analysis of rules\u2019 effects on small entities, as having  had more significant effects on time and resources than the more recent  requirements. Some officials said that these requirements add time to the  rulemaking process and may even work at cross-purposes during the  course of regulatory development. Agency officials at FDA and SEC  reported that compliance with the PRA information collection  requirements may add a year or more to the timeline of regulatory  development. As a result, rather than gather new information to support a  rulemaking, agency officials will sometimes rely on existing information,  information available from a more limited number of sources, or  information gathered through public notices. This can make it more  difficult to determine the effect of a regulation on small entities that may  not be represented by a small sample of interested parties or respond to  public notices. FDA officials stated that the agency posts on its Web site a  \u201cDear Colleague\u201d letter alerting the small business community to the  rulemakings listed in the semi-annual Unified Agenda and Regulatory Plan  that may affect small business. This letter explains how to contact the  agency and encourages small businesses to become involved early in the  rulemaking process.

Rules in which the most significant changes affected  the scope, impact, or estimated costs and benefits of the rules as originally  submitted to OIRA. Usually, these changes were made to the regulatory  language that would appear in the Code of Federal Regulations and is  legally binding.

Nonetheless, some of the documentation on OIRA\u2019s changes was very  clear, but in other cases additional efforts were required to interpret the  information. As we found in 2003, the agencies did not always clearly  attribute changes made at the suggestion of OIRA, and agencies\u2019  interpretations were not necessarily consistent regarding what constitutes  a substantive change that should be documented to comply with the  executive order transparency requirements.

Reexamine OIRA\u2019s current policy that only documents exchanged by  OIRA branch chiefs and above need to be disclosed because most of  the documents that are exchanged while rules are under review at  OIRA are exchanged between agency staff and OIRA desk officers.  4.  Establish procedures whereby either OIRA or the agencies disclose the  reason why rules are withdrawn from OIRA review.  5.  Define the types of \u201csubstantive\u201d changes during the OIRA review  process that agencies should disclose as including not only changes  made to the regulatory text but also other, noneditorial changes that  could ultimately affect the rules\u2019 application (for example,  explanations supporting the choice of one alternative over another and  solicitations of comments on the estimated benefits and costs of  regulatory options).  6.  Instruct agencies to put information about changes made in a rule after  submission for OIRA\u2019s review and those made at OIRA\u2019s suggestion or  recommendation in the agencies\u2019 public rulemaking dockets, and to do  so within a reasonable period after the rules have been published.  7.

Other issues covered  by our 2003 recommendations\u2014such as OIRA informal reviews and  disclosing why rules are withdrawn from OIRA review\u2014did not arise  during this review, but this may reflect the nature of the specific rules we  reviewed and our more limited sample of case studies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal regulatory agencies issue many rules to ensure public health and  safety, protect the environment, and facilitate the effective functioning of  financial markets, among other goals. Because these rules can affect so  many aspects of citizens\u2019 lives, it is crucial that rules be carefully  developed and considered and that rulemaking procedures be effective  and transparent. To further such goals, Congresses and Presidents have  placed many procedural and analytical requirements on the rulemaking  process over the years. While we and others have reported on agencies\u2019  implementation of individual requirements, there has been little analysis of  the cumulative effects these requirements have on agencies\u2019 rulemaking  processes.", "Our study of broadly applicable requirements illustrated the difficulties of  evaluating the effects of regulatory requirements on the rulemaking  process with limited data. To the extent that agencies had information for  selected rules, it showed considerable variation in the time required for  issuing final rules that could not be explained by the number of regulatory  requirements, few of which were triggered. Moreover, the complexity or  magnitude of a major rule also did not explain all or most variation, as  some case-study rules were not major and took nearly as long or longer to  be published. This raises the question of what factors can account for the  variations in rule development. While our findings point to better use of  existing estimates and plans to identify opportunities to improve the  rulemaking process, agencies also recognized more can be done and, in  some cases, have taken steps to answer this question.", "We found that early in their rulemaking processes each agency identified  the key milestones it needed to accomplish to produce a final rule. During  the course of our review, only DOT provided data that it routinely tracked  these milestones and reported internally and externally on the status of  milestones for development of the agency\u2019s significant rules. However, in  comments on our draft report, EPA and FDA subsequently provided some  documentation and data on their tracking and reporting of milestones.   Although there is no right time for how long a rulemaking should take,  monitoring actual versus estimated performance enables agency managers  to identify steps in the rulemaking process that account for substantial  development time and provides information necessary to further evaluate  whether the time was well spent. Although not all factors are within an  agency\u2019s control, some are. Agency officials we spoke with identified  several potential benefits to monitoring and reporting, including better  scheduling and increased internal and external accountability. This is also  consistent with the internal control standard that an agency must have  relevant, reliable information relating to external as well as internal  events. Additionally, officials in three of the four agencies we audited said  they would benefit from a better understanding of how staff resources are  used, even though agencies\u2019 efforts so far have produced limited results.  Information on only one element in the rulemaking process\u2014length of  time\u2014cannot answer whether an agency is managing well. However, such  information can provide insights into the process, such as when it  contributed to our efforts to determine the relative burden of various  regulatory requirements.", "Our review of major and case-study rules indicated that the majority of the  rules triggered only a few of the rulemaking requirements. The  requirements that rules most often triggered are among the longest  standing and broadly applicable\u2014the PRA, the RFA, and centralized OIRA  review under Executive Order 12866. The PRA and the RFA generally  apply to all agencies and rules, and officials from each of the agencies  where we conducted case studies cited those requirements as ones that  consistently added time to the rulemaking process and required  investments of agency resources. Similarly, under Executive Order 12866,  we observed that a relatively small portion of rules submitted to OIRA for  review have economic consequences significant enough to trigger the  most rigorous analytical requirements, so any burden of compliance with  those requirements is not very widespread. The majority of rules  submitted for OIRA review (around 85 percent historically) are significant  for reasons other than their economic impact.", "The case-study agencies generally met the executive order\u2019s requirements  to disclose materials they provided for OIRA\u2019s review and substantive  changes made during OIRA\u2019s review. For those case-study agencies and  rules subject to OIRA review, some agency practices were more effective  than others in communicating review results. Transparency problems that  we identified in the past persist, such as incomplete attribution of changes  and inconsistent definitions of substantive changes among and within  agencies. Also, unlike when addressing other regulatory requirements\u2014 where agencies typically note in the published rule whether the rule  triggered the requirements\u2014the agencies did not clearly identify in their  final rules when substantive changes had been made during the OIRA  review period.

For example, regarding  FDA\u2019s proposal to narrow the scope to only economically significant rules,  in this report we note that about 85 percent of all significant rules are not  economically significant, so such a limitation would drop the bulk of the  agency\u2019s regulatory activity. Further, with regard to FDA\u2019s point that it is  uncertain what rules OMB will deem significant, in this report we stated  that under Executive Order 12866 the agency, not OMB, has the primary  responsibility to first identify which rules are significant. Therefore, FDA  should be aware of many if not most of the rules that are deemed  significant in its inventory. For those rules that OMB deems significant  only at the latter stages of rulemaking, we recognize that tracking might  have to begin at that stage. Regarding FDA\u2019s second point, we did not  recommend one particular system and recognize that the information in  FRDTS provides tracking data on milestones. However, we note that these  data are limited to the latter stages of the rulemaking process. Because our  review showed that the earlier developmental stages of a rule could be a  significant portion of time spent in regulatory development, there is value  in also tracking milestones in the earlier stages. Regarding FDA\u2019s third  point, it is still important to report some information externally as well as  internally to improve the transparency and accountability of the agency\u2019s  rulemaking process. Further, we believe that FDA\u2019s concern about the  impact that reporting some information externally could have on agency  resources is overstated. None of the agencies we met with during this  review identified responding to public inquiries as a major factor affecting  resources and timeliness. Also, there is nothing that precludes agencies  from providing reasons for delays when externally reporting this  information to reduce the volume of public inquiries. Therefore, we kept  this recommendation addressed to FDA.", "With regard to our second recommendation that agencies should also  evaluate actual performance versus the targeted milestones, FDA stated  that the agency is already engaged in quality improvement efforts for its  rulemaking process. Specifically, FDA said that its Policy Council has  quarterly meetings with the agency components and the agency  periodically reviews its rulemaking processes to see if changes are needed.  Also, FDA noted that 12 such reviews have been completed since 1981,  and identified two recent pilot projects resulting from these reviews.", "However, although FDA said the agency conducted general evaluations  and provided some examples, FDA did not provide information showing  that the agency had specifically evaluated the issue highlighted in our  recommendation. To the extent that FDA has not, we would still  recommend that they specifically evaluate the reasons for any  discrepancies between projected and actual milestones for their  significant rulemakings. Therefore, we kept this recommendation  addressed to FDA. We revised the body of the report where appropriate in  response to the additional information FDA provided in its comments.", "Regarding our recommendation that agencies routinely track major  milestones and report internally and externally when major milestones are  reached, EPA clarified that the agency currently tracks key milestones  associated with the rulemaking process and reports this information  internally and externally. Specifically, EPA cited RAPIDS, an internal  tracking system that monitors cross-agency involvement and senior  management reviews. EPA also cited three primary sources for external  reporting, specifically its use of Action Initiation Lists, the Semiannual  Regulatory Agenda, and a quarterly report which they subsequently  identified as EPAStat.", "Based on the new information and subsequent documentation that we  requested from EPA in response to the agency\u2019s comments, we concur that  EPA has a tracking system and internal and external reporting  mechanisms that appear to address our recommendation. Therefore, we  removed this recommendation to EPA. For example, EPA\u2019s RAPIDS tracks  information on numerous milestones on all phases of the rulemaking  process. Further, RAPIDS tracks information on rules that are both  economically significant and significant. Similarly, with regard to internal  and external reporting, EPA cited three main sources the agency uses for  external reporting of milestones. We modified the body of the report to  incorporate the new information. We note, however, that we had  requested this information during our review and, because the information  was not provided at the time of our review, we did not have the  opportunity to discuss how the information is used, whether it is useful,  and, most importantly, if it could be used to respond to our report  objectives. We did not audit the new information provided because of the  approaching deadline for OMB to provide recommendations to the  President for a new executive order on federal agency regulatory review.", "While not specifically addressing our second recommendation that  agencies should also evaluate actual performance versus the targeted  milestones, EPA comments indicated that agency executives and  managers routinely meet to review milestones on key regulations and  review program performance. Specifically, EPA noted that actions that are  completed on time or early are used by the agency as examples of best  practices and actions that are off-track are identified early and corrective  steps are taken to expedite their completion. Because we were unaware of  this system or its use at the time of our review, we could not determine  whether EPA specifically evaluated discrepancies between projected and  actual milestones to determine reasons why and took corrective actions.  No evidence was provided to draw a conclusion. Therefore, we kept this  recommendation addressed to EPA.", "With regard to our four recommendations to OMB to more consistently  implement the Executive Order 12866 requirement that agencies provide  information to the public in a complete, clear, and simple manner, OMB  stated that these recommendations have merit and warrant further  consideration. In particular, OMB stated that it will give full consideration  to the report and its recommendations as the agency finalizes its  recommendations to the President for a new Executive Order on  regulatory review. OMB also said that the report will remind rulemaking  agencies of their responsibility to identify in a complete, clear, and simple  manner the substantive changes between the draft rule submitted to OIRA  for review and the action subsequently announced, and to identify those  changes in the regulatory action that were made at the suggestion or  recommendation of OIRA.", "We also received technical comments and clarifications which we  incorporated into this report, where appropriate. EPA provided a  substantive technical comment regarding our classifications of the level of  OIRA changes for three of the case study rules. In light of the clarifying  comments EPA provided, we revised our classification of the Ethylene  Oxide Emissions rule from \u201csignificant changes\u201d to \u201cother material  changes.\u201d However we did not reclassify the other two EPA rules because  the changes suggested would not be consistent with the methodology and  criteria we used in this and prior reviews of the OIRA regulatory review  process.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
