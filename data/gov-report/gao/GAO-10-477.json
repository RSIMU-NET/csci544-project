This raises concerns about fiscal strain on the sector. To provide information on nonprofits' indirect cost reimbursement, especially when funding flows through entities such as state and local governments, GAO was asked to review, for selected grants and nonprofits, (1) how indirect cost terminology and classification vary, (2) how indirect costs are reimbursed, and (3) if gaps occur between indirect costs incurred and reimbursed, steps taken to bridge gaps. GAO selected six Departments of Health and Human Services and Housing and Urban Development grants and 17 nonprofits in Louisiana, Maryland, and Wisconsin. GAO selected these agencies for their historical relationship with nonprofits. GAO reviewed policies and documents governing indirect costs and interviewed relevant officials. GAO also reviewed research on nonprofits' indirect costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Depending on the grant program, nonprofits may be reimbursed for indirect costs (generally costs such as rent or utilities), administrative costs (generally cost activities such as accounting or personnel), both, or neither. OMB officials said costs can be classified as either indirect or direct, and administrative cost activities are usually, but not always, classified as indirect costs. However, inconsistencies in the use and meaning of the terms indirect and administrative, and their relationship to each other, has made it difficult for state and local governments and nonprofits to classify costs consistently. This has resulted in varying interpretations of what activity costs are indirect versus administrative. As OMB guidance on cost principles for nonprofits recognizes (2 CFR Part 230), because nonprofit organizations have diverse characteristics and accounting practices, it is not possible to specify the types of costs that may be classified as indirect in all situations. This increases the challenges of administering federal grants and, in some cases, makes it difficult for recipients to determine those activities eligible for indirect cost reimbursement under a particular federal grant and those that are not. GAO found differences in the rate in which state and local governments reimburse nonprofits for indirect costs. These differences, including whether nonprofits are reimbursed at all, largely depend on the policies and practices of the state and local governments that award federal funds to nonprofits. Federal grants often provide wide latitude in setting cost reimbursement policies and practices, and some state and local governments do not reimburse these costs at all. Those that do can often choose the reimbursement rate. As a result, GAO found that variations in indirect cost reimbursement exist not only among different grants, but also within the same grant across different states. GAO found that nonprofits fund indirect costs with a variety of federal and nonfederal funding sources, and that when indirect cost reimbursement is less than the amount of indirect costs nonprofits determine they have incurred, most nonprofits GAO interviewed take steps to bridge the gap. They may reduce the population served or the scope of services offered, and may forgo or delay physical infrastructure and technology improvements and staffing needs. Because many nonprofits view cuts in clients served or services offered as unpalatable, they reported that they often compromise vital \"back-office\" functions, which over time can affect their ability to meet their missions. Further, nonprofits' strained resources limit their ability to build a financial safety net, which can create a precarious financial situation for them. Absent a sufficient safety net, nonprofits that experience delays in receiving their federal funding may be inhibited in their ability to bridge funding gaps. When funding is delayed, some nonprofits said they either borrow funds on a line of credit or use cash reserves to provide services and pay bills until their grant awards are received. Collectively, these issues place stress on the nonprofit sector, diminishing its ability to continue to effectively partner with the federal government to provide services to vulnerable populations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Nonprofit organizations have increasingly become key partners with the  federal government in delivering important federal services throughout the  nation, including health care, education, housing, and human services. One  study estimates that nonprofits received approximately $317 billion from  the federal government in fiscal year 2004 for service delivery. The  Congressional Research Service (CRS) estimates that government grants  and payments to the nonprofit sector increased almost 53 percent from  1995 to 2005, demonstrating governments\u2019 increased reliance on this  sector to deliver public services. The breadth and diversity of nonprofits  allow them to tailor services to the specific needs of communities and  individuals. However, funding is often limited for the indirect costs  associated with providing these services (indirect costs are generally costs  such as rent or utilities that cannot be readily identified with a particular  service or product). Sometimes costs that would normally be classified as  indirect costs are covered in other ways; other times they are not covered  at all. As such, we have reported that nonprofits often struggle to cover the  costs of doing business, which raises concerns about the long-term  financial health and durability of the sector and its ability to effectively  deliver federal services and programs.", "Congress recently took steps toward addressing these challenges.

These states and  nonprofits were selected based on criteria such as amount of HHS and  HUD funding received, population, and geographic dispersion. We  reviewed documents, guidance, and policies governing the treatment of  indirect costs from these states, local governments, and nonprofits, and  interviewed budget and program officials in these organizations. Further,  we interviewed officials from nonprofit associations, such as the National  Council of Nonprofits and the Nonprofit Finance Fund.

A cost  may not be allocated to an award as an indirect cost if any other cost  incurred for the same purpose, in like circumstances, has been assigned to  an award as a direct cost. Direct costs of minor amounts may be treated as  indirect costs under certain conditions. Recognizing that nonprofit  organizations have diverse characteristics and accounting practices, the  guidance states that it is not possible to specify the types of cost that may  be classified as indirect costs in all situations.

According to OMB officials, the terms  \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d can be thought of as ways to classify costs; that is,  they are \u201ccost buckets.\u201d In contrast, the term \u201cadministrative\u201d refers to a  cost function or activity\u2014such as accounting, procurement, personnel, or  budgeting. On the one hand, OMB Circular A-122 cost guidance to  nonprofits indicates that administrative costs are usually but not always  indirect costs; on the other hand, that same guidance lists \u201cadministration\u201d  costs as one of two categories of indirect costs. Further, OMB Circular A- 87 cost guidance to state and local governments uses the terms indirect  and administrative interchangeably in certain places. Taken together, the  OMB guidance can be viewed as ambiguous. Guidance is most useful  when it is clear and well understood. OMB officials told us that given the  uncertainty and confusion with respect to these definitions and their  application, it may be helpful to bring federal, state, and local officials  together with representatives from nonprofit organizations to discuss  these issues. Doing so, they acknowledge, could help clarify and improve  understanding of how indirect costs should be treated.", "Classifying similar costs differently can make it difficult to determine how  much money grantees receive for cost activities typically thought of as  indirect, and at what rate. For example, the ESG program provides states  or local government grantees up to 5 percent for administrative costs. As  the primary recipients of ESG funds, states are required to share at least a  portion of this funding with local government subgrantees; however, there  is no such requirement for cost sharing with nonprofits. Thus, on its face it  may appear as if ESG provides no administrative cost reimbursement for  nonprofits. However, the ESG statute allows some emergency shelter  costs, such as rent and utilities, which are typically thought of as indirect  costs, to be claimed as a direct cost under ESG\u2019s \u201coperating costs\u201d  activity\u2014one of five direct program activities for which subgrantees may  be reimbursed. In another example, the statute for the HOPWA grant  program limits administrative cost reimbursement for project sponsors to  7 percent. Because administrative costs can either be charged as direct or  indirect costs depending on the circumstance, and because HOPWA has  no explicit limit on indirect costs, it is difficult to accurately characterize  cost reimbursement for activities commonly thought of as indirect.", "When grants and grantees classify similar costs differently it can also  result in the same cost activity being covered for some nonprofits but not  others, and can increase the complexity of administering the grants.  Nonprofit association officials told us that because grant award packages  and federal guidance contain unclear or conflicting information on how to  allocate costs, nonprofits sometimes unknowingly exclude eligible  expenses in their calculation of administrative costs and, as a result, limit  their own reimbursement potential. Further, some of the nonprofit and  association officials we spoke with said that because grant programs have  different definitions of indirect costs, they must take care to reconcile  their own accounting systems with the requirements of each grant they  receive to ensure that they properly account for the funds. They also said  that this is time consuming and resource intensive, and that more  consistent classifications and treatment across federal grants would  simplify grant administration and may reduce costs.", "We and others have previously reported that federal grant programs  sometimes classify similar or identical costs differently. In 2006, we  reviewed seven programs from HHS, and the Departments of Agriculture  and Labor, and found that the legal definitions of and the federal funding  rules for administrative costs varied even though many of the same  activities were performed to administer the programs. The report noted  that the statutes and regulations that define administrative costs for these  programs differ in part because the programs evolved separately over time  and have different missions, priorities, services, and clients. Further, the  report noted that a number of state budget officials said that varying  definitions of administrative costs create challenges for them. For  example, one said that it can be difficult to develop coding for accounting  and budgeting that can be used across programs and, as a result, it can be  difficult to monitor costs accurately; another shared this concern and said  that consistent definitions of and caps for administrative costs would  make it easier to allocate costs across programs and, therefore, might  reduce costs. This concern is not new; in a 2002 report on tax-exempt  organizations, we reported that different approaches for charging  expenses, as well as different allocation methods, can result in charities  with similar types of expenses allocating them differently.", "Even though the terms indirect costs and administrative costs are not  synonymous, we found that some nonprofit, state, and local government  officials we spoke with use them interchangeably. A national nonprofit  association official made a similar observation, noting that terminology  varies throughout the nonprofit sector. State and local government and  nonprofit officials we spoke with also reported using other terms, such as  overhead, general operating expenses, or management and general  expenses, synonymously with indirect and administrative costs.", "A 2007 report on nonprofits\u2019 overhead costs also discussed widespread  confusion about indirect costs throughout the sector, and identified  \u201cvariations in definitions of overhead and the overhead cost rate\u201d as areas  of concern among nonprofit researchers and practitioners. The report  also concluded that there is a substantial difference between indirect costs  and administrative costs, noting that not all indirect costs are  administrative, such as the costs of a telemarketing campaign, which is a  programmatic or fundraising function. The report also said that there are  administrative costs that are direct costs, such as those for the computers  and office supplies used by the finance department.", "Inconsistencies in guidance in grant award packages and across federal  programs add to the challenge of administering federal grants.

These differences, including whether nonprofits are reimbursed at all,  largely depend on the policies and practices of the state and local  governments that award federal funds to nonprofits. State and local  governments may apply the same indirect cost limit to all subgrantees or  may choose to apply different indirect cost limits to different subgrantees.  For example, for all subgrantees who receive funds under the Block  Grants for Community Mental Health Services and the Prevention and  Treatment of Substance Abuse, the Louisiana Department of Health and  Hospitals limits indirect cost reimbursement to 12 percent. Other state and  local government agencies, such as the Wisconsin Department of Health  Services, work with individual subgrantees to determine an indirect cost  reimbursement rate.

For example, according to a Dane County, Wisconsin  official, Dane County receives 10 percent for administrative and indirect  costs for the PSSF grant from the state of Wisconsin and passes the entire  amount on to its nonprofit service providers; this increases the amount of  funds available to nonprofits. However, some state and local governments  we spoke with interpret statutory limitations on their own administrative  costs as necessarily limiting the administrative and indirect costs  allowable by the grant for all subgrantees. Although states often enjoy  wide latitude in determining the administrative and indirect  reimbursement rates of their subgrantees, applying a more specific  interpretation of federal statute potentially limits the amount of funds  available to nonprofits.", "Variations in cost coverage exist not only among different grants across  different states, but also within the same grant across different states. For  example, for the PSSF grant, states may retain up to 10 percent of the  grant award to pay for their own costs to administer this grant, or they  may pass this amount through to the nonprofit service providers to which  they award PSSF grants. In addition, states may determine the allowable  level of indirect cost reimbursement for the nonprofit service providers to  whom they award PSSF grants.

Primary recipients of federal funds are required to have a federal indirect  cost rate agreement in order to be reimbursed for indirect costs. There is  no such requirement for recipients that receive federal funds that first flow  through entities such as state and local governments. Five of the 17  nonprofits in our sample have federal agreements.

Given recent  economic conditions, the need for sufficient cash reserves may be  particularly important."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Untimely Reimbursements and High Grant Administration Costs Exacerbate Nonprofits\u2019 Reported Funding Gaps", "paragraphs": ["A November 2009 CRS report noted that (1) in addition to funding cuts,  states apparently have been delaying payments for services they have  contracted with nonprofits to provide; and that (2) it appears that  governments, particularly state governments, may be contributing to the  financial difficulties of nonprofit organizations. During the course of our  work, we spoke with nonprofits that made similar observations. Factors  such as untimely reimbursements and high grant administration costs can  place stress on the nonprofit sector, diminishing its ability to continue to  provide services to vulnerable populations. OMB officials acknowledged  that building nonprofits\u2019 capacity to manage may help nonprofits better  contend with these issues and continue to meet their missions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Untimely Reimbursements", "paragraphs": ["Untimely receipt of government grant and contract payments contributes  to financial strain on nonprofits. Six of the 17 nonprofits in our study  reported that their reimbursements from federal, state, and local  governments are delayed at times, which can cause cash flow problems  and undermine their sustainability. For example, an official from a  Maryland nonprofit said that her organization was awarded an HHS grant  from the state of Maryland in October 2008 but did not actually receive the  funding until May 2009. Maryland nonprofit officials said they sometimes  experience 15- to 30-day delays in reimbursement from the state of  Maryland. One Maryland nonprofit official said delays such as these create  a \u201ccash-flow nightmare\u201d for her organization. The nonprofit has a line of  credit it can draw on to tide it over until it receives grant payments, but  this increases costs because it incurs interest and fees on the line of credit,  which are not reimbursed. Three of the nonprofits in our study said that  smaller nonprofits without cash reserves or lines of credit rely on timely  payments to sustain their operations. They said that even small delays put  these nonprofits at risk of failure. Some state and nonprofit association  officials we spoke with, however, said that reimbursement delays also  occur when nonprofit staff are so busy operating programs that they do  not keep up with filing invoices in a timely manner; as a result, when  nonprofits most need the money, it is not available.", "We and others have also cited challenges nonprofits face as a result of  delayed reimbursements from federal, state, or local governments. In 2006  we reported that recipients of selected federal grants reported that  delayed awards create significant burden on them and limit their ability to  plan for and efficiently execute grant programs. Grant recipients noted  that they often received award notifications significantly later than they  had anticipated, sometimes months after the expected award date  provided in the opportunity announcement. These uncertainties and  delays caused significant problems in planning for and executing grant  projects. Grant recipients in this study suggested that agencies should  award grants in a more timely way or provide more precise information on  when an award could be expected. A 2007 study on the financial health of  the human service providers in Massachusetts noted that when an  organization with limited cash experiences unexpected delays in the  receipt of income, a crisis situation can occur. A 2002 study that reviewed  prior research on this topic noted that when government agencies are  delayed in approving contracts or grant payments, recipient organizations  often experience cash flow problems. Consistent with comments from  the nonprofits we interviewed, this report suggested that payment delays  are especially difficult for smaller and new organizations because they do  not have established mechanisms to withstand delayed or unpredictable  funding."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Costs of Administering Grants", "paragraphs": ["The high costs of grant administration sometimes discourage nonprofits  from applying for grant funds. Three nonprofits we interviewed reported  that they do not seek additional government grants or may not reapply for  grants they currently receive for this reason. For example, a Maryland  nonprofit official stated that her organization is eligible for a Recovery Act  grant program that provides services to youth, but she is hesitant to take  on the project because the grant\u2019s administrative reimbursement rate is 3  percent, which would not cover the cost of administering the grant. Over  half of the nonprofits in our study said that administrative reporting  requirements make it challenging to administer grants they receive.", "Officials from a Louisiana nonprofit told us that complying with reporting  requirements for the more than 20 federal grants they manage requires a  significant amount of staff resources. A Maryland nonprofit official  explained that some of the nonprofits\u2019 federal grants are \u201cbig, complex,  and complicated\u201d to acquire and manage because it does not have a  dedicated grants management team and establishing one would redirect  resources away from other areas. Likewise, officials from a Wisconsin  nonprofit said that complying with the county\u2019s challenging bureaucratic  process requires a significant amount of time that could otherwise be  spent on mission-related activities, and that the organization regularly  loses money as a result of these requirements.", "We and others have previously reported on the challenges facing  nonprofits in administering grants. In July 2007, we testified that  practitioners and researchers alike acknowledged the difficulty that  nonprofit organizations, particularly smaller entities, have in responding to  the administrative and reporting requirements of their diverse funders.  We said that although funders need accountability, the diverse  requirements of different funders make reporting a time-consuming and  resource-intensive task. For example, meeting the increasing expectations  that nonprofits measure performance, given the size of grants and the  evaluation capabilities of the staff, can be difficult. One researcher said  that performance evaluation is one of the biggest challenges they face. A  2002 study, which included an analysis of Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  Forms 990 from 1,172 nonprofit organizations from 1985 to 1995, found  that for some nonprofits, an increase in government funding is positively  correlated with an increase in the share of administrative expenses the  following year, which could be the result of the costs associated with  obtaining contracts and the challenges of meeting accountability and  reporting requirements. Similarly, a 2004 study on nonprofit overhead  costs of 9 nonprofit organizations reported that the nonprofits with the  weakest organizational infrastructures received half or more of their  revenue from public sector sources, and that the public sector practice of  providing little support for overhead costs was directly associated with the  organizational weaknesses at these nonprofits."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal, state, and local governments rely on nonprofit organizations as  key partners in implementing programs and providing services to the  public, such as health care, human services, and housing-related services.  Nonprofits\u2019 ability to determine and manage their indirect costs is affected  by inconsistencies in terminology and guidance across federal programs  on how to classify costs. Further, varying reimbursement practices by  state and local governments that award federal funds affect the rate at  which indirect costs are covered. Absent a clear understanding among  federal, state, local, and nonprofit officials about how to interpret OMB\u2019s  indirect cost guidance and consistently classify activities typically thought  of as indirect costs, nonprofits will likely continue to struggle with  accurately and consistently reporting on their indirect and administrative  costs of doing business, and a clear picture of the true gap between actual  and reimbursed indirect costs will remain elusive.", "As the federal government increasingly relies on the nonprofit sector to  provide services, it is important to better understand the implications of  reported funding gaps, such as compromised quality of important  administrative functions, including information technology, human  resources, legal, and accounting operations. Such gaps further limit  nonprofits\u2019 capacity to correctly determine how indirect costs should be  treated. Collectively, these challenges potentially limit the sector\u2019s ability  to effectively partner with the federal government, can lead to nonprofits  providing fewer or lower-quality federal services, and, over the long term,  could risk the viability of the sector.

These included selecting a  nonprobability sample of federal grants, states, and nonprofits to serve as  case studies and conducting a literature review to analyze published work  related to this topic. The scope of the third objective was broader to  include the perspectives of nonprofits that receive any federal funding,  direct or pass-through.

We selected HHS  and HUD as our two primary agencies of focus because of their familiarity  and historical relationship with nonprofit organizations. HHS and HUD  grants address many of the National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities  (NTEE) classifications related to social and housing services. The NTEE  classification system for nonprofits was devised by the Urban Institute\u2019s  National Center for Charitable Statistics (NCCS), which is a national  clearinghouse of data on the nonprofit sector in the United States. NTEE  classifications are widely referenced by the Internal Revenue Service and  nonprofit researchers and practitioners.
