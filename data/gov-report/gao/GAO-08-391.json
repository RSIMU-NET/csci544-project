For example, four products account for about 84 percent of the total amount of uncollected AD/CV duties. Also, a relatively small number of importers owe the vast majority of these uncollected duties. In addition, half of the 23,000 unpaid AD/CV duty bills are less than $309, but the average duty bill is more than $26,000 due to a relatively small number of very large bills. According to CBP officials, prospects for collecting a sizeable portion of these bills are slim, because many of the importers have disappeared, have no assets, or have declared bankruptcy. CBP reporting on uncollected AD/CV duties has been critical to congressional and public oversight of CBP's efforts to collect AD/CV duties. However, the law generating this reporting has been repealed. Four key factors contribute to uncollected AD/CV duties, a few of which the U.S. government has partially addressed. First, because the U.S. AD/CV duty system involves the retrospective assessment of duties, the final amount of AD/CV duties an importer owes can significantly exceed the initial amount paid when the goods entered the country. Second, companies that did not previously export products subject to AD/CV duties, i.e., \"new shippers,\" pose two types of risks for collections. For example, new shippers can be assigned an AD/CV duty rate based on as few as one shipment, which can significantly underestimate the final duty rate. Also, importers purchasing from new shippers were able to provide a bond in lieu of a cash payment to cover the initial AD/CV duties assessed. Congress addressed this risk by temporarily requiring all importers to pay initial AD/CV duties in cash. Third, all importers must provide a general bond to secure the payment of all types of duties, but CBP's standard practice for setting the amount of this bond inadequately protects AD/CV duty revenue. CBP addressed this by revising its bonding formula for products subject to AD/CV duties, but the revision has been tested on only one product and faces domestic and international legal challenges. Fourth, CBP collects minimal information regarding importers and does not conduct background or financial checks, which creates challenges to locating importers and collecting AD/CV duties. Two sets of options exist for improving AD/CV duty collection, each of which involves potential advantages and disadvantages. One set of options involves revising U.S. law to eliminate the retrospective component of the U.S. AD/CV duty system by assessing final duties when the product arrives in the United States (i.e., a prospective system). But there would be trade-offs. For example, under a retrospective system, the amount of duties finally assessed reflects the actual amount of dumping by the exporter for the period of review. Under a prospective system, the amount of duties assessed may not match the amount of actual dumping or subsidization. However, in practice, a substantial amount of AD/CV duty bills are not collected under the U.S. retrospective system. The second set of options involves making adjustments within the existing system. For example, Congress could revise the standards for new shipper reviews and CBP could examine the option of revising bonding requirements to protect additional AD/CV duty revenue."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 2001, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has  been unable to collect antidumping (AD) and countervailing (CV) duties  imposed to remedy injurious unfair foreign trade practices totaling  hundreds of millions of dollars.

This substantial amount of  uncollected duties has caused concern on the part of Congress and the  domestic industries affected by the dumped or subsidized products. The  noncollection of those duties means that the U.S. government has not fully  remedied the unfair trade practices and has lost out on a substantial  amount of revenue.", "The process for assessing and collecting AD/CV duties involves two key  agencies and can take several years.

In addition, you asked us to identify options  for improving the AD/CV duty system. Specifically, we examined (1) the  extent and nature of uncollected AD/CV duties; (2) the key factors  contributing to uncollected AD/CV duties and the steps taken to improve  the collection of AD/CV duties; (3) interagency communications that affect  the processing of AD/CV duties; and (4) potential options for improving  AD/CV duty collections.", "To meet these objectives, we analyzed U.S. government data and reports  and interviewed officials from relevant government agencies and the  private sector. To describe the extent and nature of uncollected AD/CV  duties, we reviewed CBP data on all open, unpaid AD/CV duty bills for  fiscal years 2001 through 2007, as of September 2007. To identify the key  factors affecting CBP\u2019s ability to collect AD/CV duties and the steps taken  to improve collection, we analyzed CBP data; reviewed relevant statutes,  regulations, and agency reports; and interviewed agency officials. We also  analyzed CBP records documenting its efforts to collect AD/CV duties,  reviewed agency reports and legislative changes, and interviewed agency  and private sector representatives. To determine whether interagency  processes inhibit the collection of AD/CV duties, we analyzed  documentation related to interagency communications regarding AD/CV  duties and interviewed agency officials. To identify and analyze potential  options for improving AD/CV duty collection, we interviewed agency  officials and private sector representatives and reviewed academic  literature. In addition, we obtained information from several foreign  governments to understand how their AD/CV duty systems operate. We  determined that the data presented in this report are sufficiently reliable  for the purpose for which they are presented. Appendix I provides  additional information regarding our scope and methodology. We  conducted this performance audit from June 2007 to March 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Exporters are  companies that ship goods manufactured or produced in foreign countries  to the United States. Importers may be companies that purchase the  products from exporters or simply may be responsible for the facilitation  of the importation of the goods. Importers are responsible for paying all  duties, taxes, and fees on those products when they are brought into the  United States. Importers also are required to obtain a general bond to  secure the payment of their financial obligations. CBP is responsible for,  among other things, collecting the duties, taxes, and fees assessed on  those products and setting the formula for establishing importers\u2019 bond  amounts.", "The United States and many of its trading partners have established laws  to remedy the unfair trade practices of other countries and foreign  companies that cause injury to domestic industries. U.S. law authorizes  the imposition of AD/CV duties to remedy these unfair trade practices,  namely dumping (i.e., sales at less than normal value) and foreign  government subsidies. While AD/CV duties are intended to protect U.S.  industries and workers from unfair foreign trade practices, they also have  become a substantial source of revenue for the U.S. government. CBP is  the U.S. agency responsible for collecting all import duties, which  amounted to over $98 billion from fiscal years 2003 through 2006. A  portion of these duties are AD/CV duties, of which CBP collected $8 billion  in cash deposits (or 7 percent of the total). A recent Department of the  Treasury (Treasury) analysis estimated that for fiscal years 2003 through  2006, the overall collection rate for all duties exceeded 99 percent and the  collection rate for AD/CV duties was somewhat lower (96 percent).  However, Treasury also reported that the collection rate for AD duties  owed as a result of an administrative review by Commerce was less than  50 percent. Treasury estimated that approximately $589 million in total  duties went uncollected during the period. Uncollected AD/CV duties  represented 87 percent of that amount.", "Figure 1 shows the amount of uncollected AD/CV duties owed for entries  liquidated during each fiscal year, as of September 30. For example, for  fiscal year 2007, CBP reported $237 million in uncollected AD/CV duties  for entries liquidated during the year, as of September 30, 2007. The  amount of uncollected duties for entries liquidated during fiscal year 2007  could decrease based on additional collections made in subsequent years.", "According to government officials and private sector representatives, the  substantial shortfalls in collecting AD/CV duties were first widely  publicized after the enactment of CDSOA (also known as the Byrd  Amendment) in 2001, which provided for the distribution of AD/CV duties  to the injured domestic industries, instead of, as in the past, going to  Treasury. Following the repeal of CDSOA in 2006 after a decision by the  World Trade Organization (WTO) that the law violated WTO rules, AD/CV  duties collected will again be paid to Treasury.", "The process for investigating, calculating, and assessing AD/CV duties can  be a lengthy process and involves three key agencies. Commerce is  responsible for determining whether the imports at issue are being sold at  less than fair value (dumped) or are being subsidized by a countervailable  subsidy. The ITC is responsible for determining whether an industry in  the United States is being injured by the imports at issue. Both ITC and  Commerce must make affirmative determinations in their respective  investigations for AD/CV duties to be imposed. Commerce also sets the  AD/CV duty, which is equal to the amount of dumping or subsidization.   CBP is then responsible for collecting the AD/CV duties.", "At the completion of its investigation, Commerce issues an AD/CV duty  order, which specifies the products for which importers must pay AD/CV  duties, and indicates the rates applicable to several specific exporters and  a catch-all rate for all other exporters that did not receive a specific rate.  The AD/CV duty order also instructs CBP to collect cash deposits at the  time of importation at those rates on all merchandise subject to the order.  As shown in figure 2, the merchandise also can be subject to an  administrative review by Commerce 12 months after the issuance of the  AD/CV duty order. During the administrative review, Commerce analyzes  previous imports to determine the actual level of dumping or subsidization  for those imports. At the conclusion of the administrative review (typically  about 18 months after the review\u2019s initiation), the liquidation rate (i.e., the  final duty rate) for the merchandise is established. Commerce  communicates the final duty rate to CBP through liquidation instructions  and CBP instructs staff at each port of entry to assess final duties on all  relevant entries (i.e., applying the rate to the value of goods imported).  The liquidation process is complete when CBP refunds money (if the cash  deposit rate was higher than the liquidation rate) or issues a supplemental  bill (if the liquidation rate is higher than the cash deposit rate). If the cash  deposit rate is equal to the liquidation rate, CBP does not issue a refund or  a supplemental bill and the entry is liquidated \u201cas entered.\u201d These actions  must be completed by Commerce and CBP within 6 months. (App. III  provides additional information regarding the AD/CV duty collection  process.)", "To collect additional AD/CV duties an importer owes, CBP sends the  importer a monthly bill. An importer has 6 months from the date of  liquidation or reliquidation to protest the bill amount. After the protest  period has expired, if an importer has not paid the bill, CBP requests  payment from the surety (insurance) company that underwrote the bond  the importer provided when the products entered the United States.  According to CBP officials, if CBP does not receive full payment of the bill  within 8 months of sending the first bill, it \u201csanctions\u201d the delinquent  importer. CBP officials also explained that importers that have not been  sanctioned are allowed to have their merchandise released from the port  of entry without paying all estimated duties, taxes, and fees so long as they  commit to make such payment within 15 days. When importers are  sanctioned, CBP revokes this privilege and requires the full payment of all  estimated duties, taxes, and fees before products can leave the port of  entry. If CBP does not receive payment within 1 year of issuing the first  bill, CBP\u2019s Revenue Division (which is responsible for collecting payment)  refers the case to CBP\u2019s Office of Chief Counsel, which determines the  next course of action. In addition, the Office of Chief Counsel determines  whether the bill should be written off.", "While the time frames for completing each step in the process for  assessing and collecting AD/CV duties are established by law, AD/CV  duties also are subject to judicial review, which is not subject to time  frames. According to CBP and Commerce officials, importers and surety  companies frequently obtain legal injunctions or file protests related to the  application of AD/CV duties.

Third, all importers must provide a general bond to  secure the payment of duties, but CBP\u2019s standard bond formula provides  little protection of AD/CV duty revenue because it sets bond amounts at a  low level.

In these cases, CBP must attempt to  collect the duties from importers who are, at times, unable or unwilling to  pay. According to a 2007 Treasury report on major duty collection  problems, these situations create the most significant collection  problems. Some importers are unable to pay the additional amount  because it exceeds their available assets. Others, such as illegitimate  importers, expect that their final assessment will exceed their cash deposit  and plan to avoid their final duty obligation, according to Treasury  officials.", "Final AD duty rates are lower or the same as the estimated duty rates the  vast majority of the time. However, in some cases, final duty rates are  significantly higher. In analyzing more than 6 years of CBP data covering  over 900,000 entries subject to AD duties, we found that duty rates went  up 16 percent of the time, went down 24 percent of the time, and remained  the same 60 percent of the time. In instances when rates increased, the  median increase was less than 4 percentage points, meaning that half of  the time the rate increased less than 4 percentage points.

The first  risk is linked to the ability of importers purchasing from new shippers to  post bonds instead of having to pay cash deposits. In the course of an  AD/CV duty investigation, Commerce typically determines an AD/CV duty  rate applicable to a good associated with several specific manufacturers  and exporters as well as a rate for all those manufacturers and exporters  of the good not individually investigated. After the conclusion of an AD/CV  duty investigation, some exporters who are not individually investigated  may request a review in order to receive their own rates because they  believe they could receive a lower rate. A \u201cnew shipper\u201d (a  manufacturer/exporter) who did not export the subject merchandise  during the initial period of investigation and is not affiliated with any  exporter who exported the subject merchandise can request that  Commerce conduct a review to establish the shipper\u2019s own individual  AD/CV duty rate. Once Commerce initiates a new shipper review,  importers purchasing from the manufacturer/exporter undergoing the  review used to have the option of paying estimated AD/CV duties by  providing a bond in lieu of paying cash. As discussed earlier in this report,  importers that were allowed to provide bonds in lieu of cash deposits are  responsible for about 40 percent of the amount of uncollected AD/CV  duties.", "Congress has partially addressed this risk of uncollected AD/CV duties  associated with new shipper reviews. In August 2006, Congress  temporarily suspended the \u201cnew shipper bonding privilege\u201d that allowed  importers who purchased from companies undergoing a new shipper  review to provide a bond, instead of cash, to cover the estimated AD/CV  duties due at entry. As a result, all importers must now provide a cash  deposit to cover the estimated duties at entry until July 2009. This new  policy eliminated the risk of uncollected AD/CV revenues when the final  duty amounts were assessed at the cash deposit rate or less because CBP  does not have to issue a bill for the bonded amount. However,  supplemental duties due to rate increases remain unprotected.", "The new law also required CBP to apply the revised policy retroactively to  April 1, 2006. Thus, those importers who already had obtained bonds for  AD/CV duties on shipments from new shippers during the approximately  4.5 months preceding the legislation were required to make cash payments  for these shipments. CBP identified $96 million worth of such bonds that  needs to be replaced with cash. While CBP has taken steps to collect this  money, as of January 2008, it had collected only approximately $100,000 in  total.", "The second risk is linked to the level of imports required to obtain an  AD/CV duty rate as a result of a new shipper review. U.S. law does not  specify any minimum amount of exports or number of transactions that a  manufacturer or exporter must make to be eligible for a new shipper  review. As a result, an exporter can be assigned its own individual AD/CV  duty rate based on a very minimal amount of exports. For example, a new  shipper can purposely make one commercial shipment to the United  States at a relatively high price for which the importer would pay a  relatively high AD/CV duty rate, then request a review of that shipment.  Commerce\u2019s review (based on the one shipment) will determine that the  new shipper was not dumping the product in the United States and assigns  a 0 percent AD/CV duty deposit rate. Once Commerce assigns the new  shipper a 0 percent AD/CV duty rate, the AD/CV duties the importer paid  on the one commercial shipment are refunded, with interest. In addition,  no AD/CV duty deposits are collected on future shipments, but additional  duties may be owed if those shipments are determined to have been  dumped or subsidized when an administrative review is completed in  approximately 12 to 18 months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP\u2019s Standard Bond Formula Provides Little Protection of AD/CV Duty Revenue; CBP Has Taken Steps to Address This Risk, but Faces Challenges", "paragraphs": ["CBP\u2019s standard bond setting formula provides little protection for securing  AD/CV duty revenue when the final amount of AD/CV duties owed exceeds  the amount paid at the time of importation. To ensure payment of  unforeseen obligations to the government, all importers are required to  post a security, usually a general obligation bond, when they import  products into the United States. This bond is an insurance policy  protecting the U.S. government against revenue loss if an importer defaults  on its financial obligations. CBP determines the appropriate amount of a  bond required for each importer.  In general, the importer is required to  obtain a bond equal to 10 percent of the amount the importer was assessed  in duties, taxes, and fees, over the preceding year (or $50,000, whichever is  greater).", "As seen in table 1 earlier in this report, CBP\u2019s standard bond formula is  insufficient to protect AD/CV duty revenue in some cases. Table 1 presents  data on the top 20 importers with uncollected AD/CV duties and their bond  amounts, which are insufficient to protect AD/CV duty revenue for all 20  importers. When AD/CV duties are retrospectively increased, the standard  bond formula can be insufficient to cover the importer\u2019s new obligation. If  an importer fails to pay the supplemental AD/CV duties, CBP can collect  from the surety, up to the amount of the bond that was provided at the  time of importation. However, CBP frequently faces a lengthy process of  trying to collect from bonding agents who can, and often do, protest CBP\u2019s  decision to collect the bond amount. According to Treasury\u2019s analysis, if  an importer defaults and the amount of the bond is insufficient to cover  the importer\u2019s new obligations, duties due in excess of the bond coverage  are often uncollected.", "In July 2004, in response to problems collecting AD duties, CBP  announced a revision to its standard bond policy for bonds covering  certain imports subject to AD/CV duties. The revised bond formula was  intended to reduce the risk of uncollected duties, but CBP has tested it on  only one product subject to AD duties. The revised policy requires  importers to obtain a bond equal to 100 percent of the estimated AD/CV  duties for items imported over the previous 12 months. Essentially, the  new requirement doubles the AD/CV duty revenue protected in that CBP  now receives a cash deposit, plus an increased bond approximately equal  to the cash deposit. In February 2005, CBP applied the revised policy to  imports of shrimp from six countries subject to AD duties as a \u201ctest case\u201d  before applying the policy more broadly.", "In October 2006, we reported on the implementation of the test case and  its effects. We found that the revised bonding requirement achieved its  goal of increasing the amount of AD duties secured. CBP data showed that  the policy increased the amount of duty revenue protected by 85 percent,  but that the costs imposed on shrimp importers as a result of the revised  policy are substantial. For example, shrimp importers must pay higher  premiums and often are required by sureties to provide 100 percent  collateral. According to shrimp importers, this reduced the amount of  funds available to operate their business, tied up collateral for several  years, and strained the borrowing capacity of some importers.", "While the policy has protected revenue and had some negative impacts on  importers, it is not possible to assess its full effects on AD/CV duty  collections for three reasons. First, it has been applied to one product,  shrimp, which has little history in terms of duty collections. Second, the  domestic shrimp industry and over 100 shrimp exporters reached  agreements to not request that Commerce conduct administrative  reviews. In exchange for cash payments from exporters and the  cooperation of the exporters on issues related to illegal antibiotics and  circumvention, the domestic industry agreed not to request an  administrative review of these exporters. This eliminated the possibility of  duty rate increases which can result in uncollected duties. Thus, it is not  possible to separate the effects of the policy from the effects of the  agreements. Third, some U.S. importers and WTO members have  challenged the legality of the policy. The U.S. Court of International  Trade has issued an injunction on the implementation of the policy for  some importers, and a WTO dispute settlement panel issued a report in  February 2008 indicating that the revised policy as applied to imports of  shrimp from India and Thailand is inconsistent with WTO rules.

As a result, other countries reported that they have no major  problems collecting AD/CV duties.", "Canada\u2019s AD duty system often is referred to as a prospective normal  value system. Canadian officials conduct investigations to determine  whether imports are being dumped or subsidized and whether they are  causing injury to Canadian industry; if so, they impose AD/CV duties.  According to Canadian officials, when the government finds that dumping  is occurring, the Canadian government calculates a \u201cnormal value\u201d for the  product, which is used to calculate the amount of AD duties applicable on  all future shipments to Canada. For all future imports, if the normal value  of the goods exceeds the export price, the importer owes AD duties in an  amount equal to the difference between the two prices. Thus, the amount  of duties owed, if any, varies based on the export price. The lower the  export price, the greater the duties owed, and vice versa. If the export  price is equal to or higher than the normal value, the importer owes no AD  duties. Officials stated that this normal value is used until the Canadian  government conducts a review to update it, which typically occurs  annually. These reviews are initiated either by the government or at the  request of an importer or exporter based on market or price changes.  Following the completion of a review, the new normal value is used for all  future imports, but is not used to recalculate the amount of duties owed  on prior imports (unlike in the U.S. system). Officials further explained  that under Canadian law, importers and certain exporters (for example,  those from the United States and Mexico) also may request a  redetermination of the normal value or export price after duties have been  assessed on a transaction for the purpose of obtaining a refund. Any duties  found to have been paid in excess as a result of the redetermination will  be refunded to the importer. As of November 2007, Canada imposed AD  duties on 17 products and CV duties on 6 products. In 2006, Canada  collected approximately $24 million in AD/CV duties.", "Australia\u2019s AD duty system also is prospective and the duties are assessed  based on the normal value calculated during an investigation of unfairly  priced imports. However, as Australian officials explained, the AD duties  owed may have two components: one fixed and one variable. The fixed  component is the difference between the normal value and the export  price during the AD duty investigation. This amount is assessed on all  future imports on a per-unit basis. The variable component is the  additional duties that will be assessed if an exporter lowers its price for an  individual transaction below what it charged during the investigation. The  additional duties will be assessed at an amount equal to the difference  between the two prices. Like the Canadian system, Australia periodically  reviews the normal value and makes any adjustments on a prospective  basis. As of October 2007, Australia imposed AD duties on 35 products and  CV duties on 1 product.", "The European Union\u2019s (EU) AD/CV duty system also is prospective, with  the amount of the duties based on the amount of dumping or subsidization  applied on an ad valorem (percentage) basis. EU officials stated that they  conduct an investigation to determine whether imports are being dumped  or subsidized and whether they are causing injury to a European industry.  If so, they then establish the normal value for the product and compare  this to the export price. Officials further explained that they calculate the  percentage difference between these two prices and set this as the AD/CV  duty rate. This rate is then applied to all future imports of the product. As  a result, the amount of the AD/CV duties owed is a simple percentage the  current export price. Thus, the lower the export price, the lesser the  amount of duties owed; the higher the price, the greater the amount of  duties owed. According to EU officials, EU regulations allow for the  periodic review of AD/CV duties as well as for the refund of any duty paid  determined to be in excess of the actual margin of dumping and/or  subsidization of the exporter concerned. Officials stated that these  periodic reviews have a prospective effect, that is, the new rate of duty  will affect only future imports (contrary to the U.S. system, the amount of  duty cannot be increased retrospectively). Separately, importers have the  opportunity to request a refund review, which would concern past  imports. As of December 2006, the European Union had 134 AD measures  and 2 CV measures in force. The AD measures covered 59 products and 32  countries, while the CV measures covered 10 products and 5 countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trade-Offs Involved When Considering Prospective and Retrospective AD/CV Duty Systems", "paragraphs": ["Prospective and retrospective AD/CV duty systems differ in a variety of  ways, and the specific design features of each system influence their  relative advantages and disadvantages. The types of trade-offs associated  with each system can be illustrated by comparing three specific  characteristics:    Timing for determining and collecting final AD/CV duties. In  prospective AD/CV duty systems, the amount of AD/CV duties paid by the  importer at the time of importation is essentially treated as final. This  eliminates the risk of being unable to collect AD/CV duties. Establishing  the final amount of AD/CV duties owed at the time of importation also  creates certainty for importers. This enables legitimate importers to plan  their business operations. In addition, some prospective AD/CV duty  systems and retrospective systems assess AD/CV duties that increase or  decrease as the degree of dumping or subsidization increases or  decreases, which can provide exporters an incentive to eliminate or  reduce dumping. For example, under Canada\u2019s \u201cprospective normal value\u201d  AD/CV duty system, Canada\u2019s investigation results in establishing a normal  value which is known to all parties. Exporters can then raise their prices  up to that normal value, thereby eliminating their dumping and avoiding  any AD/CV duties.", "In a retrospective AD/CV duty system, the amount of AD/CV duties owed is  not determined until well after the time of importation. Importantly, our  analysis showed that, in the U.S. system, final duties are assessed, on  average, more than 3 years after importation. This time lag, which often is  the result of the time required to conduct the administrative review  necessary to calculate final AD/CV duties and any judicial review of the  results of the review, has several potential implications. First, the threat of  an administrative review can deter some companies from dumping. An  administrative review could result in AD/CV duty rates being increased  from the estimated rate paid at the time of importation, which could mean  significant new duty liability for an importer. As such, since legitimate  importers seek price certainty, they may be less inclined to purchase from  exporters whose AD/CV duty rates fluctuate substantially over time.  Second, the time lag creates collection risks for the U.S. government. As  discussed earlier, the long lag times between entry and final duty  assessments in the U.S. system increase the risk of uncollected duties, as  importers may become unable or be unwilling to pay the final amount of  AD/CV duties when they are assessed. Third, the time lag can result in  \u201cbad actors,\u201d those importers who intentionally avoid paying required  duties, not being identified until they have been importing for a long time.  Only after its collections efforts are unsuccessful does the government  clearly know that duties owed by this importer are at serious risk for  noncollection. During this time lag, the importer may continue to import  dumped or subsidized products into the country, thus incurring additional  duty liability and increasing the U.S. government risk for noncollection.  \u201cAccuracy\u201d of AD/CV duties paid. Under a prospective AD/CV duty  system, the amount of duties assessed may not match the amount of actual  dumping or subsidization. Under some prospective systems, the amount of  AD/CV duties an importer is assessed is based on dumping or  subsidization that occurred in a previous period. As a result, if the amount  of dumping or subsidization changes, the amount of duties paid in the  current period may not equal the amount of dumping or subsidization that  is currently occurring. However, the government is able to collect the full  amount of AD/CV duties assessed because the duties are paid at the time  of importation.", "Under a retrospective AD/CV duty system, the amount of duties assessed  reflects the actual amount of dumping by the exporter for the period of  review. The amount of the final AD/CV duty liability may not be  established until the government reviews all the imports for a given period  and calculates the amount of dumping or subsidization that has occurred.  As a result, a retrospective system can assess duties that exactly reflect  the amount of dumping or subsidization. However, in practice, a  substantial amount of retrospective AD/CV duty bills are not collected.  This gap between the amount of duties assessed and the amount collected  means that the government is not fully remedying the unfair trade practice.  This suggests that assessing a more accurate duty rate does not  necessarily result in receiving more accurate duty amounts from  importers. It also raises concerns about the equity of the system, as those  who evade AD/CV duties gain a competitive advantage at the expense of  those companies that pay the full amount of duties owed.", "Administrative simplicity for customs officials. Both prospective and  retrospective AD/CV duty systems may involve complex processes for  determining appropriate AD/CV duty rates. However, they differ with  respect to their simplicity for customs officials responsible for collecting  AD/CV duties.", "Prospective AD/CV duty systems create a smaller burden for customs  officials because the full and final amount of AD/CV duties is assessed at  the time of importation. For example, according to Canadian customs  officials, its AD/CV duty system places little burden on customs officials.  Since all duties are paid when products enter the country, customs  officials face little, if any, additional work to process imports subject to  AD/CV duties.", "Retrospective AD/CV duty systems can create a substantial burden for  customs officials. According to CBP officials, the U.S.\u2019s retrospective  AD/CV duty system places a unique and significant burden on its  resources. For example, it creates a considerable amount of administrative  duties related to identifying, tracking over time, and properly processing  entries subject to AD/CV duties. When CBP needs to collect additional  duties beyond those paid at the time of importation, additional resources  also are needed to attempt to collect those duties, which can involve  attempting to locate importers that have disappeared or collecting from  importers that have declared bankruptcy, and may also necessitate  working with other agencies such as Justice.

First, Congress could extend or make permanent its suspension of  the new shipper bonding privilege. Doing so would require all importers to  pay estimated AD/CV duties in cash at the time of entry, thus eliminating  the need to attempt to collect from surety companies.", "Second, Congress could revise the level of exports required for exporters  applying for \u201cnew shipper\u201d status to potentially reduce the risk of  uncollected duties. As discussed previously, under U.S. law, a company  applying to be a new shipper is entitled to an expedited review of its  exports for the purpose of establishing an AD/CV duty rate to that  company\u2019s exports in the future. According to Commerce officials, since  such companies typically have exported only one shipment of the goods  subject to AD/CV duties, which is almost always at a relatively high price,  they typically calculate a cash deposit rate of 0 percent. As a result,  importers purchasing from these companies pay no AD/CV duties at the  time of importation. However, Commerce may later determine that the  exports were dumped or subsidized, and therefore retrospective bills  would be issued. As described earlier, these retrospective bills are a key  factor contributing to uncollected AD/CV duties. To mitigate this risk,  Congress could choose to provide Commerce the discretion to require  companies applying for a new shipper review to have a greater volume of  imports before establishing an individual AD/CV duty rate. According to  Commerce officials, such discretion would be useful because it could help  mitigate the risks posed by establishing an AD/CV duty rate based on one  shipment.", "Revising the requirements for new shippers could reduce the risk of  uncollected duties by making it harder for exporters to manipulate new  shipper reviews and evade duties. However, a large volume of imports may  be required to prevent some exporters from intentionally manipulating the  new shipper review process. In addition, requiring a greater volume of  imports could unfairly burden legitimate new shippers by requiring them  to export more than they otherwise might before they could obtain an  individual cash deposit rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements for Becoming an Importer of Record Could Be Heightened", "paragraphs": ["CBP or Congress could heighten the requirements for a company applying  to be an importer of record to potentially reduce the likelihood that  importers would prove unable to pay their duty liabilities. As discussed  previously, the requirements for becoming an importer in the United  States are minimal and do not involve any financial or background checks.  Heightened requirements might include mandatory financial or  background checks. However, according to CBP officials, performing  financial checks would provide a limited assessment of importers\u2019 future  ability to pay additional AD/CV duties because their financial situations  can change quickly. Additionally, a financial check does not address a  company\u2019s willingness to pay additional AD/CV duties. It also would create  a significant new burden on CBP, which would need to conduct or oversee  these financial or background checks. For example, CBP data indicate that  from fiscal years 2005 through 2007, there was an average of over 350,000  importers of record. Of those, about 130,000, on average, were new  importers each year. Moreover, these financial or background checks  would need to be updated periodically, which would compound the  resource requirements over time. In addition, it is possible that the  heightened requirements would be imposed on all importers to be fair.  Given that the vast majority of importers comply with customs laws and  pay their duty liabilities, such a broad approach may not be a cost- effective way to improve the collection of AD/CV duties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Could Revise Its Bonding Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Bond requirements could be modified to provide additional protection in  the case that importers are unable or unwilling to pay their duty bills. One  option would be for CBP to expand the application of its revised bond  policy for imports subject to AD/CV duties. As explained earlier, this  policy was established in July 2004, and significantly increased the value  of bonds required of importers. At the time it was initially implemented,  CBP officials envisioned applying the policy to shrimp imports as a test  case and subsequently applying the policy to additional imports they  believe pose a significant risk for uncollected AD/CV duties. To date, the  policy has been applied only to imports of shrimp from six countries  subject to AD/CV duties. As we have previously reported, this policy  effectively doubled the amount of revenue protected by requiring (in  addition to the cash deposits required at the time of entry) a continuous  bond essentially equal to the cash deposits. However, expanding the  application of the policy entails substantial drawbacks. For example, some  importers covered by the expanded policy would face a significant  increase in their costs. Shrimp importers reported that they experienced  increased costs due largely to substantial collateral requirements needed  to obtain the bonds. According to importers, these costs reduced their  profitability and forced some importers to exit the industry. In addition,  the revised continuous bonding policy has been challenged in U.S. court  and at the WTO. The U.S. Court of International Trade has issued an  injunction on the implementation of the policy for some importers, and a  WTO dispute settlement panel issued a report in February 2008 indicating  that the revised policy as applied to imports of shrimp from India and  Thailand is inconsistent with WTO rules.", "CBP also could set new bond requirements based on its assessments of an  importer\u2019s likely ability to pay AD/CV duties. CBP could create a set of  criteria to judge each importer\u2019s ability to pay and require larger bonds of  companies judged to have a lower likely ability to pay, which would  increase the amount of AD/CV duty revenue protected. Such an approach  could allow CBP to target importers considered to be at high risk for  uncollected AD/CV duties and require them to provide larger bonds.  However, performing such analyses of individual importers\u2019 likely ability  to pay retrospective AD/CV duties, like background and financial checks,  would create a substantial administrative burden for CBP. Such analyses  would create a substantial new workload because of the likely complexity  of the analyses, the large number of importers (approximately 350,000),  and the need to regularly update the analyses.", "CBP also could require importers to provide an additional bond for each  entry subject to AD/CV duties in addition to the already required  continuous bond. Some representatives from surety companies said that  this requirement could protect additional revenue while creating only a  minimal burden on CBP. They suggest that this type of requirement would  allow surety companies to identify, in advance, when they are insuring the  payment of AD/CV duties, which are at greater risk of nonpayment by  importers. Since they face a greater risk of having to pay out on bonds  related to AD/CV duties, surety companies would likely increase the cost  to importers of obtaining the bond, perhaps through increased premium  rates or collateral requirements. These increased costs could deter  malfeasance by illegitimate importers by increasing the cost of importing  merchandise subject to AD/CV duties. However, it may impose costs on  legitimate importers that pose little risk of failing to pay retrospective  AD/CV duties. At the same time, competition among surety companies  could force them to offer better bond prices for lower-risk importers,  reducing the costs for importers not at risk of uncollected duties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress Could Extend the Length of Time Allowed for CBP to Liquidate Entries Subject to AD/CV Duties", "paragraphs": ["Congress could choose to extend the time frame allowed by law for CBP  to liquidate entries subject to AD/CV duties. As discussed earlier, CBP  has 6 months to liquidate entries subject to AD/CV duties from the time  that Commerce publishes a notice in the Federal Register establishing (1)  the final AD/CV duty rates or (2) the lifting of an injunction against  liquidation, whichever comes last. According to CBP officials, this 6-month  deadline can be very hard to meet, especially when a large volume of  imports needs to be liquidated or a case is extremely complex. According  to CBP officials, for most imports, the Harmonized Tariff System code for  a product determines the applicable duty. However, in some AD/CV duty  cases, no Tariff code exists for the specific products that Commerce  investigated and imposed duties on. An example is wooden bedroom  furniture from China. According to CBP officials, there is a Tariff code for  wooden furniture, but there is not one for wooden bedroom furniture, for  which there is an AD order in effect. As a result, CBP needs to examine the  invoices for every entry of wooden furniture from China to see if it falls  within the scope of the AD order. This is very labor intensive and creates  an opportunity for companies to circumvent the duties. Extending the  amount of time for CBP to liquidate entries subject to AD/CV duties could  reduce the potential for entries to be \u201cdeemed liquidated,\u201d which can lead  to foregone revenue if additional duties should have been paid. However,  extending this time frame could delay refunds to some importers.

This problem was first widely  recognized after 2000, and has gained increased prominence and visibility  based on annual public reporting by CBP. However, a recent change in  U.S. law eliminated the legal requirement that generated CBP\u2019s reporting  on uncollected AD/CV duties.", "While Congress and the relevant agencies have taken some steps in recent  years, they have not yet fully addressed the factors contributing to  uncollected AD/CV duties, and serious risks remain. Some of these factors  stem from shortfalls in the capabilities and operation of the relevant  agencies.

Adjustments such as altering  importers\u2019 bond requirements would protect additional revenue, but also  could have significant implications for the trade community and our  trading partners, which would need to be carefully considered. Providing  Commerce with the discretion to establish a minimum level of exports  needed to qualify for a special new shipper review could reduce the  possibility of uncollected AD/CV duties and would affect both legitimate  and illegitimate importers and exporters. On the other hand, additional  analysis is required to determine whether eliminating the retrospective  aspect of the duty collection process could help achieve the AD/CV duty  system\u2019s intended purposes more effectively.

We identified entries involving a company undergoing a new shipper  review as those where the importer was allowed to post a bond to secure  AD/CV duties after the AD/CV duty order was issued. In addition, we  needed to select only those entries involving one entry line because CBP\u2019s  data regarding open, unpaid bills do not separate out the amount  attributable to individual AD/CV duty orders if multiple orders were  involved.
