To  date, integrated flight tests have demonstrated basic functionality of a  representative ballistic missile defense system using surrogate and  prototype components, and have shown success in intercepting a mock  reentry vehicle in a developmental test environment. The first flight test  consisting of components closest to the configuration of the September  2004 initial defensive capability is IFT-14, which is currently scheduled for  the third quarter of fiscal year 2004. The test will incorporate Block 2004  prototypes of the interceptor booster and kill vehicle of the configuration  intended for operational use beginning in September 2004. In addition, the  first tactical build of the battle management software will be utilized in  IFT-14. However, interceptors will not be launched out of Fort Greeley in  IFT-14 and IFT-15 (the remaining integrated flight tests to be conducted  before September 2004).", "In commenting on a draft of this report, MDA stated that while it cannot  address all technical concerns for the initial fielding, it has added the  following activities:    Enhanced producibility, quality, and reliability efforts.", "Increased operational focus in the developmental program, e.g., military  utility and effectiveness assessments.", "Expanded command and control, battle management, and operator  integration in BMDS testing to support fielding of initial defensive  capabilities in 2004.", "MDA also stated that the results of these program decisions are intended  to provide a comprehensive program that demonstrates operational  effectiveness and military utility against credible threats in an operational  environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness of September 2004 and December 2005 Initial Defensive Capability", "paragraphs": ["System effectiveness is characterized in terms of the following four  performance metrics: (1) defended area, (2) launch area denied,  (3) probability of engagement success, and (4) raid size breakpoint.  Defended area is the portion of the United States protected against  long-range missile attacks and, as a metric, is usually reported relative to  a single threat country or region; launch area denied simply refers to the  collection of threat countries from which the United States is protected.  The probability of engagement success is the probability that all attacking  warheads are destroyed, derived from the probabilities associated with  missile defense functions like detection, discrimination, and hit-to-kill.  Finally, raid size breakpoint is the maximum number of warheads the  system can realistically defeat in a single engagement. This metric is highly  dependent on interceptor inventory.", "A detailed discussion of GMD\u2019s expected effectiveness is presented in the  classified June 2003 version of this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Factors Affecting System Performance", "paragraphs": ["A notable limitation of the effectiveness of the September 2004 initial  defensive capability\u2014and possibly the December 2005 capability\u2014 pertains to the inability of system radars to perform target discrimination.  Neither the Cobra Dane radar nor the upgraded early warning radar at  Beale is capable of performing rigorous discrimination, a function  achievable only by the X-band radar. Rather, both radars will utilize  common \u201ctarget classification\u201d software that enables them to classify  objects as threatening or non-threatening. For example, debris would be  classified as non-threatening, but objects like deployment buses and decoy  replicas would be classified as threatening. Accordingly, the system would  have to rely solely on the kill vehicle for a final target selection.", "The assessment of kill vehicle discrimination is, therefore, critical for  understanding the capability of the deployed system, a point made in the  DOT&E report. Appropriately, the GMD prime contractor tracks the  discrimination capability of the kill vehicle as a technical performance  measure. The prime contractor\u2019s December 2002 assessment rated the kill  vehicle discrimination performance as meeting expectations based on  analysis and simulation.", "Lastly, measures of system suitability like availability and vulnerability\u2014 which complement system effectiveness\u2014are important for characterizing  the initial defensive capability as a whole. MDA is aiming for full-time  operations but faces risks in achieving this goal. Details on system  availability and vulnerability are provided in our June 2003  classified report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since DOT&E issued its August 2000 report, DOD has altered its approach  to the acquisition of missile defense systems to one that follows a  \u201ccapability-based\u201d strategy. The new approach allows MDA to evolve and  demonstrate additional improvements in missile defense systems before  committing to procurement and operations. MDA\u2019s test program for all  missile defense elements, such as GMD, was also reoriented to focus on  the development and use of the BMDS Test Bed. Over time, the Test Bed  should facilitate testing that address many of DOT&E\u2019s recommendations,  especially those pertaining to flight test realism, complexity, and  artificialities. However, most of the agency\u2019s actions with respect to  DOT&E\u2019s ground testing recommendations, namely, those pertaining to  comprehensive hardware-in-the-loop testing of the kill vehicle have been  deferred. In addition, MDA is proceeding slowly with the flight testing  against certain countermeasures, which DOT&E noted are simple for an  enemy to implement. These unresolved concerns in the test program  warrant attention by DOT&E and the test community in general. Given the  importance of ground testing and discrimination testing for understanding  system effectiveness, decision makers in the Congress and Office of the  Secretary of Defense would benefit from having information on the  agency\u2019s progress in these matters as they consider investments in  developing the ballistic missile defense system. As an independent office  that reviews DOD\u2019s weapon system testing and the office that made the  recommendations discussed in this report, DOT&E would be in a good  position to provide such information to decision makers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["As a means of providing decision makers with critical information when  investments in missile defense are considered, we recommend that  DOT&E report periodically, as it deems appropriate, on the status of  MDA\u2019s actions taken or planned in response to the August 2000  recommendations. In its review, DOT&E should include information and  recommendations, as warranted, on MDA\u2019s progress and planning (1) to  improve hardware-in-the-loop testing of the kill vehicle, (2) to test kill  vehicle components in nuclear environments, and (3) to test the GMD  element\u2019s capability to defeat likely and simple near-term  countermeasures during integrated flight tests.

For example, the DOT&E report issued in  February 2003, FY02 Assessment of the Missile Defense Agency Ballistic  Missile Defense System, continued to highlight the need for a  comprehensive hardware-in-the-loop capability to test the kill vehicle  under the stress of real physical phenomena and to test the kill vehicle\u2019s  discrimination capability. We do recognize that a number of  recommendations for which no actions are currently planned, such as  those recommendations dealing with flight testing during Initial  Operational Test and Evaluation, are a direct result of MDA\u2019s new  acquisition approach.", "The department is correct in stating that we did not address the capability  of the envisioned ballistic missile defense system as a whole in defeating  midcourse countermeasures. However, we do note that a system-level  discrimination architecture would use a network of ground- and space- based sensors to formulate a \u201cdiscrimination solution.\u201d Also, given the  early stages of development of the envisioned layered system, including  boost-phase intercept, the value of this strategy has not been  demonstrated.", "Although the department agreed that DOT&E should report periodically  on the status of MDA\u2019s actions to address the August 2000 DOT&E  recommendations, it did not believe additional reporting is required to  track their resolution. The department pointed out that our  recommendation grants DOT&E discretionary reporting authority  where mandatory reporting already exists. We believe, however, the  recommendation is worded appropriately. Existing statutory reporting  requirements for DOT&E on the adequacy and sufficiency of the missile  defense test program do not require that the August 2000 DOT&E  recommendations be specifically addressed. We worded the  recommendation to highlight the areas we believe DOT&E should  address\u2014hardware-in-the-loop testing of the kill vehicle, testing of  kill vehicle components in nuclear environments, and testing the  GMD element\u2019s capability to defeat likely and simple near-term  countermeasures\u2014and to give DOT&E the discretion to address our  recommendation in the manner it deems appropriate.
