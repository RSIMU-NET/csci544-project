In this report, MEP collectively refer to all state, federal, and university manufacturing extension programs.", "In the current climate of federal budget reductions, Congress is reevaluating its funding of MEP through NIST. One issue Congress is considering is whether MEP services have helped improve companies\u2019 business performance. This report responds to your request that we obtain manufacturers\u2019 views regarding the impact of MEP services on their business performance and the factors that affected the impact and delivery of MEP services.", "To identify the impact of MEP services on manufacturers\u2019 business performance, we conducted a national survey of manufacturers who had received substantive services from MEP in 1993. The survey asked manufacturers to assess the impact of MEP assistance on various aspects of their business performance. In our August 1995 briefing report to you, we summarized the overall impact of MEP assistance on the business performance of manufacturers we surveyed, and presented the views of a number of companies that had not used MEP services. We reported that about 73 percent (or 389) of 535 respondents indicated that they believed MEP assistance had positively affected their overall business performance. About 15 percent (or 82) reported they believed MEP assistance had not affected their overall business performance. In addition, most respondents reported that MEP assistance had positively affected their use of technology in the workplace (about 63 percent), the quality of their product (about 61 percent), and their customers\u2019 satisfaction (about 56 percent). This report presents our conclusions from further analysis of our national survey results. These results cannot be generalized to all manufacturers that used MEP.", "Our objectives for this report were to (1) identify factors that may have contributed to the positive impact on overall business performance reported by the majority of survey respondents; (2) determine whether companies\u2019 expectations were met regarding the impact of MEP assistance on specific business performance indicators, such as manufacturing time frames and labor productivity; and (3) determine whether companies thought that MEP actually demonstrated attributes they valued most, such as MEP staff expertise, timely assistance, and reasonably priced fees.

MEP engage in a variety of activities to assist small- and medium-sized manufacturers, often in partnership with other business assistance providers such as Small Business Development Centers, community colleges, and federal laboratories. MEP offer a wide range of business services, including helping companies (1) solve individual manufacturing problems, (2) obtain training for their workers, (3) create marketing plans, and (4) upgrade their equipment and computers. MEP assistance focuses on small- and medium-sized manufacturers because research by the National Research Council and others has indicated that these companies lack the resources necessary to improve their manufacturing performance.", "MEP funding typically comes from a variety of sources, which may include federal and state government agencies, universities, private industry, and fees. Between fiscal years 1988 and 1994 Congress appropriated a total of $141.7 million (in 1994 dollars) to MEP through NIST. Fiscal year 1995 appropriations were $104 million. State or local agencies are to provide matching funds for NIST grants to individual MEP. A 1995 Battelle Memorial Institute report estimated that states collectively spent about $57.7 million specifically on MEP in fiscal year 1994. That same fiscal year, federal MEP spending was $66 million. We were not able to determine the amount of MEP funding from other sources of support, including universities, private industry, and users\u2019 fees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This report analyzes data from questionnaires we sent to 766 manufacturers that had completed at least 40 hours of MEP assistance in 1993 in one or more of four service categories. We obtained the names of these manufacturers from the directors of 57 MEP in 34 states. A total of 551 manufacturers (72 percent) completed and returned the questionnaire. We also interviewed eight manufacturers who had received MEP services and were given tours of their manufacturing facilities in Maryland, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Appendix II provides more details on our scope and methodology.", "In assessing the impact of MEP services on their companies\u2019 overall business performance, 13 percent of survey respondents reported an extremely positive impact, 59 percent reported a generally positive impact, and 15 percent reported no impact. (Less than 1 percent of respondents (0.2 percent) said the assistance had had a negative impact.) We analyzed the likelihood of the companies reporting that the impact of MEP assistance on their overall business performance was extremely positive, somewhat positive, or not positive, depending on various company and program characteristics identified through the survey. We analyzed how the reported impact of MEP assistance related to the companies\u2019 reported age, 1994 gross sales, and number of permanent employees. Also, we analyzed the reported impact of MEP assistance in relation to the companies\u2019 activities associated with the assistance\u2014whether they made financial investments, spent staff time, implemented recommendations, and paid for the assistance. In addition, we analyzed how the reported impact of MEP assistance varied according to whether programs received NIST funds.", "We used logistic regression techniques to determine which factors were statistically significant in predicting the reported impact of MEP assistance on companies\u2019 overall business performance. The strength of these particular statistical techniques is that they allowed us to estimate the individual influence of each factor on the reported impact, both before and after the influences of all other relevant factors identified in the survey were controlled. Appendix III provides more detailed information on our methodology, the models tested, and the results obtained.", "We used simple frequency distributions to determine whether the companies\u2019 expectations were met regarding the impact of MEP assistance on specific business performance indicators and to analyze whether MEP demonstrated the attributes most valued by the companies.", "Results from our work cannot be generalized to all companies that used MEP because our questionnaire covered only companies that had completed at least 40 hours of MEP assistance. In addition, our results do not apply to all MEP services because we limited our analysis to four MEP service categories.", "Since we did not evaluate the operations or management of specific federal programs, we did not obtain agency comments on this report. However, on February 12, 1996, we discussed a draft of this report with NIST officials, including the Director of the NIST Manufacturing Extension Partnership Program. He agreed with the technical accuracy of the report and offered minor clarifications, which we incorporated into the report where appropriate.", "We did our work primarily in Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., from February 1995 to January 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Factors That Influenced the Impact of MEP Assistance on Companies\u2019 Overall Business Performance", "paragraphs": ["We analyzed several factors related to company and program funding characteristics to determine whether they influenced the companies\u2019 assessment of the impact of MEP assistance on their overall business performance. We found that several company characteristics\u2014relating to company level of involvement with MEP assistance, and company size and age\u2014influenced the companies\u2019 assessment of the impact of MEP assistance on their overall business performance. However, the program funding characteristic we examined\u2014whether the program received NIST funds\u2014did not influence the companies\u2019 assessment of the impact of MEP assistance.", "We found that the level of companies\u2019 involvement played an important role in determining the outcome of MEP assistance. The manufacturers that had made financial investments in their company as a result of MEP assistance were 2.5 times more likely than those that did not to report an \u201cextremely positive\u201d impact on their overall business performance, as opposed to a \u201cgenerally positive\u201d impact. They also were 5.6 times as likely to report a generally positive impact as opposed to a \u201cneutral\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d impact. Companies whose staff spent relatively more time in activities related to MEP assistance were 1.7 times more likely to report an extremely positive impact of MEP assistance on their overall business performance, as opposed to a generally positive impact.", "Furthermore, the relatively small companies, which research has indicated are most in need of modernization assistance, were most likely to report that their overall business performance was improved by MEP assistance. According to the National Research Council, small- and medium-sized manufacturers generally lack the expertise, time, money, and information necessary to improve their manufacturing performance. We found through our survey that the companies whose fiscal year 1994 gross sales were less than $1 million were 3.1 times more likely to assess the impact of MEP assistance as extremely positive, as opposed to generally positive. Likewise, the companies started since 1985 were 2.0 times as likely as the older companies to report an extremely positive effect of MEP assistance on their overall business performance, as opposed to a generally positive effect.", "Our visits to manufacturers provided examples of how MEP assistance benefited growing companies. A furniture manufacturer said his company needed MEP assistance to make fewer mistakes in the growth process. This manufacturer said he used MEP experts to help identify and correct environmental and worker safety hazards, so the facility would comply with federal workplace standards. At a company that makes molded plastics, the company president said that the company needed MEP assistance to guide its rapid growth. MEP helped this company with strategic management, planning, worker training, and quality improvement.", "Our survey revealed no significant differences in how the companies viewed the impact on their overall business performance of MEP that did and did not receive NIST funds. MEP funding typically comes from a variety of sources, which may include federal and state government agencies, universities, industries, and fees. The combination of funding sources varies across programs, but our analysis revealed no significant distinction in how the companies assessed the impact of MEP that did and did not receive NIST funds. Specifically, MEP that received NIST funds were equally as likely as other MEP to have their impact on business performance rated positively by the companies. In commenting on our analysis, NIST officials said that, given the manufacturers\u2019 positive responses to our survey, they expected no difference in how the manufacturers viewed the impact of MEP that did and did not receive NIST funds. Moreover, they said that the function of NIST funding is to help MEP serve more clients, with a wider variety of services. Also, they said that they believed NIST support improves programs\u2019 efficiency and effectiveness, which are dimensions of MEP that our survey did not address."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improvements to Specific Business Performance Indicators Met Most Companies\u2019 Expectations", "paragraphs": ["As part of our analysis, we compared what the companies said they expected from MEP assistance to the results they reported. We found that most of the companies (between 61 and 77 percent) reported that MEP assistance met or exceeded their expectations for improvements to specific business performance indicators, such as manufacturing time frames, the quality of market research, and sales to new and repeat customers. However, between 23 and 39 percent of the companies reported that their expectations were not met for improvements to these indicators.", "Our survey results indicate that equipment modernization and plant layout assistance improved manufacturing time frames for most of the companies expecting these improvements (see fig. 1). In particular, the survey results indicate that equipment modernization and plant layout assistance met or exceeded the expectations of a substantial number of the companies for reducing cycle times\u2014the times required by machines or work stations to fully complete their sequence of operations (77 percent)\u2014and setup time\u2014the time it takes to prepare equipment for changes to production (76 percent). In addition, the assistance met a large number of the companies\u2019 expectations for improvements to worker output (76 percent). However, about 30 percent of companies we surveyed that received equipment modernization and plant layout assistance reported that they did not have their expectations met for reductions to manufacturing lead time, the time it took them to process an order, from start to finish, after design approval.", "Several companies commented on how MEP assistance affected their efforts to improve plant layout and modernize equipment. One manufacturer that we visited said the company was able to solve problems with congestion and redundant product movement on the plant floor after implementing MEP plant layout recommendations. The company was rewarded with faster production and lower costs. Another manufacturer responding to our survey commented that, by modernizing equipment and improving plant layout, the company was better able to meet its delivery schedules and, thus, satisfy its customers\u2019 needs.", "Most of the companies that received product design and development assistance reported in our survey that they achieved anticipated improvements to quality (see fig. 2). In particular, large proportions of these companies reported fewer incomplete product development projects (77 percent) and improved quality of market research (71 percent). Most of the comments we received regarding product design and development assistance were positive. For example, one respondent commented that the assistance it received made it possible for the company to develop a process that it could not have developed on its own. However, not all companies shared such views. One respondent wrote that it took too much management time to work with MEP consultants, and he felt that the company had educated the consultants, and not vice versa.", "Our survey also indicated that most companies\u2019 expectations for reduced product design and development time frames were satisfied. Seventy percent of the companies reported they received anticipated reductions in the time needed to get new products to market. One survey respondent commented about the importance of MEP assistance in getting a new product to market, noting that the assistance helped the company to overcome equipment problems, which freed the company to market new machine technology. Despite positive assessments such as these, our survey results show that product design and development assistance met fewer of the companies\u2019 expectations for reducing costs of product development (66 percent) and increasing access to new customers (65 percent), compared to other business performance indicators.", "Between 61 and 74 percent of the companies we surveyed that expected quality improvement assistance to bolster specific business performance indicators were satisfied with the results they received (see fig. 3). A substantial percentage of the companies had their expectations fulfilled regarding increased sales to repeat customers (74 percent) and new customers (69 percent). However, our results indicate that, for 39 percent of the companies, quality improvement assistance did not meet expectations for reducing rework and scrap levels.", "Customer satisfaction was an important goal of the companies seeking quality improvement assistance. Ninety-four percent of the companies we surveyed regarding quality improvement assistance said they sought the assistance in order to enhance their competitive position in the marketplace. In interviews, several manufacturers told us that they undertook quality improvement initiatives in order to retain and attract customers. They said that an increasing number of customers had high expectations for the quality of products. For example, at a foundry we visited, the company president said that many customers of foundry products were reducing the number of suppliers and were working on a closer, more long-term basis with the remaining suppliers. He said that this new customer-supplier relationship put more emphasis on quality than ever before and that it was extremely important to guarantee quality in order to retain customers.

A senior company official told us that MEP brought experts in training, engineering, and human resources to help the company reverse this decline and benefit from the machinery upgrade.", "Most respondents looking for timely and affordable assistance said they found it through MEP. About 92 percent of the survey respondents rated timely assistance as an important MEP attribute, and 83 percent said they were satisfied with the timeliness of the assistance provided by the program they had used. Ninety-one percent of respondents rated reasonably priced MEP service fees and project proposals as important MEP attributes, and most were satisfied with the price of fees and proposals costs at their own program. Eighty percent of respondents who paid fees were satisfied that the fees were reasonable, and about 81 percent of respondents were satisfied that their program had project proposal costs within their financial means. Three hundred twenty-eight survey respondents (60 percent) paid a fee for MEP assistance. Of those, 58 percent said that the value added or worth of the assistance was worth more than what they paid for it, 27 percent said the assistance was worth about what they paid, and 11 percent said the assistance was worth less than the fee they had paid.", "As agreed with you, unless you announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 14 days after the date of this letter.

For the purpose of our study, we considered programs to be relevant if their primary function was to provide direct technical assistance to individual manufacturers, using program staff or supervised consultants. We defined \u201ctechnical assistance\u201d as one or more of the following activities: providing access to and encouraging the use of innovative and/or off-the-shelf manufacturing technologies and processes; disseminating scientific, engineering, technical, and management providing access to industry-related expertise and capability in university research departments; and transferring advanced manufacturing (i.e., cutting edge) technologies and techniques to companies.", "Our definition excluded business assistance programs such as the Small Business Administration\u2019s Small Business Development Centers; business incubators; financial assistance, funding, and grant programs; joint research ventures with universities and/or federal laboratories; on-line technical data base services; and industry networks.", "We located 80 MEP that met our criteria for inclusion and had been established before 1994. We used reports from the National Governor\u2019s Association, the Northeast-Midwest Institute, and the Battelle Memorial Institute in Ohio that contained references to existing MEP as the basis for identifying programs that would possibly fit our criteria. We confirmed and updated information in these reports by conducting structured telephone interviews with all programs that we believed matched our criteria. We interviewed officials from a total of 114 programs in 40 states. Eighty of them met our criteria for inclusion and had been established before January 1994.", "Fifty-seven of the 80 MEP that qualified for our study supplied us with the names of clients that met our survey criteria. Thirteen of these MEP received NIST funding for fiscal year 1994, accounting for 36 percent of survey respondents. In an effort to determine if the qualified programs that provided client information differed from the qualified programs that did not, we compared the two sets of programs on the basis of program age, total funding, federal funding, and type of administration. The results of the comparisons indicated that there were no significant differences between MEP that did and did not provide client data.", "We asked the 57 participating MEP to select from their records all manufacturers that met specific criteria that we developed in consultation with MEP officials and MEP evaluation experts. The client had to meet the following criteria: It had to be a manufacturing facility, which means that its products had to belong to one or more of the manufacturing categories in the Department of Commerce\u2019s Standard Industrial Classification codes. Our survey excluded nonmanufacturing facilities, such as service providers or farmers. It had to have received at least 40 hours of MEP assistance in 1993. Thus, when the facility received our survey in early 1995, at least 1 year would have elapsed since the MEP assistance ended. MEP evaluation experts have told us that 1 year would have been sufficient time for facilities to be able to gauge the value of the assistance and its impact on their business performance. Experts also have told us that 40 hours would have been enough assistance to have had a potential effect on a manufacturer\u2019s business performance. It had to have completed assistance in one or more of the four categories defined in the following paragraph. In cases in which a manufacturer completed more than one type of assistance, we asked the MEP official to choose the primary assistance provided to the manufacturer (i.e., the assistance requiring the most MEP time and/or resources).", "We did not verify the client information MEP provided against the programs\u2019 records.", "The assistance categories we included in our survey involved the following: Quality improvement.

They are types of assistance that MEP typically offer clients, so our survey potentially could include clients from most MEP. Also, the four types of assistance are defined in a similar way by most MEP, according to MEP officials. Other MEP services (such as worker training and strategic business planning) may vary considerably from one program to another.", "Finally, we selected types of assistance that were directed at clients\u2019 manufacturing operations. MEP clients receiving operations-related assistance were able to tell us (1) how they expected the assistance would affect their operations and/or performance and (2) whether or not these expectations were met. Other types of MEP assistance\u2014examples are material engineering, electronic data exchange, and computer upgrading\u2014have effects on manufacturers\u2019 operations that are less visible and less easily measured. As a result, manufacturers may have difficulty determining the expected and actual impact of these types of services on their business operations and performance.", "We designed four questionnaires, each focusing on one assistance category. In designing our survey questions, we obtained input from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and MEP officials, MEP evaluation experts, and managers at manufacturing facilities. We also reviewed client surveys that MEP used.", "Each questionnaire contained identical questions to obtain background information about the respondent and to get respondents\u2019 views on the impact of MEP services on their business performance and the factors affecting the impact of MEP services. However, the four surveys also had unique questions asking about the expected and actual outcomes of the assistance, because each type of assistance focuses on a different aspect of manufacturers\u2019 operations. We tailored these questions to ask about the kind of impacts that reasonably could be expected to result from the particular kind of assistance received.", "As part of our survey development, we tested all four surveys with manufacturers who had received MEP assistance in Texas, Iowa, New York, and Kansas. We chose those states in order to cover diverse areas of the country where MEP are located. We also interviewed eight manufacturers who had received MEP services and were given tours of their manufacturing facilities in Maryland, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.

The factors included the following characteristics of those manufacturers: (1) the number of permanent employees as of January 1, 1995, (2) the number of hours company staff devoted to MEP assistance, (3) the year the company started operating, (4) the company\u2019s gross sales in fiscal year 1994, (5) whether the company paid any fees for MEP assistance, (6) whether the company made any financial investments as a result of the assistance, (7) whether the assistance included recommendations, and (8) the percentage of MEP recommendations the company implemented.

Each of these two indicators of company size were significantly related to assessments when the other indicator was ignored. However, when we controlled for gross annual sales, the effect of number of permanent employees was not statistically significant.", "The percentage of recommendations implemented was dropped from the multivariate analysis because there were too few responses to perform the analysis. Only 70 percent of the companies received recommendations and provided information on the percentage of recommendations implemented.", "Some of these factors had many categories. We used loglinear methods to determine which of those categories differed with respect to companies\u2019 assessment of the overall impact of MEP. We combined the categories that were not significantly different from one another. The categories which ultimately were contrasted with one another are given in the second column of table III.1. For the purpose of our analysis, the factors were used as the independent variables.", "We used simple bivariate logistic regression models to estimate the individual influence of each factor on the reported impact of MEP assistance, without controlling for the influence of all other relevant factors identified in the survey. We estimated which of the nine factors, as categorized in Table III.1, were related to (1) the odds on the overall impact of MEP being assessed as extremely positive versus generally positive and (2) the odds on the overall impact of MEP being assessed as generally positive versus negative or neutral. Our bivariate estimates are given as odds ratios in the third and fifth columns of table III.1.", "As can be seen in that table, seven of the nine factors had a significant relationship to the likelihood that companies assessed the impact of MEP assistance as extremely positive, as opposed to generally positive. In addition, four of the nine factors were significantly related to the odds of companies assessing the impact of MEP assistance as generally positive, as opposed to neutral or negative.", "The bivariate odds ratios have a straightforward interpretation. The odds ratio gives an estimate of how each factor, as categorized in column 2 of Table III.1, affected companies\u2019 assessment of MEP assistance. For example, the companies with 20-99 employees were more than twice as likely as the companies with 100 or more employees to assess the impact of MEP as extremely positive as opposed to generally positive. Likewise, the companies with less than 20 employees were more than twice as likely as the companies with 20 to 99 employees to assess the impact of MEP as extremely positive, as opposed to generally positive. Similar interpretations can be given to the other odds ratios in the table. The bivariate odds ratios are estimates that do not take into account the effects of other variables.", "We also undertook multivariate analysis of the data. Multivariate analysis also estimated the individual effect of each factor on the reported impact of MEP assistance, but it controlled for the influence of all other relevant factors. It is necessary to control for the influence of multiple factors because some factors are associated with others, making it impossible to isolate their individual effect on the dependent variable. Our multivariate analysis did not include two factors used in the bivariate analysis: the number of permanent employees and the percentage of recommendations companies had implemented.", "The odds ratios in the fourth and sixth columns of table III.1 provide the results of multivariate analysis. Odds ratios that are marked by an asterisk represent statistically significant effects. Five factors had significant effects on the odds of whether programs were assessed extremely positively as opposed to generally positively: (1) the number of company staff hours devoted to the assistance, (2) when the company started operating, (3) the company\u2019s 1994 fiscal year gross sales, (4) whether the company paid any fees for the assistance, and (5) whether the company made any financial investments as a result of the assistance. Only two factors had significant effects on whether assessments were generally positive as opposed to neutral or negative: (1) the number of company staff hours devoted to the assistance and (2) whether the company made any financial investments as a result of the assistance.", "Many of the significant effects from the multivariate analysis are quite sizable. For example, the companies that made financial investments were 2.5 times as likely as those that had not made financial investments to assess the impact of MEP assistance as extremely positive, as opposed to generally positive. The companies that made financial investments also were 5.6 times as likely as companies that had not made financial investments to assess the impact of MEP assistance as generally positive, as opposed to neutral or negative. Other odds ratios can be similarly interpreted.", "Our letter report features the results of the multivariate analysis. The multivariate estimates may differ from the bivariate estimates because the multivariate analysis controlled for the effects of all other factors when estimating the influence of one factor. Bivariate analysis estimates the influence of one factor without controlling for the effects of other factors. In general, the multivariate and bivariate estimates for each factor are similar, with two exceptions.", "The first exception is company staff hours devoted to MEP assistance. In the bivariate analysis, this factor was unrelated to whether companies assessed the impact of MEP assistance as extremely positive versus generally positive. However, multivariate results indicate that company staff hours were significantly related to companies\u2019 assessment of the impact of assistance as extremely positive, as opposed to generally positive. We believe that the significance varies because of a relationship between company size and the number of company staff hours spent on MEP assistance. In particular, larger companies devoted more staff hours to the program. In order to accurately assess the independent influence of company staff hours, we needed to control for company size. Our multivariate model controls for company size by including the variable that measures gross sales. Therefore, the multivariate model provides a more accurate assessment of the impact of company staff hours, independent of company size.", "The second exception was the factor measuring whether MEP assistance included recommendations. In our bivariate analysis, this variable was significantly related to both extremely positive and generally positive assessments. However, its significance disappeared in our multivariate analysis. Companies receiving recommendations were more likely to devote more staff hours to the program and to make financial investments as a result of MEP assistance. Therefore, when the multivariate analysis controlled for company staff hours spent on the assistance and financial investments made as a result of the assistance, the effect of recommendations was rendered insignificant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Government Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Susan S.
