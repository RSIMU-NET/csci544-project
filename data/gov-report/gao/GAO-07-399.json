This report examined (1) actions taken to improve the markets' capabilities to prevent and recover from attacks; (2) actions taken to improve disaster response and increase telecommunications resiliency; and (3) financial regulators' efforts to ensure market resiliency. GAO inspected physical and electronic security measures and business continuity capabilities using regulatory, government, and industry-established criteria and discussed improvement efforts with broker dealers, banks, regulators, telecommunications carriers, and trade associations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The critical securities markets organizations GAO reviewed have acted to significantly reduce the likelihood of physical disasters disrupting the functioning of U.S. securities markets. As of January 2007, the seven critical exchanges, markets, clearing organizations, and payment processors GAO reviewed have the capability of performing their critical functions at sites that are geographically dispersed from their primary sites. These organizations were also preparing plans to reduce the likelihood that a disease pandemic will disrupt their critical operations, although not all had fully completed such efforts. They also improved their physical and information security measures, including by taking actions that GAO identified during this review. Although key securities trading staff remain concentrated in single locations, the broker-dealers and clearing services banks that account for significant trading volumes and that GAO reviewed have increased the distances between their sites for primary and backup operations for clearance and settlement activities and established dispersed backup trading locations. Various private and public sector groups continued to enhance the preparedness of the financial sector, although resolving vulnerabilities in the telecommunications infrastructure remains a challenge. Securities industry organizations have continued to conduct annual industrywide tests of financial market participants' backup site operating capabilities, and key trading and clearing organizations are increasingly using communications networks that are less vulnerable to disruption to transmit information. After attempts to assist individual financial market participants to determine whether their own telecommunications lines were routed through single paths or switches proved difficult, regulators are assisting efforts to develop automated systems for identifying circuit paths. In response to concerns over whether the telecommunications infrastructure can absorb the increased demand likely to result from large numbers of organizations and individuals seeking to telecommute during a pandemic, financial regulators and market participants are assisting government efforts to model such events and develop potential solutions. To improve market resiliency, financial regulators established goals for prompt recovery of critical clearing activities after disasters and have been conducting examinations to ensure market participants' compliance. Securities regulators also set goals and are examining securities markets' readiness to resume trading and plan to do more focused reviews of individual broker-dealer capabilities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also has improved its program for overseeing operations issues at market and clearing organizations, including increasing its staffing levels and expertise. Securities and banking regulators have been actively addressing pandemic issues, but could better ensure that market participants prepare complete plans and have sufficient time to train employees and test these plans, by providing formal expectations that plans address even severe outbreaks and set dates for completing such plans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The massive destruction caused by the September 11, 2001, terrorist  attacks on the World Trade Center showed how the financial markets can  be significantly affected by such events. In several prior reports since the  attacks, we found that financial market participants\u2014including the  exchanges, clearing organizations, and broker-dealers and banks that  conduct trades and process payments\u2014and regulators had taken many  actions to reduce the risk that such disasters would disrupt the markets\u2019  operations in the future. However, we also reported that some of the  organizations that execute trades or perform clearance and settlement  processing essential to the functioning of the U.S. securities markets  lacked backup operating sites sufficiently distant from primary operating  locations, and thus were at a greater risk of disruption from wide-scale  events such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters that physically damage  facilities and infrastructure over a wide area. In addition, we reported that  although the broker-dealers that account for significant trading volumes  and the clearing banks that process payments associated with trading also  increased their ability to resume operations after such events, some still  were vulnerable to disruption by such disasters.", "As a result, our September 2004 report included recommendations to the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to assess whether the  improvements various broker-dealers implemented would be sufficient to  allow trading to resume after a disaster. In addition, we recommended that  SEC make various improvements to the program and staff that it uses to  oversee market security and business continuity issues. To assess whether  market participants and regulators have continued to ensure the security  and resiliency of our securities markets, you asked that we conduct a  review to document the progress these organizations have made since our  last report. Specifically, we assessed (1) actions critical securities market  organizations and key market participants have taken to improve their  business continuity capabilities for recovering from physical disasters,  electronic attacks, and pandemics and the measures they use to reduce  their vulnerabilities to such events; (2) actions taken by financial market  participants, telecommunications industry organizations, and others to  improve the ability of participants to respond to future disasters and  increase the resiliency of the telecommunications on which the markets  depend; and (3) financial regulators\u2019 efforts to ensure the resiliency of the  financial markets, including SEC\u2019s progress in improving its securities  market organization oversight program.", "In performing this work, we visited seven organizations\u2014which included  exchanges, clearing organizations, and payment system processors\u2014that  we categorized as critical because the products or services they offered or  the functions they performed were essential for the overall ability of the  U.S. securities markets to continue operations. We inspected various  physical and electronic security measures at these seven organizations and  reviewed their business continuity capabilities. In assessing the  organizations\u2019 physical and electronic security and business continuity  efforts, we used regulator-established criteria or criteria generally  accepted by government or industry. For our reviews, we reviewed  documentation and descriptions that market participants and regulators  provided and reviews that other organizations\u2014such as external  consultants or other government agencies\u2014had conducted. When feasible,  we also directly observed controls in place for physical security, electronic  security, and business continuity at the organizations assessed. We did not  test these controls by attempting to gain unauthorized entry or access to  facilities or information systems; we also did not directly observe testing  of business continuity capabilities. In addition to the critical organizations,  we also discussed the business continuity capabilities and improvements  of six large broker-dealers and banks, which collectively represented a  significant portion of trading and clearing volume for U.S. securities  markets. In addition, we reviewed documents from financial market  regulators, industry associations, a major telecommunications carrier, the  Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Homeland Security,  and interviewed their staffs about actions they have taken to improve the  resiliency of the financial markets and telecommunications service. To  assess regulators\u2019 oversight efforts, we reviewed relevant regulatory  guidance and examinations done by banking and securities regulators of  financial market organizations and key participants. We performed our  work from April 2006 through February 2007 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. For more information on the  scope and methodology of our review, please see appendix I. For security  reasons, we did not include the names of the organizations we reviewed or  their functions and locations in this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Various organizations must be able to operate for the U.S. securities  markets to function. Individual investors and institutions such as mutual  funds send their orders to buy and sell stocks and options to broker- dealers, which route them to be executed at one of the many exchanges or  electronic trading venues in the United States. After a securities trade is  executed, the process known as clearance and settlement occurs that  ensures the accuracy of the trade, transfers ownership of the securities  from the seller to the buyer, and exchanges the necessary payment  between these two parties. Separate organizations perform this process  for stocks and for options, while a single depository maintains records of  ownership for the bulk of the securities traded in the United States. Banks  participate in the U.S. securities markets by acting as clearing banks that  maintain accounts for broker-dealers to accept and make payments for  these firms\u2019 securities activities. The payments that are exchanged  between the banks of clearing organizations, broker-dealers, and their  customers are processed by systems operated by the Federal Reserve or  other private payment system processors. Virtually all of the information  processed is transferred between parties through telecommunications  systems; as a result, the securities markets depend heavily on the  telecommunications industry\u2019s supporting infrastructure.", "Although thousands of entities are active in the U.S. securities markets,  certain key participants are critical to the ability of the markets to  function. Some are more important than others because they offer unique  products or perform vital services. For example, markets cannot function  without the activities performed by clearing organizations; and in some  cases, only one clearing organization exists for particular products. In  addition, other market participants are critical to overall market  functioning because they consolidate and distribute price quotations or  information on executed trades. Other participants may be critical to the  overall functioning of the markets only in the aggregate. For example, if  one of the thousands of broker-dealers in the United States is unable to  operate, its customers may be inconvenienced or unable to trade, but the  impact on the markets as a whole might be limited to a reduced liquidity  or less price competitiveness. However, a small number of large broker- dealers account for sizeable portions of the daily trading volume on many  exchanges. If several of these large firms were unable or unwilling to  operate, the markets might not have sufficient trading volume to function  in an orderly or fair way.", "Several federal organizations oversee the various securities market  participants. SEC regulates the stock and options exchanges and the  clearing organizations for those products. In addition, SEC regulates the  broker-dealers that trade on those markets and other participants, such as  mutual funds, which are active investors. The exchanges also have  responsibilities as self-regulatory organizations (SRO) for ensuring that  their participants comply with the securities laws and these organizations\u2019  own rules. To oversee the operational risks at the securities exchanges  and clearing organizations, SEC published its Automation Review Policy in  1989, which advised SROs prospectively of SEC\u2019s expectations on how  these organizations should address information dissemination and  physical security and business continuity challenges. ARP staff conduct  reviews of how these organizations are addressing SEC\u2019s expectations in  these areas. Additionally, several federal organizations have regulatory  responsibilities over banks and other depository institutions, including  those active in the securities markets. The Federal Reserve oversees bank  holding companies and state-chartered banks that are members of the  Federal Reserve System. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  (OCC) examines nationally chartered banks.", "To ensure that the functioning of the financial markets is protected, the  financial sector is one of several key infrastructures that the United States  has designated as critical to our nation. To protect these infrastructures,  the Homeland Security Act of 2002 created the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) and gave it wide-ranging responsibilities for leading and  coordinating the overall protection effort for the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 further defines  these responsibilities for DHS and those federal agencies given  responsibility for particular industry sectors such as telecommunications  or banking and finance, known as sector-specific agencies. The  Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is the federal agency responsible  for infrastructure protection activities in the banking and finance sector,  which includes coordinating and collaborating with relevant federal  agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector.", "The threats for which organizations in the financial and other critical  sectors must be prepared vary. As the events of September 11 illustrated,  terrorist activity can pose a significant threat to U.S. entities. Events such  as attempts to bomb key facilities can significantly impair the operations  of an affected organization and events involving nuclear, radiological, or  chemical hazards could cause substantial damage to key facilities or  necessary infrastructure over a wide area or render such facilities and  infrastructure inaccessible for extended periods. Similarly, major natural  disasters such as hurricanes, tornados, or earthquakes also can result in  wide-scale damage or make areas inaccessible just about anywhere in the  United States. In addition to events that cause physical damage, financial  market organizations remain a prime target for individuals or  organizations seeking to use cyber attacks to obtain unauthorized access  or prevent legitimate users from accessing the key networks and systems  upon which the financial markets depend. Moreover, concern has grown  about the threat of an influenza pandemic and the impact it could have on  the operations of entities in the United States, including those in the  financial markets. With individuals in other countries having already have  fallen ill and died as a result of the H5N1 strain of avian flu, the U.S.  government is urging all businesses to prepare for a pandemic. The  pandemic threat is different than those previously envisioned because it  could affect large numbers of people simultaneously, with waves of illness  occurring for weeks at a time over the course of several months."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Market Organizations Have Significantly Improved Their Ability to Withstand Physical Disasters, Although Pandemic Planning Remains Challenging", "paragraphs": ["Since our last report, all seven organizations whose operations we  considered critical to the overall functioning of U.S. securities markets  have in place business continuity capabilities that reduce their  vulnerability to disruption by a wide-scale disaster. These capabilities  include having backup operating sites that have staff capable of  performing the organizations\u2019 critical tasks and that are geographically  distant from their primary operating locations. All seven critical  organizations have taken steps to reduce the likelihood that power and  telecommunications outages will affect their operations and all have  tested their business continuity capabilities by running simulations or  performing live processing of their primary activities from backup  locations. All seven critical organizations are developing business  continuity plans to address the risk of infectious pandemics, although at  the time we reviewed these organizations only one had fully developed a  plan that incorporates the various elements needed to address such an  occurrence. Each of the seven organizations also has continued to  enhance the measures it uses to prevent physical attacks from disrupting  its operations, with those that still had vulnerabilities using their business  continuity capabilities to mitigate those weaknesses. Each organization  continued to improve the information security measures intended to  mitigate the risk of electronic attacks, including taking or considering  additional actions we identified that could further improve their  information security. Representing many of the most active market  participants, the large broker-dealers and banks that we contacted also  have continued to improve their disaster-recovery capabilities. Although  by maintaining their trading staff in single locations increases the risk that  they will be unable to resume activities promptly after a wide-scale  disaster, the major broker-dealers we reviewed have implemented various  measures to mitigate such risks, including cross-training staff and  establishing dispersed backup trading locations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Critical Financial Market Organizations Have Developed Business Continuity Capabilities to Help Address the Risk of Wide-Scale Disasters", "paragraphs": ["Since our 2004 report, all the critical organizations have established  business continuity capabilities that reduce the likelihood that a wide- scale physical disaster would disrupt their key operations. When we last  reported, four of the seven organizations had established backup sites  capable of performing the key activities they needed to be operational and  located them at considerable distances from their primary sites to reduce  the likelihood that a disaster, even a wide-scale event, would render both  locations unusable. However, at that time, we also reported that three of  the critical organizations lacked business continuity capabilities that likely  would have allowed them to resume operations shortly after such  disasters. For example, one of these organizations had a backup site that it  could use to conduct its key activities, but this site was within a few miles  of its primary location and therefore also could have been rendered  unusable in a wide-scale disaster.", "As of September 2006, all seven critical organizations now have  geographically distant backup sites or other means of conducting their key  operations. For example, one of the organizations previously lacking a  geographically dispersed site has completed a new data center that is  more than 1000 miles from its primary operating locations and that now is  capable of conducting all the key processing that the organization would  need to be operational. Because the distance between sites is too great to  allow both the primary and the backup site to process identical data  simultaneously, the organization has implemented a proprietary hardware  based data replication technology that ensures that copies of all  production data and processing results from the primary sites are stored  and then transmitted to the remote site. Since installing this technology,  the organization\u2019s staff indicated that it has significantly reduced the time  required to have the remote site take over operations to less than 2 hours  with less than a minute of data loss if a disaster were to affect both  primary processing sites. Rather than establishing a geographically distant  site that exactly duplicates its primary site, another of these three  organizations instead acquired the capability to conduct its critical trading  activities through an electronic system whose processing location is  located more than 700 miles from the organization\u2019s current operating site.  Finally, to better ensure that it would be able to operate in the aftermath  of a wide-scale disaster, the last of these three organizations installed  hardware capable of performing its critical processing operations at a site  that is more than 200 miles from its current primary operating location.", "In addition to these three organizations, the other four have also improved  their business continuity capabilities to further reduce their vulnerability  to such events. For example, one organization that when we last reported  had established a backup data center more than 700 miles from its  headquarters and primary operating location changed how it operates so  that it now conducts its live critical business processing from the  geographically distant site and uses its former primary processing site as  its backup location. According to the staff of this organization, they  transferred the operations to the more distant site because it is located in  an area they deemed at lower risk than its current headquarters and  former processing location, which is located in a downtown urban area  that they believe is more likely to be at risk for terrorist activities than the  new primary processing location. Although the organization likely may  have reduced its risk of disruption from terrorist activities, its new primary  location may be at greater risk of damage from natural disasters, such as  hurricanes or tornados, than its headquarters location. When we last  reported, another of the critical organizations had three locations at which  it could conduct its critical processing operations; a primary operating  site, a secondary site that could quickly take over processing if a disaster  damaged the primary site, and a tertiary site that could become  operational within 24 hours if the backup site were not available. Since  then, this organization lowered its vulnerability to disruption by changing  the configuration of its data centers to provide greater distance between  its primary and secondary sites, increasing the distance between these  sites by hundreds of miles. In addition, two organizations have increased  their recovery capabilities by establishing sites hundreds of miles from the  primary site that are capable of monitoring and operating critical networks  at the primary location. These remote command centers give the  organizations the ability to maintain or resume operations if their primary  site became inaccessible, but was not destroyed.", "By establishing these dispersed operating capabilities, all the organizations  have addressed another potential weakness\u2014the concentration of staff in  one location or a geographic area\u2014that previously increased their  vulnerability to a wide-scale disaster. When we last reported in 2004,  several of the critical organizations faced greater risk that their operations  could be disrupted by disasters because the staff they needed to perform  their critical business operations were located in just one location or in  multiple locations near each other. However, now all seven organizations  have taken steps to ensure that they will have staff capable of performing  their critical activities in the event of a wide-scale disaster, either by  establishing backup operating locations or making other arrangements to  have sufficient staff to conduct the organizations\u2019 critical operations.  These operations include backup data-processing centers and alternative  site business operating centers that have staff that perform critical non- data-processing activities, such as assisting customers or performing  activities requiring manual processing."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Critical Organizations also Have Improved Their Telecommunications and Power Resiliency and Tested Their Business Continuity Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["The seven critical market organizations also have reduced the likelihood  that their operations would be disrupted by disasters that affect their  power or telecommunications services. For example, all organizations  installed generators capable of supplying their operations sites with power  if they lose power from their local utility. These organizations generally  had fuel supplies on hand that would be sufficient to run these generators  from 3 to 7 days. During the August 2003 power failure that affected the  Northeast, all seven critical organizations successfully provided service to  their customers and members without interruption.", "Similarly, the organizations also all have taken steps to reduce the  likelihood that they would lose their telecommunications service. For  example, all the organizations had registered the circuits that carry their  important telecommunications traffic with the National Communications  System\u2019s Telecommunications Service Priority (TSP) program, which  would provide increased priority for restoration of these key circuits in the  event of a disruption. Several of the organizations also now increasingly  receive information from their members through more resilient  telecommunications networks. For example, the Secure Financial  Transaction Infrastructure (SFTI) was created to provide a more reliable  and \u201csurvivable\u201d private communications network that links exchanges,  clearing organizations, and other financial market participants. To ensure  resiliency and eliminate single points of failure, SFTI employs redundant  equipment throughout, and carries data traffic over redundant fiber-optic  rings that have geographically and physically diverse routes. To improve  the resilience of the communications for clearing securities transactions,  the Securely Managed and Reliable Technology (SMART) network has  been created that allows market participants to exchange information with  clearing organizations over private high-bandwidth networks that  automatically route traffic over alternate paths in the event that any part of  the network is damaged. In addition, one of the critical organizations we  reviewed formerly received data from its broker-dealer customers through  direct connections to its data centers\u2014often from just a single customer\u2019s  location. However, this organization now has a network configuration in  which the customers connect at multiple points to a new redundant fiber- optic ring network, reducing the likelihood that customers would be  unable to communicate with the organization.", "Moreover, the seven critical organizations have tested their business  continuity capabilities and plans\u2014although some more fully assessed the  ability of their backup arrangements than others. Routinely using or  testing recovery and resumption arrangements ensures that backup  arrangements can perform critical operations and that all customers or  others that must connect to an organization are able to do so. Some of the  critical organizations have conducted very robust testing of their ability to  operate from other locations outside their primary location. For example,  at least two of the critical organizations operated data centers that receive  all the data needed to process their operations and had run live processing  for actual business days from their non-primary locations. In contrast,  another organization regularly tested the operational condition and  connectivity of its equipment at its back up site and ran exercises with  small numbers of staff at this site to simulate its critical activities, but had  never attempted to conduct an actual business day from this backup  location. One organization had used the systems it would need to operate  if its primary location were damaged for some live processing but had not  yet fully tested whether these systems had adequate capacity to process  the organization\u2019s full operating volume of data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Organizations also Have Begun to Address Risk of Pandemics", "paragraphs": ["In recognition of the increased concerns of a pandemic influenza  outbreak, the seven critical organizations also were in the process of  developing business continuity plans to address the potential impacts of a  pandemic on their operations, although only one has completed a formal  plan. To determine elements that could be considered as part of business  continuity planning for a pandemic, we identified various documents  issued by private sector organizations, government bodies, and financial  regulators. These included a paper issued by the Financial Services Sector  Coordinating Council for Critical Infrastructure Protection and Homeland  Security (FSSCC), which includes representatives of various financial  market trade associations, market organizations, and others. The FSSCC  pandemic paper outlined numerous issues that organizations should  consider, as well as one issued by a risk and insurance services firm that  included actions to consider taking before, at onset, and throughout the  event. In addition, we reviewed issuances by U.S. banking regulators, as  well as those from other U.S. and international organizations.", "By analyzing these documents, we identified four elements that we used to  evaluate the seven critical financial market organizations\u2019 pandemic  planning efforts, including:    A preventive program to reduce the likelihood that an organization\u2019s  operations will be affected, including monitoring of potential outbreaks,  educating employees on the disease and how to minimize its transmission,  and providing disinfectant soaps and hand sanitizers in the work place.", "A formal plan that includes escalating responses to particular stages of an  outbreak, such as first cases of humans contracting the disease overseas,  first cases within the United States, and first cases within the organization  itself.", "Facilities, systems, or procedures that provide the organization the  capability to continue its critical operations in the event that large  numbers\u2014as many as 40 percent by some estimates\u2014of an organization\u2019s  staff will be unavailable for prolonged periods. Such procedures could  include social distancing to minimize staff contact, teleworking, or  conducting operations from alternative sites.", "A testing program to better ensure that the practices and capabilities that  an organization implements to address a pandemic will be effective and  allow it to continue its critical operations.", "The guidance that U.S. and international entities have issued also include  other elements that organizations could take into account to produce an  effective business continuity plan for a pandemic, including developing  appropriate compensation and sick leave policies and establishing  communication mechanisms, such as hotlines, to aid in providing  information to employees and customers.", "The seven critical organizations all were conducting activities to help them  prepare business continuity plans to address pandemic risks. For example,  one organization has begun to analyze which staff would be considered  critical and how the organization could continue operations if as many as  70 percent of its total staff were not available\u2014a higher percentage than  some organizations are projecting could be affected. Staff at two of the  organizations told us that they had begun training alternate staff to  perform critical duties normally done by other staff. Staff at one of the  organizations described conducting a \u201ctabletop\u201d exercise in which their  staff discussed what actions they would take and what challenges they  would face in a pandemic scenario. At the time we visited these  organizations, only one of the seven organizations had a fully developed  plan for addressing pandemic threats in place with detailed response plans  for each business unit. Another of the organizations has a draft plan in  place, although at this time it does not include information on how specific  business functions will be maintained across varying absence levels. The  other organizations, while not having formal plans completed, have gone  through various planning efforts, such as verifying that staff can work  from multiple locations and then expanding the number of  communications channels available from remote locations as needed.  Depending on how an influenza pandemic spreads, the impact on some of  these organizations might somewhat be mitigated because of their existing  dispersed business continuity capabilities. However, health organizations  have cautioned that with global airline travel available, any disease  outbreak could occur quickly and be widely spread within a short period  of time, an occurrence that would reduce the protection that dispersed  facilities provide."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Although Some Challenges Remain, Organizations also Have Acted to Reduce Physical Security and Information Security Vulnerabilities", "paragraphs": ["The seven critical market organizations have continued to implement  physical security measures to reduce the potential for physical attacks on  their facilities. To assess the actions taken by the critical organizations  since our last report, we discussed and inspected the security measures in  place at these organizations. Based on these assessments, we found that  organizations had continued to improve their physical security. For  example, one organization has installed barriers that create a fixed holding  area for vehicles undergoing security checks before allowing them to  approach its facility. This same organization has reduced the likelihood  that its facility will be damaged by bombs by installing thicker, more blast- resistant walls and glass. To further improve its security, another  organization added a new armed security post to mitigate potential risks  from nearby vehicular traffic and commercial sites and additional  surveillance cameras capable of providing wider views of the area around  its primary site.", "But, some organizations continue to face challenges in limiting the  potential for physical attacks on their facilities. For example, one  organization is in the process of moving its primary and backup operations  from its own secured facilities to sites that a contractor operates. Through  inspection of one of these new facilities, we determined that it had various  physical security measures in place, including a fenced perimeter and  inspections of packages and visitors. However, this new site had less  imposing barriers around it and was located closer to roads around the  facility than the organization\u2019s previous primary operating site. Several of  the other organizations also had continuing physical security  vulnerabilities at their primary sites, such as being located in multitenant  buildings or not having the ability to limit vehicular traffic around their  facilities. However, the risk of any of these new or remaining physical  security vulnerabilities at the seven organizations\u2019 primary sites largely has  been mitigated by each having implemented geographically dispersed  capabilities for conducting their critical activities.", "The seven critical organizations also have continued to make progress in  enhancing their information security. To assess the actions taken by the  critical organizations since our last report, we reviewed documentation for  any new systems, networks, and security measures at these organizations  and discussed them with the organizations\u2019 staff. Based on these  assessments, we determined that the seven organizations were continuing  to implement sound information security practices, such as using firewalls  or other controls to limit unauthorized access, expanding their use of  systems to detect intrusions, conducting more extensive assessments of  their systems\u2019 security vulnerabilities, and implementing the  improvements we identified in our previous reviews. However, in some  cases organizations have put in place new systems architectures that  potentially introduce new vulnerabilities. As a result, we identified  additional ways in which the organizations could improve their  information security, measures that all the organizations either had begun  implementing or were considering."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Broker-Dealers and Banks Have Reduced Risk of Disruption in Clearing Activities and Continue to Address Risks to Trading Activities", "paragraphs": ["Since our 2004 report, the banks and broker-dealers that are key  participants in the U.S. securities markets have made considerable  progress in improving their resiliency, but certain wide-scale disasters  could significantly disrupt their ability to conduct trading activities. We  spoke with six firms, including four broker-dealers that conduct  significant volumes of trading on U.S. securities markets, and two banks  that are responsible for the clearance and settlement activities necessary  to ensure that securities ownership and payments are appropriately  transferred. If firms such as the six described above were unable to  conduct the processing needed to clear and settle securities transactions  after a disaster, the resulting failures to pay for and deliver securities  could lead other firms to be unable to make subsequent payments or  deliveries, resulting in a potential systemic financial crisis. In addition, if  sufficient numbers of broker-dealers were not able to resume trading  activities when appropriate, the ability of U.S. trading markets to function  could be impaired.", "In response to expectations by financial regulators, since the 2001 attacks  these broker-dealers and banks have improved the resiliency of their  clearing and settling operations by increasing the geographic distance  between the primary and backup sites that conduct such operations. For  example, all six of the firms have established primary data centers in  locations outside of New York City. In addition, one of these firms has  established a new backup data center overseas. According to firm officials,  all but one of these facilities are operational, with the last one to be  completed by March 2007. Three of these firms have gone beyond  regulators\u2019 expectations to establish a third data center that provides an  additional level of backup for clearance and settlement activities. One firm  has even established a fourth data center, and another has a fourth under  construction. In addition, staff at all six firms told us that they routinely  use or test their recovery and resumption arrangements to ensure that  they can recover and resume their clearance and settlement activities  within the time frames expected by the regulators.", "Although firms have strengthened the resiliency of their clearing and  settling operations, their trading activities remain vulnerable to disruption  because all key trading staff are still concentrated in one geographic area.  To conduct trading, broker-dealers generally operate trading floors where  their traders receive orders from customers and enter these into electronic  systems for execution at an exchange, electronic market, or other venue.  The firms process the information the trading systems produce at data  centers. Based on our discussions with these broker-dealers, these firms  have established multiple data centers, including those outside the area.  However, all these firms\u2019 key staff who trade U.S. stocks are located at  trading floors in or near the New York City financial district. Since the  attacks on September 11, two of these firms moved their trading floors  from lower Manhattan to midtown, which may reduce the risk of a trading  disruption following a localized attack or other disaster in lower  Manhattan. But, the stock traders still work in one relatively small  geographic area and rely on some of the same infrastructure. For example,  they share the same public transportation system. This concentration of  traders poses a risk to trading activities because it could prevent firms  from promptly resuming trading after a wide-scale physical disaster, a  vulnerability that we initially noted in our 2004 report. (We discuss how  SEC is addressing this risk later in this report.) Similarly, such staff are  also at risk from a pandemic outbreak.", "Nevertheless, the firms we reviewed have taken a variety of steps to  mitigate the risks to their ability to trade. For example, all firms have  implemented backup trading floors, which would allow them to conduct  their trading activities at an alternate site if their primary trading floors  were unusable or inaccessible. All of the firms have conducted some  trading from their backup floors at least once, on occasions such as the  2004 Republican National Convention and the 2005 transit workers\u2019 strike  (both of which events resulted in reduced accessibility to Manhattan). In  addition, officials at one firm said that they have some ability to conduct  trading in U.S. securities from an overseas location. According to SEC,  other firms also are exploring the possibility of conducting such trading  from overseas. However, some of the firm officials with whom we spoke  said that they were reluctant to permanently split their trading staff  between multiple locations for business reasons. For example, a firm that  separates its trading staff could suffer losses in productivity, since traders  could lose the immediate access to market information and institutional  knowledge that is gained from the concentration of traders on a single  trading floor.", "Similarly, all six firms that we spoke with have been working to integrate  pandemic planning into their business continuity plans. For example,  several of these firms have established internal committees or task forces  to oversee their continuity planning for a pandemic. These internal  committees have developed relationships with the World Health  Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) as well as local public health authorities and have consulted with  medical experts. Moreover, these firms have joined other market  participants and financial regulators at numerous meetings and tabletop  exercises since late 2005 for pandemic planning. Firm officials noted that  pandemic planning involves new considerations and scenarios that had  not been part of traditional business continuity planning. For example,  traditional plans would address the loss of facilities but not loss of staff; as  a result, business continuity plans needed to be modified for a pandemic  to deal with the potential reduction in staff able to work during the weeks,  or even months, of a pandemic outbreak."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Although Addressing Financial Market Telecommunications Vulnerabilities Remains Challenging, Efforts to Improve the Resiliency Are Continuing", "paragraphs": ["Financial market participants, in conjunction with regulators and other  organizations, have made various efforts to improve the overall resiliency  of the financial sector. Their actions include industry-wide connectivity  testing from backup locations, expert physical security assessments of  selected financial market organizations, and exercises of various disaster  scenarios that include financial market participants. Financial regulators  also have been assisting and promoting the creation of regional coalitions  that allow financial market participants to obtain information from and  interact with government and law enforcement bodies during actual  disasters. Although efforts to further improve the resiliency of the  telecommunications infrastructure have identified additional challenges,  public and private groups continue to work together to find potential  solutions, including developing ways to allow organizations to map the  physical routing of their circuits and analyzing how increased teleworking  during a pandemic might increase demands on telecommunications  network capacity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Financial Market Participants Involved in Various Testing and Information Sharing Efforts", "paragraphs": ["To provide assurance that securities market participants can perform  critical activities in the event of a disaster, industry organizations have  continued to conduct an annual industry-wide connectivity test. The  Securities Industry Association (SIA), together with the Bond Market  Association, the Futures Industry Association and the Financial  Information Forum led a test on October 14, 2006, the second year for this  industry-wide effort. The objectives of the test were to (1) exercise and  verify the ability of market participants to operate through an emergency  using backup sites, recovery facilities, and backup communications  capabilities across the industry; and (2) provide participants with an  opportunity to exercise and check the ability of their backup sites to  successfully transmit and receive communications between the backup  sites of other market participants. More than 250 organizations, including  broker-dealers, markets, service bureaus, and industry utilities  participated, with test participants representing more than 80 percent of  normal market volume. In addition, new test components were added to  the 2006 test, such as money markets and payment system processors.  Test results showed a 95 percent success rate overall for successful test  connections. According to association officials who assisted with the test,  none of the participating exchanges or firms experienced any significant  complications and when problems did arise, most were resolved quickly,  allowing the test orders to be placed and processed. According to a Bond  Market Association official, the test was very successful and it gave them  confidence that all facets of the industry would be able to operate  effectively during emergencies. Some of the preliminary lessons learned  from the 2006 test are that while industry participants have been adept at  resolving technical issues related to market performance when they occur,  firms still need to regularly and frequently test their backup connections to  market entities. Furthermore, firms and market entities must ensure that  they can reach employees with key technical knowledge during  emergencies.", "In addition to tests within the financial markets community, cross-sector  exercises have helped provide an important perspective on  interdependencies across industries and how those dependencies can  affect businesses\u2019 resiliency. Officials from Treasury and representatives  of selected financial markets participated in two such efforts conducted by  DHS. These tests\u2014TOPOFF 3 (top officials) and Cyberstorm\u2014were  tabletop exercises, meant to create lifelike scenarios of disasters that  force participants to look at the effect of cross-sector dependency (or  interdependencies) in such catastrophes. In addition to participating in  these tests, SIA and the Bond Market Association used TOPOFF 3 to test  their crisis communications tools and techniques\u2014the industry\u2019s  emergency alert systems that notify participants to convene and join a  series of conference calls. The purpose of the conference calls is to  evaluate the condition of the firms on Wall Street, relate that status to  regulatory bodies that would be considering early market closings or other  measures to deal with a crisis, and then transmit those instructions back  to the individual firms. SIA officials reported that the tests were successful  and served to identify areas in which improvements were needed, such as  ensuring that all contact numbers were up-to-date and making sure that  the timing, length, and sequence of calls were realistic. According to  Treasury officials, they have also sponsored several exercises for the  financial services sector, including some that focus on avian flu. These  have been conducted with financial institution and local government  representatives in various locations around the country.", "In addition to national cross-sector exercises, DHS has been assisting  individual firms and organizations by conducting on-site physical security  assessments of various financial market organizations. Members of the  Risk Management Division at DHS conduct the assessments, which  include a review of an organization\u2019s facility and physical security  measures such as surveillance, perimeter, and intrusion technologies. DHS  prepares a group of reports that vary by security classification and  provides them to the organizations with their findings and  recommendations. DHS performed 19 of these assessments from fiscal  years 2003 through 2006, with 21 planned for fiscal year 2007. Locations  included primary facilities in multiple urban locations, as well as several  key remote backup centers across the country.", "Financial regulators also have been promoting regional coalitions to  improve information sharing and response during disasters. Financial  market participants have formed coalitions in cities and across wider  areas such as states that allow financial market organizations to obtain  information from local government, law enforcement, and other first  responder organizations during actual disasters. The financial sector in  Chicago formed the first of these coalitions, known as ChicagoFIRST,  which sends representatives to the local emergency response command  center in the event of a disaster affecting that city. This allows the  ChicagoFIRST representatives to obtain accurate and timely information  about what actions governmental and other bodies are taking during the  event. The representatives then share the information with financial  market organizations to better allow them to take appropriate actions.  Coalitions also can facilitate other information-sharing efforts. For  example, in July 2004, ChicagoFIRST, the City of Chicago\u2019s Office of  Emergency Management and Communications, and Treasury conducted a  tabletop exercise for the local financial sector. The exercise provided an  opportunity for Chicago\u2019s financial community and federal, state, and local  government officials to practice crisis response protocols to simulated  emergency scenarios. Based on the success of the ChicagoFIRST model,  Treasury published a handbook to guide such efforts in December 2004.  As of January 2006, the cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, and  Minneapolis and the State of Florida formed similar local collaborative  efforts.", "Financial market organizations also have participated in other  information-sharing forums and benefited from federal dissemination of  information and analyses. To assist in infrastructure protection issues, the  Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC),  which includes representatives from a broad range of financial regulatory  agencies, meets regularly to improve coordination and communication  among financial regulators and enhance the resiliency of the financial  sector. In addition, FSSCC, which includes representatives of the  financial trade associations and other entities, provides one mechanism  for sharing information relating to infrastructure protection among  financial market participants. FSSCC works to help reinforce the financial  services sector\u2019s resilience against terrorist attacks and other threats to  the nation\u2019s financial infrastructure. Formed in 2002, FSSCC acts as the  private sector council that assists Treasury and DHS in addressing critical  infrastructure protection issues within the banking and finance sector.  FSSCC has published reports summarizing best practices and lessons  learned for issues of common concern to the industry at large. Members of  FSSCC also meet periodically with the financial regulators to share  information about common concerns and challenges. Financial market  organizations also have received consolidated information through other  federal sources. For example, the Financial Services Information Sharing  and Analysis Center (FS/ISAC) consolidates threat information for the  sector. The financial services sector established FS/ISAC\u2014and Treasury  sponsored it\u2014to encourage the sharing of information on physical and  cyber security threats between the public and private sectors to protect  critical infrastructure. Between 2004 and 2005, FS/ISAC\u2019s membership  grew more than 200 percent, to more than 1,800 member-organizations  that receive alerts and other information directly and another 7,000  organizations that receive such information via an industry association.  The alerts and information now reach 34 percent of the industry. FS/ISAC  also conducts threat intelligence conference calls at the unclassified level  every 2 weeks for members, with input from DHS. Treasury similarly hosts  a similar biweekly threat conference call with representatives of the  financial regulators and DHS. Both sets of calls discuss recent physical  and cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and incidents.", "The potential threat of a pandemic is another area in which regulators and  market participants are working together to share information and  increase overall preparedness. FBIIC created a working group to address  pandemic flu issues that has been holding meetings among both FBIIC and  FSSCC members. Treasury representatives also have participated in  several working groups established by the Homeland Security Council to  address pandemic flu issues. In addition, FSSCC issued a statement and  issue paper on preparations for avian flu to provide guidance for financial  institutions considering how to prepare for the potential of a serious  influenza epidemic. The paper presents 31 key issues that financial  institutions might consider in developing their plans. Some examples of  the issues include the identification of critical operations (those needed  for weeks or months, not days); methods of splitting and segregating staff;  expanded use of tele- and videoconferencing; and coordination with local  emergency management and public health organizations. In addition to  publishing the statement, FSSCC formed an Infectious Disease Forum that  is being led by the SIA on FSSCC\u2019s behalf. The group meets quarterly,  including joint sessions with a similar pandemic working group run by  federal regulators. The forum provides a venue for FSSCC members that  have active avian flu working groups or are currently conducting research  on this issue to collaborate and share information to prepare for a possible  influenza pandemic or other infectious disease outbreak. FSSCC also  provides additional information on pandemic issues on its website. Lastly,  several US financial services firms participated in a recent 6-week, market  wide pandemic exercise in the United Kingdom. The exercise ran in  October and November 2006, with 70 organizations and about 3,500 staff  from across the financial sector taking part. Officials from the U.S. federal  regulator community provided input into the scenario planning of the  event. UK officials who ran the exercise stated in the summary report that  an important next step would be to work with their international  regulatory partners to ensure cross-border regulatory coordination\u2014and  thus that global financial markets will be able to continue operating in a  pandemic."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Activities Were Under Way to Improve Resiliency of Telecommunications, but Identifying Clear Solutions Remains Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Since the 2001 attacks, financial regulators, market participants, and other  organizations have engaged in various efforts to improve the resiliency of  the telecommunications infrastructure upon which the markets depend,  but clear resolutions to the various challenges have proved difficult to  identify. As we reported in 2003, September 11 showed that such events  can have significant effects on the telecommunications services that  support the U.S. financial markets. Although some financial market  participants attempted to ensure that they would not lose  telecommunications service by contracting with more than one  telecommunications carrier, the attacks revealed that multiple carriers\u2019  lines and circuits often traversed the same physical paths or relied on the  same switching offices and thus were susceptible to damage from the  same event. One way that financial markets organizations have attempted  to address this problem is by exploring the feasibility of mapping the  physical paths that individual organizations\u2019 telecommunications circuits  follow.", "However, completing such analyses has proved very time-consuming and  expensive. According to a 2004 report by the President\u2019s National Security  Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC), carriers would have  to use labor-intensive, manual processes to ensure route diversity and  monitor that condition on an ongoing basis. The NSTAC report further  stated that guaranteeing that circuit routes would not be changed could  make an organization\u2019s service less reliable because its circuits could lose  the benefit of technologies that automatically reroute circuits in the event  of facility failures. To assess the feasibility of mapping physical circuit  routing, the Federal Reserve participated in the National Diversity  Assurance Initiative\u2014a joint project between the Federal Reserve and  various telecommunications carriers\u2014that the Alliance for  Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS) conducted. After doing  an initial assessment of the circuits, the initiative decided that conducting  an end-to-end multi-carrier assessment of telecommunications circuits  could only be conducted manually, a very labor and cost intensive process.  The members of the initiative concluded that attempting such an analysis  for large numbers of circuits in multiple organizations would be very  difficult. As a result, the ATIS report indicated that an automated system  would likely have to be developed to more efficiently track circuits across  multiple carriers and make end-to-end diversity assessments and  assurance feasible on any larger scale. The report recommended a small- scale follow-up effort to determine the objectives and requirements for a  system that could provide end-to-end diversity assurance in a multicarrier  environment. According to the report, the scoping effort should attempt to  identify the high-level requirements, cost estimates, and level of effort  needed to develop and implement an automated circuit assurance  solution. Since this report was issued, the National Communications  System (NCS) within DHS, which is responsible for administering the  federal national security and emergency preparedness  telecommunications programs, has agreed to lead an effort\u2014the Diversity  Assurance Analysis\u2014to explore the potential for developing automated  solutions to the circuit diversity problem.", "Telecommunications providers are also attempting to improve the  resiliency of the infrastructure upon which the financial markets depend.  As we previously reported, much of the disruption to voice and data  communications services throughout lower Manhattan\u2014including the  financial district\u2014that stemmed from the 2001 attacks occurred when one  of the buildings in the World Trade Center complex collapsed into an  adjacent telecommunications center, which served as a major local  communications hub within the public network. Since then, the provider  that operates this facility has been rebuilding portions that were damaged  or lost in the attacks, using designs that provide greater resiliency and  redundancy to their infrastructure in lower Manhattan. For example, the  provider has reinforced the storage area for generator fuel with a  protective wall and now routes the fuel through concrete-lined conduits.  The provider also has updated parts of its network to use more resilient  advanced switches and used more fiber-optic cables, which are smaller  but can carry more message traffic.", "Financial market regulators and participants also have become concerned  about the potential impact of a pandemic on telecommunications  resiliency. As many financial market organizations have begun considering  how best to ensure business continuity in during a disease outbreak, many  (including some of the broker-dealers that we contacted) considered  having large numbers of their employees telecommute. However, concerns  have been raised about whether the existing telecommunications  networks would have adequate capacity for absorbing the additional data  and voice communications traffic. For example, all the calls that originate  in individual neighborhoods usually must go through a single set of  switches before reaching the larger-capacity and more redundant  telecommunications network. It is not known whether the lines and  switches serving individual neighborhoods or areas would have sufficient  capacity, particularly since more people overall may be home during a  pandemic, as a result of school or workplace closings. For example, in a  June 2006 testimony before Congress, an FSSCC official stated that the  financial markets community did not have enough information to  determine whether the nation\u2019s telecommunications infrastructure could  support a rapid and explosive increase in users on specific networks.  Consequently, FSSCC recommended that NSTAC be asked to research this  issue and identify any recommendations to ensure that the  telecommunications sector\u2019s networks were robust enough to meet other  sectors\u2019 demands during such a potentially stressful time.", "In addition, in November 2006, FSSCC and telecommunications carriers  agreed to collaborate on an NCS study about the potential impacts of a  pandemic on telecommunications infrastructure. The study will focus on  the technical feasibility of national policy and business continuity planning  related to telecommuting in response to the pandemic influenza threat.  According to an NCS official, previously completed models on this issue  indicate that sufficient bandwidth to accommodate increased traffic  during a pandemic appears to exist on a national level, but problems could  be experienced in the individual neighborhood or commercial area  connections points, which are the \u201cfirst mile\u201d or \u201clast mile\u201d of the  connection to the national system. The financial market participants from  FSSCC will assist NCS by contributing their business continuity  telecommuting plans and estimated traffic load during a pandemic. These  plans will be used in examining potential access network issues for the  financial community and serve as an example for other industries in  predicting the potential change in traffic on access networks.  Telecommunications carriers will provide estimates of potential surge  traffic from the general public during a pandemic using related historical  data (e.g., snowstorms). The financial community anticipates benefits  from this study would include recommendations on mitigation measures  that could be implemented either in advance or in real time for the various  impact levels possibly encountered during a pandemic."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Financial Market Regulators Have Acted to Improve the Readiness of the Financial Sector and Plan to Address Remaining Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Federal financial regulators have taken a variety of steps to strengthen the  ability of the U.S. securities markets to recover from a wide-scale disaster.  In 2003, regulators jointly issued business continuity guidance to  strengthen the resiliency of key organizations and firms that clear and  settle transactions in critical financial markets. The regulators expect  these organizations to be able to recover and resume their clearing and  settlement activities on the same business day on which a wide-scale  disruption occurs. Since 2003, regulators have conducted examinations  and determined that all of these organizations and firms have substantially  implemented this guidance or will soon do so. SEC and banking regulators  also have been reviewing the planning that organizations that participate  in the securities markets are doing to address pandemics, but have not  other actions that could improve readiness. SEC has issued expectations  that markets be prepared to resume trading promptly after disasters, and  its staff have taken steps to assure themselves that large market  participants have taken sufficient actions to increase the likelihood that  U.S. markets would resume trading. SEC staff also plan to do more  focused reviews of broker-dealer trading readiness. SEC also has taken  actions to improve the ARP program that it uses to oversee systems  operations issues at the markets and clearing organizations, including  increasing staffing levels and expertise and preparing a rule mandating  compliance with the ARP program\u2019s tenets for which it expects to seek  approval during 2007."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Regulators Have Taken Additional Steps to Reduce Likelihood of Disruptions to Clearance and Settlement Activities", "paragraphs": ["Since 2003, federal financial regulators have worked in a coordinated  manner to assess and improve the resiliency of the U.S. securities markets  with respect to clearance and settlement activities. As we noted in our last  report, in April 2003, SEC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC jointly issued the  Interagency Paper on Sound Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the  U.S. Financial System (Sound Practices).  The Sound Practices paper  establishes business continuity expectations for the clearance and  settlement activities of organizations that support critical financial  markets. These organizations include the core clearing and settlement  entities that process securities transactions (core organizations) and firms  that play a significant role in critical financial markets (significant firms)\u2014 generally defined as those firms whose participation in the markets results  in their consistently clearing or settling at least 5 percent of the value of  the transactions in any of the product markets specified in the paper. The  agencies expect these organizations must be able to recover and resume  their clearing and settlement activities on the same business day on which  a wide-scale disruption occurs. To achieve this goal, the organizations  would maintain geographically dispersed facilities and resources and  routinely use or test their recovery and resumption arrangements to  ensure their effectiveness.", "Since issuing the paper, regulators have been conducting examinations of  the organizations subject to these practices and have determined that  those organizations have substantially achieved the capabilities envisioned  in the Sound Practices paper or soon will do so. Specifically, SEC, the  Federal Reserve, and OCC have reviewed firms\u2019 primary and backup data  center arrangements, the amount of time that it takes firms to recover  their operations at their backup sites and firms\u2019 tests of their backup  arrangements. In an April 2006 report to Congress, the regulators reported  that the core organizations all have data and operations centers that are  geographically remote from their primary sites. Regulators also noted  that several of these organizations share or periodically shift their  operations between their primary and backup sites; this practice prepares  them to continue their operations in the event of a disruption at either  location. Although the significant firms initially were expected to be  capable of resuming their clearing operations within the time frames in the  Sound Practices paper, regulators extended this deadline for some firms  because of the work and costs associated with implementing these  practices. For example, when the practices were issued in 2003, one firm  had just completed a new data center only several miles away from its  primary site; as a result, this firm requested\u2014and was granted\u2014additional  time to establish a geographically remote data center. According to the  representatives of regulators and firms with whom we spoke, all  significant firms likely will have sufficiently dispersed sites capable of  conducting critical clearing activities by March 2007 and thus will have  substantially achieved the practices. In contrast with the situation existing  in 2001, the regulators conclude that by increasing the geographic diversity  of their operating locations, the core organizations and significant firms  significantly have increased the likelihood that critical financial markets  will be able to recover clearing and settlement activities fairly rapidly after  a wide-scale disruption.", "With most firms having sites allowing them to recover their operations  within the Sound Practices time frames, regulators are expecting firms to  conduct meaningful tests of these capabilities in the near term. In January  2006, SEC, the Federal Reserve, and OCC issued a detailed letter to all  core organizations and significant firms, outlining expectations for the  testing strategies that organizations and firms should use to verify their  implementation of the Sound Practices. In this letter, regulators advised  organizations and firms that they should have a comprehensive and risk- based testing approach that includes routine use or testing of recovery and  resumption arrangements. In addition, the significant firms should assess  whether their recovery arrangements were compatible with those of the  core organizations. The fundamental testing concepts included in this  letter are also being incorporated into a revised version of the business  continuity planning guidance that the Federal Financial Institutions  Examination Council\u2014which issues guidance developed jointly by the  various depository institutions regulators\u2014plans to issue later this year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Are Actively Addressing Pandemic Planning, but Additional Actions Could Improve Readiness", "paragraphs": ["Banking and securities regulators have been working to assist market  participants\u2019 pandemic planning efforts, but have not taken other actions  that could better assure that market participants adequately prepare for a  pandemic. For example, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which is a  self-regulatory organization (SRO) that oversees its broker-dealer  members, issued an information memorandum to provide guidance to  member organizations about how to assess whether their business  continuity and contingency plans would be suitable for a prolonged,  widespread public health emergency. In a letter sent to securities  exchanges and clearing organizations, the Acting Director of SEC\u2019s Market  Regulation Division noted that these organizations should promote  planning and preparations to keep the markets operating during a  pandemic. This letter notes that while securities exchanges and clearing  organizations already have extensive business continuity programs, such  plans are usually designed to address a discrete event and therefore may  prove inadequate to address the potentially long-lasting impact of a  pandemic, which could include multiple waves of outbreaks lasting 6 to 8  weeks. It also notes that federal, state, or local governments may take  actions, such as quarantines, that may make it more difficult to maintain  critical operations using remote backup sites. Although acknowledging  that developing such plans would be difficult, the letter notes that such  planning is necessary for organizations to analyze options and prepare for  how the markets may function if confronted with an outbreak. In addition  to this letter, SEC staff also have been speaking at forums such as  conferences and meetings with market participants\u2014industry trade  associations, FSSCC\u2014to share information about pandemic issues.  Furthermore, SEC staff told us that they have also begun to review  pandemic planning issues during inspections of exchanges, electronic  markets, clearing organizations, and broker-dealers. In a joint notice from  the regulators that oversee banks and thrifts, the agencies indicated that  their institutions should review the U.S. government\u2019s national pandemic  strategy to consider what actions may be appropriate for their particular  situation, and whether such actions should be included in their event  response and contingency strategies. The bank regulators noted that  financial institutions with a global presence and those considered critical  to the financial system may have greater preparation and response  challenges than those of other financial institutions. Bank regulation  officials told us that they have also begun reviewing pandemic planning in  the context of their ongoing supervisory activities. Lastly, SEC officials  told us that they are beginning to work with the Securities Industry and  Financial Markets Association to plan for a 4-week exercise beginning in  September 2007 that will be modeled after the exercise conducted in the  United Kingdom (discussed earlier in this report). This exercise will test  how ready U.S. securities firms are to operate during a future flu  pandemic.", "Although regulators have been actively addressing pandemic issues, they  have not taken some additional actions that could improve readiness  within the financial markets. For example, SEC and banking regulator  staff told us that they are speaking about the need for financial institutions  to prepare for a potential pandemic and they have issued general  statements indicating that market participants should develop plans and  provided issues to consider. However, none of these issuances specifically  directed market participants to prepare plans likely to be effective in the  midst of even the most severe outbreaks, which can result in significant  levels of illness, deaths, transportation shutdowns, or constrained  telecommunications capabilities. SEC staff told us that developing such  plans is complicated. For example, important information for the  effectiveness of the plans is not currently fully known, such as when and  where outbreaks will occur, how virulent they will be, and how quickly  they will spread. In addition, the actions that governments may take in  response to a pandemic also are not certain, such as whether quarantines  would be imposed or schools would be closed. As a result, the SEC staff  said that financial market organizations will need to have flexible plans  that accommodate various scenarios and actions. Regulatory staff also  noted that the U.S. government has yet to establish dates by which other  sectors should have complete plans. Given that state and local  governments, or organizations in power, telecommunications,  transportation, or other sectors upon which the financial markets depend  may take a range of actions, such as quarantines, that could affect the  viability of financial market organizations\u2019 pandemic plans, clear  expectations from regulators that financial market organizations\u2019 plans  should address such scenarios would provide greater assurance that all  critical organizations and key market participants prepare plans that are  sufficiently robust.", "Banking and securities regulators also have not set dates by which market  organizations would be expected to have prepared at least an initial formal  business continuity plan intended to ensure that critical operations can  continue during a pandemic. Given that a pandemic could begin at any  time, having complete formal plans in place beforehand would better  ensure that financial market organizations could respond immediately.  Completing such formal plans would allow exchanges, electronic markets,  clearing organizations, broker-dealers, and banks to identify and begin  acquiring any needed additional resources, such as medical supplies or  computer hardware. In addition, completing initial plans soon would  ensure the plans are appropriately approved by organization management  and allow organizations to begin training employees and preparing  communications for customers about possible changes in operating  procedures during a pandemic.", "As part of preparing plans for pandemics, market participants have  indicated that regulators should specify the types of regulatory relief that  might be provided. Several of the broker-dealers with whom we spoke told  us that they anticipated needing some form of regulatory relief in a  pandemic situation. For example, broker-dealer staff likely would be  working from home during a pandemic due to health concerns, and as a  result, regulators might have to grant some relief from requirements that  broker-dealer personnel be directly supervised. NASD, which is an SRO  for its broker-dealer members, issued a notice seeking their input  regarding what specific, short-term regulatory relief might be necessary to  maintain market stability while still providing sufficient protections for  investors. In providing comments to NASD, two trade associations for  securities noted that such relief might be necessary to give broker-dealers  the flexibility to operate when a large number of employees were not in  their regular work space, either because they were sick, caring for others,  or afraid to come into the office. While some employees might be able to  work from nonregular locations, the trade associations noted that the  requirement to register new temporary offices as new branch office  locations may have to be suspended as was done after the September 2001  attacks and Hurricane Katrina. Another area in which relief might be  needed would involve providing additional time for broker-dealers to  submit personnel registrations and for those staff to fulfill continuing  education requirements. Similarly, the associations noted that the time for  conducting normal supervisory reviews should be extended during a  pandemic because the personnel who perform such reviews were likely to  be needed to help their firms in actual business activities. According to  their comment letter, regulatory relief would be necessary no matter what  method of operation a broker-dealer chooses because the number of  absent employees likely would cause difficulties in promptly settling  transactions and delaying many other activities. The associations urge the  regulators to cooperate in a multiregulator process that coordinates  granting relief as well as proposing that any trigger (such as a certain  percentage infection rate that the Centers for Disease Control would  declare) for the commencement of relief should occur at the same time  across the markets.", "After collecting the information on what types and under what  circumstances that regulatory relief may be needed, NASD officials  indicated that they intend to work with SEC and other SROs to determine  what relief may be appropriate. Similarly, to appropriately respond to such  anticipated requests for regulatory relief, NYSE has filed a draft rule  proposal with SEC seeking more authority to grant exemptive regulatory  relief in the event of a pandemic. For example, under the proposed rule,  NYSE may waive or extend the time otherwise applicable for complying  with examination, training, or continuing education requirements.", "Although willing to consider regulatory relief, SEC staff indicated that  market participants should not expect wide-scale waivers of important  securities regulatory requirements. Although SEC staff told us that they  recognize that some form of regulatory relief would most likely be part of  the process of enabling the financial system to keep operating under the  trying conditions of a pandemic, they also noted that such relief should be  one of the last stages in continuity planning and preparation, not the first.  Instead, they said that market participants should develop plans and  capabilities for continuing operations during a pandemic that also would  allow organizations to materially comply with important securities  regulations. These areas included ensuring that broker-dealer personnel  were properly supervised, necessary records prepared, and price  transparency for securities maintained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Have Worked to Ensure That Trading Activities Will Resume After a Disaster, and Plan to Examine Broker-Dealer Readiness More Fully", "paragraphs": ["Although broker-dealers are not required to be able to resume operations  after disasters, securities regulators have issued some guidance and  conducted some assessments of firms\u2019 readiness to trade. As noted in our  last report, SEC issued a policy statement in 2003 that established business  continuity guidelines for the exchanges and electronic markets that match  buy and sell orders for securities. This guidance expects these exchanges  and markets to develop business continuity plans and be prepared to  resume trading on the next business day following a wide-scale disaster.  SEC examiners from the ARP program have been conducting  examinations of the various markets subject to this policy statement to  ensure that these entities had sufficient capabilities to conduct operations  even if a wide-scale disaster damaged or rendered their primary operating  sites inaccessible. Specifically, these SEC staff have determined that the  two largest markets have implemented business continuity capabilities  that likely would allow them to resume trading activities within one day of  a disaster.", "Although SEC issued some guidance addressing business continuity  expectations for exchanges and other trading venues, the firms that trade  on U.S. markets are not required to ensure that they can resume  operations after disasters. According to SEC officials, no provisions in the  securities laws explicitly require that firms conducting securities activities  be operational under all circumstances and resuming operations in the  aftermath of a disaster would be a business decision left to the  management of individual firms. Nevertheless, NYSE and NASD, which  together oversee the majority of broker-dealers operating on U.S. markets,  have issued rules that establish business continuity expectations for their  members. These rules require broker-dealers to develop business  continuity plans that address various areas, including data backup and  recovery, and alternate means for communicating with customers.  Although these rules do not require firms to be capable of resuming  operations in the event of a disaster, NYSE staff that conduct reviews of  their member firms told us that many firms are attempting to implement  such capabilities for their own business reasons. If a firm were unable to  develop sufficiently robust capabilities that would allow it to resume  trading, the NYSE and NASD rules require that such firms must, at a  minimum, have the capability to ensure that its customers would have  access to their funds and securities. For example, NASD staff who oversee  their member firms told us that some firms provide customers with  contact information for their clearing organizations on customer account  statements and firm Web sites. Based on reviews done by their examiners,  NYSE and NASD officials reported that most of their member firms have  implemented these business continuity planning rules, although larger  firms generally were more likely to be compliant than smaller firms.", "SEC has undertaken some assessments of the readiness of broker-dealers  to resume trading in the event of disasters and plans to conduct more  specific examinations of broker-dealers\u2019 capabilities in the future. In  response to the recommendation in our last report that SEC fully analyze  the readiness of the securities markets to recover from major disruptions,  SEC staff told us that they have taken various actions to assess the ability  of broker-dealers to resume trading promptly after disasters. Staff from  SEC\u2019s Market Regulation Division and Office of Compliance, Inspections,  and Examinations told us that, in consultation with the other federal  agencies and local emergency management officials in New York and  Chicago, they have considered how a wide range of disaster scenarios  would affect the securities markets. These scenarios include both a variety  of man-made threats (including chemical, biological, and radiological  terrorist events) and natural disasters (including a severe hurricane or a  pandemic). According to SEC, the likely impact of these events will vary  from scenario to scenario and from organization to organization. They also  have had discussions with key broker-dealer market participants about  their capabilities and plans for overcoming various disasters. For example,  after publication of the Sound Practices paper, SEC staff conducted an  analysis of the major firms to ascertain their willingness and ability to  continue to trade in the event of a wide-scale disruption. SEC staff told us  that these firms all expressed a commitment to continue to operate and  have allocated substantial resources to enhance their resilience  sufficiently to permit them to trade. Accordingly, SEC staff believe that  market participants have increased their resiliency since September 11  and that based on this work sufficient numbers of firms and staff likely  would be able to operate from various locations to allow U.S. markets to  resume trading when appropriate.", "During discussions we had with SEC staff as part of this review, staff  responsible for conducting broker-dealer examinations told us that their  efforts since the 2001 attacks have been more focused on ensuring that  firms were improving their capabilities for recovering their clearance and  settlement activities, as required under the Sound Practices paper.  However, based on our inquiries about trading readiness, SEC staff agreed  that they could take further steps to assess broker-dealers capabilities in  this regard. As a result, they developed an expanded examination module  to obtain more detailed information on firms\u2019 business continuity  capabilities related to trading activities and have made this part of the  existing examination guidance for the SEC examiners. SEC officials told  us that they expect to use this expanded guidance in the applicable  broker-dealer examinations beginning with the 2007 cycle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Has Made Various Improvements to the ARP Program", "paragraphs": ["Since 2004, SEC has implemented various improvements to its ARP  program, which oversees operations of automated and information  technology systems at exchanges, clearing organizations, and electronic  communications networks. In response to our past recommendations to  SEC to expand the level of staffing and resources committed to the ARP  program, SEC hired four new staff members during 2005, increasing the  program\u2019s staffing from 9 to 13. In addition, in response to our  recommendation that SEC increase its overall technical expertise, all four  of these newly hired staff have at least master-level degrees in information  security-related fields. SEC has obtained funding to establish its own  information security laboratory and is acquiring hardware that the agency  can use to test systems and equipment being used by market participants  and to help ARP staff learn about information security vulnerabilities and  protection practices. To further improve the technical sophistication of  the ARP examinations, SEC also began contracting with an information  technology consulting firm to supplement its staff on information security  reviews of the entities the ARP program oversees. During the last 2 years,  staff from this consulting firm accompanied SEC staff on several reviews  of the larger organizations, and our review of the reports that were  prepared indicated that this firm\u2019s assistance has helped SEC expand the  range and breadth of issues that it reviewed during those examinations.", "In response to our prior concerns that SEC was not examining important  market organizations frequently, staff responsible for the ARP program  have changed their practices to increase how often they will conduct  reviews of the more critical organizations. While we had previously  reported that the intervals between examinations for many of the critical  organizations had been as much as 3 years, ARP staff, since implementing  the new practice, have been annually reviewing the organizations they  consider most important. Our analysis of ARP report data from fiscal years  2003 through 2006 confirmed that the critical organizations under SEC\u2019s  jurisdiction were being reviewed at least annually. Furthermore, we  reviewed the reports from the ARP examinations conducted between  March 2004 and May 2006, and they indicate that the ARP staff generally  were addressing all the key areas, including telecommunications, physical  security, information security, and business continuity planning, during  the examinations they have conducted. For example, we reported in 2003  that few of the ARP program examinations addressed physical security  issues. During this period, we found that several of the organizations had  hired an external consultant to review their physical security adequacy as  a result of prior ARP staff recommendations. In addition, while we  reported that SEC staff sometimes had problems getting organizations to  implement ARP staff recommendations, our review of the latest  examinations indicated that the organizations that SEC examined were  implementing the ARP staffs\u2019 recommendations appropriately. For  example, in 6 of the 8 exams conducted in 2005, the examined  organization had since taken actions sufficient to close all  recommendations made previously.", "Although SEC appears to be getting adequate cooperation from the  entities that it reviews as part of the ARP program, SEC currently  administers the ARP program under policy statements on a voluntary  basis. Consistent with one of our prior recommendations, staff in SEC\u2019s  Market Regulation Division told us that they continue to make progress in  obtaining approval of a rule that will make adherence to the ARP program  mandatory for affected organizations. SEC staff told us they have drafted a  rule that will allow them to cite firms for rule violations if they fail to  adhere to the expectations of the ARP program and assess penalties  similar to other SEC requirements. The draft rule has been undergoing a  series of internal reviews and staff expect to present it to the SEC  Commissioners for issuance in spring 2007. Given the importance of the  activities that the ARP program oversees to the U.S. securities markets, we  continue to support making ARP a rule-based program to better assure  that the SEC staff have the necessary leverage to ensure compliance with  any recommendations they deem necessary for the continued functioning  of the markets."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Based on the series of reviews we conducted, the financial regulators and  market participants have made considerable progress in the more than 5  years that have passed since September 11, 2001, in improving the security  and resiliency of the U.S. securities markets against potential attacks and  other disruptions. The critical exchanges and clearing organizations all  have implemented increased physical security measures to reduce their  vulnerability to physical attacks and reduced the vulnerability of their key  information systems and networks to cyber threats. Most significantly, all  of the organizations now have the capability to conduct their operations  from backup sites that are at a significant geographic distance from their  primary locations, a move that greatly reduces their vulnerability to even  wide-scale disasters that affect their primary operating locations. During  this period, financial market regulators also have contributed to the  increased security and resiliency of the markets by actively overseeing and  encouraging market participants\u2019 efforts and by issuing guidance and  conducting examinations.", "Although considerable progress has been made, regulators, participants,  and others remain appropriately focused on various ongoing challenges.  The need to assess and incrementally improve physical and information  security measures remains constant as techniques for both attacking and  protecting the critical assets of the financial markets will continue to  evolve. With functioning telecommunications systems being vital to the  markets\u2019 ability to operate, efforts by regulators, market participants,  telecommunications providers, and other government bodies to improve  the availability and resiliency of this key infrastructure are critical.   Finally, although SEC staff have assured themselves that key broker- dealers also were acting to improve their resiliency, we are encouraged by  SEC\u2019s recent plans to focus even greater attention on these efforts to  ensure that sufficient numbers of such firms will be available to trade  following future disasters.", "Although banking and securities regulators have taken various actions to  help the financial markets prepare for and respond to an influenza  pandemic, additional actions could further improve the readiness of the  financial markets to withstand this threat. To their credit, financial market  organizations have begun considering a range of issues related to  pandemics and are working with others to improve readiness, such as by  assisting with analyses of the capacity of the telecommunications  infrastructure with relevant government agencies. However, at the time we  visited them we found that few of the critical financial market  organizations had completed the development of formal plans specifying  the actions they would take and the capabilities and resources they would  need to be able to continue their critical operations if significant numbers  of their staff were ill or unavailable during a pandemic.", "When faced with the recognition that attacks or natural disasters could  significantly disrupt market operations, financial regulators responded by  issuing guidance and expectations\u2014in the Sound Practices paper and in  other policy statements\u2014that specified the actions that market  participants should take and set deadlines by which these actions should  be taken. Although a pandemic could similarly disrupt financial  organizations\u2019 ability to operate, the regulators, although actively  addressing pandemic issues, have not taken similar actions. Regulators  indicated they are advising market participants in meetings and other  forums to prepare plans that address the impacts of even a severe  pandemic; however, these regulators have not issued any formal  statements of these specific expectations. Without such official  expectations, market participants may not adequately prepare plans that  are sufficiently robust to address the more serious scenarios, which could  include widespread illnesses, deaths, transportation bans, or  telecommunications bottlenecks. In addition, the regulators have not set a  date by which financial organizations should have their pandemic plans  completed. Having plans that fully meet regulatory expectations in place  before an outbreak would allow organizations to provide training to their  employees and conduct tests and exercises of their plans that could  provide valuable insights into how to further improve their readiness.  Given that the severity of pandemic and the potential responses that  governments or other organizations may take can vary, effective business  continuity plans will have to be flexible by including a range of measures  that financial market organizations can implement depending on  circumstances, and these plans will have to be updated continually as new  information arrives. Having such plans in place soon would help  organizations to identify any additional resources needed, obtain the  appropriate management approvals, and prepare their staff and customers  for changes in how an organization may operate during a pandemic. While  governmental bodies have not taken similar actions for other key sectors  of the U.S. economy, such action by regulators of the financial sector  could demonstrate the leadership that the sector is known for and serve to  spur other sectors to accelerate their progress as well."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To increase the likelihood that the securities markets will be able to  function during a pandemic, we recommend that the Chairman, Federal  Reserve; the Comptroller of the Currency; and the Chairman, SEC,  consider taking additional actions to ensure that market participants  adequately prepare for an outbreak, including issuing formal expectations  that business continuity plans for a pandemic should include measures  likely to be effective even during severe outbreaks, and setting a date by  which market participants should have such plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Federal Reserve, OCC, Treasury,  and SEC for their review and comment.

In addition, they  acknowledged that we recognized that the financial markets have made  significant progress in increasing their ability to withstand wide-scale  disasters. Regarding our recommendation that these regulators consider  taking additional actions regarding pandemic preparedness\u2014including  issuing specific instructions that organizations plan for severe pandemics  and setting a date by which business continuity plans for pandemics  should be completed, the officials noted that the critical organizations and  key market participants subject to the Interagency Sound Practices paper  are planning for a pandemic, including a severe outbreak, and identifying  measures to reduce their vulnerabilities to such events. They also noted  that all of these organizations have been subject to supervisory review  over the past several months, and that these organizations\u2019 contingency  plans generally address the four elements recommended in our report. The  officials also indicate that their agencies have incorporated reviews of  organizations\u2019 pandemic planning efforts into their ongoing supervision  and oversight processes to ensure that the critical market organizations  are updating their plans as new information becomes available and  incorporating lessons learned from market exercises. In their letter, the  officials indicate that they will follow up to ensure any weaknesses in the  ongoing pandemic-planning process are appropriately addressed by the  organizations, and if the regulators find that organizations\u2019 efforts are  lagging, they will consider taking additional actions, including those that  we have suggested.", "We are encouraged that the regulators plan to actively monitor the  progress that critical organizations and key market participants are  making to plan and prepare for a pandemic. Although the regulators  maintain that organizations have prepared plans that address all expected  elements, during the agency comments process we obtained the draft  pandemic plan for one of the critical organizations.  Based on our review,  this organization's plan addressed some of the expected elements, but did  not include the specific procedures that would be used to ensure that its  critical operations would continue during a pandemic. The organization  indicated these procedures would be described in business unit plans that  were still being prepared. In addition, we recently recontacted  representatives at five of the six key market participants that we had  reviewed, and while most indicated that they had received sufficient  instruction from regulators regarding pandemic expectations, staff at one  firm told us that, although they had attended meetings with regulators on  pandemic issues, they have not received any guidance on specific  scenarios to plan for, such as transportation shutdowns. Because at least  some organizations may not yet be fully prepared or potentially may fail to  consider the potential pandemic scenarios associated with a severe  outbreak, particularly if mitigating them is difficult and discourages or  delays firms\u2019 willingness to fully prepare, we continue to believe that  having regulators give greater consideration to providing specific  instructions to market participants and setting a date for having pandemic  continuity plans complete would increase the likelihood that organizations  fully prepare and have adequate time to test and adjust any planned  responses in advance of the outbreak of an actual pandemic.", "We also received technical comments from Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC,  and Treasury staff that we incorporated where appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after the  date of this report.

To maintain the  security and the confidentiality of their proprietary information, we agreed  with these organizations that our report would not discuss their efforts to  address physical and information security risks and ensure business  continuity in a way that could identify them. To assess how these  organizations ensured they could resume operations after an attack or  other disaster, we discussed their business continuity plans and  capabilities with their staff and visited their facilities. We compared their  plans to practices recommended for financial organizations, including  bank regulatory guidance. Among the operational elements we considered  were the existence and capabilities of backup facilities, whether the  organizations had procedures to ensure the availability of critical  personnel and telecommunications, and whether they completely tested  their plans. In evaluating these organizations\u2019 backup facilities, we  attempted to determine whether these organizations had backup facilities  that would allow them to recover from damage to their primary sites or  from damage or inaccessibility resulting from a wide-scale disaster. When  possible, we directly observed the operation of these backup sites and  reviewed relevant documentation, including backup facility test results  that the organizations provided.", "To assess what critical organizations had done to minimize the likelihood  that physical attacks would disrupt their operations, our staff that  routinely conduct physical security reviews at government agencies and  private organizations conducted on-site \u201cwalkthroughs\u201d of the critical  organizations\u2019 facilities, reviewed their security policies and procedures,  and met with key officials responsible for physical security to discuss  these policies and procedures and compared these with guidance that the  U.S. Department of Justice developed for federal buildings.

We also compared their information  security measures with those recommended for federal organizations in  the Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual, other federal  guidelines and standards, and various industry best practice or principles  for electronic security.
