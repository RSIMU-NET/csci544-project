Navy determined that all of the 3,652 vehicles GAO selected for review were utilized by applying DOD and Navy criteria such as for mileage and individually justifying vehicles. CBP did not determine if 1,862 (81 percent) of its 2,300 selected vehicles were utilized in fiscal year 2015 even though the vehicles did not meet DHS's minimum mileage criteria. CBP officials stated that, contrary to DHS policy, CBP did not have criteria to measure these vehicles' utilization because it was difficult to manually collect the data needed to establish appropriate criteria and assess if vehicles met those criteria. CBP is currently installing devices in many of its vehicles that will allow it to more easily collect such data, but lacks a specific plan for how to ensure these data will allow it to determine if vehicles are utilized. NRCS did not determine if 579 (9 percent) of its 6,223 selected vehicles were utilized in fiscal year 2015. USDA and NRCS fleet officials stated that the agency did not annually assess vehicle utilization, nor did it apply USDA criteria such as mileage or days used. USDA and NRCS officials said they were unaware of USDA's policy requiring these steps because the policy had not been widely discussed or shared within USDA since 2012. CBP and NRCS cumulatively incurred an estimated $13.5 million in depreciation and maintenance costs in fiscal year 2015 for vehicles with unknown utilization (see table). While these costs may not equal the cost savings agencies derive from eliminating underutilized vehicles, without corrective action, agencies are incurring expenses to retain vehicles without determining if they are utilized.", "a Selected owned vehicles for each agency in GAO's review covered all passenger vehicles and light trucks, except those that were: 1) emergency responder vehicles, 2) law enforcement vehicles, 3) tactical vehicles, or 4) located outside the Continental United States, among other limited exclusions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CBP develop a plan for how it will use its new data collection devices to establish criteria and assess vehicle utilization and that USDA communicate its vehicle utilization policy to fleet officials.

To identify what vehicles were  purchased from a non-GSA source, we identified the 17 waivers that GSA  approved from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2015 that allowed  agencies to purchase either a single vehicle or any executive fleet  vehicles from these other sources, and we determined what vehicle was  ultimately purchased with the approved waiver.", "To determine the extent to which selected agencies identify utilized  vehicles, we selected three departments that had among the largest  owned fleets in fiscal year 2015, among other criteria: the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and  the Department of Defense (DOD). Then, within each of those  departments we selected agencies that reported among the most owned,  non-law enforcement passenger vehicles and light trucks. The agencies  selected were Customs and Border Protection (CBP) within DHS; the  Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) within the USDA; and  the Navy within DOD. For each agency, we reviewed policies for  assessing vehicle utilization and obtained information on selected  vehicles in these agencies\u2019 fleets as of September or October 2016. We  then determined whether the selected agencies followed these policies,  including asking each agency to identify whether or not selected vehicles  met utilization criteria or had documentation to justify their retention,  among other categorization requests. We analyzed the costs agencies  reported paying for maintenance in fiscal year 2015 and the lost resale  value (i.e., depreciation) agencies may have incurred for any potentially  underutilized vehicles they did not identify and remove. We also  interviewed agency fleet officials about their agency\u2019s policies for  assessing vehicle utilization.

Five departments  owned approximately 89 percent of these vehicles, as shown in Table 1.", "Agencies acquire vehicles through purchase or lease and are responsible  for making decisions about the number and type of vehicles they need.  Agencies obtain almost all of their vehicles through GSA. Specifically, by  purchasing through GSA\u2019s Vehicle Purchasing program or leasing a  vehicle through GSA Fleet. GSA is a mandatory source for purchase of  new vehicles for federal executive agencies and other eligible users.  According to federal guidelines, when deciding what vehicle to buy,  agencies should purchase vehicles that meet their mission and represent  the best value by considering price, when the vehicle can be delivered,  fuel economy, lifecycle cost, past performance, and other considerations.  GSA Vehicle Purchasing offers an array of non-tactical vehicles and  options at a savings from the manufacturer\u2019s invoice price, including  traditional vehicles (such as pickup trucks and sedans) and specialized  vehicles (such as firetrucks and utility trucks). GSA develops annual  vehicle standards that establish the types and sizes of vehicles and  general equipment it will offer through the GSA Vehicle Purchasing  program. GSA also maintains an on-line procurement tool\u2014known as  AutoChoice\u2014that allows the purchasing agency officials to view the  standard vehicle models, choose equipment options, view side-by-side  comparisons of vehicle models from different manufacturers, place their  orders, and track delivery. The order is then recorded in a GSA  procurement database called ROADS. If GSA cannot meet an agency\u2019s  needs for a specific vehicle, agencies can apply to GSA for a waiver. If  approved, agencies may then purchase a vehicle directly from a non-GSA  source, such as a dealership.", "In some cases, agencies are required to or directed to acquire vehicles  with a lower environmental footprint. For example, the Energy Policy Act  of 1992 requires that 75 percent of agencies\u2019 light-duty vehicle  acquisitions be alternative-fuel vehicles (AFVs). In addition, the Energy  Independence and Security Act of 2007 prohibits agencies from acquiring  any light-duty motor vehicle or medium-duty passenger vehicle that is not  a low greenhouse-gas emitting vehicle. Executive Order 13693, issued  in March 2015, directed that agencies plan for zero emission vehicles or  plug-in hybrid vehicles to make up 20 percent of all new agency  passenger vehicle acquisitions by December 31, 2020, and 50 percent of  all new agency passenger vehicle acquisitions by December 31, 2025.", "Agencies are responsible for managing their vehicles\u2019 utilization in a  manner that allows them to fulfill their missions and meet various federal  guidelines and directives, such as by completing a vehicle allocation  methodology (VAM). The VAM process is designed to help agencies  identify the optimal size and composition of their respective fleets. Under  GSA guidance, agencies are directed to complete a VAM survey, which  measures the usage of each vehicle in the fleet, at least every 5 years.  GSA guidance further advises agencies on how to complete the VAM  process. For example, agencies are instructed to have standards for the  minimum amount of use of a vehicle\u2014called utilization criteria\u2014that are  appropriate for their missions. Agencies define their own utilization  criteria\u2014which may include mileage, number of trips, or other metrics\u2014 and decide which vehicles, if any, to eliminate from their fleets.", "Federal agencies determine when to replace or dispose of vehicles based  on federal vehicle replacement standards and their mission and program  needs. GSA has established minimum standards in federal regulations  that call for agencies to retain agency-owned vehicles for at least a  requisite number of years or miles before replacing them. For example,  an agency should keep a sedan or station wagon for at least 3 years or  60,000 miles, whichever occurs first. It may keep the vehicle beyond the  minimum years and miles if the vehicle can be operated without  excessive maintenance or substantial reduction in resale value.  Conversely, the agency may replace a vehicle that has not yet met the  threshold if the vehicle needs body or mechanical repairs that exceed the  fair market value of the vehicle. Federal regulations allow agencies to  dispose of vehicles they no longer need and have been declared excess,  even if the vehicles have not met the minimum replacement standards for  years and mileage.

For instance, these officials reported that  it can be time-consuming for fleet managers to ensure that drivers of  dual-fueled vehicles, which can run on gasoline or an alternative fuel, use  the required alternative fuels when reasonably priced and available,  which is defined as within a 5 mile or 15 minute drive. Similarly, agency  officials reported that completing paperwork associated with the AFV  requirements can take up costly staff time. For example, one official  stated that an agency\u2019s mission may require the use of certain vehicle  types\u2014such as pickup trucks\u2014 that do not meet the Energy  Independence and Security Act of 2007\u2019s requirement to purchase only  low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicles, resulting in the need for an agency  to certify that no low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicle is available to meet  the functional needs of the agency. The official explained that it was very  time-consuming for his staff to complete the required paperwork for each  vehicle in the fleet that was not a low-greenhouse-gas-emitting vehicle."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inaccurate and Fragmented Data Can Require Additional Personnel Resources", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the three selected agencies reported that limitations of their  fleet management information systems\u2014including manual data entry and  recording fleet data in multiple systems\u2014can lead to increased costs in  the form of staff time and missed opportunities to analyze the available  information. Officials also reported that efforts to address these limitations  by adopting more sophisticated technology typically involve obstacles  such as the complications associated with cybersecurity.", "Officials for each selected agency said that their systems require the  manual entry of some data, which is resource intensive. For example, one  official said users needed to complete some forms by hand before the  data were manually entered into the system. Officials also said users  sometimes manually enter data in non-standard formats, which can  increase the amount of time needed to analyze the data.", "In addition, according to agency officials, when fleet data are recorded in  multiple systems that do not communicate with each other, it requires  more staff time to accomplish fleet management tasks. One official stated  that in some cases, agencies within the same department may not use  the same data systems, a situation that complicates internal processes  such as transferring a vehicle from one agency to another.", "Several officials said that they are interested in adopting new  technologies that have the potential to streamline the collection and  improve the accuracy of fleet data, such as using scanners to collect data  from bar codes. However, officials cautioned that it can be costly and  time-consuming to adopt new technologies and integrate them into  existing systems and processes. For example, an official within Navy said  that his office paid a local vendor to run diagnostics on their vehicles\u2019  engines \u2014a costly process. In an attempt to minimize these costs, his  office identified an available software program that could perform these  diagnostics at a potential savings of $200\u2013300 per test. The official said  that as of October 2016 the Navy was 8 months into the process of  evaluating the program for potential use. Similarly, officials from Navy  reported challenges in adopting telematics.  Specifically, according to  Navy officials, telematics have been installed in approximately 700 owned  vehicles in Navy\u2019s fleet, at an estimated cost of approximately $300,000;  however, they have not yet been able to activate 674 of those 700  installed telematics systems due to cybersecurity reviews to ensure that  the vehicles cannot be manipulated by outside sources.  Navy officials  said that while telematics offer information that benefits some vehicles  and missions, installing telematics in their vehicle fleets required a  substantial initial investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Budget Restrictions Can Increase Fleet Costs", "paragraphs": ["`  Some officials said that when budgets are tight they retain vehicles that  need to be replaced beyond the standard replacement timeframe of three  years or 60,000 miles for sedans and station wagons, which can lead to  higher overall fleet costs. Officials explained that maintenance costs  increase as vehicles age, so the overall lifecycle costs of owning older  vehicles is higher. According to the fiscal year 2015 Federal Fleet Report,  the average age of owned passenger vehicles was 5.8 years for DHS, 5.4  years for USDA, and 5.2 years for Navy. According to officials, some  agencies perform vehicle lifecycle cost analyses which help determine  when vehicles are no longer cost effective to retain, among other  decisions. However, one official said they were not always able to replace  vehicles when their analyses suggested the vehicle should be replaced  due to budget constraints. Moreover, by using more of their fleet funds on  maintenance, agencies have even fewer available resources to purchase  new vehicles. Officials said that this cycle can make it challenging for fleet  managers to contain costs. According to officials, to help address the  costs of aging owned vehicles, Navy and NRCS are planning to increase  their use of GSA-leased vehicles. An official from CBP reported that  converting their fleet from owned to leased vehicles was generally not  financially feasible because CBP installs mission-specific special systems  and equipment and operates in conditions that would be likely to damage  vehicles."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given the billions of dollars spent annually to operate and maintain  federally owned vehicles and the government-wide emphasis on efficient  fleet management, it is critical for agencies to have sound fleet  management practices.

Nonetheless, our finding that millions of  dollars are being spent on vehicles that are potentially underutilized  indicates action is needed.", "Because CBP does not view DHS criteria to be appropriate in all cases  for its diverse fleet and does not individually justify vehicles, CBP  management cannot determine which vehicles, if any, are being properly  utilized by CBP staff, and the agency may be spending millions of dollars  on vehicles that are not needed. While new telematics devices are  capable of providing vehicle usage information, CBP risks losing the  opportunity to use these new data to identify and remove underutilized  vehicles because CBP has not developed a plan to determine how it will  use this usage data to improve its utilization assessment processes,  including processes for vehicles without telematics devices.", "Additionally, because key NRCS and USDA officials were unaware of  USDA\u2019s policies on utilization and assessment, staff did not have  necessary information to guide retention decisions for vehicles that cost  more than $750,000 annually. Awareness of this policy would provide  important information to NRCS officials to determine which vehicles, if  any, may be underutilized and could be removed from their fleet.

Specifically, we analyzed information on more than 64,500 passenger  vehicles and light trucks purchased by federal agencies through GSA  from fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2015 (the most recent, complete  fiscal year at the time of the request), including information such as:  the quantity of vehicles purchased;  the type of vehicle, such as a pickup truck or sedan;  the agencies that acquired vehicles;  the cost of the vehicles purchased; and  the location of where the purchased vehicles were delivered.", "We also used the ROADS data to analyze the options that agencies  purchased with these vehicles, as options provide additional insight into  the characteristics of the vehicles purchased. Agencies selected 346  unique options for the passenger vehicles and light trucks purchased  during this 5-year time period. In order to describe the purpose of these  options, we categorized the options into six groups. The first four groups  were derived from the Federal Property Management Regulations  (FPMR):  1.  Safety: We defined this category as options that serve to prevent  collisions, vehicle or other damage, injury, or theft of the vehicle. This  includes protecting occupants in the event of a collision and  supporting the recovery of a vehicle if it is stolen. Lane-departure  warning systems and backup cameras are examples of options we  placed in the safety category.  2.  Economy: We defined this category as options that remove features,  or options that reduce the size, power, or features to be included in a  vehicle. Reducing the engine size or eliminating air conditioning, thus  potentially reducing vehicle\u2019s cost, are examples of options we placed  in the economy category.  3.  Efficiency: We defined this category as options that could increase  the fuel efficiency of a vehicle (including supporting use of alternative  fuels) as well as options that facilitate vehicle maintenance and  optimal operation (including reducing operating costs). An engine  capable of running on compressed natural gas is an example of an  option we placed in the efficiency category.  4.  Suitability: We defined this category as options that could reasonably  be determined to be necessary to accomplish an agency\u2019s mission.  Pre-wired police equipment is an example of an option we placed in  the suitability category.", "In addition, we created two additional categories:  5.  Administration: We defined this category as including options that  were related to the purchase, delivery, or warranty of the vehicle  (such as the option to send a vehicle overseas).  6.  Undetermined: We used this category to group options that did not  meet any of the five defined categories, including options with unclear  descriptions.", "We then conducted a content analysis to categorize all 346 options into  each of these categories. In order to conduct this analysis, two analysts  independently coded each of the options into the six categories, and then  met to discuss and resolve any coding discrepancies. After this initial  categorization, 48 options were categorized as \u201cundetermined\u201d. We  subsequently discussed our categorizations with GSA officials and asked  them for any examples of why agencies might select these undetermined  options for any of the other five categories. After reviewing GSA\u2019s  responses, we placed 38 of the previously undetermined options into one  of the five other categories. The remaining 10 options were still  categorized as \u201cundetermined\u201d because GSA\u2019s response did not provide  assurance that the option belonged in one of the other five categories.  For example, GSA replied that power seats could be selected for drivers  with mobility impairments, but we found that agencies selected power  seats over 5,000 times. Similarly, GSA suggested that remote keyless  entry could be a safety feature for vehicles operated in extreme climates,  but it is unclear what climates would constitute \u201cextreme\u201d. When we  randomly selected zip codes to determine where 10 of the vehicles with  remote keyless entry were delivered, we found that they were delivered to  Maryland, North Carolina, and Virginia, among other locations. We  subsequently reported the cost and frequency of these remaining options,  combining some similar options (i.e., leather seats and heated front  leather seats), which resulted in the six options we analyzed.", "We also analyzed information on the number of waivers that agencies  submitted to GSA during this time frame in order to purchase vehicles  from a non-GSA source. We examined all 17 waivers that GSA approved  from fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2015 for an executive agency to  either purchase one vehicle or to purchase executive vehicles. For each  of these waivers, we requested purchase orders and other relevant  information from the agencies that received these waivers to determine  what vehicles were purchased.", "To determine how selected federal agencies identify what vehicles are  utilized, we judgmentally selected three federal agencies for review: the  U.S. Navy (Navy); U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources  Conservation Service (NRCS); and U.S. Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s Customs and Border Protection (CBP). We made our selection  after considering the following criteria about their respective departments: among the largest owned fleets in fiscal year 2015, at least 10,000 non law enforcement designated vehicles, and a majority of domestic vehicles in their overall fleet.", "We then selected the agencies from these three selected departments  that reported among the largest number of domestic, non-law  enforcement passenger vehicles and light trucks in response to a GAO  request for this information. We selected these fleets to broadly discuss  the experiences and practices across a section of the federal fleet. These  results are not generalizable to their overarching departments or other  federal agencies.", "We reviewed the selected agencies\u2019 policies on utilization and interviewed  officials. To estimate the costs associated with potentially underutilized  vehicles, we conducted a multi-step analytical process. First, we focused  on a selected population of vehicles, which included:  light trucks or passenger vehicles, because these two categories  comprise the majority of federal-owned vehicle fleets (approximately  55 percent and 15 percent respectively);  vehicles that are still in the selected agencies\u2019 inventories as of  November 2016; and  vehicles that were acquired prior to fiscal year 2015, so that the  agencies were fully accountable for the selected vehicles\u2019 utilization  over the entire fiscal year 2015 time period.", "We defined passenger vehicles and light trucks using vehicle descriptions  in GSA\u2019s Federal Automotive Statistical Tool (FAST) database, as shown  in table 8.", "We excluded tactical, law-enforcement, and emergency-responder  vehicles from the selected vehicle population as well as vehicles located  outside of the continental U.S., due to the differences in reporting and  management processes that can be associated with these characteristics.  We also excluded vehicles that were procured through non-appropriated  funds, such as user fees, as any savings associated with eliminating  those vehicles would not accrue to the federal government.", "We then requested data from the three selected agencies on all of the  relevant vehicles in our defined population. After receiving the data from  the selected agencies, we conducted various diagnostic analyses of  these data to assess their reliability and performed logic procedures to  address obvious data issues. For example, we examined VIN numbers  and acquisition cost values and removed any vehicles with errors from  the population of analysis, removing approximately 12,900 vehicles in  total across the three agencies. We received over 25,000 vehicle records  from the three agencies that we reviewed for reliability and data issues,  and 12,175 vehicle records met our selection criteria for analysis. In total,  the selected vehicles from these agencies accounted for about 3 percent  of the federally owned fleet. The findings from our analysis of these  vehicle records are not generalizable to all vehicles at the agencies or to  agencies beyond those we selected.", "Next, we sent to each selected agency a list of their selected vehicles and  requested that they group the vehicles into one of the categories  described below and depicted in figure 5, so that we could determine how  many vehicles were utilized, underutilized, or of unknown utilization.  Specifically, groups 3, 5, and 7 reflect shortcomings in agency efforts to  identify and remove underutilized owned vehicles. We focused on  determining the costs associated with the vehicles in these groups.", "Group 1: Vehicle must be a law enforcement, emergency response, or  tactical vehicle or located outside of the United States or no longer in the  agency\u2019s owned inventory. These vehicles are excluded from our  population of analysis.", "Group 2: Vehicle must have met at least one agency utilization criteria,  specifically defined in the agency\u2019s policy or guidance documents in fiscal  year 2015. This group did not apply to agencies that do not have  utilization criteria written in their policy.", "Group 3: The agency must have specific utilization criteria defined in  agency policy or guidance documents AND be unable to determine  whether the vehicle met this standard in fiscal year 2015. Example: The  agency has mileage-based utilization criteria, but the mileage data are  either missing or clearly incorrect (negative mileage).", "Group 4: For this category, for the vehicle\u2019s retention, there must be a  written justification that was considered valid by the agency in fiscal year  2015 in lieu of meeting criteria defined in agency policy or guidance. If the  agency does not have utilization criteria, then the vehicles would need to  have written justifications in regards to vehicle retention in order to be  placed in this category.", "Group 5: The agency is unable to determine whether there is a written  record verifying that in fiscal year 2015, the vehicle\u2019s continued use was  justified and approved.", "Group 6: Vehicle must NOT have met any agency utilization criteria for  fiscal year 2015 (or there are no criteria in agency policy) that was  specifically defined in agency policy or guidance documents, AND there  was no written justification for the vehicle\u2019s retention that was considered  valid by the agency in fiscal year 2015.

AND the vehicle was not  reassigned, repurposed, or given other tasks within the agency in fiscal  years 2015 or 2016.", "Agencies were responsible for categorizing each of the vehicles. We  provided the agencies with each vehicle\u2019s VIN number, make, model, and  other identifying information to assist in the process. We did not verify  whether agencies categorized vehicles correctly as some of the  information necessary for these categorizations was contained within  agency systems and records (for example, if the vehicle met an agency\u2019s  defined criteria or if the vehicle was repurposed). However, to evaluate  the overall reliability of agencies\u2019 vehicle justification reporting, we  selected a random sample of 20 vehicles from each agency that placed  vehicles into group 4 and then requested the written justifications for  those vehicles.", "To determine the cost savings that could be achieved through the  reduction of potentially underutilized vehicles (groups 3, 5, and 7), we first  determined what factors drove cost for the selected agencies in managing  their owned vehicles. After conducting agency interviews, we determined  that the main drivers of cost for agencies were depreciation,  maintenance, and fuel. While there are other drivers of cost, agency  officials reported that they did not collect information on the indirect costs  associated with owned vehicle fleets such as fleet manager salaries or  the costs to garage the vehicles. Although fuel is a main driver of cost,  any reduction in fuel costs by removing these underutilized owned  vehicles would most likely be offset to a large extent by an increase in  fuel costs for other vehicles in the agency\u2019s fleet in order to complete the  agency\u2019s mission. Thus, we determined that potential cost savings of  underutilized vehicles would be achieved through determining the  aggregate depreciation\u2014which represents foregone cost avoidance\u2014  and maintenance costs for fiscal year 2015.", "Agencies used different methods to calculate depreciation, so we used  GSA\u2019s simplified straight-line depreciation method to calculate a  consistent average annual depreciation cost per vehicle for each agency.  We asked each agency to provide the average capitalized value, average  salvage value, and average useful life (in years) for vehicles in their  respective fleets. We then used these values to calculate average annual  depreciation per vehicle and multiplied that cost to the number of vehicles  that were potentially underutilized. This calculation represented the total  depreciation of all potentially underutilized vehicles in each agency\u2019s fleet  for fiscal year 2015. However, because vehicles typically have greater  depreciation during their first few years in operation, the straight-line  depreciation method underestimates the actual loss of value for relatively  new vehicles but overestimates the actual loss for vehicles nearing the  end of their useful lives. The actual total cost savings\u2014in the form of  avoiding loss of value\u2014from removing vehicles is difficult to estimate  because it depends on many factors specific to each individual vehicle  such as age and model, and economic factors such as the fluid market  value for used vehicles.", "To calculate the total maintenance cost for potentially underutilized  vehicles, we asked the agencies to provide all maintenance transaction  records by vehicle for fiscal year 2015. While NRCS and Navy could  provide this information, CBP could only provide an unknown percentage  of their total fleet maintenance transactions. This response is due to the  fact that 60 percent of CBP\u2019s fleet has access to agency-owned  maintenance garages. CBP does not record asset-level maintenance  transactions for their agency-owned maintenance garages. To address  this issue, we asked CBP to provide the total maintenance cost incurred  to the agency in fiscal year 2015 as well as the total number of vehicles in  its fleet for fiscal year 2015. After CBP provided this information, we were  able to calculate its average vehicle maintenance cost for fiscal year  2015, and we multiplied this average to the number of potentially  underutilized vehicles in its fleet. Although the average per-vehicle  maintenance costs are substantively lower for NRCS vehicles (groups 5  and 7) than those of CBP, high maintenance costs are consistent with  CBP officials\u2019 statements that their vehicles drive in difficult terrain. Given  the potential for harsh driving conditions, we determined that their  calculated total costs are reliable for reporting purposes.", "To gather information related to challenges agencies face in managing  the costs of their owned vehicle fleets, we spoke with fleet management  officials from our three selected agencies: Navy, CBP, and NRCS. We  conducted two discussion groups with fleet management officials in  October 2016. We recruited participants by requesting volunteers from  each agency\u2019s fleet management pool, and then judgmentally selected  the eventual participants in order to achieve a balance of representation  among all three of the selected agencies. A total of 17 fleet management  officials participated in our discussions, with at least one representative  from each agency in each group. We also conducted individual interviews  with upper management officials from each of the three selected agencies  to discuss the challenges agencies face in managing the costs of their  fleets. Findings from our discussion groups and interviews, while  illustrative, are not generalizable to the full population of fleet  management officials at these three agencies or the federal government.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2016 to April 2017 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
