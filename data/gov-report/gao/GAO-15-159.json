In particular, officials from DHS, DOT, and transit agencies GAO selected explained that it is difficult for transit agencies to place priority on resilience activities because managers may be reluctant to focus on resilience and resilience activities compete with other priorities for funding. Federal, transit-agency, and emergency-management officials also cited challenges related to some aspects of federal grants that have made it difficult for transit agencies to, among other things, incorporate resilience into disaster recovery efforts and make regional transit-networks resilient.

In addition to the financial impact, loss of  transit services, and damage of related infrastructure can have negative  effects on a community by impeding access to jobs, medical care,  education, shopping, and other services. For example, recent severe  weather events, such as major winter storms in Massachusetts and  landslides in Washington State, temporarily shut down transit systems in  these areas. Further, these types of weather-related events can be  expected to increase. According to the United States Global Change  Research Program, the impacts and costs of weather disasters are likely  to increase in significance as such events become more common and  intense due to climate change.

We also interviewed officials from these two agencies. To  identify actions selected transit agencies take to make their systems more  resilient, we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from nine  transit agencies and five local emergency management offices in five  metropolitan areas: Los Angeles Region, California; Miami, Florida;  Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Seattle/Puget Sound Region, Washington;  and Washington, D.C. These areas are among the 10 largest  metropolitan areas in terms of transit ridership and were selected to  obtain variation in geography, types of risks, and transit modes.

These policies\u2014which focus on critical infrastructure, national  preparedness, and climate change or weather-related events\u2014address  resilience in the context of homeland security (e.g., terrorism) and natural  disasters. The federal government has targeted 16 critical infrastructure  areas for resilience-building policies. Transportation infrastructure, which  includes public transit systems, is one of these areas.", "Actions that can help transit agencies prepare for, respond to, recover  from, and mitigate the risk of catastrophic events can contribute to transit  system resilience. These actions can be taken before, during, and after  an event (see fig. 1). For example, transit agencies can develop plans to  help them prepare for a catastrophic event before it occurs, and can  repair transit infrastructure after an event so that the infrastructure can  better withstand similar events in the future.", "In large part, the actions for resilience-building efforts noted in figure 1  occur at the local level and are specific to the needs, scope, and risks of  the transit systems, factoring in state and local priorities. However, the  Stafford Act of 1988, as amended, mandated a role for the federal  government in assisting state and local governments to carry out their  responsibilities to alleviate the damage from disasters. Today, federal  agencies\u2014DHS and DOT, in particular\u2014share federal oversight of and  assistance for critical infrastructure, including transit systems. Moreover,  DHS and DOT are the federal agencies responsible under the National  Infrastructure Protection Plan for promoting national resilience-related  polices in public transit systems. DHS has primary responsibility for  transportation security and emergency preparedness and response.  DHS\u2019s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is the primary federal  agency overseeing security matters for public transit systems and  provides technical assistance to transit agencies to augment their system  security. DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has  responsibility for administering the public transportation-security grant  provisions of the 9-11 Act and is the lead federal agency responsible for  building the nation\u2019s capability to prepare for and respond to all-hazards  catastrophic events. Transit agencies can apply to FEMA for grants for  emergency planning, response, recovery, and mitigation efforts\u2014either  directly or through their states, depending on the type of grant. DOT\u2019s  Federal Transit Administration (FTA) provides funds to help develop new  transit systems and improve, maintain, and operate existing systems; and  provides technical assistance as needed to transit systems. As specified  by law, FTA\u2019s programs for funding transit systems operate as either  formula or discretionary grants for certain types of capital or operating  expenses.

As noted by DHS and transit officials, some changes  in funding levels and timing of grant availability can limit transit agency  and local use of federal assistance.", "According to DHS officials, TSA employs a risk-based strategy to  determine security risks on public transit systems. DHS maintains a Top  Transit Asset List (TTAL) to identify critical infrastructure assets that are  vital to the continuity of major transit systems and whose destruction  would be detrimental to the region and even the nation. TSA uses the  TTAL to help target technical assistance, and FEMA uses it to allocate  transit security grants to reduce risks associated with major transit  systems, especially in large metropolitan areas.", "As part of its risk-based approach, TSA conducts 30 to 34 Baseline  Assessment for Security Enhancement (BASE) reviews of public transit  agencies per year, which support transit agency resilience in several  ways.effectiveness of transit agencies\u2019 security and emergency response  programs and to identify existing security guidelines and requirements  and security gaps so the evaluated transit agency can prioritize actions to  address vulnerabilities to enhance security. Officials from DHS and transit  agencies we visited said that the BASE reviews are an effective tool to  assess a transit agency\u2019s security program. According to DHS officials,  DHS also uses the results of the BASE reviews in the selection process  for Transit Security Grant Program (TSGP) grants; the TSGP is discussed  further below. Furthermore, TSA disseminates best practices, identified in  part through the BASE program, among regional and national transit  agencies, emergency management agencies, and state agencies, which  can help make transit systems more resilient. These best practices  include, for example, incorporating resilience into capital project design.  Moreover, DHS has stated that, as critical infrastructure is built and  refurbished, those involved in making design decisions should consider  the most effective ways to prepare for threats and hazards, mitigate  vulnerabilities, and minimize consequences.", "Sections 1405 and 1406 of the Implementing Regulations of the 9/11 Commission Act  of 2007, Pub.

See figure 2 for the annual TSGP amounts awarded for public transit  from fiscal year 2005 through fiscal year 2014\u2014the current year. Later in  this report, we discuss the challenges experienced by transit agencies  related to the timing of these grant funds. To determine which transit  agencies receive TSGP funds, a panel of officials from different DHS  agencies, including FEMA and TSA, rank and score proposed projects  based on, among other things, whether agencies have assets listed in the  TTAL and their BASE results.", "FEMA also administers a Port Security Grant Program, designed to  directly support maritime transportation-infrastructure security activities,  such as improvement of port-wide maritime security-risk management,  maritime security-training exercises, and maritime security-mitigation  protocols that support port recovery and resilience capabilities. According  to DHS officials, ferry systems that are awarded these funds cannot also  apply for TSGP funds for the same project.", "In addition to the TSGP and Port Security Grant Program, transit  agencies are eligible for the Homeland Security Grant Program. These  grants, such as the Urban Areas Security Initiative, are aimed at helping  metropolitan areas build and sustain national preparedness. However,  transit agencies cannot apply directly for these funds. State  Administrative Agencies apply for these grants on behalf of the state and  its subgrantees, including transit agencies and other local entities seeking  such funds.", "FEMA\u2019s disaster- and hazard-mitigation grant programs can also be used  for helping make transit systems resilient. Public Assistance, typically the  largest of these programs, focuses on immediate post-disaster recovery  efforts and its grants can be used for removing debris, implementing  emergency protective measures, and repairing or replacing damaged  public equipment or facilities. Public Assistance funds also may be used  for hazard mitigation measures to damaged infrastructure to reduce the  likelihood of future damage. According to FEMA officials, transit agencies  are also eligible for three FEMA mitigation grant programs\u2014Hazard  Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM)  Program, and Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) Program\u2014that primarily  fund weather-related resilience efforts, such as implementing flood control  measures or protection from the effects of earthquakes. Transit agencies  in the wake of recent disasters have used mitigation funds to support  resilience projects.", "While FEMA\u2019s mitigation grant programs can help transit agencies carry  out resilience-type projects, we identified two limitations transit agencies  face in trying to obtain such funds. First, to obtain FEMA funding, transit  agencies must apply through their state government as opposed to  applying directly to the federal government. Thus, transit agencies are  competing with other state and local organizations, including non-transit- related organizations such as housing organizations and public utilities,  for FEMA funds. Second, FEMA officials noted that because various  FEMA grants and other federal funds to aid recovery and resilience  building after a catastrophic event have different regulations and  timeframes, it could be difficult for the grant recipients to coordinate the  use of these funds for resilience efforts.transit agencies and others indicate arise from competing priorities and  the timing of federal grants in more detail later in the report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOT Focuses on Transit Funding and Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["DOT provides funding and technical assistance to transit agencies to  improve their resilience.

FTA may require that transit agencies  refund FTA for the portion of an FTA-paid asset if that asset does not last  the minimal life cycle for that asset. FTA officials stated that this  requirement could incentivize transit agencies to take actions that could  contribute to system resilience. For example, the useful life requirement  could encourage transit agencies to adopt improved asset management  practices, which also improve the resilience of transit assets. However,  in cases of disasters, FTA can waive this requirement. FTA waived this  requirement for the buses that were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina and  thus were taken out of service before reaching their minimum useful life.  FTA officials further told us that, as permitted under the Stafford Act, FTA  waived the remaining useful life for property damaged or destroyed by  Hurricane Sandy.", "In addition to federal requirements, FTA officials told us that local building  codes and current industry design standards could help transit agencies  build resilience. For instance, according to transit officials we spoke with  in California, California\u2019s stringent seismic codes enable transit systems  to build to better withstand earthquakes.

Separately, officials from  Philadelphia\u2019s SEPTA told us that while they do not have a formal  agreement with other local transit agencies, they participate in a regional  transit working group to, among other things, address common security- related issues, coordinate drills and training, and efficiently administer  and procure certain security equipment and other services.", "While we did not assess the effectiveness of the selected transit  agencies\u2019 coordination efforts with other state and local agencies, our July  2009 report on disaster assistance stated that stakeholders faced  obstacles with coordination and collaboration after the 2005 Gulf Coast  hurricanes. Based on our review of five past disasters, we found that  collaborative practices could help communities recover and rebuild from  catastrophic events. Accordingly, we recommended that FEMA  establish a mechanism for sharing information and best practices focused  on disaster recovery, including practices that promote effective  collaboration. In September 2013, we found that FEMA had implemented  this recommendation.", "In addition, eight transit agencies we visited showed or told us about  changes they have made to their physical infrastructure to mitigate the  impacts of catastrophic events on their transit systems. For example:", "Miami-Dade Transit made changes to better protect its electrified third  rail and reduce damage and replacement costs. This transit agency  uses cover boards to protect the electrified third rail that supply power  to its trains. Officials from this transit agency told us that hurricane  winds ripped off cover boards in some places, damage that prompted  them to look for better solutions to protect the third rail. As a result,  officials installed newly designed cover boards that allow winds to flow  through the cover, rather than catch the wind\u2014thus allowing the cover  boards and the third rail to better withstand hurricane winds (see fig.  5.)", "Philadelphia\u2019s SEPTA changed its roadside curbs and subway vents  to reduce subway flooding. Flooding is one of the key risks to this  transit agency\u2019s rail system. Officials explained that subway flooding  occurs, in part, because water accumulates near roadside curbs that  have deteriorated, thus allowing water to enter vents that provide air  to the underground train system. To remedy the problem, the transit  agency raised curbs or vents throughout the city to minimize water  flow into the vents (see fig. 6). Prior to implementing this renovation,  the transit agency had previously relied on a strategy of covering  vents susceptible to flooding with plywood and sand bags in advance  of large storms, but this process was labor intensive and dependent  on how much time was available before a storm."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transit Agencies Face Challenges in Placing Priority on Resilience and with Certain Aspects of Some Federal Grants", "paragraphs": ["Officials from DOT, DHS, transit agencies and emergency management  offices we visited stated that transit agencies face challenges related to  placing priority on resilience and some aspects of certain grant programs  that can help make transit systems resilient.

These managers may not make  resilience a priority because it is difficult for them to make the case for  resilience projects and because catastrophic events occur infrequently.  As far back as June 1998, we reported that state and local governments  might be reluctant to take actions that improve resilience to natural  hazards because, among other reasons, decision-makers may not have  complete or accurate information on the extent to which averted losses  could exceed the increased cost of resilience actions.comprehensive and reliable data to make decisions about cost-benefit  tradeoffs continues to be difficult. FTA has developed a tool to help transit  agencies in Sandy-affected areas evaluate the cost-effectiveness of  resilience projects in reducing the vulnerabilities of both an asset and of  the public transportation system to future disasters. This information on  cost-effectiveness was among the factors FTA used to help it determine  which resilience projects would receive ERP funds. Additionally, three  transit researchers whom we interviewed agreed that it can be  challenging to convince management that preparing transit systems for  future catastrophic events should be a priority; they further explained that  this is because such events may not happen or may happen infrequently.", "Second, officials from four transit agencies we visited as well as DOT,  and DHS indicated that resilience activities compete with other priorities  for funding.", "Competing with other transit agency priorities: Resilience activities  may compete with other transit agency priorities\u2014such as those that  address systems operations \u2014for funding. For example, an official  from Seattle/Puget Sound Region\u2019s Washington State Ferries  explained that because his transit system lost a critical source of  funding\u2014the state\u2019s motor-vehicle excise tax\u2014the agency needed to  direct its existing funding sources to operating and construction costs,  which left little room for resilience-related activities, such as building  redundant systems. Officials from Philadelphia\u2019s SEPTA told us that  they sometimes have to prioritize funding to address federal  requirements\u2014such as a requirement to install positive train control  on railroads used to transport commuters, inter-city rail passengers, or  hazardous materials\u2014which limits the funding that is available for  other agency activities such as those that help make their system  resilient.", "Competing with other state priorities: In 1998, 2007, and 2014, we  found that state and local governments might be reluctant to invest in  resilience-building activities\u2014such as hazard mitigation\u2014because  leaders may be concerned that these activities will detract from  economic development goals that may be a higher priority for  communities. According to a FEMA official, transit systems have not  been high priority in states\u2019 applications for FEMA mitigation grants,  such as the HMGP, in part because states tend to focus on other  priorities that are of interest to communities. The FEMA official told us,  for example, that after Hurricane Sandy, a state prioritized HMGP  grants for residential housing rather than for transit. An official from an  emergency management office said that these competing priorities  may limit the funding provided to transit agencies and affect their  ability to undertake activities that could help make their systems  resilient.", "Third, officials from seven transit agencies and four emergency- management offices said that federal funds are not always available for  transit systems\u2019 resilience and limits their ability to undertake activities  that could help make their systems resilient. Officials from some of these  transit agencies said that federal funds are not always available to help  them make their systems resilient to catastrophic events, particularly  natural disasters, before they occur. For example, as discussed earlier,  ERP funds are currently available only after an event occurs and only if  Congress provides an appropriation specific to the event. Furthermore,  according to officials from one transit agency and two emergency  management offices, federal funds provided after a disaster to improve  resilience to future disasters are limited. An official from the transit agency  said that funding is limited because federal funds provided after a  disaster, other than through the ERP, are largely focused on recovery and  not mitigation or other activities that can be used to address resilience. An  official from one of the two emergency management offices said that  following a disaster, state or local funding may not be readily available to  cover the federal cost sharing requirements applicable to federally funded  projects, thus preventing them from receiving the federal funds. In  addition, officials from some of the transit agencies said that funding for  the TSGP, a grant program that helps transit agencies improve their  systems\u2019 resilience to security risks, is sporadic and difficult to obtain or  has declined. As discussed earlier, TSGP funds for public transit peaked  in fiscal year 2009 at almost $500 million; but were at or below $90 million  in each of the past 3 fiscal years. Miami-Dade Transit officials said that  the lack of TSGP funding has made it difficult to obtain funding to  implement security upgrades at facilities, and officials from Seattle/Puget  Sound Region\u2019s King County Metro Transit said the decline has made it  difficult to obtain funds to maintain implemented security solutions. The  four transit researchers we spoke with agreed that the availability of funds  for resilience is a challenge for transit agencies. Two of these transit  researchers further explained that funding resilience activities is  especially challenging for smaller transit agencies or agencies that do not  have enough funding from fare box revenue to address their operating  costs.", "Making choices about how to prioritize activities given finite resources is  not a new or unique dilemma for transit agencies. In March 2006, we  found that while transit agencies that operate rail systems may use FTA  financial assistance for security activities, such as upgrading security  technologies, they must balance and prioritize such investments in  security against other competing needs. about how to prioritize activities, which involves the consideration of  trade-offs, is similar to the process that other organizations, including  Congress and federal agencies, must go through when confronted with  funding requests that have merit, but exceed the amount of available  funding.interviewed are considering actions to assist transit agencies place  priority on resilience activities.", "GAO, Passenger Rail Security: Evaluating Foreign Security Practices and Risk Can  Help Guide Security Efforts, GAO-06-557T (Washington, D.C.: Mar. 29, 2006).", "Philadelphia\u2019s SEPTA and FTA are considering some actions that could  help place priorities on resilience activities within their agency:", "While participating in an FTA-funded climate-change adaptation- assessment pilot program, officials from SEPTA found, that one  strategy that could help ensure that the agency addresses resilience  across a range of weather events is to incorporate assets\u2019 climate  change vulnerabilities in SEPTA\u2019s asset management program. The  2013 report that summarized the results of the pilot program  concluded that if this vulnerability information is included in an asset  management program, decision-makers can use this information to  help them determine how to address those issues in future  maintenance or new construction investments. This agency has  incorporated elements of this strategy into its asset management  program.", "FTA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on an asset  management system, as discussed earlier, and is considering  whether risk analyses, among other things, should be included in  transit agencies\u2019 asset management plans to help transit agencies  make investment and other decisions. While the proposed rulemaking does not specifically refer to transit system resilience,  consideration of a transit system\u2019s risk during investment prioritization  decisions could help minimize those risks and thus improve the  resilience of a system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Federal Grant Program Requirements Pose Challenges for Use of Federal Funds for Resilience", "paragraphs": ["Transit agency, emergency management, and federal officials also cited  challenges specifically related to some aspects of federal grants,  challenges that have affected how or the extent to which transit system  resilience is addressed. These challenges are discussed below.", "Incorporating resilience into disaster recovery: Officials from  emergency management offices in Miami-Dade County and  Philadelphia as well as officials from Philadelphia\u2019s SEPTA and a  FEMA official, identified challenges with incorporating mitigation  activities into disaster recovery due to the difficulty of coordinating  available funding streams. As discussed above, mitigation is one  action that can contribute to resilience. After a presidentially declared  major disaster or emergency, an affected state can request funds  from FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance grant program for response and  recovery efforts, such as for repairing or replacing disaster-damaged  transportation infrastructure. However, an official from one of the  emergency management offices said that because federal and state  processes for distributing federal funds that can be used for mitigation  (i.e., FEMA\u2019s Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds) takes time,  transit agencies may not be able to use these funds during their  recovery efforts, such as those that occur with the help of the Public  Assistance grants. Further, an official from another emergency  management office said that hazard mitigation grants become  available after much of the rebuilding is under way or complete. Given  the different timelines for the Public Assistance and Hazard Mitigation  Grants, opportunities to incorporate resilience into projects occurring  during the recovery stages of a disaster can be missed. Determining  when agencies should focus on resilience and recovery can be  difficult. In March 2010, we found that state and local governments  might not have the capacity to focus on recovery soon after a  disaster. We have ongoing work to evaluate select efforts to  facilitate resilience as part of the Sandy recovery effort. We plan to  issue a report on these efforts in 2015.", "Decreased focus on regional resilience. Officials from Philadelphia\u2019s  SEPTA, the Los Angeles area\u2019s Orange County Transportation  Authority, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation  Authority, and one emergency management office said that changes  with FEMA\u2019s TSGP grant program has affected efforts to improve  regional resilience. In fiscal year 2011, DHS revised its policy for the  TSGP grant program from one where the funds were allocated to  high-risk regions and given to transit agencies in those regions using  a collaborative process to a nationally competitive grant program  where all transit agencies nationwide competed for the funds. When  grants were regionally allocated, transit agencies were required to  work together to determine how best to request and allocate TSGP  funds for their region. According to officials from two transit agencies,  such collaboration with other transit agencies in their region is  important because a city\u2019s transit network is often comprised of transit  systems run by multiple transit agencies. However, when the grant  program became competitive, officials from three transit agencies and  one emergency-management office said that transit agencies had less  incentive to collaborate with other transit agencies in their region  because all the agencies were competing for the same pool of TSGP  funds. FEMA officials told us that the grant program still encourages  regional collaboration because such collaboration is a criterion for  determining grant distributions. Furthermore, one emergency- management office said that changes with another FEMA grant  program\u2014the Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program\u2014 also potentially limited regional coordination. In fiscal year 2012, the  Regional Catastrophic Preparedness Grant Program\u2014which was  used to support regional all-hazard planning for catastrophic events\u2014 was discontinued as it was no longer funded. According to FEMA  officials, this grant program enabled agencies, including transit  agencies, in a region to coordinate their preparedness and planning  efforts with other agencies in their region. However, officials from the  emergency management office told us that the discontinuance of the  grant program may limit transit agency coordination and cooperation  that existed under the grant as agencies compete with one another for  other FEMA preparedness grants. Despite transit agencies\u2019  decreased incentive to coordinate with other transit agencies, we  found\u2014as we discuss earlier\u2014that transit agencies continue to  coordinate with other transit agencies through formal agreements or  by participating in local or regional transit coordination groups.", "Short period of performance to address resilience of certain assets: In  fiscal year 2012, DHS changed the period of performance for the  TSGP grants from 3 to 4 years\u2014 depending on the type of project\u2014to  2 years. According to DHS officials, DHS took this action to  encourage transit agencies to use their grants quickly. Officials from  Philadelphia\u2019s SEPTA told us that DHS\u2019s requirement that transit  agencies complete projects funded by TSGP grants in 2 years makes  it challenging for their agency to undertake projects that address  resilience. Specifically, these officials explained that because of  DHS\u2019s emphasis on completing projects within 2 years, transit  agencies cannot fully address the resilience of the assets needing  greater attention because projects related to these assets generally  take longer than 2 years to complete. According to DHS officials,  based on a review of seven transit agencies, the length of time for  completing transit security projects that require construction ranged  from about 2.5 to about 5 years, depending on the type of project.", "Transit agencies may request an extension to the 2-year period of  performance; however, according to DHS guidance on the grants,  such extensions are only given under exceptional circumstances,  such as if a natural disaster or other major event were to occur or if  complex environmental reviews cannot be completed within the time  frame. A DHS official told us that his agency recognizes the 2-year  performance period to be a challenge for transit agencies and said  that DHS is working with transit agencies and Congress to find the  right balance between getting funding deployed versus the length of  time it takes to complete more complex projects. The extent of this  challenge may differ depending on each agency\u2019s system. For  example, a transit researcher we spoke to said that in general, shorter  performance periods are typically not a problem for transit agencies  that primarily have bus fleets because projects associated with buses  do not take as long to complete as rail projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["One of the goals of public transit systems, post-disaster, is to resume  operations as quickly as possible. After catastrophic events, a system can  take days, weeks, or months to fully recover and rebuild. In the past 13  years, the vulnerability of transit systems to catastrophic events has been  repeatedly demonstrated as these events, particularly extreme weather  events, have occurred more frequently. Such events are expected to  increase going forward. Given that catastrophic events can be  challenging to predict, transit agencies find themselves in the difficult  situation of trying to balance the needs of daily operations with preparing  for such events. There is a constant need to balance the immediate  needs with the \u201cwhat-if\u201d needs as decision-makers prioritize use of their  finite resources. The role of the federal government in providing  resilience-related assistance to transit agencies may fluctuate, depending  on the catastrophic events and the related authority and appropriations  Congress provides to DOT and DHS. While it is not possible to make a  transit system completely immune to catastrophic events, continued  efforts by all parties to place priority on and improve resilience through  preparedness, response, recovery, and mitigation can help our nation\u2019s  transit systems potentially better withstand and recover from such events  and reduce their human and economic impacts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided DHS and DOT with a draft of this report for review and  comment.

Our review focuses on catastrophic events caused  either by nature (e.g., hurricanes, flooding, fires) or by humans (e.g.,  security events, including terrorism). Transit modes included in our review  include rail transit (light-rail, heavy rail, commuter rail), bus, and ferry  systems.", "To determine the activities DOT and DHS take to help transit agencies  make their systems resilient to catastrophic events, we reviewed and  analyzed documentation from the two federal agencies on their relevant  funding programs, requirements, guidance, policies, and technical  assistance. We also interviewed officials from these two agencies.

We determined that  the data were reliable for the purposes of describing the amount of  funding awarded for public transit. Also, to understand the federal  government\u2019s overall approach to addressing resilience, we reviewed  Executive Orders, Presidential Policy Directives, Homeland Security  Presidential Directives, and national policy statements or plans for  national critical infrastructure protection and climate change adaptation.

The five selected areas are Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania;  Seattle/Puget Sound Region, Washington; and Washington, D.C. We  selected the five metropolitan areas because they (1) are located in  different geographic areas and have the potential exposure to different  types of weather- and non-weather related risks (e.g., hurricanes,  earthquakes, terrorism), (2) have varying types of transit modes (light-rail,  heavy rail, commuter rail, bus, and ferry), and (3) are among the 10  largest metropolitan areas in terms of transit ridership. While we did not  interview all transit agencies in each metropolitan area, we selected those  that had relatively high transit ridership, were located in the city, or  provided service to the city. While the information we obtained from the  five areas is not generalizable to transit systems nationwide, the selected  areas have some of the larger transit systems in terms of ridership.
