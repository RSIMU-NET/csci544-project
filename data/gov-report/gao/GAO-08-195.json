Key work activities--those that are either inherently governmental or core to the agency's mission--are generally exempt from competitions. In fiscal year 2004, Congress began placing spending limitations on the Forest Service's competitive sourcing program because of concerns about how the program was managed. Also, like other agencies, the Forest Service must report annually to Congress on the savings achieved from any competitions it conducted. GAO was asked to determine the extent to which the Forest Service has (1) plans and guidance to help implement its competitive sourcing program effectively and (2) sufficient cost data to ensure that it complied with its spending limitations and accurately reported its savings to Congress for fiscal years 2004 through 2006. To answer these objectives, GAO examined the agency's strategic plan, guidance, and available cost data for competitive sourcing and interviewed key agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service lacks a realistic strategic plan and adequate guidance to help ensure that it can effectively implement its competitive sourcing program. For example, the Forest Service's current strategic plan is unrealistic because it does not take into account the likely availability of personnel and funding resources needed to implement the plan. Furthermore, the Forest Service lacks sufficient guidance on identifying key work activities that should be excluded from competitions. Although Forest Service officials do not believe that inappropriate work activities have been included in competitions that it has held, without clear guidance the Forest Service remains at risk of doing so. The agency also lacks a strategy on how to assess the cumulative effect that competitions could have on its ability to fight wildland fires and respond to other emergencies. Outsourcing a large number of federal jobs to the private sector could, over time, reduce the number of available responders. For fiscal years 2004 through 2006, the Forest Service lacked sufficiently complete and reliable cost data to (1) demonstrate its compliance with statutory spending limitations on its competitive sourcing activities and (2) accurately report competitive sourcing savings to Congress. Regarding compliance with spending limitations, the Forest Service did not collect cost data on all activities related to competitive sourcing because it believed that some costs were not subject to the limitations. For example, the Forest Service did not collect data on employees' salaries related to studying the feasibility of conducting a competition--a key component of its competitive sourcing process. GAO has interpreted the statutory spending limitations to generally apply to all costs attributable to the Forest Service's competitive sourcing program. Moreover, because the Forest Service's cost data used to determine compliance with statutory spending limitations were not reliable, the Forest Service cannot know if it exceeded the limitations. Regarding the savings achieved from its competitions, the Forest Service reported to Congress a savings totaling over $38 million between fiscal years 2004 and 2006. However, the Forest Service could not provide GAO with sufficient data or the methodology it used to calculate savings derived from competitions. In addition, GAO found that the Forest Service did not consider certain costs, which were substantial, in its savings calculations. As a result, Congress may not have an accurate measure of the savings from the Forest Service's competitive sourcing competitions during this period."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The 2001 President\u2019s Management Agenda includes a governmentwide  initiative\u2014known as competitive sourcing\u2014that aims to improve  government efficiency and reduce the costs of government programs by  promoting competition between federal employees and private sector  organizations. The competitions determine who should perform  commercial activities\u2014activities performed by the government that are  also regularly performed in the commercial marketplace, such as  information technology (IT), maintenance and property management, and  logistics. These competitions compare the public and private sector costs  of performing an activity and may result in outsourcing federal jobs to the  private sector. In its competitive sourcing strategic plan, known as the  Green Plan, the Forest Service, an agency within the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA), sets forth the agency\u2019s goal to conduct 14  precompetition studies in 5 years to evaluate the feasibility of subjecting  nearly two thirds of its total workforce to competitive sourcing  competitions.", "The Forest Service manages about 193 million acres of land\u2014about 30  percent of all federal lands\u2014and has a workforce of about 37,000 full-time- equivalent staff (FTE). The employees are geographically dispersed  throughout the nation. In addition to its headquarters in Washington, D.C.,  the Forest Service has 9 regional offices, 155 forest offices, and about 600  district offices.", "The Forest Service\u2019s competitive sourcing program is subject to the  requirements of the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Circular  No. A-76 (the circular) and the Federal Activities Inventory Reform Act of  1998 (the FAIR Act). Generally, the circular sets forth the competitive  process an agency must follow to determine whether federal employees or  private sector organizations should perform a commercial activity. The  competitive process can be divided into three stages: (1) a precompetition  planning stage that, among other things, determines the scope of the  competition; (2) a competition stage that begins with a public  announcement of a competition and ends with the selection of the  competition\u2019s winner; and (3) a postcompetition accountability stage,  which involves such activities as monitoring and reporting on the winner\u2019s  performance. The circular also directs agencies to create a staffing plan\u2014 which creates an organization of agency employees that is known as the  \u201cMost Efficient Organization\u201d (MEO)\u2014to be used to represent the agency  in the competition. After allowing for a transition period, the winner of the  competition, whether the MEO or a private sector organization, is subject  to the provisions of the postcompetition accountability stage.", "The FAIR Act, as implemented by the circular, requires federal agencies to  compile and submit to OMB for approval an annual inventory of the  activities their employees perform. The inventory must include the number  of FTEs that perform each activity and designate whether the activity is  inherently governmental or commercial. Inherently governmental  activities\u2014such as setting policy or spending funds\u2014are critical to the  role and function of government and, therefore, are exempt from  competition with the private sector. In contrast, commercial activities\u2014 those that are not inherently governmental and could be performed by the  private sector\u2014are subject to competitive sourcing competitions, unless  the agency exempts the activity. The agency may still exempt a  commercial activity if, for example, it deems the activity to be core to the  agency\u2019s mission (referred to as core-commercial).", "In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2004, requires executive  agencies to report annually to Congress on competitive sourcing  activities. Among other things, the act requires agencies to report actual  savings derived from implementing a competitive sourcing competition.  While the act does not provide direction on how to calculate actual  savings, OMB does provide this direction through annual guidance. The  Forest Service, through USDA, reported to Congress that it saved over   $38 million in fiscal years 2004 through 2006 as a result of competitive  sourcing competitions.", "Because of concerns about how the Forest Service was managing its  competitive sourcing program, Congress limited the funds that the Forest  Service could spend on competitive sourcing activities during fiscal years  2004 through 2007. In fiscal year 2004, the spending limitation was   $5 million; in fiscal year 2005, it was $2 million; in fiscal year 2006, it was  $3 million; and in fiscal year 2007, it was also $3 million. The Forest  Service initiated 171 competitions in fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and it has  acknowledged that this first experience with the competitive sourcing  initiative fell short of expectations. For example, a congressional study  noted that nearly half of these competitions involved three or fewer FTEs,  and that, as a result, Forest Service officials acknowledged that the  competitions were unrealistic, adding that holding competitions involving  few FTEs often made it impossible for private sector organizations to  compete effectively. Two of the most important lessons the Forest Service  believes it has learned from this experience are that it should (1) centralize  responsibilities for competitions to increase control and oversight and   (2) plan competitions better by, for example, identifying the appropriate  scope of the competition.", "The Forest Service has taken steps to improve the management of its  competitive sourcing program in both of these areas. In fiscal year 2003, it  strengthened headquarters\u2019 oversight of competitive sourcing  competitions. In fiscal year 2004, USDA issued guidance directing the  Forest Service to perform studies to assess the feasibility of conducting a  competition\u2014known as feasibility studies\u2014before committing to a  competition. Although not required by the circular, feasibility studies are  conducted during the precompetition planning stage and help determine  whether to compete an activity. Also, some of the steps required by the  circular during the precompetition planning stage are completed as part of  the study. In fiscal years 2004 through 2006, the Forest Service completed  three feasibility studies. They were for communications activities  (completed June 2005), the Geospatial Service and Technology Center  (completed April 2006), and fleet management activities (completed   May 2006). During this time frame, the Forest Service also completed three  competitions, all begun in 2003 and completed in 2004. They were the IT  competition (1,200 FTEs, completed July 2004); the fleet maintenance  competition (57 FTEs, completed January 2004); and the road  maintenance competition (66 FTEs, completed January 2004).", "As with the management of its competitive sourcing program in fiscal  years 2002 and 2003, the Forest Service\u2019s most recent competitive sourcing  activities have raised questions about whether the program is being  effectively managed. In this context, you asked us to determine the extent  to which the Forest Service has (1) plans and guidance to help implement  its competitive sourcing program effectively and (2) sufficient cost data to  ensure that it complied with its competitive sourcing statutory spending  limitations and accurately reported its competitive sourcing savings to  Congress for fiscal years 2004 through 2006.", "To address these two objectives, we focused on the Forest Service\u2019s  competitive sourcing activities between fiscal years 2004 through 2006.  For the first objective, we examined the Forest Service\u2019s Green Plan and  how the Forest Service scoped the three competitions it completed during  this period. In doing so, we collected and reviewed pertinent OMB, USDA,  and Forest Service guidance and documentation, including documentation  related to the three completed competitions. In addition, we interviewed  Forest Service officials familiar with the agency\u2019s competitive sourcing  activities to better understand implementation of the program. For the  second objective, we examined the appropriations acts for fiscal years  2004 through 2006 to determine which costs incurred by the Forest Service  during that period were subject to the spending limitations. We obtained  available Forest Service cost data for activities associated with its  competitive sourcing program. We assessed the reliability of these data  and found them unreliable as a measure of the costs and savings  associated with the program. We conducted our work between October  2006 and January 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

To help fulfill its  mission, the Forest Service devotes considerable resources to suppressing  wildfires. To coordinate the firefighting efforts of the Forest Service and  other federal land management agencies, the interagency National Wildfire  Coordinating Group (NWCG) was established. This group adopted an  interagency incident command system (ICS) and firefighting standards for  responding to wildland fires. Federal employees in the land management  agencies assume specific roles within the ICS, a command structure used  at all levels of government and organized around five primary functional  areas: command, operations, planning, logistics, and finance and  administration.", "There are about 80,000 federal employees and retirees who mobilize to  assist state and local organizations to fight fires and respond to national  emergencies as needed.

The remaining 18,000 to 20,000 employees are part of the  \u201cForest Service militia.\u201d These are employees who are ICS-certified to fight  fires but for whom the militia duty is a volunteer, collateral duty. These  militia members will often leave their primary work duties and travel to  the incident scene to provide assistance. A militia member may typically  spend between 1 to 3 weeks each year fighting wildfires and responding to  emergency situations. Militia teams that assisted the Federal Emergency  Management Agency following Hurricane Katrina logged as many as 60 to  90 days of duty. As part of their militia duties, Forest Service employees  often perform activities related to their regular work duties. For example,  when responding to a wildfire, an employee whose regular duties involve  IT support might provide this support at the scene of the fire. Employees  may also perform militia duties that are unrelated to their regular work  duties.

This is a significant increase  over the activities it proposed to study in a draft of this plan issued   5 months earlier in July 2005. The July 2005 draft Green Plan scheduled   13 feasibility studies for activities associated with 6,180 FTEs for fiscal  years 2005 through 2009. The Forest Service selected these activities by  identifying good candidates for feasibility studies and then selecting a  level of effort the officials believed could be managed over the next   5 years. For example, in selecting the studies, the officials said they  considered the complexity of the studies, the additional workload that  would result from conducting them, and the personnel resources required  in selecting these activities. The Forest Service used the following nine  criteria as the basis for identifying good candidates for feasibility studies:    Potential for savings. An activity with greater potential for savings  through more effective or efficient performance is considered a stronger  candidate for a feasibility study.", "Availability of private sector contractors. An activity performed by a  large number of commercial companies is considered a stronger candidate  for a feasibility study.", "Severability. An activity that can be performed by an independent  business unit is considered a stronger candidate for a feasibility study.", "Preferred government performance. An activity that management prefers  to be performed by a government position is considered a weaker  candidate for a feasibility study.", "Location.

An activity that is typically performed at a  central location is considered a stronger candidate for a feasibility study.", "Potential for process improvement. An activity with a greater potential for  improvement through modernization, reorganization, or some other means  is considered a stronger candidate for a feasibility study.", "Impact on incident support. An activity that supports emergency  situations, such as firefighting, is considered a weaker candidate for a  feasibility study.", "However, after reviewing the Forest Service\u2019s proposed Green Plan, USDA  directed the Forest Service to revise its plan to include all 24,512  commercial FTEs eligible for competition in either a feasibility study or an  A-76 competition.

According to a Forest Service official, the additional feasibility study  was added to comply with the USDA directive to include all commercial  FTEs in the Green Plan, not because it included activities that might  benefit from an A-76 competition. OCFO officials explained to us that  USDA agencies have an option to perform feasibility studies to identify  good candidates for more targeted feasibility studies, and that this was the  purpose of the 15,000 FTE feasibility study.

The  completed studies account for only 2,580 FTEs of the approximately  19,000 FTEs that were scheduled to be studied by this date.", "In our previous work, we found that effective strategic plans take into  account the resources required to implement the plan, such as human  capital, technology, and information. While Forest Service officials could  not provide us with any documents showing resources involved in  conducting feasibility studies, the effort does not appear to be  insignificant. According to OCFO guidance, 13 separate steps are involved  in conducting feasibility studies, with many of the procedures involving  several additional subtasks. Table 3 shows OCFO\u2019s guidance for  conducting feasibility studies.", "According to a senior Forest Service official, while the agency considered  personnel requirements when selecting the original 13 activities for  feasibility studies, it did not do so when it expanded the Green Plan to  include all commercial FTEs. According to this official, there would be no  practical way to conduct the 15,000-FTE study because it would include so  many dissimilar activities. Consequently, FTEs would first need to be  grouped into many separate activities, each requiring its own feasibility  study, and as the number of studies increased, so too would the demands  placed on Forest Service personnel. Several senior Forest Service officials  with whom we spoke said that it is inconceivable that the schedule of  feasibility studies in the OMB-approved Green Plan for fiscal years 2005  through 2009 could be met.", "Just as it did not take into account personnel resources in its OMB- approved December 2005 Green Plan, the Forest Service also did not  consider congressionally directed funding limitations.

Forest Service officials told us that the FAIR  Act inventory represents only a \u201crough snapshot\u201d of the inherently  governmental and core-commercial activities within the Forest Service,  and that much additional work must be done to identify specific activities  suitable for competition. They raised the following concerns about using  FAIR Act inventory data to identify inherently governmental and core- commercial activities:  Improper classification of activities in the FAIR Act inventory.  Disagreements between the Forest Service and USDA regarding activity  designations raise questions about appropriate classification.

The Forest Service is required by  OMB to use OMB-assigned function codes for the FAIR Act inventory.

Specifically, our review of  cost data from the USDA\u2019s Federal Financial Information System (FFIS)  and subsequent discussions with Forest Service officials, including the  Chief Financial Officer, confirmed that the Forest Service had not issued  formal guidance on which costs where to be charged to competitive  sourcing job codes in FFIS, and that there was a lack of institutionalized  policies and procedures to guide employees in tracking the time and costs  associated with competitive sourcing activities. As a result, Forest Service  officials, including the Chief Financial Officer, agreed that it was likely  that employees used job codes inconsistently and that the accounting of  competitive sourcing expenditures between fiscal years 2004 and 2006  were unreliable and inaccurate. We also asked the Forest Service for data  to substantiate the annual savings resulting from competitive sourcing  competitions it reported to Congress in fiscal years 2004 through 2006.

The appropriations acts for fiscal years 2004 through 2006  define a \u201ccompetitive sourcing study\u201d for purposes of the spending  limitations as  \u201ca study on subjecting work performed by Federal  Government employees or private contractors to public- private competition or on converting the Federal  Government employees or the work performed by such  employees to private contractor performance under the  Office of Management and Budget Circular A\u201376 or any  other administrative regulation, directive, or policy.\u201d", "Unfortunately, by defining a \u201ccompetitive sourcing study\u201d as a \u201cstudy,\u201d  albeit in the context of private versus public source performance, the  appropriations acts do not clearly indicate the breadth of Forest Service  activities that fall within its meaning. At the very minimum, however, the  phrase includes the competition stage (the second stage) of the OMB  Circular No. A-76 process because it represents the formal structured  process of soliciting and evaluating proposals from public and private  sources. The Forest Service takes the position that the annual spending  limitations apply only to costs attributable to the competition stage. We  disagree, as does the U. S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s General Counsel,  who provides legal assistance to the Forest Service. Even if we were to  read the word \u201cstudy\u201d as narrowly as the Forest Service apparently does,  the additional words \u201cand related activities\u201d in this context make clear that  the statutory language includes more than simply the competitions.", "The statutes do not define \u201crelated activities\u201d or set out specific criteria for  identifying them. While a broad range of activities are \u201crelated,\u201d in the  sense of having some logical connection to competitive sourcing studies,  we believe Congress intended to focus on those activities that the Forest  Service performs as part of its implementation of the President\u2019s  competitive sourcing initiative. In other words, \u201crelated activities\u201d are  those activities the Forest Service performs if it is considering whether to  conduct a public-private competition. Under the Forest Service\u2019s  competitive sourcing program, no competition is conducted until the  completion of a feasibility study, the objective of which is to evaluate  whether an activity should be subject to the A-76 competitive sourcing  process. Likewise, no competition is conducted under OMB Circular No.  A-76 until the completion of the precompetition stage (the first stage),  which also includes tasks such as conducting market research and  developing an acquisition plan. Feasibility studies and precompetition  planning activities are thus prerequisites to a competition and, therefore,  in our view, \u201crelated activities.\u201d Similarly, the postcompetition stage is a  required consequence of conducting a competition. The Forest Service\u2019s  Competitive Sourcing Program Office supports and manages these and  other activities in the Forest Service\u2019s competitive sourcing program.  Because these activities further the Forest Service\u2019s objective of  conducting competitions under the competitive sourcing initiative, we  view them as \u201crelated activities\u201d subject to the spending limitation.", "While it can be argued that the words \u201cand related activities\u201d include  activities the Forest Service performs to carry out the FAIR Act, such as  preparing inventories and reporting to Congress, we think the better view  is that these costs are not encompassed in this limitation. Congress by law  expressly requires these activities, even absent any other competitive  sourcing program activities. Moreover, complying with the FAIR Act does  not further the Forest Service\u2019s progress on the PMA competitive sourcing  initiative, and it was the Forest Service\u2019s cost to implement this initiative  to which the congressional committees were reacting. Our interpretation  is consistent with the interpretation provided to us by the USDA Office of  General Counsel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Accordingly, we conclude that the spending limitations on \u201ccompetitive  sourcing studies and related activities\u201d included in the appropriations acts  funding the Forest Service for fiscal years 2004 through 2006 apply to all  costs attributable to the Forest Service\u2019s competitive sourcing program,  including the following:    conducting feasibility studies to evaluate which activities should be  subject to the competitive sourcing process set out in OMB Circular   No. A-76;   engaging in the competitive sourcing process set out in OMB Circular   No. A-76, including activities related to precompetition planning,  competitions between sources, and postcompetition accountability; and   managing the agency\u2019s competitive sourcing program.", "The appropriations acts spending limitations, however, do not apply to  costs incurred for complying with the FAIR Act, which the Forest Service  must do even if it applies no efforts to competitive sourcing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Forest Service", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Chief of the Forest Service  letter dated December 31, 2007."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.  We believe that the Forest Service\u2019s comments misstate our position  regarding its guidance for ensuring that key work activities are  excluded from A-76 competitions. Our report does not state that the  Forest Service has no guidance, but rather that it lacks clear guidance.  Without clear guidance, we do not believe that the Forest Service\u2019s  current process can offer sufficient safeguards to ensure that key work  activities are excluded from A-76 competitions, especially in light of  the agency\u2019s plan to examine the activities of two thirds of its  workforce. For example, regarding the FAIR Act inventory, we found  significant fluctuations in the percentages of inherently governmental  activities in the inventory data for fiscal years 2004 through 2006,  suggesting that the Forest Service had difficulty classifying positions  when preparing the inventory. In addition, Forest Service officials told  us that the inventory data represents only a \u201crough snapshot\u201d of the  inherently governmental and core-commercial activities within the  Forest Service, and that much additional work must be done to  identify specifics activities suitable for competitions. Finally, the  Forest Service officials responsible for the three completed  competitions\u2014IT infrastructure, road maintenance, and fleet  maintenance\u2014told us that they developed their own methodologies to  classify inherently governmental and core-commercial activities  because they did not find the agency\u2019s FAIR Act inventory data useful  and received little guidance on how to identity inherently  governmental and core-commercial activities. Nevertheless, these  officials were confident that they successfully identified and exempted  from competition inherently governmental and core-commercial  activities because of, among other reasons, the clearly commercial  nature of the activities. However, the three completed competitions  may not be representative of future competitions, particularly if the  Forest Service proceeds with its plan to examine the work activity of  two thirds of its workforce.  2.  As we state in our report, OMB guidance on how to calculate  competitive sourcing savings reported to Congress does not specify all  of the costs that should be included in the calculations, thus providing  the Forest Service with some discretion on which costs to include.  Although the Forest Service followed OMB guidance in calculating  savings, we believe the guidance provides the Forest Service with the  latitude to include the other costs we identified\u2014some of which  substantially reduce or even exceed the savings reported to Congress.", "Including these costs would have provided Congress with a more  realistic picture of the extent to which the Forest Service\u2019s competitive  sourcing program is saving the American taxpayers\u2019 money.  3.  At the Forest Service\u2019s request, we excluded from our report much of  the information we received related to termination of the Serco  contract because negotiations between the Forest Service and Serco  are ongoing. However, excluding all mention of the types of possible  additional costs would provide the false impression that the savings  already reported to Congress resulting from the fleet maintenance  competition have been realized, when in fact they are being called into  question.  4.  Although the Forest Service does not believe it exceeded the spending  limitations, even under the broader interpretation, we found that it  does not have the data to substantiate this claim. Specifically, as we  state in our report, the Forest Service did not collect complete and  reliable cost data related to its competitive sourcing program during  fiscal years 2004 through 2006 because it did not have a cost  accounting system sufficient to track costs related to competitive  sourcing. Furthermore, in consultation with Forest Service officials,  we agreed that it was not feasible to reconstruct cost data for  competitive sourcing activities for these years because doing so would  require a significant amount of resources and would not likely provide  reliable data. Because the Forest Service was unable to provide us  with complete and reliable cost data and it was not feasible to  reconstruct the data, neither the Forest Service nor GAO can  determine with an appropriate degree of certainty if the Forest Service  exceeded the appropriations acts\u2019 spending limitations.", "In addition, we acknowledge in our report that the Forest Service has  made efforts to improve its policies and guidance on how to establish  job codes and how employees are to use them for tracking purposes,  including a directive specifying that the cost of performing some  precompetition planning activities be charged to competitive sourcing  job codes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Andrea Wamstad Brown,  Assistant Director; F.
