Although the United States has not had an outbreak of FMD since 1929, a single outbreak of FMD virus as a result of an accidental or intentional release from a laboratory on the U.S. mainland could have significant consequences for U.S. agriculture. The traditional approach to the disease, once infection is confirmed, is to depopulate infected and potentially infected livestock herds to eradicate the disease. The value of U.S. livestock sales was $140 billion in 2007; about 10 percent of this figure, or approximately $13 billion, was accounted for by export markets. The Plum Island Animal Disease Center (PIADC), on a federally owned island off the northern tip of Long Island, New York, is the only facility in the United States that studies the live FMD virus. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) was responsible for the PIADC from its opening in the 1950s until June 2003, when USDA transferred responsibility for it to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), as required by the Homeland Security Act of 2002. The act specified that USDA would continue to have access to Plum Island to conduct diagnostic and research work on foreign animal diseases, and it authorized the president to transfer funds from USDA to DHS to operate the PIADC. Also, under Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD-9), the secretary of Agriculture and the secretary of Homeland Security are to develop a plan to provide safe, secure, and state-of-the-art agricultural biocontainment laboratories for researching and developing diagnostic capabilities for foreign animal and zoonotic diseases. On January 19, 2006, DHS announced that to meet its obligations under HSPD-9, it would construct and operate a new facility--the National Bio- and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF)--containing several biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) laboratories, BSL-3 agricultural (BSL-3-Ag) laboratories, and biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories. FMD research is to be performed in a BSL-3-Ag laboratory. When fully operational, the NBAF is meant to replace the PIADC. The primary research and diagnostic focus at the PIADC is foreign or exotic diseases, including FMD virus, that could affect livestock, including cattle, pigs, and sheep. DHS stated that the PIADC was \"nearing the end of its life cycle\" and was lacking critical capabilities to continue as the primary facility for such work. Another reason DHS cited was the need to be close to research facilities. According to DHS, although the PIADC coordinates with many academic institutes throughout the northeast, its isolated island location means that few academic institutes are within a reasonable commuting distance; DHS believes that these are needed to provide research support and collaboration required for the anticipated NBAF program.

DHS concluded that the EIS and threat and risk analysis showed very little differentiation across the six sites and considered that the safety and security risks that had been identified at all sites were acceptable, with or without mitigation. Specifically, for all sites the risk was zero to low for all accident scenarios, except for an overpressure fire--an explosion from the buildup of a large amount of gas or flammable chemical in an enclosed area. The risk of an overpressure fire accident was moderate for all sites For all sites--except Plum Island--the overall risk rank was moderate, based on the potential for infection and opportunity for disease to spread through livestock or wildlife. The Plum Island site's overall risk rank was low, because the likelihood of any disease spreading beyond the island was small, since animals do not live in the vicinity and the potential for infection is less. The threat and risk assessment concluded that the insider threat would be the biggest threat to the NBAF and would be independent of the site."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is the most highly infectious animal  disease known: nearly 100 percent of exposed animals become infected  with it.

FMD virus has  seven serotypes and many subtypes. Immunity to or vaccination for one  type of the virus does not protect animals against infection from the other  types. FMD-infected animals usually develop blister-like lesions in the  mouth, on the tongue and lips, on the teats, or between the hooves; they  salivate excessively or become lame. Other symptoms include fever,  reduced feed consumption, and abortion. Cattle and pigs, which are very  sensitive to the virus, show disease symptoms after a short incubation  period of 3 to 5 days. In sheep, the incubation period is considerably  longer, about 3 to 12 days, and the clinical signs of the disease are usually  mild and may be masked by other diseases, allowing FMD to go unnoticed.", "The mortality rate for young animals infected with FMD depends on the  species and strain of the virus. Adult animals usually recover once the  disease has run its course, but because FMD leaves them severely  debilitated, meat-producing animals do not normally regain their lost  weight for many months, and dairy cows seldom produce milk at their  former rate. Thus, the disease can cause severe losses in the production of  meat and milk.", "FMD virus is easily transmitted and spreads rapidly. Before and during the  appearance of clinical signs, infected animals release it into the  environment through respiration, milk, semen, blood, saliva, and feces.  The virus may become airborne and spread quickly when animals become  infected. The virus replicates prolifically in pigs, so that they release large  amounts of the virus into the air. Animals, people, or materials exposed to  the virus can also spread FMD by bringing it into contact with susceptible  animals. For example, the virus can spread when susceptible animals  come in contact with animal products (meat, milk, hides, skins, manure);  transport vehicles and equipment; clothes or shoes; and hay, feed, or  veterinary biologics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMD Outbreaks", "paragraphs": ["FMD outbreaks occurred in most countries of the world during the  twentieth century.

They are  usually used to predict the dispersion of continuous buoyant air pollution  originating from ground level or elevated sources, primarily single puff  source releases. Gaussian plume models also assume that particle  dispersion follows a Gaussian distribution, meaning that particles at the  source have a normal distribution. The most appropriate use for straight- line Gaussian plume models is continuous releases of a constant source  strength and uniform wind field. They can be reasonably reliable over  short ranges (up to 10 km) in situations involving homogeneous conditions  and simple flows, such as unidirectional steady state flow over relatively  flat terrain.

Lincoln Laboratory stated that it is  unclear how the MACCS2 model compared to these standard models.

No matter where a release  occurred, all export sales would be lost. The impact on exports would not  permit discrimination across sites. If a containment zone was established,  however, fewer exports would be affected than under a national ban.  Imposing a containment zone restricts animals within it, and exported  products must be shown to come from animals outside the zone. The  fewer animals within the containment zone, the smaller the potential  impact on exports. To the extent that a release on an island might permit  defining a smaller containment zone and involve fewer animals (or not  affect animals at all) than a release at a mainland site, the losses from an  island release could be smaller. Estimates of the potential impact of  establishing containment zones with less comprehensive export bans  could help differentiate NBAF sites.", "DHS cited a November 2008 letter from OIE\u2019s director general that stated  that differences in the national impact of an outbreak relate more to how a  country\u2019s authorities respond than to where the outbreak occurs.

They did not  incorporate the accident scenarios in the EIS\u2014considered worst-case  scenarios\u2014or the results of the plume modeling of those scenarios. Also,  for the outbreak scenarios used in the analyses, the relative susceptibility  of the various animal species or animals kept indoors was not considered.  An outbreak could be more or less costly depending on the type of animal  infected. For example, since it is more difficult to detect the disease in  sheep than in cows, FMD could spread farther in sheep, creating an  outbreak of greater magnitude. The analyses also lacked information on  the FMD virus source term (numbers and species shedding virus at the  time of the outbreak by serotype), meteorological conditions, and virus  decay rate in the environment. The BKC study noted that a more advanced  meteorological and dispersion model would be needed to quantify the  relative rankings of potential impacts for the sites.", "Scenarios also lacked large-scale outbreaks of longer duration. The FMD  virus outbreak scenarios in the BKC analyses were short, averaging 44 to  51 days, and relatively small in scale. However, the domestic impact could  be greater than loss from an export ban if a large number of animals were  infected over a large geographic area for a longer period. Analyses of  scenarios involving larger outbreaks, in addition to incorporating worst- case scenarios in the EIS, would have provided additional information on  the domestic impact of an FMD virus release and, thus, the relative  differences across the sites.", "The BKC analyses showed that an off-site impact of an aerosol release  would be highest for Kansas and lowest for Plum Island, but the analyses  were unable to distinguish between the impacts of the four other proposed  sites. Livestock density within the area affected the overall economic  impact for all scenarios in the BKC analyses, with Plum Island possessing  an advantage over the mainland sites because of the lack of livestock in  the vicinity. For example, for the aerosol release of FMD virus, the BKC  used two measures: the total number of susceptible animals and the  number of cattle facilities larger than 500 head. For the Kansas site, the  high impact stemmed from the high numbers and densities of susceptible  animals and the largest numbers of markets and large swine facilities  surrounding the site; in contrast, the low impact for Plum Island stemmed  from the small numbers and densities of animals surrounding the site.", "As shown in figure 4, for the average estimated economic impact of a  single random introduction of FMD virus in the counties surrounding the  proposed NBAF sites, indirect costs in the form of industry disruption  showed the greatest variance across sites, ranging from a little over $1  billion for the Kansas site to as little as $31 million for the Plum Island site.  The overall impact in the economic analyses included estimates of (1)  foreign trade lost during an export ban; (2) disruption to industry, or  indirect costs; and (3) costs to government, or direct costs. Plum Island  also had the least overall economic impact, at $2.8 billion, compared to the  mainland sites, with the Kansas site having the greatest overall impact, at  $4.2 billion.", "The analyses were also constrained by the lack of precise information on  the locations of animals in the counties surrounding the sites. As we have  reported, data limitations make it difficult for any computer modeling  effort to accurately predict the spread of disease. Modelers must  estimate the number and location of animals, as well as their interaction  with other segments of industry, because the United States does not have  a national mandatory system that identifies the location and tracks the  movement of livestock. Modelers currently use county-level agriculture  census data from USDA\u2019s National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS)  (conducted every 5 years), possibly reducing the accuracy of predictions  about FMD\u2019s spread if animal presence changes markedly. Without  knowing the exact location of livestock, it is difficult to understand its  interaction with wildlife.", "We have also reported that limited information on the number and  movement of wildlife and its susceptibility to the virus further complicates  matters. This is an important gap, since FMD is known to have spread  from livestock to wildlife in past outbreaks. The last time the United States  had an outbreak, in California in the 1920s, the virus spread from pigs to  cattle and black-tailed deer. It took 2 years and the slaughter of 22,000  deer to eradicate the disease from a local deer population in one national  park. Interaction may be possible with susceptible species, such as deer  and wild pigs, where livestock graze extensively.", "The BKC recognized that its May 2008 epidemiological and economic  analyses had significant limitations. Thus, several months before DHS  announced the site selection, according to LLNL officials, the BKC  recommended that DHS conduct additional analyses\u2014with a better  aerosol dispersion model, better input data (source term, livestock data),  and more scenarios. The BKC approached DHS in July 2008, proposing a  more comprehensive analysis, including (1) additional time to evaluate the  consequences of the accidental release scenarios, including those  identified in the EIS, to perform a more accurate risk assessment; (2)  better information such as source term and regional meteorological data  related to the scenarios; (3) information on the location and clustering of  susceptible animals in the vicinity of the sites; and (4) the use of a more  advanced aerosol dispersion model for quantitative modeling. According  to the BKC, consequence modeling for each site that was tailored to the  eight EIS scenarios would provide additional useful information but could  not be accomplished without an estimate of the likelihood that an actual  FMD virus release would lead to the infection of at least one animal at one  location\u2014which it stated would require an assessment by a qualified risk  analysis team.", "In May 2009, DHS stated that conducting such additional work would have  little value because of the limitations in the livestock data that we  previously noted. According to DHS, it held extensive discussions with the  BKC on the potential scope of additional FMD release analyses, including  evaluating the economic consequences of additional scenarios and  additional aerosol dispersion modeling. It determined that for this analysis  to have value, precise locations and numbers of livestock at the locations  for each of the six NBAF sites were needed. DHS stated that these data  were not available from the NASS and that data from local USDA field  offices were not sufficient to support further analysis. However, in July  2009, DHS also stated that it determined that the BKC analysis using the  2002 data from the NASS on a county-level basis was sufficient because  the agricultural statistics provided an accurate representation of the  agricultural information at each of the six sites.", "Finally, DHS\u2019s literature reviews included a hypothetical outbreak for the  United States as well as previous outbreaks in other countries; none were  related to the impact of an outbreak from any of the six sites. In the EIS,  DHS cited some independent studies of simulated or previous outbreaks in  other countries, including the 2001 Pirbright outbreak in the United  Kingdom, to provide estimates of the economic costs of possible U.S.  outbreaks. None of these studies were related to the EIS accident  analyses, the LLNL analyses, or the six sites.

The EIS showed that Plum Island\u2019s lack of animals  placed it at an advantage with respect to the likelihood that FMD virus  would become established after being released and spread from the site. In  contrast, all the other sites are in areas where the virus would have ample  opportunity to spread rapidly after release because of the presence of  susceptible livestock and wildlife. Further, the EIS showed that for all  sites except Plum Island, the wind could potentially transport viral  pathogens significant distances and that this pathway is not limited for  them, as it is on Plum Island.", "The threat and risk analyses also identified differences in risks across  sites, but DHS concluded that they would be mitigated by security  upgrades to facility design, operational protocols, and guidelines so that  the risks would be equal across sites.", "Because the different safety and security risks\u2014no matter how extreme\u2014 that the EIS and threat and risk assessment identified were all considered  mitigated, DHS selected a site by using its original evaluation criteria (see  table 6).

Our review of the EIS also found that it did not address  hazards associated with large animals\u2014a unique purpose of the NBAF.  Many of these risks, reported on in our testimony, were still not addressed  in the EIS. While the EIS identified the loss of animal control as one of the  seven accident scenarios involving an FMD virus release, it did not address  in detail the risks associated with the special containment of large animals.", "As we noted in our testimony, handling large animals within confined  spaces\u2014a full-size cow can weigh up to 1,430 pounds\u2014can present special  dangers for the scientists as well as the animal handlers. Moving carcasses  from the contained areas to necropsy or incineration areas poses  additional risks. For example, one of the internal releases of FMD virus at  the PIADC happened in transporting large animal carcasses from  contained rooms through to incineration.", "We also noted that transferring FMD work to an NBAF is to be  accompanied by increases in both scope and complexity over those of the  current activities at the PIADC. These increases would mean an increase  in the risk associated with work at the new facility. For example, the BSL- 3-Ag space at the new NBAF is projected to be almost twice the size of the  space currently at the PIADC and is to accommodate many more large  animals. According to PIADC officials and the EIS, requirements specify  NBAF space for 166 large cattle (up to 1,430 pounds) for both short-term  and long-term clinical trials with aerosolized FMD virus, as well as about  50 to 60 cattle for USDA\u2019s ongoing research. This is contrasted with the  more than 100 cattle that the PIADC can handle today.", "In addition, we noted an important difference between a standard BSL-3  laboratory, such as the laboratories used for work with human pathogens,  and a BSL-3-Ag laboratory. In BSL-3-Ag, the human operator has extensive  direct contact with infected animals and, consequently, the virus. Because  the virus can be carried in a person\u2019s lungs or nostrils or on other body  parts, humans become a potential avenue by which the virus could escape  the facility. Special biosafety procedures are needed\u2014for example, a full  shower on leaving the containment area, accompanied by expectorating to  clear the throat and blowing through the nose to clear the nasal passages.  Additionally, a 5-to-7-day quarantine is usually imposed on any person who  has been within a containment where FMD virus is present, a tacit  acknowledgment that humans can carry the disease out with them, even  after these additional procedures.", "DHS has cited an FMD laboratory in Winnipeg, Canada, to support its  assertion that FMD work can be done safely on the mainland. Canada has  decided to conduct FMD work on the mainland but in a downtown  location.  Susceptible animals are not likely to be in the immediate  neighborhood. Its scope of work for FMD is also smaller than that at the  PIADC or the proposed NBAF. In the Winnipeg laboratory, the number of  animals handled is very small (two large infected animals such as cows),  whereas in the proposed NBAF, DHS plans to accommodate 166 large  cattle. The FMD work in Winnipeg is done in a Canadian level (CL-3)  facility, which is equivalent to a BSL-3Ag facility in the United States. The  proposed U.S. facility would use many more animals than the Winnipeg  facility. Consequently, using the Winnipeg facility to support its assertion  regarding the U.S. mainland NBAF facility is not valid.

DHS\u2019s analyses did not effectively  characterize and differentiate the risks associated with the release of FMD  virus at the six sites. From its Gaussian plume modeling results, DHS  concluded that the mainland and Plum Island would differ little in air  concentrations from an FMD virus release. However, the simple straight- line Gaussian plume model DHS used for its accident analyses was based  on unrepresentative accident scenarios, outdated dispersion modeling  techniques, and inadequate meteorological data, and therefore it was not  appropriate for determining the extent of dispersion of an FMD virus  release. Drawing conclusions about relocating research with highly  infectious exotic animal pathogens from questionable methodology could  result in regrettable consequences. Site-specific dispersion analysis, using  proven models with appropriate meteorological data and defensible  source terms, should be conducted before scientifically defensible  conclusions can be drawn.", "The economic analyses did not incorporate market response to an FMD  outbreak\u2014which would be related to the number of livestock in the site\u2019s  vicinity. They also did not consider the effect of establishing a  containment zone to control the effects of a national export ban on the  domestic livestock industry\u2014which could have been used to differentiate  across NBAF sites.

We agree  that the value of modern containment technology has reduced the risk of  an accidental release and that the safety of HCLs has improved. However,  evidence shows that accidents continue from human error and from  operational failure in facilities. Thus, as DHS has acknowledged, the risk  of release of an agent from a modern HCL is not zero, and Plum Island  offers a unique advantage\u2014with its water barrier and absence of  animals\u2014over the mainland. If foreign infectious viruses are introduced  into the United States, research on these viruses must be done with the  utmost care and planning. For these reasons, work of this nature should  be conducted only where adequate analyses have shown that the  consequences of an accidental release are absolutely minimized.", "Given the significant limitations in DHS\u2019s analyses that we found, the  conclusion that FMD work can be done as safely on the mainland as on  Plum Island is not supported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained written comments on a draft of our report from the  Department of Homeland Security, whose key concerns we discuss here.  The agency\u2019s letter is printed in appendix II.", "First, DHS noted that while we cited limitations of the DHS risk  assessment methodology, we provided no analysis that would indicate that  a different methodology would yield different results. Although the  congressional mandate did not require GAO to conduct an alternative  analysis, we went beyond the mandate to identify an alternative plume  model (RIMPUFF) that has been validated for FMD virus, as well as more  appropriate source term and meteorological data that should have been  used. We believe that using this validated model and appropriate source  term and meteorological data\u2014and performing additional epidemiologic  and economic analyses that included worst-case scenarios, market  analyses, and the use of containment zones\u2014would have provided more  comprehensive information for both decision makers and the public  regarding the sites\u2019 relative differences in risks when conducting FMD  research.", "Second, DHS stated that the draft report was unresponsive to the direction  of the Congress because we chose to evaluate whether FMD research can  be done as safely on the mainland as on Plum Island. In reality, we both  satisfied the mandate through our analysis of the EIS and provided  additional analysis as we agreed to with congressional requestors. This is  consistent with the way we work with the Congress in scoping all our  work. Because the PIADC has a long history of FMD work, it was agreed  that we would address the relative safety of the island and mainland sites  to put the safety issue in perspective.", "Third, although DHS noted that it had stated in the NBAF EIS that the water  barrier around Plum Island provides an additional layer of protection in the  extremely unlikely event that pathogens  proposed for study at the NBAF were  accidentally released, DHS determined that the Plum Island site did not best  meet the purpose and need to locate, construct, and operate the NBAF, based  on the research; workforce; acquisition, construction, and facility operations;  and community acceptance evaluation criteria that a team of federal employees  (DHS and USDA subject matter experts) had developed. We agree with DHS  that Plum Island can provide an additional margin of safety compared to  mainland sites; however, in the DHS decision, this extra safety factor was  outweighed by nonsafety factors, such as community acceptance. DHS believes  that it can mitigate the risks of accidental or intentional releases from any of the  sites.", "Fourth and finally, DHS stated that DHS and USDA have determined that  live FMD virus research can be safely studied on the mainland because  modern biocontainment technology has made the likelihood of an  accidental release of a pathogen extremely small. DHS noted that modern  biocontainment technology has eliminated the need for locating animal- disease research on an island, as was considered necessary decades ago.  DHS stated that we should not dismiss the fact that live FMD virus  research is already being performed on the mainland in other countries,  since this clearly demonstrates that such work can be conducted safely on  the mainland (with appropriate biosafety and biosecurity protocols to  minimize the risk of release). While we agree, and while we stated in our  report that modern technology has made the risk of an accidental release  of a pathogen extremely low, the risk is not zero. Accidents continue,  primarily from human error. The fact that live FMD work in countries such  as Australia and New Zealand is done mostly offshore emphasizes that  even a low risk may be considered too great where agriculture is  economically important. The challenges of maintaining a high-containment  environment in the case of FMD research are particularly difficult, given  the large number of research animals planned for the NBAF. The NBAF  EIS did not directly address those challenges. Thus, the issue is: What level  of risk is acceptable? The question is especially important when, as in this  case, an alternative is available that offers a lower level of risk than the  one that has been chosen.", "Overall, once a certain low level of risk has been identified as being  acceptable for the conceptual NBAF facility, DHS appears to rank other,  nonsafety factors more highly than the further risk reduction the island  site could provide. Because safety is always a relative concept, this  prioritization of other issues over further safety is a matter of judgment  that should, for clarity, be explicitly stated and justified.", "DHS and USDA also provided technical comments on and corrections to  the draft report.

DHS also stated that there is sufficient literature to justify the  use of the MACCS2 model (originally developed to model the dispersion of  radiological aerosols) for biological aerosol. DHS stated that several  features of Gaussian plume models make them desirable for risk  assessment. They provide, according to DHS, the ability to use yearly  averaged meteorological datasets to determine the probability that areas  away from the release site will be affected by the plume.", "In fact, we did present positive comments, as appropriate. However, it is  important to note that DHS experts raised serious caveats about the use of  the MACCS2 model for FMD that are not outweighed by the positive  comments. Other experts besides DHS\u2019s experts have raised the same  concerns about the appropriateness of using MACCS2 for biological  dispersion and safety analysis. DHS dismissed these caveats, asserting that  they would not dramatically change its conclusions, but DHS offered no  evidence to prove its assertion.", "Modeling biological dispersion of dangerous pathogens is a complex  process. Using an unvalidated model for this task was inappropriate. The  MACCS2 model has a \u201cTable of Limitations\u201d listed in a U.S. Department of  Energy report (MACCS2 Computer Code Application Guidance for  Documented Safety Analysis, final report (Washington, D.C.: June 2004)).  Limitations include a release duration of 3 minutes to 10 hours, which is  inappropriate for a puff release; sensible energy issues that would affect  modeling when heat or other energetics are involved; and terrain  sensitivity and building wake effects that DHS addressed. The MACCS2  model also uses Pasquill stability classifications that are outdated and not  used in modern, more appropriate models. Moreover, by limiting the  dispersion to 10 km, the MACCS2 model fails to address more real-life  scenarios and worst-case scenarios that have been found important in  FMD virus dispersion.", "Much better, validated, models are available and should have been used.  We believe that if DHS is going to analyze something as important as the  downwind dispersion of FMD virus after a release, it should use the best  science and validated models available. We emphasized the use of a model  that has been validated for FMD virus\u2014such as the RIMPUFF model\u2014as  well as the use of more appropriate source term and meteorological data.  Some models like the HPAC and RIMPUFF apply modern theory for  diffusion and turbulence factors and have been applied and validated for  the airborne spread of biologicals and, specifically, FMD. RIMPUFF,  available to all users, has been shown to provide more sophisticated and  accurate data than other simulation models. RIMPUFF is linked to a  geographic information system, so site-specific meteorological data can be  generated and integrated with geographic and demographic data for  display in a format that can be easily assimilated and transmitted  electronically.", "DHS also asserted that our observation that Gaussian plume models do  not provide suitable information for modeling the effects of a specific  release is irrelevant. DHS stated that it used the Gaussian plume model as  a dispersion model to compare the six sites (thus, the relative magnitude  of downwind normalized concentration is of primary importance, not the  absolute value). We believe our statement is relevant, especially since  DHS\u2019s independent subject matter experts made the same observations.  Modeling the effects of a specific release is critical. Limiting the  comparison of the six sites by the relative magnitude of downwind  normalized concentration does not provide the true effects of a release.  Measuring the effects of a specific release is important when attempting to  obtain site-specific relative information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Meterological and Source Term Data", "paragraphs": ["DHS stated that our observation on its use of meteorological data is  inaccurate. We stated that DHS\u2019s using hourly averaged meteorological  data in the MACCS2 model, rather than wind rose meteorological data,  gave long-term averages for wind direction but cannot account for  variations in velocity. Therefore, the data were not representative of the  prevailing wind directions at the sites and did not account for the season  or time of day. DHS stated that the MACCS2 meteorological input files  contain weather data at hourly intervals for the whole year. The data take  into account the season and the time of day, the MACCS2 uses wind  direction at each hourly interval as input, and thus a typical MACCS2  dataset represents the full spectrum of wind directions over an entire year.  DHS stated that although the NBAF EIS did not provide explicit data on  the wind rose, the data from which a wind rose can be constructed are in  the MACCS2 input data set.", "As we stated in our report, the wind rose data are a graphic representation  of the direction and velocity of the wind and a very important tool in  determining wind direction and, therefore, the potential dispersion of FMD  virus. Although the MACCS could provide wind direction at each hourly  interval as input, DHS did not in its modeling produce a wind rose to  determine the predominant direction and velocity of the wind. Wind rose  diagrams are straightforward to interpret. The graphic shows the primary  direction the wind travels and the relative amount of time the wind travels  from that direction. Wind rose diagrams should be applied in dispersion  modeling because they illustrate the magnitude and direction of the  predominant wind at a particular location. In addition, hourly averaged  data do not describe what dispersion would look like in a worst-case  scenario, because all meteorological conditions for longer-range transport  are averaged.", "DHS also stated that we provided no evidence that the value DHS used for  the aerosol release factor was an underestimation. We stated that if a  sample of 100 ml of 1 x 10 virus could potentially be aerosolized.  We believe from our discussions with FMD experts that this value is too  low, indicating that 1 x 10-4 may be an underestimation. DHS noted that it  stated in the EIS that a spill of 1 kilogram of a liquid containing virions,  with a viscosity of water (0.01 poise), from a height of 1 meter would  result in an aerosol release factor (ARF) of approximately 8 x 10\u20136, which  is more than an order of magnitude lower than the 1 x 10\u20134 ARF value used  for spill accidents for the NBAF. DHS therefore believed that the EIS has  appropriately characterized the source term. However, we believe that the  scientific experimental data that would support the source term values  cited in the EIS are lacking. DHS used the data relating to the dispersal of  a powder\u2014containing Bacillus anthracis\u2014used in the 2001 anthrax  attack. The energy requirements for dispersing a powder differ in a major  way from the requirements for dispersing from a bulk liquid. According to  Danish FMD experts, in the concentration of FMD virus they produce in  their laboratory, they routinely get 10 during  their fermentation and production phases. During the centrifuging phase,  the concentration level often goes higher. Therefore, if you start with a  higher concentration of viruses in a vial and there is an accidental spill,  then the source term will be that much higher."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimates of Economic Impact on an FMD Outbreak", "paragraphs": ["DHS stated that the EIS analyses used actual events and existing studies to  evaluate the economic effects of a potential FMD outbreak and that it is  likely that the direct, localized effects of an outbreak would not be limited  by the 10 km dispersion field determined by the plume modeling.

Because USDA\u2019s NASS  does not release farm locations within a county, the precision of data  needed to use the plume modeling dispersion field for a localized  economic evaluation was not available. However, DHS said that the BKC  analysis using the 2002 NASS data on a county-level basis was sufficient,  because the agricultural statistics accurately represented the agricultural  information at each of the six sites. The NBAF EIS table D.2-l shows direct  economic costs less than 4 percent of the total economic costs of a  potential FMD virus release for all sites. However, DHS did not directly  address our point concerning the need for additional economic analyses  involving market response and containment zones; instead, it stated that  the EIS analyses would not include a market analysis and the  establishment of containment zones to lessen the impact of an export ban  for all six sites. DHS stated that OIE\u2019s determination regarding a country\u2019s  FMD status is based on how the country\u2019s authorities respond to the  incursion rather than to where the outbreak occurs. DHS also stated that  its literature review\u2014intended to identify upper and lower bounds of  potential economic losses and not to develop detailed estimates for  specific sites\u2014had included one study that demonstrated the local impact  of an FMD outbreak in southwestern Kansas.", "We believe that the use of worst-case scenarios and available, if limited,  livestock data for additional epidemiologic and economic analyses\u2014 including outbreaks of longer durations\u2014would further differentiate the  sites, including showing unique differences between the mainland sites  and Plum Island. Because the United States has not had an FMD outbreak  since 1929, much is uncertain about the potential consequences of a  release. For example, it is not clear in which species, or how, wildlife can  spread and act as a reservoir for the virus, despite the perceived low risk  of its occurring. In addition, each site has its own level of susceptible  livestock and wildlife in the vicinity, but DHS did not model the spread of  FMD after an initial infection. As we stated in the report, studies have  shown that the virus can travel distances far greater than 10 km from a  release. Furthermore, while an export ban in the event of a confirmed  FMD infection would result in an immediate foreign ban on the export of  animal products, the consequences of that ban\u2014from both a foreign and a  domestic standpoint\u2014would be affected by the ease of establishing a  containment zone, as well as by the market response to the outbreak.  Thus, we believe it imperative that decision makers be provided with  analyses sufficiently detailed to show the relative differences in risk  among sites\u2014regardless of the confidence in HCLs to reduce those risks\u2014 before a site decision is made. Lacking these additional epidemiologic and  economic analyses, we think DHS\u2019s efforts to evaluate the economic  impact of an FMD outbreak did not provide sufficient information on the  relative differences in risks across sites, particularly with respect to  potential consequences.", "Finally, DHS appears to have misunderstood our meaning of the term  integration, discussing its overall risk assessment methodology and  conclusions rather than addressing DHS\u2019s lack of integration of the  accident analyses in the EIS with the BKC epidemiologic and economic  analyses\u2014our main point. While DHS developed a set of accidental FMD  virus release scenarios that it considered to represent those likely to have  the greatest impact, and used plume modeling to determine the dispersion  of FMD virus releases under those scenarios, it did not conduct  epidemiologic analyses with the same scenarios and assumptions to  predict the potential economic impact for each site; had DHS done so, it  would have produced a more comprehensive picture of the relative  differences in impacts of an FMD virus release across sites and, also, a  better comparison of the mainland sites to Plum Island."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Issues of Containment for Large Animals Infected with FMD", "paragraphs": ["DHS stated that live FMD virus research is already being performed on the  mainland in other countries and that five BSL-4 facilities currently operate  in the United States in populated areas. DHS noted that no public  exposure has ever resulted from research at a BSL-4 laboratory in the  United States. DHS asserted that modern biocontainment technology has  eliminated the need for locating animal-disease research on an island, as  was done decades ago. DHS also stated that state-of-the-art operating  procedures and biocontainment features minimize the potential for  laboratory-acquired infections and accidental releases. In addition, DHS  stated that the hazards of working with large livestock are not site- specific. It has been shown, and is demonstrated daily, that at the PIADC,  with proper training, scientists and animal handlers work safely with large  animals.", "DHS is not addressing our main point about the significant increase in  potential risks because of the larger scale of work with infected animals in  BSL-3 Ag facilities than that conducted in BSL-4 facilities. The BSL-4  laboratory work that DHS refers to is work with human pathogens. Our  comments relate to safety issues concerning work with FMD under BSL -3  Ag, where the containment level is lower than in BSL-4 and human  operators can have direct contact with infected animals.", "The more direct contact between FMD-infected animals and humans is  possible because FMD virus is not a human pathogen. In BSL-3 Ag  laboratories, direct contact is also more extensive between human  operators\u2014a potential avenue for escape of the virus\u2014and FMD-infected  animals. In addition, the amount of virus animals excrete will be  significantly higher in BSL-3 Ag laboratories because the animals are  larger; thus, the potential for exposure is greater. While it is true that with  proper training, scientists and animal handlers could work safely with  large animals, DHS\u2019s comments do not address the issues we raised about  the lack of analyses in the EIS concerning the risks associated with the  containment of large animals infected with FMD.", "We recognize that the PIADC\u2019s working practices have been shown to be  generally effective in preventing the release of virus. Our point here,  however, is that although the hazards of handling large livestock may not  be site-specific, the potential consequences are\u2014in the event of a release  of the virus. We believe the importance of the island location cannot be  evaluated as a separate factor, since the United States has had no  comparable mainland site. Comparison with the Pirbright facility in the  United Kingdom, where FMD outbreaks occurred from an accidental  release of FMD virus, emphasizes the safety value of the island location.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland Security  and the Secretary of Agriculture.
