Five federal agencies are piloting GEAR--the Departments of Energy (DOE), Homeland Security/Coast Guard (DHS/Coast Guard), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Veterans Affairs/National Cemetery Administration (VA/NCA), and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM)--with the intention to expand GEAR government-wide. The Chief Human Capital Officers Council (CHCO Council) is developing a toolkit based, among other things, on the experience of the pilot agencies. The toolkit is intended to help additional agencies implement the GEAR framework; CHCO Council representatives expect the toolkit to be complete by the end of September 2013. However, beyond the toolkit, neither the CHCO Council nor OPM have identified next steps to implement GEAR government-wide, such as identifying roles and responsibilities. Further, neither OPM nor the CHCO Council has plans to regularly update the GEAR framework or toolkit to include additional lessons learned, or to make such information available more broadly to key stakeholders, such as human resource professionals who may be responsible for future implementation. Without taking these steps, agencies that have already begun implementing GEAR risk losing their momentum; in addition, it may be challenging to implement GEAR government-wide.", "The five pilot agencies adopted various approaches to implementing GEAR -DOE, HUD, and OPM implemented GEAR agency-wide, while Coast Guard and NCA adopted GEAR in single units - based on agency needs, available resources, and GAO's lessons learned to date. For example, early stakeholder involvement, including engagement between those representing labor and management, resulted in greater transparency and fewer obstacles. In addition, administering employee surveys to identify the greatest needs before implementing GEAR helped establish a baseline to better track results.", "Each of the pilot agencies developed a GEAR project plan that outlined specific actions. DOE's GEAR plan was the most thoroughly documented. The other four agency plans did not include all project planning best practices. Without these elements, agencies may be limited in their ability to determine what needs to be done, when it should be done, who should do it, and how to measure progress towards achieving objectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["As GEAR is adopted government-wide, GAO recommends that the Director of OPM, in collaboration with the CHCO Council, define roles and responsibilities for OPM, the CHCO Council, and individual agencies, in such areas as updating the toolkit (as needed) and disseminating information on GEAR more broadly.

We concluded that effective performance  management systems that link individual performance to organizational  results will be key to mission success in this difficult environment. In  2011, representatives of various federal agencies, labor unions, and  management organizations were brought together by the National Council  on Federal Labor-Management Relations (LMR Council), in conjunction  with the Chief Human Capital Officers Council (CHCO Council), to identify  ways to reform and improve employee performance management in the  federal government. The resulting effort, the Goals-Engagement- Accountability-Results (GEAR) framework, is a set of five high-level  recommendations intended to create high-performing organizations that  are aligned, accountable, and focused on results. Five federal agencies  are piloting GEAR, either agency-wide or in single units: the Department  of Energy (DOE), the Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD), the Department of Homeland Security/United States Coast Guard  (DHS/Coast Guard), the Department of Veterans Affairs/National  Cemetery Administration (VA/NCA), and the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM).", "You asked us to evaluate the GEAR framework.

In addition, we interviewed OPM officials and CHCO   We verified that the key practices were applicable for  Council officials who were members of the LMR Council work group that  drafted the report.", "To address our second objective, we obtained and analyzed each  agency\u2019s GEAR implementation plan(s) and obtained and analyzed  updates from the agencies and other documentation that identified their  current GEAR implementation status. We developed an interview  instrument to discuss agency strategies with human resource/human  capital officials, program managers, and other officials responsible for  GEAR implementation. We also interviewed labor union representatives  about any problems or concerns with implementing the GEAR framework.  In addition, in May 2013 we visited Coast Guard Base Boston, where we  observed initial GEAR training sessions and interviewed supervisors and  employees about their reactions to the training and the GEAR framework.  We chose this site because the Coast Guard was the most recent of the  five pilot agencies to implement GEAR and we were able to visit soon  after the start of their implementation efforts.", "To address our third objective, we identified project planning best  practices (drawn primarily from Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, GAO\u2019s definitions of performance measurement,  and GAO\u2019s guide for best practices in project schedules) and assessed  the inclusion of information contained in the agencies\u2019 GEAR plans  against the best practices. We focused on the inclusion of the following  best practices because they were relevant to GEAR: (1) plan objective(s)  describing a goal; (2) specific actions needed to attain that goal; (3) roles  and responsibilities identified and assigned to project stakeholders; (4)  schedules containing logically related project elements leading to the  goal; and (5) valid performance measures that permit comparison  between desired outcomes and actual results. We assessed each  agency\u2019s GEAR plan to determine the extent to which the information that  was included met each of the five best practices.

According to OPM regulations, performance management is the  systematic process by which an agency involves its employees, as  individuals and members of a group, in improving organizational  effectiveness in the accomplishment of agency mission and goals.  Performance management includes such actions as  setting expectations, continually monitoring performance, developing the  capacity to perform, periodically rating performance in a summary  fashion, and rewarding good performance.", "In December 2009, the LMR Council was created to establish a  cooperative and productive form of executive branch labor-management  relations in an effort to improve the productivity and effectiveness of the  federal government. The LMR Council is co-chaired by the Director of  the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the Deputy Director for  Management of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) with  members representing executive branch departments and agencies,  several labor unions, and other management associations. The LMR  Council serves as an advisor to the President on matters involving  executive branch labor-management relations; it also promotes  partnership efforts between labor and management within the executive  branch. For example, the order states that management should discuss  workplace challenges and problems with labor and endeavor to develop  solutions jointly, rather than advise union representatives of  predetermined solutions to problems and then engage in bargaining over  the impact and implementation of the predetermined solutions.", "In April 2011, the LMR Council, in conjunction with the CHCO Council, set  out to examine the federal government\u2019s performance management  accountability framework and to make recommendations for  improvement. The CHCO Council supports OPM in the strategic  management of human capital at federal agencies and provides a forum  for senior management officials to exchange human resources best  practices. By May 2011, a work group was formed (with members  representing various federal agencies, labor unions, and management  organizations from both the LMR and CHCO Councils) to discuss ways to  examine the existing system of employee performance management in  ways that the work group felt were different from previous attempts that  focused on actions such as increasing employee accountability through  changes to regulations.", "The work group developed the GEAR report, issued in 2011, which  identified challenges with the federal performance management system,  such as a lack of evidence that the mechanical aspects of public and private  sector performance management systems, such as rating levels and  awards, do a good job of improving employee and organizational  performance; and a disconnect among the various functions responsible for  organizational performance improvement and employee performance  improvement. For example, there were few formally structured  opportunities for the individuals responsible for these functions to  interact and communicate.", "As a result of identifying these challenges, according to the GEAR report,  the work group agreed to  focus on the relational elements of organizational and employee  performance management, such as how to set clear expectations in  work plans through frequent formal and informal feedback between  supervisors and employees; and engage employees and agency managers, through their labor unions  and CHCOs, and identify successful practices that have improved the  selection and training of supervisors and the engagement between  employees and supervisors such as two-way communication and  continual informal feedback.", "The work group constructed the GEAR framework, as presented in the  GEAR report, with the following recommendations:  1.  Articulate a high performance culture.  2.  Align employee and organizational performance management.  3.  Implement accountability at all levels.  4.  Create a culture of engagement.  5.  Improve supervisor assessment, selection, development, and   training.", "OPM officials told us that the practices in the GEAR report are well known  and credible but not universally applied in federal agencies. According  to an OPM senior official, the GEAR recommendations are \u201ccommon  sense but not common practice.\u201d The same official noted that the GEAR  recommendations align with current regulations addressing federal  performance management, but that GEAR adds specific strategic and   Agency officials said  technical guidance and communication strategies.that combining the recommendations into one framework can aid officials  in maintaining focus and attention on improving performance  management in the context of competing priorities.", "The GEAR recommendations and framework were presented to and  accepted by the LMR Council in November 2011. By December 2011,  five agencies had volunteered to implement the GEAR framework. Of  these, three agencies \u2013 DOE, HUD, and OPM \u2013 implemented GEAR  agency-wide with few exceptions. Two agencies \u2013 Coast Guard and NCA  \u2013 implemented GEAR in single units. The agencies all created GEAR  implementation plans and periodically met as a group to discuss  strategies and challenges, and to share successes and additional training  opportunities throughout implementation. The pilot agencies also  periodically reported their progress to both the LMR and CHCO Councils.  No additional agencies have volunteered to pilot GEAR. However, in  Analytical Perspectives: Performance and Management section in the  President\u2019s Budget for Fiscal Year 2014, there is a stated goal of broader  application of the GEAR framework across the federal government, with  no stated timeframe for completion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The GEAR Framework Generally Addresses Key Performance Management Practices; Refinements Could Improve Future Government-wide Implementation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The GEAR Framework Generally Addresses Key Performance Management Practices", "paragraphs": ["We have previously identified a set of key practices for modern, effective  performance management, which appear with summary descriptions in  table 1. Our current review found that the GEAR framework generally  addressed seven of these key practices, but it does not give clear  attention to two other practices.", "As shown in table 1, two practices\u2014connecting performance expectations  to crosscutting goals, and linking pay to organizational performance\u2014do  not receive clear attention in the GEAR framework. LMR work group  members who helped to draft the GEAR report told us they did not  specifically discuss agency crosscutting goals during the drafting and  instead, focused on aligning employee and organizational performance  management. However, they also told us that GEAR does not deter  agencies from connecting performance expectations to crosscutting  goals, and that they felt that crosscutting goals would be subsumed under  individual and agency performance goals, as appropriate. OPM officials  agreed that connecting performance expectations to crosscutting goals is  essential to improving performance across the federal government.", "In addition, these same LMR work group members said that they  excluded linking pay to performance because Congress authorizes pay.  Congress is responsible for authorizing pay-for-performance plans, and  tools to reward good performance with pay are increasingly limited in the  federal government. They said that the GEAR report suggests  appropriate action for both good and poor performance and that use of  pay-for-performance could be understood as such an action.", "According to the GEAR report, effective, and productive relationships  between managers and employees are necessary for performance  improvements. The greater an employee\u2019s level of engagement, the more  likely he or she is to go beyond the minimum required. GEAR emphasizes  promoting employee-supervisor engagement through continual informal  feedback and frequent (up to four times per year) formal feedback.  Beyond the establishment of competencies and aligned goals, GEAR  recommends frequent interaction and accountability\u2014both for supervisors  and employees\u2014based on measurable goals.", "The GEAR report also recommends that agencies improve the  assessment, selection, development, and training of supervisors,  emphasizing that agencies should select and assess supervisors based  on supervisory and leadership proficiencies, rather than technical  competencies, and should hold them accountable for performance of  supervisory responsibilities. In addition, GEAR emphasizes the need to  hold supervisors accountable for providing feedback, documenting  performance discussions, and holding poorly-performing employees  accountable. According to the GEAR report, focusing on accountability of  managers and supervisors helps to ensure continual, effective  communication and to make performance management a daily feature of  work. Senior officials at three of the pilot agencies reported that  supervisors sometimes say there is not enough time for supervisory  responsibilities. For example, officials at DOE and HUD said that  supervisors sometimes see their supervisory responsibilities as  secondary to programmatic responsibilities and may not allocate sufficient  time to set clear expectations or provide frequent feedback to employees.", "As part of improving supervision, GEAR recommends greater integration  between the agency units dealing with organizational performance and  those dealing with individual employee performance. Specifically, GEAR  proposes greater integration between the CHCO and Performance  Improvement Officer (PIO) functions to improve overall program  execution, either through creation of a Performance Management  Integration Board or through continuous communication so that the  functions work in tandem. Similarly, GEAR emphasizes long-term  integration of performance management into agency functions. For  example, it recommends mentoring to ensure general organizational  continuity, continual planning and assessment to ensure continued focus  on personnel management and high performance, and targeted training  and development programs to ensure agencies will have qualified  supervisors and be able to fill other critical occupations. We have  previously concluded that integrating human capital planning with broader  organizational strategic planning is essential for ensuring that agencies  have the talent and skill mix needed to cost-effectively execute their  mission and program goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM and CHCO Council Have Not Fully Defined their Roles for Implementing GEAR Government-wide", "paragraphs": ["While OPM and the CHCO Council have been supportive of the pilot  effort to date, neither entity has identified their specific respective roles or  responsibilities for achieving the current administration\u2019s goal of  implementing GEAR more broadly across the federal government going  forward. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities will be important for  maintaining the momentum of the pilot, sharing the pilot effort\u2019s lessons  learned, and encouraging additional agencies to implement the GEAR  framework.", "OPM has taken several steps to help the pilot agencies implement GEAR.  For example, OPM officials have facilitated conversations among the pilot  agencies to share information and lessons learned, and have made web- based training on performance management available to federal agencies  at no cost. According to OPM officials, OPM, as co-chair of the CHCO  Council, will provide leadership and direction for the government-wide  implementation of GEAR, but the future of GEAR will be determined by  the CHCO Council as a whole and not by OPM alone. They noted that the  GEAR framework is intended to be flexible and thus did not want to  mandate how agencies should implement it.", "CHCO Council officials agreed that the framework provides flexibility to the  agencies; however, the same CHCO officials also cited the need for some  standardization of GEAR metrics to ensure accountability among agencies.  As noted, in Analytical Perspectives: Performance and Management of the  President\u2019s Budget for Fiscal Year 2014, \u201cthe CHCO Council is currently  reviewing the progress of GEAR and lessons learned in these agencies  and identifying other leading practices across the Federal sector and  private sector with the goal of broader application of the GEAR framework  across the Federal Government.\u201d", "For its part, the CHCO Council is reviewing the pilot agencies\u2019  implementation of GEAR with an eye toward identifying promising  practices. Specifically, CHCO Council officials told us that an internal  work group is identifying promising practices and metrics that, when  combined, may provide additional guidance in the form of a diagnostic  toolkit to assist agencies in implementing the GEAR framework.  According to CHCO Council work group members, a toolkit is needed  because the GEAR recommendations were high-level in nature, and the  report itself did not include practical guidance. For example, an agency  may want to implement GEAR\u2019s recommendation to create a culture of  engagement, but the GEAR report provided limited guidance on how to  do so.", "According to a CHCO Council work group member, the diagnostic toolkit  will enable agencies to identify their level of \u201cmaturity\u201d on a scale by  analyzing the results of the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS),  the Human Capital Framework (HCF), the non-SES Performance  Appraisal Assessment Tool (PAAT), and the SES certification process.  Federal agencies can use these tools to measure whether, and to what  extent, conditions characterizing successful organizations are present in  federal agencies (FEVS); to assist officials in achieving results in  personnel management programs (HCF); and to assess agencies\u2019  performance appraisal systems and develop plans and strategies for  making improvements (non-SES PAAT and SES certification process).", "From this, agencies can use the results to identify a range of promising  practices that the agency may choose from, based on identified resources  and needs. According to the same CHCO Council work group members,  these promising practices align with the five GEAR recommendations and  reflect a range of initiatives (compiled from both public and private sector  efforts, as well as pilot agencies\u2019 experiences), that provide options for  agencies based on their specific needs. The CHCO Council\u2019s subgroups  plan to complete the diagnostic toolkit by August 2013 and to present the  final product to the CHCO Council by the end of September 2013.  However, beyond its completion in September 2013, the CHCO Council  has no stated plans to update the toolkit, such as collecting lessons  learned on an ongoing basis from the pilot agencies, or including  additional promising practices as needed. Without gathering information  from the pilot agencies as they continue their implementation process,  valuable information that could help agencies implement GEAR in the  future may be lost.", "While the toolkit shows promise for refining the future implementation of  GEAR, its utility in this regard could be limited because neither the CHCO  Council nor OPM have stated plans to broadly disseminate it. CHCO  Council officials told us that the completed diagnostic toolkit will be  presented to the entire CHCO Council but there is no plan to share that  information on a broader basis, which would be consistent with the  Administration\u2019s goal to more broadly implement GEAR government-wide.  CHCO Council officials stated that it was OPM\u2019s responsibility to  determine the future of the diagnostic toolkit. One vehicle for  disseminating the toolkit\u2019s information more broadly could be the OMB  Max Federal Community Website where OPM officials have already  posted informational material on GEAR and where pilot agencies can add  their own information and experiences. Without making such information  more widely available, front-line managers, supervisors, representatives  of labor unions, and other federal human capital stakeholders may not  have access to information that could improve employee engagement.", "Moving forward, it will be important for both OPM and the CHCO Council  to agree upon their specific roles and responsibilities if the goal of broader  application of the GEAR framework government-wide is to be realized.  Once specific roles and responsibilities have been established going  forward, plans may be made to update the GEAR framework and  diagnostic toolkit as needed and to broadly disseminate the information  so that stakeholders government-wide who are already implementing  GEAR (or may implement in the future) will have access to the most  recent guidance available."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Pilot Agencies Adopted Various Approaches to Implementing GEAR; Opportunities Exist to Capture Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pilot Agencies Adopted Various Approaches to Implementing GEAR", "paragraphs": ["The five pilot agencies adopted various approaches to implementing all  five of the GEAR recommendations based on their needs and available  resources.

Thus, three of the five agencies \u2013 DOE, HUD, and OPM \u2013 implemented  GEAR agency-wide, while two agencies \u2013 Coast Guard and NCA\u2013  established pilots in single units. DOE, HUD, and OPM officials all said  that the project had the best chance of changing the organizational  culture if they implemented it agency-wide. For example, HUD officials  said they felt that implementing GEAR agency-wide would permit it to be  better embedded in the performance culture. An OPM official said that  GEAR focused attention on previously identified human capital needs,  such as supervisor assessment, that had not been addressed due to  limited resources and competing priorities.", "VA is implementing GEAR within its NCA agency as a single unit pilot in  its Memorial Service Network (MSN) II in the southeastern region of the  country. According to VA officials, VA chose the NCA because it has a  reputation as a high-performing organization and an existing focus on  metrics and feedback. NCA officials said they chose to implement GEAR  as a single unit, rather than agency-wide, because doing so allowed them  to provide closer attention and support. The Coast Guard is implementing  GEAR at Base Boston, which, according to officials, was chosen as the  pilot site for several reasons: the presence of both general schedule (GS)  and wage grade (WG) employees (who happen to be supervised by both  military and civilian personnel) a wide variety of occupations, and the  representation of a single union \u2013 the American Federation of  Government Employees (AFGE) \u2013 rather than the multiple unions that are  present at other Coast Guard bases. Coast Guard officials said they  chose to pilot GEAR at a single unit because implementation brought  challenges such as dealing with such a large military population  (approximately 42,000 military personnel that rotate bases approximately  every two to three years and operate on a different performance  management plan compared with approximately 9,000 civilian  employees) and negotiating with approximately nine unions. According to  one Coast Guard official, to develop more than one site would create a  capacity issue that would make it very difficult to plan and implement.", "Table 2 shows how many employees will be covered by GEAR at each  agency, as well as each agency\u2019s time frame for implementation.  Additional information on the actions taken by each agency is included in  appendices V-IX.", "Each of the agencies said they had engaged labor unions during GEAR  implementation.

In contrast, NCA officials said that  the two unions that cover their employees, AFGE and the National  Association of Government Employees, have been involved in GEAR  implementation and made contributions to NCA\u2019s approach to GEAR.  Coast Guard officials said the agency met with union representatives for  several extensive discussions involving facilitators and brain-storming  sessions, in order to include union input in the final GEAR implementation  plan. As a result of these discussions, Coast Guard officials told us that  the agency has the approval of the union and that both parties are  mutually responsible for the successful implementation of GEAR.

Project planning is the basis for controlling and managing project  performance, including managing the relationship between cost and  time. As we have previously concluded, preparing a project plan  encourages agency managers and stakeholders to systematically  consider what is to be done, when and how it will be done, what skills will  be needed, and how to gauge progress and results. Agency approaches  to such planning can vary with each agency\u2019s particular needs and  mission. Nevertheless, existing best practices stress the importance of  accountability and sound planning for any project. Inherent in such  planning is the development and use of a project management plan that  describes, among other factors, the project\u2019s objectives, implementation  actions, lines of responsibility, estimated schedule for development and  implementation, and performance measures. Having accurate and  transparent project cost and schedule information is also essential to  effective oversight.", "Each of the pilot agencies developed a GEAR project plan that outlined  specific actions.

For example, DOE\u2019s GEAR project  plan was the most thoroughly documented of the five plans we assessed  and included project planning best practices for all five elements we  assessed. The other four agency plans did not include all project planning  best practices. Not including such best practices could limit their  effectiveness in further implementing the GEAR framework.

Since the volunteer pilot  agencies are in the process of implementing GEAR, we assessed them  on the contents of the plan and not against the progress made towards  implementation of the plan.

According to the plan, the Coast Guard selected its pilot location  at Base Boston, with both military and civilian personnel, as a result of  discussions between management and labor unions. The plan clearly  states that a primary project manager in the Coast Guard\u2019s human  resources office and a project manager at Base Boston are in charge of  GEAR implementation.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s plan has a high-level schedule that includes nine  different actions and dates, such as deploying a communication plan to  the workforce in February 2013, with the last date being the start of the  pilot in April 2013. This is the last date in the plan associated with a  specific action. Elsewhere in the plan, the Coast Guard lists pending and  ongoing actions under each of its objectives but does not include dates.  According to Coast Guard officials, the pilot will run the length of a  performance cycle (from April 1, 2013 to March 31, 2014). However,  based on the plan, we are unable to determine whether the Coast Guard  has additional actions planned for implementing GEAR that extend  beyond preparing for and starting the project itself. Best practices note  that planning and scheduling are continual processes throughout the life  of a project. They state that planning may be done in stages throughout  the project as stakeholders learn more details.

In addition, the Coast Guard created a  data repository to gather and analyze performance management  responsibilities. However, for both examples, there is no statement within  the plan specifying whether these are performance measures or  identifying what types of data are being collected. According to internal  control standards, performance measures should be established to  evaluate the success or failure of their activities and programs.  Performance measurement involves identifying performance goals and  measures, establishing performance baselines by tracking performance  over time, identifying targets for improving performance, and measuring  progress against those targets. Without additional information on  performance measures, the Coast Guard is missing opportunities to  gauge progress and measure the success of their implementation efforts  and, as a result, the agency may not have all available data for decision- making.

OPM has facilitated conversations  among participating GEAR agencies to identify lessons learned and the  CHCO Council is developing a GEAR toolkit to help agencies improve  performance management and increase employee engagement.  However, going forward, the roles and responsibilities of OPM, the CHCO  Council, and participating federal agencies have not been fully defined,  including how to identify future promising practices, and how to update  and disseminate information on the government-wide implementation of  GEAR. Clearly defined roles and responsibilities will be important for  capitalizing on the improvements made at the five pilot agencies, as well  as for sustaining and achieving the current Administration\u2019s goal of  implementing GEAR more broadly. Without these next steps, the  momentum and lessons learned from the GEAR pilot may be lost and  desired performance management reforms in federal agencies may not  be fully realized.", "The five pilot agencies deserve significant credit for taking steps to  implement the GEAR recommendations and improve performance  management within their organizations in a relatively short amount of  time. Although it is too early to tell whether GEAR is changing  organizational culture within the pilot agencies, leading practices  identified during the pilot should help inform GEAR implementation efforts  at other agencies. However, as part of implementing the GEAR model,  most of the pilot agencies did not develop complete project plans that will  help guide their GEAR-related efforts into the future.

In addition, OPM officials reviewed these criteria and agreed that  many of the practices are very important contributors to organizational  success. We systematically reviewed the GEAR report from the National  Council on Federal Labor-Management Relations (LMR Council) using a  methodology to determine whether the goals, recommendations, and  actions described in the document qualitatively reflected the presence or  absence of the key practices. We also reviewed LMR Council meeting  minutes and other materials from LMR Council meetings.

The Coast Guard is implementing all five of GEAR\u2019s recommendations in  a single-site pilot at Base Boston, affecting approximately 200 employees,  both GS and WG. The Coast Guard chose Base Boston for several  reasons: the presence of both GS and WG employees \u2013 who happen to  be supervised by both military and civilian personnel, a wide variety of  occupations, and the representation of a single union rather than the  multiple unions that are present at other bases. Coast Guard officials said  they chose to implement GEAR as a pilot because agency-wide  implementation brought challenges such as dealing with such a large  military population \u2013 approximately 42,000 military personnel that rotate  bases approximately every two to three years and operate on a different  performance management plan compared with approximately 9,000  civilian employees \u2013 and negotiating with approximately nine unions.

The pilot is  expected to run for the length of one annual performance cycle and  complete on March 31, 2014. According to Coast Guard officials, agency  officials met with union representatives for extensive discussions  involving facilitators and brainstorming sessions in order to include union  input in the final GEAR implementation plan.

Coast Guard officials noted that the agency  needs to improve its culture of engagement. They said part of the  problem is that supervisors do not have enough time to provide feedback,  and employees do not know how to prepare adequately for their  assessments or feedback sessions. By September 2013, all new  supervisors (both civilian and military) will have to take 40 hours of  mandated supervisor training so they will have a base knowledge of how  to provide effective feedback.

Additionally, DOE  officials said they held employee focus groups about the agency\u2019s  performance management system to help inform some of the key actions  of the GEAR implementation plan. Agency officials said that they  expected, and found, that employees did not view the effective execution  of the performance management process as positively as supervisors; in  other words, performance discussions are occurring but they are not  perceived by employees as adding value. Based on data showing that  timely completion of the reviews declined over the previous year, DOE  officials have begun to look for ways to streamline the review process.  This includes shifting to a system that allows supervisors to indicate  satisfactory performance without the need for extensive documentation.  Officials also said that a new electronic performance assessment system,  ePerformance, has facilitated completion of quarterly reviews. According  to DOE officials, ePerformance allows management to monitor feedback  sessions centrally and ensure that supervisors complete them in a timely  fashion, something that was impossible under the agency\u2019s old paper- based system for conducting performance reviews. According to DOE  officials, it is still not possible to ensure that all reviews are of good  quality, only that they are timely. DOE officials feel that improved  communication between managers and employees will be a major  benefit. To reinforce the importance DOE places on supervision, the  agency developed a mandatory supervisory critical element, which holds  supervisors accountable for each phase of the performance process,  according to officials.
