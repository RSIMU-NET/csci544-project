TSA uses CWS to capture the amount of time canine teams conduct training as well as searching for explosives odor, among other functions. However, TSA has not fully analyzed the data it collects in CWS to identify program trends and areas that are working well or in need of corrective action. Such analyses could help TSA to determine canine teams' proficiency, inform future deployment efforts, and help ensure that taxpayer funds are used effectively. For example:", "GAO analysis of canine team training data from May 2011 through April 2012 showed that some canine teams were repeatedly not in compliance with TSA's monthly training requirement, which is in place to ensure canine teams remain proficient in explosives detection.", "GAO analysis of TSA's cargo-screening data from September 2011 through July 2012 showed that canine teams primarily responsible for screening air cargo placed on passenger aircraft exceeded their monthly screening requirement. This suggests that TSA could increase the percentage of air cargo it requires air cargo canine teams to screen or redeploy teams.", "TSA has not deployed passenger screening canines (PSC)--trained to identify and track explosives odor on a person--consistent with its risk-based approach, and did not determine PSC teams' effectiveness prior to deployment. TSA's 2012 Strategic Framework calls for the deployment of PSC teams based on risk; however, GAO found that PSC teams have not been deployed to the highest-risk airport locations. TSA officials stated that the agency generally defers to airport officials on whether PSC teams will be deployed, and some airport operators have decided against the use of PSC teams at their airports because of concerns related to the composition and capabilities of PSC teams. As a result of these concerns, the PSC teams deployed to higher-risk airport locations are not being used for passenger screening as intended, but for other purposes, such as screening air cargo or training. TSA is coordinating with aviation stakeholders to resolve concerns related to PSC team deployment, but has been unable to resolve these concerns, as of September 2012. Furthermore, TSA began deploying PSC teams in April 2011 prior to determining the teams' operational effectiveness and before identifying where within the airport these teams would be most effectively utilized. TSA is in the process of assessing the effectiveness of PSC teams in the operational environment, but testing is not comprehensive since it does not include all areas at the airport or compare PSCs with already deployed conventional canines (trained to detect explosives in stationary objects). As a result, more comprehensive testing could provide TSA with greater assurance that PSC teams are effective in identifying explosives odor on passengers and provide an enhanced security benefit.", "This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in December 2012.

The program began under the Federal Aviation  Administration in 1972 as a partnership with state and local law  enforcement agencies with jurisdiction over airports by pairing law  enforcement officer (LEO) handlers with conventional canines trained to  detect explosives in objects (e.g., baggage and vehicles). In accordance  with the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, which established TSA,  the transfer of NCP to TSA was accomplished in March 2003. TSA  subsequently expanded the program beyond airports to other  transportation modes, including mass transit, and in January 2008, further  expanded the program to include civilian transportation security inspector  (TSI) canine teams responsible for screening air cargo. In 2011, TSA  again expanded the program by deploying TSI handlers to airports with  passenger screening canines (PSC)\u2014conventional canines also trained  to detect explosives being carried or worn on a person.", "In 2008, pursuant to the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11  Commission Act of 2007, we reviewed TSA\u2019s plans and capacity to  increase its explosives detection canine teams.

Using data from the agency\u2019s Canine Website System  (CWS), we analyzed the number of training and utilization minutes  recorded by canine handlers from May 2011 through April 2012\u2014the  most recent data available at the time of our analysis. We compared the  number of minutes canine teams spent training each month (known as  training minutes) with TSA\u2019s requirement. We analyzed the number of  minutes canine teams were utilized each month (known as utilization  minutes) by type of handler (LEO and TSI) to identify any differences. In  addition, we collected and reviewed monthly reports on canine team  training and utilization from canine team supervisors\u2014an area canine  coordinator and field canine coordinators.

We reviewed TSA\u2019s  Recommended Operational Procedures for Canine Screening of  Individuals to understand TSA\u2019s procedures for deploying PSC teams and  protocols for responding to final responses from PSCs. In addition, we  interviewed PSC handlers at the two locations we visited where PSC  teams were initially deployed. We also interviewed officials from Amtrak  police and three major aviation industry associations\u2014Airport Law  Enforcement Agencies Network (ALEAN), Airports Council International- North America (ACI-NA), and American Association of Airport Executives  (AAAE) because they represent stakeholders who expressed views to  TSA on its deployment of PSC teams. While the results from our  interviews are not generalizable to all PSC handlers and aviation  stakeholders, they provided a range of perspectives on TSA\u2019s PSC team  utilization and response protocols. To determine the extent to which TSA  determined the effectiveness of PSC teams, we compared the PSC  assessment approach used by TSA and the DHS Science and  Technology Directorate (S&T) with DHS guidance and best practices.  Moreover, we reviewed the available test results from TSA and DHS  S&T\u2019s operational assessment of PSC teams\u2019 effectiveness in different  areas at the airport. In addition, we interviewed DHS S&T officials  regarding the assessment methodology, and determined that the results  were reliable.

The  annual costs to TSA for LEO teams reflect the amount of the stipend.  TSA\u2019s start-up and annual costs for TSI canine teams are greater than  those for LEO teams, because TSI handlers are TSA employees, so the  costs include the handlers\u2019 pay and benefits, service vehicles, and cell  phones, among other things.

During this time, TSA  requested and was provided funding to increase the stipend it provides to  law enforcement agencies for participating in NCP, and of amounts  appropriated in fiscal year 2012, $5 million was directed for 20 new  canine teams. For fiscal year 2013, TSA is requesting approximately  $96 million for its canine program, which is about $5 million less in  funding than was appropriated in fiscal year 2012.

DOD reported that the most recent  agreement, dated January 2012, requires TSA to request the number of  canines it needs based on its annual requirement. TSA reported that on  the basis of how many canine teams it plans to train, it requests up to 190  canines each year. TSA also breeds canines at its Canine Breeding and  Development Center at Lackland Air Force Base. Canines undergo 10  weeks of explosives detection training before being paired with a handler  at TSA\u2019s CTES, also located at Lackland Air Force Base. Conventional  canine handlers attend a 10-week training course, and PSC handlers  attend a 12-week training course. Canines are paired with a LEO or TSI  handler during their training course. After canine teams complete this  initial training, and are acclimated to their home operating environment,  they undergo a 10- to 14-day \u201ctraining mission\u201d with a CTES evaluator to  obtain initial certification to work in their home operating environment.  During the training mission, the evaluator uses a checklist as a guide to  determine if a canine team should be certified. Some items on the  checklist are considered critical, and the canine team must demonstrate  those necessary skills in order to be certified. After initial certification,  canine teams are evaluated on an annual basis to maintain certification.", "During the conventional explosives detection evaluation, canine teams  must demonstrate their ability to detect all the explosive training aids the  canines were trained to detect in five search areas. The five search  areas are randomly selected among all the possible areas, but according  to CTES, include the area that is most relevant to the type of canine team  (e.g., teams assigned to airports will be evaluated in areas such as  aircraft and cargo).

In addition, a  specified number of nonproductive responses (NPR)\u2014when a canine  responds to a location where no explosives odor is present\u2014are allowed  to pass an evaluation and maintain certification. After passing the  conventional evaluation, PSC teams are required to undergo an  additional annual evaluation that includes detecting explosives on a  person, or being carried by a person.

While these circumstances may lead to a team not  completing the required minutes certain months during a year, our  analysis further revealed that a certain number of canine teams did not  meet the training requirement for a more extended period, at least 6  months during the period analyzed. In light of this broader trend, NCP  officials agreed that it would be useful to monitor compliance with training  requirements over time to ensure canine teams maintain their proficiency  in detecting explosives odor and stated that this information was  previously unknown to TSA until we brought it to its attention. Analyzing  the existing training data could help alert TSA to trends in noncompliance  that could assist the agency in identifying canine team deficiencies and  areas in need of corrective action.

Our analysis of CWS  utilization data for the period from May 2011 through April 2012 showed  that LEO teams consistently reported greater levels of monthly utilization  minutes than TSI teams, and that on average, from September 2011  through July 2012, TSI air cargo teams exceeded their monthly screening  requirement. However, according to senior NCP officials, it is difficult to  compare utilization rates directly because LEO and TSI teams record  utilization minutes differently. LEO teams report their utilization minutes  based on the amount of time they spend patrolling transportation  terminals, searching baggage and vehicles, and screening air cargo,  among other things. TSI teams, on the other hand, report their utilization  minutes based on the time spent primarily screening air cargo.", "According to senior NCP officials, the differences in how utilization  minutes are recorded explains why utilization minutes vary so widely  between LEO and TSI teams. While variances exist in utilization minutes  for canine teams, opportunities exist to determine whether LEO and TSI  teams are being utilized effectively. Unlike TSA\u2019s monthly 240-minute  training requirement, there is no minimum monthly canine utilization  requirement to help ensure that canine teams are effectively utilized.  According to senior NCP officials, the agency is considering whether a  minimum requirement for, and a consistent definition of, utilization  minutes should be applied to LEO and TSI teams in response to our  review. In the absence of a consistent definition of utilization minutes or  goals for utilization, it will be difficult for TSA to determine whether canine  teams are being utilized effectively. Analysis of utilization minutes in light  of stated goals could help TSA determine where LEO and TSI canine  teams are most effectively utilized and could leverage such analysis to  drive future deployment efforts.", "In addition to capturing utilization minutes, TSA also collects and  analyzes data monthly on the amount of cargo TSI air cargo canine  teams screen in accordance with the agency\u2019s requirement. However, it is  unclear how the agency uses this information to identify trends to guide  longer-term future program efforts and activities. Our analysis of TSA\u2019s  cargo screening data from September 2011 through July 2012 showed  that TSI air cargo teams nationwide generally exceeded their monthly  requirement to screen air cargo placed on passenger aircraft. This  suggests that TSA could increase the percentage of air cargo it requires  canine teams to screen, or redeploy additional TSI air cargo teams. For  example, while TSI air cargo teams have generally met or exceeded their  monthly screening requirement, as of September 2012, the agency has  yet to deploy all of its 120 TSI air cargo teams for which funding is  available. However, TSA has not utilized the trends in cargo screening  data to guide agency decision making as to whether the current and  planned deployment number of TSI teams by location is appropriate.  Three of the four supervisory TSI officials we interviewed stated that  staffing levels of TSI teams were sufficient. However, one supervisory TSI  official stated that his TSI staffing level was more than double what was  needed to meet TSA\u2019s screening requirement and provide adequate  coverage for the airport. However, TSA plans to deploy additional TSI  teams to this airport in the near future.

In March 2011, TSA issued guidance to FCCs  instructing canine handlers on how to collect and submit swab samples of  final responses to CEB to verify the presence of explosives odor. Such  samples can confirm canines are effectively detecting explosives odor,  although there are limitations to taking swab samples, and a sample that  does not confirm the presence of odor does not necessarily mean the  canine falsely detected explosives odor (e.g., the sample may have been  taken from the wrong part of the item). The purpose of the guidance was  to develop a standardized process of collecting swab samples to  determine canine teams\u2019 effectiveness in detecting explosives odor.", "However, we found that canine handlers did not always submit swab  samples. Specifically, we determined that the number of swab samples  sent by canine handlers to TSA\u2019s CEB for scientific review was far lower  than the number of final canine responses recorded in CWS. For  instance, in 2011, of the total number of final canine responses recorded  in CWS, LEO and TSI canine teams submitted swab samples for 8  percent of the final responses to CEB for scientific study after the  guidance was issued. NCP stated that 49 percent of the final canine  responses entered in CWS were improperly or incorrectly recorded by  canine handlers, and the remaining 51 percent of cases did not have to  be submitted to CEB for scientific study since submission under the  guidance was not a requirement. However, NCP officials agreed that  tracking and scientifically measuring final canine responses could help  NCP measure canine teams\u2019 effectiveness in detecting explosives in their  operational environments, such as an airport or air cargo facility.  According to these officials, the agency will take steps to require canine  handlers to submit swab samples to CEB. For example, the requirement  will be added to NCP\u2019s Standard Operating Practices and Procedures,  which is expected to be issued by March 2013. In addition, senior NCP  officials told us the agency will clarify this policy with program supervisors  and canine handlers, and modify CWS to more easily allow handlers to  document when a swab sample is collected and sent to CEB for study.

According to representatives from an  airport law enforcement association, these protocols are not appropriate  for a suicide bombing attempt requiring an immediate law enforcement  response.", "According to TSA officials, the lack of agreed-upon response resolution  protocols with local law enforcement officials has complicated efforts to  introduce PSCs at some airports. For example, seven airport operators  have declined the deployment of PSC teams because of concerns  expressed by airport stakeholders regarding TSA\u2019s response resolution  protocols and whether they are adequate for dealing with potential  threats, such as suicide bombers. According to TSA\u2019s Assistant  Administrator for the Office of Security Operations, TSA\u2019s goal is to  deploy PSC teams to airports where there is a supportive working  environment, and accordingly, TSA does not generally require that PSC  teams be accepted for use at an airport. However, TSA reported that if it  identified a specific threat to an airport, it would use its authority to deploy  the PSC teams regardless of any airport stakeholder opposition to the  decision, but it has not had to do so.", "Representatives from three major aviation industry associations we  interviewed support using PSC teams in airports, but also raised  concerns surrounding TSA\u2019s PSC response resolution protocols. These  concerns were primarily related to TSA deploying PSCs with unarmed  TSI handlers rather than LEO handlers because of the differences in their  abilities to respond to a potential threat, such as a suicide bomber.  According to TSA officials, TSA deployed PSCs with TSI handlers in a  manner consistent with the report of the Committee on Appropriations of  the House of Representatives, which accompanies the committee\u2019s DHS  fiscal year 2013 appropriations bill. Officials from an association  representing airport law enforcement officers recommended that PSC  teams be accompanied by three LEOs, among other reasons, to help  reduce the potential liability and response times associated with  responding to a possible suicide bomber. Representatives from an  association representing airport law enforcement officers and TSA  officials stated that they have been working together to try to address  concerns regarding TSA\u2019s response resolution protocols; however, they  have not been able to reach an agreement on this issue, as of September  2012. TSA maintains that PSCs are similar to the agency\u2019s other  screening tools used to detect explosives, and thus a final response from  a PSC should trigger the same type of law enforcement response to  potential threats identified through other screening measures.  Additionally, TSA officials stated that airport operators are required to  adopt and maintain TSA-approved security programs that, among other  things, provide for a law enforcement presence and capability at the  airport that is adequate to ensure the safety of passengers, and that their  current approach of using LEOs in support of TSI-led PSC operations is  consistent with this requirement.", "However, TSA\u2019s decision to deploy PSC teams only to airports where  they would be willingly accepted by stakeholders has resulted in PSC  teams not being deployed to the highest-risk airport terminals and  concourses on its high-risk list. Given that PSC teams cost $164,000  annually per team, TSA is not using the teams in the most cost-effective  manner to enhance security if it is limited to deploying them at lower-risk  airports and concourses. Moreover, PSC teams at the two high-risk  airports we visited are not being used for passenger screening because  TSA and the local law enforcement agencies have not reached  agreement on the PSC response resolution protocols. Thus, rather than  being utilized for their intended primary purpose\u2014passenger screening\u2014 PSC teams are being used to screen air cargo or conduct training. TSA  officials agreed that the decision to defer to airport stakeholders\u2019  willingness to have PSC teams deployed to their airports has resulted in  PSCs not being optimally utilized. While we recognize the value of  obtaining airport stakeholder buy-in, deploying PSC teams to the highest- risk airport terminals and concourses in accordance with its Strategic  Framework, could help TSA better deploy future PSC teams in a cost- effective manner, and utilize the PSC teams that have already been  deployed for their intended purposes to enhance security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Plans to Complete PSC Effectiveness Assessments in 2013; Initial Results Indicate Performance Challenges", "paragraphs": ["TSA began deploying PSC teams in April 2011 prior to determining the  teams\u2019 operational effectiveness and before identifying where within the  airport environment these teams would be most effectively utilized.  According to TSA officials, operational assessments did not need to be  conducted prior to their deployment because canines were being used to  screen passengers by other entities, such as airports in the United  Kingdom, and TSA leadership focused on initially deploying PSC teams  to a single location within the airport\u2014the sterile area\u2014because it thought  it would be the best way to foster stakeholders\u2019 acceptance of the teams.  However, in June 2012, DHS S&T and TSA began conducting operational  assessments to help demonstrate the effectiveness of PSC teams, and  plans to complete additional PSC effectiveness testing in 2013 at  additional airports. To assess the effectiveness of PSC teams in detecting  explosives odor, TSA and DHS S&T are assessing their capabilities  based on several factors. On the basis of these results, DHS S&T and  TSA\u2019s NCP recommended that the assessment team conduct additional  testing and that additional training and guidance be provided to canine  teams.", "As part of our review, we visited two airports at which PSC teams have  been deployed and observed training exercises in which PSC teams  accurately detected explosives odor (i.e., positive response), failed to  detect explosives odor (i.e., miss), and falsely detected explosives odor  (i.e., non productive response). See the hyperlink in the note for figure 2  for videos of training exercises at one airport showing instances when  PSC teams detected, and failed to detect explosives odor.", "On the basis of the results of DHS\u2019s assessments, TSA could have  benefited from completing operational assessments of PSCs before  deploying them on a nationwide basis to determine whether they are an  effective method of screening passengers in the U.S. airport environment.  TSA officials stated that operational assessments did not need to occur  prior to deployment because the agency does not consider PSCs a new  screening method. Moreover, according to DHS S&T\u2019s Canine Explosives  Detection Project Manager, some PSC teams needed to be deployed  operationally at airports before their effectiveness could be assessed.  While we agree that some PSC teams needed to be deployed for  operational assessments to occur, this testing could have been  completed before TSA started deploying additional PSC teams on a  nationwide basis beyond the three pilot site airports. As discussed earlier,  TSA plans to deploy all 120 teams for which it has funding by the end of  calendar year 2013. Best practices for program performance call for  agencies to use performance information to assess efficiency, identify  performance gaps, and ensure intended goals are met. We previously  reported on the need for TSA to validate detection methods before  deploying new screening methods. For example, TSA proceeded with  deploying its Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques  behavior detection program on a nationwide basis before determining  whether the list of passenger behaviors and appearances underpinning  the program were scientifically validated, and whether these techniques  could be applied on a large scale for counterterrorism purposes in an  airport environment. Assessing the effectiveness of PSCs in the  operational environment could help provide TSA with reasonable  assurance that PSCs are effective in identifying explosives odor on  passengers and provide an enhanced security benefit.", "Additionally, TSA has not completed an assessment to determine where  within the airport PSC teams would be most effectively utilized. According  to TSA\u2019s Assistant Administrator for the Office of Security Operations, to  alleviate airport stakeholders\u2019 concerns regarding TSA\u2019s response  resolution protocols, the agency initially deployed PSC teams to the  sterile areas, thereby enabling TSA to gather data on the value of PSC  teams in the airport environment while reducing the likelihood of a final  response from a PSC resulting in the closure of a checkpoint since an  individual has already passed through several layers of screening when  entering the sterile area. However, aviation stakeholders we interviewed,  raised concerns about this deployment strategy, stating that PSC teams  would be more effectively utilized in non sterile areas of the airport, such  as curbside or in the lobby areas. Specifically, two of the three aviation  industry representatives we interviewed stated that deploying PSC teams  to the sterile area, rather than the public area, could limit their ability to  detect and deter potential suicide bombers entering the airport. According  to TSA\u2019s Assistant Administrator for the Office of Security Operations,  TSA initially deployed PSC teams to the sterile area because it thought it  would foster stakeholders\u2019 acceptance of PSC teams and does not  generally consider the deployment of PSC teams to the sterile area as a  permanent or most optimal use of the PSC teams. Instead, the agency  maintains that the best use of PSC teams is in the public area or at the  screening checkpoint.", "TSA has since deployed PSC teams to the passenger screening  checkpoints. According to NCP officials, the agency is also considering  providing some PSCs to LEOs to work on the public side of the airport.  However, DHS S&T does not plan to assess the effectiveness of PSCs  on the public side, beyond the checkpoint, since TSA was not planning to  deploy PSCs to the public side of the airport when DHS S&T designed its  test plan. Comprehensive operational assessments that include a  comparison of PSC teams in both the sterile and public areas of the  airport could help TSA determine if it is beneficial to deploy PSCs to the  public side of airports, in addition to or in lieu of the sterile area and  checkpoint. Moreover, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government stresses the need for agencies to provide reasonable  assurance of the effectiveness and efficiency of operations, including the  use of the entity\u2019s resources.", "During the June 2012 assessment of PSC teams\u2019 effectiveness, TSA  conducted one of the search exercises with three conventional canine  teams. Although this assessment was not intended to be included as part  of DHS S&T and TSA\u2019s formal assessment of PSC effectiveness, the  results of this assessment suggest, and TSA officials and DHS S&T\u2019s  Canine Explosives Detection Project Manager agreed, that a systematic  assessment of PSCs with conventional canines could provide TSA with  information to determine whether PSCs provide an enhanced security  benefit compared with conventional LEO aviation canine teams that have  already been deployed to airport terminals. An assessment would help  clarify whether additional investments for PSC training are warranted.  Moreover, since PSC teams are trained in both conventional and  passenger screening methods, TSA could decide to convert existing PSC  teams to conventional canine teams, thereby limiting the additional  resource investments associated with training and maintaining the new  PSC teams. Additionally, as previously discussed, should TSA decide to  deploy some of the PSCs scheduled to be deployed in 2013 with LEO  handlers, rather than TSI handlers, TSA could further reduce program  costs and increase costs savings, as a PSC team led by a LEO handler  could cost TSA $53,000 annually per team, compared with $164,000, the  current annual cost per TSI-led PSC team. Moreover, TSA officials and  aviation industry stakeholders stated that deploying PSCs with  experienced LEO canine handlers could reduce the learning curve  associated with becoming a PSC handler."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Securing the nation\u2019s vast and diverse transportation system is a  challenging task that is complicated by the ever-changing and dynamic  threat environment.

However, a  systematic analysis of key program data that TSA currently collects,  consisting of training and utilization minutes, certification rates, results of  short notice assessments (covert tests), and canine responses to the  possible presence of explosives, could better position TSA to identify  program trends to better target resources and activities based on what is  working well and what may be in need of corrective action. In addition, a  comprehensive assessment of passenger screening canines and  conventional canine teams in all areas of the airport could provide TSA  with greater assurance that passenger screening canine teams are a  cost-effective screening tool and are being optimally utilized. Such  analyses could help TSA determine the appropriate number, type, and  placement of canine teams needed to best secure the U.S. transportation  system.

DHS stated that NCP is planning to  reestablish yearly comprehensive assessments of canine teams\u2019  compliance with program requirements, and implement corrective action,  when necessary. Furthermore, TSA is upgrading CWS, and in March  2013 will be able to capture data on PSC teams, as it currently does for  conventional canine teams. We support TSA\u2019s actions to implement these  yearly assessments, as well as the upgrade to CWS to collect information  on PSC teams. We believe it is important for TSA to also review its  analysis of canine teams\u2019 performance screening air cargo in order to  inform future decisions on the percentage of air cargo that it requires  canine teams to screen, as well as the number of TSI air cargo canine  teams needed to meet TSA\u2019s air cargo screening requirement. TSA  should also analyze its data, including results of short notice assessments  and final canine responses, to assess canine team performance in order  to mitigate any explosives detection challenges and determine canine  teams\u2019 strengths. Such actions, in conjunction with TSA\u2019s planned efforts,  would meet the intent of the recommendation.", "DHS concurred with the second recommendation, to expand and  complete testing to assess the effectiveness of PSC teams and  conventional canines in areas of the airport deemed appropriate. DHS  stated that TSA and DHS S&T will conclude testing of PSC teams in the  sterile areas of airports in February 2013, and have begun testing PSC  teams in the public areas of the airports. In addition, TSA will discuss with  DHS S&T developing testing protocols for conventional canines. We  support TSA\u2019s actions to assess the effectiveness of PSC teams, and  encourage TSA to incorporate conventional canines into future testing to  demonstrate if PSCs provide an enhanced explosives detection benefit  relative to conventional canines, given their increased cost.", "DHS also stated that TSA anticipates deploying all 120 of the PSC teams  for which it received authorization by the end of calendar year 2013.

Table 3 provides an overview of these  efforts.", "Training and evaluation. Canine handlers we interviewed in four  locations (74 of 75 handlers), generally spoke positively of the instruction  they had received during their training courses and missions. For  example, some canine handlers cited the hands-on instruction and  feedback they received from TSA Canine Training and Evaluation Section  (CTES) evaluators during their training missions as particularly beneficial.  However, some canine handlers we interviewed (26 of 67 evaluated)  suggested that TSA seek ways to improve the consistency and objectivity  of the evaluation process. For example, some canine handlers stated that  while one evaluator may consider a canine sitting a few feet away from  the explosive training aid a \u201cfringe\u201d response and count it positively,  another evaluator would consider the same scenario a nonproductive  response (NPR). As noted earlier, a specified number of NPRs are  allowed to pass an evaluation and maintain certification. In July 2011,  CTES formed a committee comprising various TSA officials and canine  handlers to conduct a review of its evaluation process. The committee  suggested creating a \u201cTrain the Evaluator\u201d course to reduce  inconsistencies in the evaluation process. CTES subsequently created an  evaluation unit, which will be implementing the course on consistently  applying evaluation guidelines later this calendar year. Furthermore, in  January 2012, CTES began sending its most experienced evaluators to  all annual evaluations to help improve the consistency and objectivity of  the evaluation process. Specifically, according to CTES officials, one of  the two evaluators conducting the evaluation is to be from the evaluation  unit, which is composed of CTES\u2019s 12 most experienced evaluators. The  committee supported actions to provide greater consistency during the  evaluation process but stated that the evaluations are fair, and ultimately  not the reason for canine teams failing evaluations. Rather, the committee  cited a lack of local training support for canine teams once they are  deployed to their home units. As a result, CTES is in the process of  deploying regional trainers to the field to assist canine teams with  proficiency training. Thus far, 23 of 27 regional trainers have been  deployed to the field. CTES planned to deploy all 27 regional trainers by  December 2012.", "Research, development, and testing.
