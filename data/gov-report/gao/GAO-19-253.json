FEMA obligated about $873.8 million for emergency work\u2014debris removal activities and emergency measures to lessen the immediate threat to life, public health, and safety\u2014and about $516.3 million for permanent work\u2014including the repair or replacement of public infrastructure such as roads, electrical utilities, and schools. For example, FEMA obligated about $101 million for the purchase and installation of modular units to be used as temporary classrooms and other facilities while permanent school buildings are repaired or replaced. FEMA's obligations for permanent work also included funding for hazard mitigation measures to reduce the risk of damage during future storms\u2014for example, by replacing wooden utility poles with composite fiberglass poles (see figure).", "FEMA and the USVI are transitioning from using the standard Public Assistance program in the territory to using the Public Assistance alternative procedures program. Unlike in the standard Public Assistance program where FEMA will fund the actual cost of a project, the alternative procedures allow awards to be made on the basis of fixed-cost estimates to provide financial incentives for the timely and cost-effective completion of permanent work projects. FEMA and USVI officials stated that the alternative procedures will give the USVI more flexibility in determining when and how to fund projects and provide an opportunity to repair and rebuild the USVI's critical services infrastructure\u2014such as its education system and electrical grid\u2014so it meets industry standards without regard to pre-disaster condition. As of November 2018, FEMA and USVI officials were discussing the process for developing projects under the Public Assistance alternative procedures.

These disasters exacerbated an already difficult financial  situation in the USVI, which was operating under severe fiscal constraints  prior to the storms.", "The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)\u2014a component of  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014is the lead federal agency  responsible for disaster preparedness, response, and recovery, which  includes assisting the USVI as it recovers from these natural disasters.  Among other responsibilities, FEMA administers the Public Assistance  program in the USVI through a partnership with the territorial government  and provides grant funding for a wide range of eligible response and  recovery activities. These activities include debris removal efforts, life- saving emergency protective measures, and the repair, replacement, or  restoration of disaster-damaged publicly-owned facilities, electrical  utilities, roads and bridges, and more. Further, in July 2018, FEMA  approved the USVI government\u2019s request to use the Public Assistance  alternative procedures program in the territory that offers financial  incentives for the timely and cost-effective completion of permanent work.", "You asked us to review the federal government\u2019s response and recovery  efforts related to the 2017 hurricanes. As part of that effort, we have  several reviews ongoing of FEMA\u2019s and the USVI government\u2019s disaster  recovery planning, oversight, and execution efforts in the USVI. In this  report, we discuss:  1.  the status of FEMA Public Assistance program funding provided to the  USVI in response to the 2017 hurricanes as of October 1, 2018\u2014 more than 1 year after hurricanes Irma and Maria impacted the  territory; and  2.  the USVI\u2019s transition to implementing FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance  alternative procedures program in the territory.", "Another review will examine disaster recovery efforts in the USVI and we  plan to issue that report later this year. In addition, we are conducting a  broader body of work covering various disaster response and recovery  issues, including disaster recovery in impacted states in the contiguous  United States and Puerto Rico, and will be reporting on these issues over  the next year.", "For this report, we reviewed relevant documentation on FEMA\u2019s Public  Assistance program\u2014including the April 2018 Public Assistance Program  and Policy Guide and the September 2018 Public Assistance Alternative  Procedures Permanent Work Guide for the USVI. We also obtained and  analyzed data from FEMA\u2019s Emergency Management Mission Integrated  Environment and Integrated Financial Management Information System  on Public Assistance program obligations and the USVI\u2019s expenditures as  of October 1, 2018. An obligation is a definite commitment that creates a  legal liability of the government for the payment of goods and services  ordered or received. For the purposes of this report, obligations represent  the amount of grant funding FEMA provided through the Public  Assistance program for specific projects in the USVI. An expenditure is an  amount paid by federal agencies, by cash or cash equivalent, during the  fiscal year to liquidate government obligations. For the purposes of this  report, an expenditure represents the actual spending by the USVI  government of money obligated by the federal government. We  interviewed FEMA officials, including those stationed in the USVI, as well  as officials from the USVI\u2019s Governor\u2019s office, the USVI\u2019s Territorial  Emergency Management Agency, the USVI\u2019s Department of Finance,  and contractor personnel regarding the implementation of the Public  Assistance program in the territory.

Further, 52  percent of the territory\u2019s housing units were damaged, ports and airports  were closed for weeks, and hundreds of thousands of tons of debris were  generated, often blocking roads and making transportation hazardous. In  addition, according to a September 2018 report from the USVI Hurricane  Recovery and Resilience Task Force, the territory\u2019s economic activity\u2014 especially tourism\u2014was severely reduced in the months following the  storms, leading to job losses and a total estimated economic impact of  $1.54 billion.", "In response to the request of the Governor of the USVI, the President  declared a major disaster the day after each hurricane struck the  territory. Major disaster declarations can trigger a variety of federal  response and recovery programs for government and nongovernmental  entities and households and individuals, including assistance through the  Public Assistance program. Under the National Response Framework  and National Disaster Recovery Framework, DHS is the federal  department with primary responsibility for coordinating disaster response  and recovery, and within DHS, FEMA has lead responsibility.

As shown in figure 2, Public Assistance  program funds are categorized broadly as \u201cemergency work\u201d or  \u201cpermanent work.\u201d Within these broad categories are separate  subcategories. In addition to the emergency work and permanent work  categories, the program includes category Z, which represents indirect  costs, administrative expenses, and other expenses a recipient or  subrecipient incurs in administering and managing the Public Assistance  program that are not directly chargeable to a specific project.", "FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program also provides funding for cost- effective hazard mitigation measures to reduce or eliminate the long-term  risk to people and property from future natural and man-made disasters  and their effects. Specifically, FEMA provides funding for hazard mitigation measures in conjunction with the repair of disaster-damaged  facilities to enhance their resilience during future disasters. For example,  a community that had a fire station damaged by a disaster could use  Public Assistance funding to repair the facility and incorporate additional  measures such as installing hurricane shutters over the windows to  mitigate the potential for future damage.", "Once the President has declared a disaster, FEMA, the state or territorial  government (the recipient), and local or territorial entities (the  subrecipient) work together to develop damage assessments and  formulate project worksheets for eligible projects. Project worksheets  detail the scope of work and estimated cost for repairing or replacing  disaster-damaged infrastructure as well as any hazard mitigation  measures that may help to increase the resilience of this infrastructure  during future disasters. After a project has completed FEMA\u2019s review  process and is approved, FEMA obligates funding for the project by  placing money into an account where the recipient has the authority to  draw down\u2014or withdraw\u2014funding to pay the subrecipient for eligible  work upon completion (see fig. 3).", "In addition, a state or territorial governor may designate a governor\u2019s  authorized representative (GAR) to oversee all aspects of disaster  assistance, including Public Assistance funding. Specifically, the GAR is  responsible for ensuring compliance with program requirements by  providing oversight into how goods and services are procured for  projects, such as construction materials or modular school units. The  GAR also confirms that subrecipients submit complete documentation  demonstrating that all work completed is in accordance with a project\u2019s  approved scope of work and Public Assistance program requirements.  The GAR then approves the paperwork and the recipient can draw down  funding from the account holding the obligations to reimburse  subrecipients for completed work. When a project has been completed,  FEMA conducts a close-out process to certify that all work has been  completed and reconciles the actual cost incurred.

Of this $586.9 million, the USVI had  expended about $532.8 million (91 percent) for emergency work projects  in categories A and B and $49.1 million (8 percent) for permanent work  projects in categories C through G. The majority of FEMA\u2019s obligations  and the funding the USVI expended as of October 1, 2018, are for  emergency work because these projects began soon after the disasters  struck and focused on debris removal and providing assistance to  address immediate threats to life and property. In contrast, permanent  work projects take time to identify, develop, and ultimately complete as  they represent the longer-term repair and restoration of public  infrastructure.", "Emergency work. Of the more than $1.4 billion FEMA had obligated as  of October 1, 2018, about $873.8 million (60 percent) was obligated for  322 emergency work projects in Public Assistance categories A and B.", "Category A: Debris Removal. FEMA obligated about $94.0 million for  71 projects focused on debris removal activities across the territory.", "For example, FEMA obligated $45.0 million to the USVI Department  of Public Works for territorywide debris removal efforts and $39.1  million to the USVI Water and Power Authority for these activities in  St. Croix (see fig. 5). Of the $94.0 million FEMA obligated for debris  removal, the USVI had expended about $54.6 million (58 percent) as  of October 1, 2018.", "Category B: Emergency Protective Measures. FEMA obligated about  $780 million for 251 projects focused on emergency measures. For  example, FEMA obligated about $187 million for the Sheltering and  Temporary Essential Power program, which is intended to provide  essential repairs or restore power to private residences to allow  affected individuals to return or remain in their homes, thereby  reducing the demand for other shelter options. In addition, FEMA  obligated approximately $101 million for the purchase and installation  of modular units to be used as temporary classrooms and other  facilities while permanent school buildings are repaired or replaced  (see fig. 6).

Of the more than $1.4 billion in Public Assistance  funding FEMA had obligated as of October 1, 2018, about $516.3 million  (36 percent) was obligated for 153 permanent work projects across  categories C through G. These permanent work projects include about  $349.4 million for cost-effective hazard mitigation measures aimed at  reducing the future risk of disaster-damaged facilities in conjunction with  their repair. Further, of the $516.3 million FEMA obligated for permanent  work in the USVI, approximately $500.4 million\u2014or 97 percent of all  permanent work obligations\u2014was obligated to the USVI Water and  Power Authority for the permanent repair of electrical distribution systems  and other utilities across the territory.", "Category C: Roads and Bridges. FEMA obligated about $5.2 million  for 35 projects focused on repairing roads and bridges in the territory,  18 of which included hazard mitigation measures totaling about $1.5  million. For example, FEMA obligated about $410,000 for one project  to repair a road on St. Thomas damaged by floodwaters. This project  included approximately $227,000 for hazard mitigation measures,  such as replacing the damaged road surface with reinforced concrete  and building a retaining wall. As of October 1, 2018, the USVI had not  expended funding in this category.", "Category D: Water Control Facilities. As of October 1, 2018, FEMA  did not have any projects in this category.

FEMA obligated $6.0 million for  77 projects focused on repairing and rebuilding damaged buildings  and equipment, 16 of which included hazard mitigation measures  totaling about $1.8 million. For example, FEMA obligated about $1.5  million to repair damage to the airport terminal building in St.  Thomas\u2014a project where hazard mitigation measures comprised 87  percent of the project\u2019s total cost (see fig. 7). These measures include  replacing the terminal\u2019s roof with materials designed to withstand  higher wind speeds to increase the building\u2019s resilience during future  storms. Of the $6.0 million FEMA obligated for category E, the USVI  had expended about $148,000 (2.5 percent) as of October 1, 2018.", "Category F: Utilities. Of the $516.3 million FEMA obligated for  permanent work projects, $502.2 million (97 percent) was obligated  for 15 projects focused on repairing utilities, 7 of which included  hazard mitigation measures totaling about $346.0 million.

The alternative  procedures provide new flexibilities to FEMA and the USVI that are not  available through the standard Public Assistance program. In September  2018, FEMA issued the Public Assistance Alternative Procedures  Permanent Work Guide for the USVI to provide guidance on the  implementation of the program in the territory. FEMA and USVI officials  stated that a section of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and the  flexibilities provided by the program itself influenced the USVI\u2019s decision  to transition to using the alternative procedures.", "First, Section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 authorized  FEMA, when using the Public Assistance alternative procedures, to  provide assistance to fund the replacement or restoration of disaster- damaged infrastructure that provide critical services to industry standards  without regard to pre-disaster condition. FEMA and USVI officials told  us that the territory therefore has a valuable opportunity to use the  alternative procedures to repair and rebuild its critical services  infrastructure\u2014including the USVI\u2019s education system, electrical grid, and  emergency medical care system, among others\u2014so it is in a better  condition than it was prior to the 2017 hurricanes. Second, USVI  officials stated that under the standard Public Assistance program  currently being used in the USVI, the territorial government is responsible  for providing the initial funding to reimburse subrecipients for completed  work prior to drawing down funds from the account holding the FEMA- obligated amounts of money for each project. They explained that  because of the financial liquidity challenges facing the territory, this  process was problematic and required USVI officials to prioritize projects  based on the availability of the territory\u2019s funding. USVI officials stated  that the Public Assistance alternative procedures will help to address this  challenge by providing the territory with more flexibility regarding when  and how to fund projects. For example, in certain cases, the USVI is able  to consolidate permanent work projects approved under the alternative  procedures and share obligated funding across these projects. In  addition, the USVI is able to use any excess funds for cost-effective  hazard mitigation measures or for activities that improve the recipient\u2019s or  subrecipient\u2019s future Public Assistance operations or planning.", "As of November 2018, FEMA and USVI officials stated they were working  to identify and develop permanent work projects using the Public  Assistance alternative procedures and discussing the process for  developing the fixed-cost estimate for each project. Specifically, unlike in  the standard Public Assistance program where FEMA will fund the actual  cost of a project, the Public Assistance alternative procedures use a  fixed-cost estimate which is agreed to prior to obligation and the USVI will  be financially responsible for any actual costs that exceed this amount.  Given the USVI\u2019s difficult fiscal situation, FEMA and USVI officials stated  that ensuring these fixed-cost estimates are as accurate as possible will  be critical. However, FEMA officials also noted that if FEMA and the  territory cannot come to an agreement on a fixed-cost estimate for any  given project, the USVI does have the option to move forward through the  standard Public Assistance program. According to FEMA\u2019s Public  Assistance Alternative Procedures Permanent Work Guide for the USVI,  all cost estimates for projects using these procedures must be finalized by  March 2020.
