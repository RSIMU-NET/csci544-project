Brady calls for implementation in two phases. Under phase I, or the interim provisions, the checks are to be conducted by the chief law enforcement officer (CLEO) in the purchaser\u2019s residence community to determine, on the basis of available records, if the individual is legally prohibited from buying the firearm under the provisions of federal, state, or local law. The sale may not be completed for 5 business days unless the dealer receives an approval from the CLEO before that time. If the CLEO does not contact the dealer within the 5-day period, the dealer may make the sale unless the dealer has reason to believe the transaction would be unlawful. Under the phase II permanent provisions effective November 30, 1998, the 5-day waiting period requirement terminates and presale inquiries for all firearms sales will be made only to a national background check system that will be operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Brady Calls for Background Checks of Prospective Handgun Purchasers", "paragraphs": ["Since early 1987, Congress has considered various versions of legislation restricting access to handguns. These legislative efforts were labeled \u201cBrady\u201d bills\u2014referring to James Brady, the Reagan administration press secretary who was disabled by a gunshot wound sustained during an attempted assassination of the President. Many of the early legislative efforts called for a waiting period for handgun purchases. The waiting period was designed, in most instances, to allow for the \u201copportunity\u201d to conduct background checks, not the imposition of a mandatory background check requirement. Often, this opportunity meant that a copy of the application form was to be sent to the appropriate local law enforcement agency. In addition, the waiting period was described as providing a cooling-off period to deter impulse purchases. Brady opponents objected to the waiting period and offered amendments or substitute legislation typically calling for systems that would allow point-of-sale background checks to screen out criminals and not delay or otherwise interfere with the rights of law-abiding citizens to buy and own handguns.", "The current two-phased approach, first introduced in 1991 and described by its original sponsors as a compromise, (1) includes a waiting period that allows CLEOs time to conduct the background check required of themand (2) provides for the eventual point-of-sale background check system. To do this, Brady amends the Gun Control Act of 1968, which contains the principal federal restrictions on commerce in firearms and ammunition.", "Since passage of the 1968 act, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) has licensed and regulated manufacturers, importers, dealers, and pawnbrokers in firearms. Under the 1968 act, as amended, those licensees (hereinafter referred to as gun dealers) are prohibited from selling firearms or ammunition to anyone they know or have reasonable cause to believe (1) has been convicted of (or is under indictment for), in any court, a crime punishable by more than 1 year in prison; (2) is a fugitive; (3) is an unlawful user of a controlled substance; (4) has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to a mental institution; (5) is an illegal alien; (6) is a dishonorably discharged veteran of the Armed Forces; or (7) is a person who has renounced U.S. citizenship. Under the 1968 act, persons purchasing a firearm from a licensed dealer are required to certify their eligibility, but no background checks or other verification of the information supplied is required. In contrast, while including the 1968 prohibitions and also requiring buyers to certify their eligibility, Brady is the first federal legislation providing for presale background checks to verify such eligibility.", "\u201crestrains such person from harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner of such person or child of such intimate partner or person, or engaging in other conduct that would place an intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the partner or child.\u201d", "Under Brady\u2019s interim provisions, a prospective handgun purchaser must complete a form\u2014generally referred to as the Brady form (see app. I)\u2014giving his or her name, date of birth, and residence address and certifying that he or she is not a member of various categories prohibited from buying a firearm. Then, within 1 business day, the gun dealer must provide notice of the form\u2019s contents to the CLEO of the area in which the buyer\u2019s residence is located. The CLEO must then \u201cmake a reasonable effort\u201d to ascertain within 5 business days whether the sale would violate federal, state, or local law, including research in whatever state and local record-keeping systems are available and the FBI-operated National Crime Information Center files (see fig. 1.1).", "The CLEO may allow the sale to proceed at any time during the waiting period by advising the gun dealer that the applicant has not been determined to be a prohibited person. Alternatively, if not notified to the contrary, the gun dealer may assume that the purchaser is not disqualified and complete the sale upon expiration of the 5-day period. However, if the search reveals that the applicant is ineligible to receive a handgun, the CLEO is to notify the dealer (without providing the reason) that the sale is denied. The CLEO may also instruct the dealer to refer the buyer to the CLEO if the buyer has questions or otherwise challenges the denial. Generally, such questions or challenges are sometimes referred to as \u201cadministrative appeals,\u201d even though practices are somewhat less formal than this term implies. For instance, by providing the law enforcement officer additional documentation, a buyer may be able to reverse a denial that initially resulted from inaccurate or incomplete information in the databases searched. Brady also provided a remedy for erroneous denial of a firearm. Generally, any person denied a firearm due to the provision of erroneous information or who was not prohibited from receipt of a firearm may bring action to direct the correction of the erroneous information or that the transfer be approved. In any such action, the court may allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee as part of the costs.", "Finally, under Brady\u2019s interim provisions, certain specified transactions in states that screen handgun purchasers\u2014e.g., through a permit system or some other procedure for conducting criminal background checks\u2014are exempt from Brady\u2019s waiting period. States that operate an alternative system that meets certain standards have been designated as Brady-alternative states by ATF. As of February 28, 1995, 24 states had systems in place that ATF determined were acceptable alternatives to Brady. Residents, dealers, and law enforcement officials in the other 26 states\u2014the so-called \u201cBrady states\u201d\u2014are subject to Brady\u2019s waiting period requirements (see app. II)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Implementation Largely Depends Upon the Cooperation of Local Law Enforcement Officials and Gun Dealers", "paragraphs": ["\u201cWith 285,000 licensees and only 240 ATF inspectors to check their premises and the records that they keep to ensure compliance, it would take approximately 10 years for us to inspect all the gun dealers.\u201d", "More recently, the number of licensed dealers has begun to decline\u2014to about 220,000 by the end of March 1995\u2014partly as a result of the increase in the license fee required by the Federal Firearms License Reform Act of 1993. Another contributing factor is the 1994 Crime Act, which required that gun dealers certify compliance with state and local law as a condition for a license. On the other hand, even if ATF had more resources to inspect gun dealers, there are legislated limits on the frequency of compliance inspections. For instance, under 18 U.S.C. 923, absent reasonable cause or a warrant, ATF can inspect or examine a licensed dealer \u201cnot more than once during any 12-month period\u201d to ensure compliance with record-keeping requirements.", "Finally, while gun dealers are required to maintain a copy of completed Brady forms for at least 5 years, the dealers are not required to report information from the forms to federal authorities. Brady allows CLEOs to retain forms for individuals denied a purchase but requires that all other forms be destroyed within 20 days. CLEOs also are not required to maintain or report data. In fact, various statutory provisions restrict the use of firearms-related information and prohibit the establishment of systems to register firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions. Thus, no data were readily available that would allow for monitoring trends in handgun purchases and denials or otherwise judge the impact of Brady."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Policymakers Recognize That Brady May Not Keep All Criminals From Obtaining Handguns", "paragraphs": ["In July 1995, the Department of Justice issued a report on guns and crime in the United States. Among other information, the report noted that: \u2022 Over 40 million handguns have been produced in the United States since 1973. Most guns are not used to commit crimes. Further, most crime is not committed with guns. However, most gun crime is committed with handguns. \u2022 During 1993, there were 4.4 million murders, rapes, robberies, and aggravated assaults in the United States, and more than one-fourth of these violent crimes involved the use of a gun. \u2022 From 1985 through 1994, the FBI received an annual average of over 274,000 reports of stolen guns. By definition, all stolen guns are available to criminals. \u2022 At the request of police agencies, ATF\u2019s National Tracing Center will trace firearms back to their original point of sale. More than three-quarters of the 83,000 guns used in crime that ATF traced for law enforcement agencies in 1994 were handguns.", "Policymakers recognize that even a perfect felon identification system may not keep felons from obtaining firearms and that Brady may not directly result in measurable reductions of gun-related crimes. For example, Brady does not apply to transactions between nonlicensed individuals. Tens of millions of handguns are already in private hands. Thus, the apparently sizable numbers of handgun transactions that take place between private individuals, such as at gun shows and even \u201con the street,\u201d are not subject to Brady\u2019s requirements. In fact, the purpose of Brady is to prevent convicted felons and other ineligible persons from purchasing firearms from licensed dealers.", "Opponents of Brady point to a 1991 survey of state prison inmates, which showed that 73 percent of those who had ever possessed a handgun did not purchase it from a gun dealer. Generally, opponents contend that it is a mistake to claim Brady prevents criminals from obtaining handguns since anyone denied a purchase from a licensed dealer can easily obtain a gun from another source and will almost certainly do so. Also, denied applicants may have friends or spouses without a criminal record make the purchases from dealers for them.", "On the other hand, Brady proponents use the same study to counter that 27 percent of those inmates surveyed obtained their firearms from licensed gun dealers and argue that no criminals should be able to buy guns from licensed dealers. Proponents acknowledge that criminal records checks alone will not prevent felons from obtaining firearms but could reduce dealer sales to disqualified persons; complement other crime control measures, such as stiffer mandatory sentences for firearms offenses; and clamp down on illegal gun trafficking."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our self-initiated review of the first full year of Brady implementation was designed to determine the following: \u2022 How frequently were the 5-day waiting period and background checks resulting in criminals and other ineligible individuals being denied the opportunity to purchase handguns from federally licensed dealers? (See ch. 2.) \u2022 To what extent had handgun purchase denials resulted in federal follow-up enforcement actions (e.g., arrests and prosecutions) against convicted felons and other ineligible purchasers who falsely completed the Brady form? (See ch. 2.) \u2022 What were the effects of the various legal challenges to Brady? For instance, we were particularly interested in whether background checks of handgun purchasers were being conducted in those jurisdictions represented by CLEOs who had filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of Brady. If no background checks were being conducted in certain jurisdictions, we wanted to determine why and what alternative arrangements were permissible or practical. (See ch. 3.)", "To obtain a broad understanding of these phase I implementation issues, we contacted a number of relevant governmental and private organizations. For example, we interviewed ATF headquarters and district officials responsible for promulgating Brady regulations and providing training and guidance to CLEOs and federally licensed gun dealers. We obtained additional national perspectives by contacting the following industry and special interest organizations: Americans for Effective Law Enforcement; the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms; the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence; Gun Owners of America; Handgun Control, Inc.; the International Association of Chiefs of Police; the Law Enforcement Alliance of America; the National Rifle Association; and the National Sheriffs\u2019 Association.", "To obtain information on how frequently the 5-day waiting period and background checks were resulting in denials, we contacted local law enforcement agencies in several Brady states. Our results are not projectable to the universe of denials nationwide. We did not use a nationally projectable sample because (1) it would have involved contacting hundreds of law enforcement agencies nationwide, (2) Brady was less than 1 year old when we began our data gathering, and (3) Brady did not impose any record-keeping requirements on CLEOs.", "We judgmentally selected 20 state and local law enforcement agencies in 12 (46 percent) of the 26 Brady states. Selection factors\u2014which are discussed in more detail below\u2014included data availability, jurisdictional variety, denial rate variety, and geographic dispersion. In seven of the Brady states we contacted, a state agency conducted background checks for all jurisdictions within the state. In the other five Brady states (13 jurisdictions), local agencies were responsible for the background checks. Also, as noted in table 1.1, 14 of the 20 agencies we contacted were surveyed earlier by ATF for Treasury\u2019s interim report on Brady\u2019s impact.", "Brady does not require any reports from CLEOs or gun dealers. In fact, Congress has passed various statutory provisions that restrict the use of firearms-related information and prohibit the establishment of systems to register firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions. Thus, no data were readily available for monitoring national trends in handgun purchases and denials. Consequently, we relied on the voluntary cooperation and judgment of selected state and local law enforcement officials to provide data on the number and results of Brady background checks performed in their respective jurisdictions. We did not attempt to determine whether the denials were appropriate. For its initial Brady report, ATF had already developed cooperative working relationships with 16 CLEOs in 8 states. Thus, after first checking with ATF officials, we selected 14 of those 16 jurisdictions to build upon the already established relationships. We did not select Gwinnett County, Georgia, and Providence, Rhode Island, because those jurisdictions do not maintain cumulative data. Two of the 16 CLEOs selected by ATF have statewide (Kentucky and Ohio) responsibilities for performing background checks of prospective handgun buyers. In addition to selecting these two states, to provide broader coverage we also selected the other Brady states that have a centralized agency with statewide responsibility for performing background checks\u2014Arizona, Arkansas, Nevada, South Carolina, and West Virginia. Finally, because press accounts listed the Fort Worth, Texas, Police Department as having one of the highest handgun denial rates in the nation, we included that jurisdiction in our review, which resulted in a total of 20 jurisdictions.", "Then, from each of the 20 applicable law enforcement agencies, we obtained available data on the number of Brady handgun purchase forms processed and the number denied during the first year of Brady implementation, February 28, 1994, through February 28, 1995. We used this information to calculate jurisdiction-specific denial rates, as well as an overall denial rate for the 20 jurisdictions. Although we did not verify the accuracy of the data obtained, during our on-site visits to three jurisdictions\u2014Arkansas; South Carolina; and Fort Worth, Texas\u2014and in numerous follow-up telephone calls with the other 17 jurisdictions, we discussed the procedures for gathering and compiling the data and have no reason to believe the data are unreliable. However, the denial rates we calculated are not projectable beyond the jurisdictions covered.", "In contacting the law enforcement officials in these jurisdictions, we also inquired about the availability and completeness of databases to conduct background checks. Our inquiries included questions covering criminal history databases, as well as possible data sources covering drug users, illegal aliens, and other categories of ineligible purchasers. Regarding criminal history databases, for example, we were interested in what course of action was taken if the background search found incomplete records\u2014particularly records showing a felony arrest but not showing a disposition.", "Also, besides quantifying, we were interested in categorizing and analyzing the various reasons used by law enforcement officials in the 20 jurisdictions to deny handgun purchases. However, we found that only 15 of the jurisdictions maintained records (some more detailed than others) showing reasons for denials. Thus, our categorization and analysis of denial reasons is limited to these 15 jurisdictions\u20146 states, 3 counties, 2 parishes, and 4 cities. Moreover, only four of these jurisdictions\u2014two states, a county, and a city\u2014had sufficiently detailed information to allow us to quantify the number of felony-related denials involving violent crime convictions or indictments.", "Regarding follow-up enforcement actions on convicted felons and others who falsely complete Brady handgun purchase forms, we interviewed DOJ officials and reviewed documents prepared by DOJ officials responsible for establishing law enforcement policy guidance. From DOJ officials, as well as from ATF headquarters officials, we obtained available information on the number of cases referred to U.S. Attorneys by ATF field offices, the number declined for prosecution by U.S. Attorneys, and the number actually prosecuted by U.S. Attorneys. We then analyzed summary information provided by ATF on the prosecuted cases. The summary information covered the nature of the charges, the individuals\u2019 past criminal histories, and any resulting convictions and sentences. For example, we were interested in whether the defendants were charged only with lying on the Brady form, or whether form falsification was an ancillary charge added in with other charges. Similarly, we were interested in whether the defendants had criminal histories showing convictions for violent felonies. Finally, we were interested in the types of sentences received by convicted defendants.", "In studying implications of the various legal challenges to Brady, we first reviewed the applicable federal district court decisions. Then, to determine the Department of Justice\u2019s position on the legal challenges, we interviewed the Acting Assistant Attorney General, as well as his Special Counsel.", "Also, we interviewed staff from ATF\u2019s headquarters and Office of Chief Counsel as well as ATF officials in field offices encompassing jurisdictions in which CLEOs have challenged Brady. In so doing, we obtained information and views on (1) whether background checks have been or are being performed in those jurisdictions in which CLEOs have challenged Brady; (2) what ATF\u2019s statutory and/or operational responsibility is with respect to CLEOs and their performance of Brady background checks; (3) ATF\u2019s role with respect to the designation of alternate CLEOs to perform the Brady background checks; and (4) what actions, if any, ATF has taken regarding Brady background checks on prospective handgun buyers in the jurisdictions involved in the lawsuits.", "We conducted our review in Arkansas; Georgia; South Carolina; Texas; and Washington, D.C., from July 1994 through August 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The Justice Department, as well as Treasury and ATF jointly, provided written comments on a draft of this report. These comments are included in appendixes V and IV.

We calculated an average denial rate of 4.3 percent in 20 jurisdictions for the first year of Brady. In following up on reasons for denials, we determined that (1) most of the jurisdictions in our survey relied only on criminal history records and (2) comprehensive data on background check results were not available.

Moreover, Brady does not require either CLEOs or gun dealers to record and report Brady-related statistics. As a result, the accumulation of data on the volume of and the reasons for handgun purchase denials is left to the discretion of the applicable CLEOs. Consequently, attempts to study the results or impact of Brady are largely dependent upon the voluntary cooperation of the CLEOs responsible for conducting the background checks.", "To develop a systematic approach for monitoring Brady\u2019s impact on the acquisition and use of firearms, in September 1994 the Justice Department\u2019s Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) entered into an agreement with the Regional Justice Information Service (REJIS). Under the terms of the agreement, REJIS is designing an information system, called the Firearms Inquiries Statistical System, to routinely collect data from volunteer samples of the estimated 22,000 local law enforcement officers within the Brady states and from state criminal history repositories, the FBI, and ATF. The primary objectives of this information system are to (1) identify, describe, and categorize the procedures used to implement Brady; (2) measure results of Brady in terms of the number of applications accepted and denied, the reasons for the denials, and the actions taken as a result of the denials; and (3) create a database to permit analyses of the use of firearms in the commission of crimes. BJS officials anticipate that initial output under the system will be available in early 1996.", "In the interim, ATF has conducted two limited-scope surveys in selected Brady states.

Rather, state and local officials were expected to determine who would be designated as CLEOs for purposes of conducting presale background checks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Effects of Not Conducting Background Checks Are Unknown", "paragraphs": ["We tried to determine whether there have been any negative effects resulting from the absence of presale background checks of handgun purchasers residing in the two jurisdictions discussed above\u2014Iberia Parish, Louisiana, and Ravalli County, Montana. We wanted to determine, for example, whether any gun-related crimes had been committed\u2014with a handgun purchased on or after February 28, 1994 (the effective date of Brady)\u2014by any resident of these jurisdictions and, if so, whether the purchaser had a criminal history or other disqualifier identifiable by a routine background check.", "In response to our suggestion, ATF\u2019s National Tracing Center performed a computerized search of tracing requests received from law enforcement agencies. The search was designed to determine if any of the tracing requests involved crime scene handguns that had been purchased in either of the two jurisdictions after Brady\u2019s effective date. In structuring the computerized search, the National Tracing Center focused on all federally licensed dealers with postal address ZIP codes applicable to the two jurisdictions.", "As of July 25, 1995, the Center\u2019s search revealed that a total of seven crime-tainted handguns had been purchased from dealers within the two jurisdictions. Six of the handguns had been purchased in Iberia Parish and one in Ravalli County. However, all seven purchases were made before Brady went into effect on February 28, 1994. Thus, this search of tracing requests did not specifically identify any crime-related effects stemming from the lack of background checks in the two jurisdictions.", "On the other hand, since no background checks had been conducted in these two jurisdictions there is no assurance that ineligible persons did not purchase handguns from licensed dealers. Moreover, the Tracing Center\u2019s search covered only one jurisdiction in each state. Thus, the search did not cover the possibility that residents of one county or parish may have purchased handguns in another county or parish in their state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The effects of the legal challenges to Brady are not entirely clear because the cases are being appealed. The federal district courts have ruled in five of six cases decided as of July 1995 that CLEOs cannot be required to perform background checks. However, the decisions found the remainder of Brady\u2019s provisions severable and that they, therefore, remained operative.", "In September 1995, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld the constitutionality of Brady, reversing the judgments of the Arizona and Montana district courts. The appeals court reasoned that the phase I background check provision is a minimal burden that the federal government can impose on state and local law enforcement agencies Background checks were being conducted in seven of the nine jurisdictions where CLEOs had challenged Brady. In the other two jurisdictions, no checks were being conducted. We did not determine whether this lack of background checks resulted in handgun purchases by ineligible individuals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In its written comments, DOJ said the fact that local law enforcement officials are not subject to criminal prosecution does not mean there is no way to compel them to fulfill their responsibilities under Brady.

We have added this point to our discussion.", "In their combined written comments, Treasury and ATF suggested that we add language indicating that the federal district court decisions were limited to the plaintiff sheriffs only and that other CLEOs in surrounding jurisdictions were still subject to Brady\u2019s phase I background check provision. While the McGee and Romero district court decisions were limited to the plaintiff sheriffs, the Mack, Printz, and Frank district court decisions did not contain such a limitation. For example, the Frank decision enjoined \u201cthe United States from enforcing that provision in the District of Vermont,\u201d the Mack decision ordered \u201cthat defendant United States of America and its agents are permanently enjoined from further enforcing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(s)(2),\u201d and the Printz decision enjoined \u201cthe United States from enforcing said provision.\u201d", "Also, Treasury and ATF commented that the number of jurisdictions affected by the legal challenges to Brady is very small compared to overall enforcement of the act. Further, we and the agencies pointed out that the federal appeals court decision overturned two of the five district court decisions against Brady, and the appeals were pending in the remaining three cases as of October 1995."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
