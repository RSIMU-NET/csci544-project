At the time, the Department believed that the thousands of systems and numerous administrative and mission-related processessupporting DOD functions were redundant and inefficient and that they should be standardized and made more efficient. To address these problems, Defense planned to simplify and improve business processes; centralize responsibility and authority in functional areas, such as finance, personnel, communications, health affairs, logistics, command and control, and intelligence; and develop an integrated communications and data processing infrastructure based on departmentwide standards.", "From the outset, DOD recognized that implementing CIM would be difficult because the basic tenet of the initiative\u2014managing and implementing business improvements and building corporate systems along functional lines\u2014represented a major shift in the way Defense traditionally did business. Whereas each military and Defense agency had historically managed its own business functions and information systems, CIM called on senior functional officials, known as Principal Staff Assistants (PSAs),together with their Defense component counterparts to be responsible for implementing improvements and information systems within the Department\u2019s business functions across service and agency lines.", "As CIM was implemented, Defense emphasized two ways of achieving process improvements and addressing problems associated with its disparate and stovepiped information technology environment. The first was to improve, or reengineer, business processes first and then apply technology to the new processes. The second involved selecting the best DOD information systems from pools of existing, or legacy, systems that provide similar automated support services and eventually replacing the duplicative systems with the best systems. A few years into the CIM effort, this became known as migration. Defense believed that if done properly, migration could cut costs associated with developing and maintaining disparate systems supporting the same functions. It also believed that migration would help to standardize business processes and allow Defense to achieve savings that could be put to better use in advancing warfighting capabilities. Figure 1.1 illustrates how migration would work in one functional area.", "For its finance and accounting functions, Defense's goal is to reduce the number of systems from the 324 that the services and agencies operated in 1991 to 32 systems.", "As of the end of fiscal year 1996, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service's strategic plan stated it had reduced the number of finance and accounting systems to 217.", "The migration strategy for accounting and finance is to  (1) identify a single migration system for each of the Department's finance and accounting functions, such as civilian pay, (2) standardize the procedures and practices used to perform these functions, and (3) migrate from existing service-unique systems to the migration systems.", "For some of these functions, such as general fund accounting, Defense established a two-pronged approach: (1) migrate initially to a single interim system or set of systems within (2) migrate from the service systems to a departmentwide system or set of systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Migration Has Become the Focal Point for CIM", "paragraphs": ["While Defense began CIM emphasizing the need to improve, or reengineer, processes before applying technology, it ended up placing more priority on obtaining quick savings through an accelerated migration strategy, which began in October 1993. This strategy called for selection of migration systems in 6 months and departmentwide transition to selected systems in the following 3 years. Defense believed that setting tight time frames for migration with some potential slippage would allow it to \u201charvest the low-hanging fruit\u201d of potential savings before reengineering. By default, this meant that the increased emphasis on migration would postpone the dramatic gains that could be achieved through reengineering.", "The risks involved with postponing reengineering efforts were significant. Reengineering identifies, analyzes, and redesigns an organization\u2019s core business processes, aiming to achieve dramatic improvements in critical areas of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed. It focuses on redesigning the business process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to an organization and its customers. Migration, on the other hand, focuses on standardizing existing processes and information systems. This can yield some benefits, such as reducing the need to maintain disparate systems that support the same functions, but seldom yields dramatic improvements. In addition, if the process is inefficient or outmoded, migration only serves to perpetuate a bad process. Finally, choosing migration before reengineering may cause future reengineering efforts to be more difficult by entrenching inefficient and ineffective work processes.", "We raised these concerns both before and after Defense decided to embark on the accelerated migration strategy. We believed that the shift in emphasis toward migration seriously endangered CIM\u2019s chances for success. For this reason, and because CIM-related technology investments, which are expected to total billions of dollars each year, are vulnerable to waste and mismanagement, we designated CIM as a high-risk government information technology initiative. Nevertheless, Defense proceeded to concentrate on migration even in areas where it had recognized that there was a significant need to change business processes. One such area was transportation. We reported in 1996 that even though Defense recognized that its military transportation processes were fragmented, outdated, inefficient, and costly, it focused on technology solutions rather than the need to identify and correct the root causes of its transportation problems.", "Because reengineering took a backseat to migration in other business areas as well, CIM has never been able to achieve the level of cost savings and process improvements originally intended. A recent reportconducted by RAND, a consulting organization, notes that \u201cThe CIM effort is today widely viewed as a failure in most quarters of the DOD. It has not resulted in either significant process reengineering or visible savings in the hardware and software required to support all the varied information systems in the Defense infrastructure.\u201d", "Defense is still planning to invest at least $18 billion in its migration effort from fiscal years 1995 through 2000.

Defense has identified 1,938 legacy systems for potential termination. As of April 1996, its Defense Integration Support Tools (DIST) database showed that 281 had already been terminated, 886 were scheduled for termination by the year 2000, and 771 more were identified for potential elimination after the year 2000.", "Table 1.1 provides the number of systems selected by each functional area, the number of legacy systems identified for potential termination, and DOD\u2019s estimated costs of developing, deploying, and maintaining the migration systems. We excluded costs for 27 systems for which DOD collected costs because the systems were classified.

Defense prepared this report in response to a requirement in Section 366 of the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1996. We also obtained and analyzed a copy of the DIST database as of April 1996 that Defense used to develop the report to the Congress, as well as to provide its own senior managers information on migration system selections and legacy system terminations. Additionally, we reviewed\u2014but did not independently verify\u2014cost information that Defense reported to Congress as part of the April 1996 Section 366 report. We also interviewed senior DOD officials to determine if additional cost and performance information on migration systems existed at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) level.", "We assessed the reliability of the data presented to the Congress in two ways. First, we identified missing and conflicting information in the April 1996 Section 366 report to the Congress and requested that the ASD C3I staff to clarify conflicting information. Second, we compared the data reported to the Congress for three functional activities (business areas)\u2014Transportation, Civilian Personnel, and Clinical Health\u2014against data provided to us by the functional area managers at these activities. We then established and analyzed a database containing schedule and available cost information for the migration and legacy systems and modified the database to reflect updated schedule, costs, and other descriptive data Defense provided to us during the course of the audit.", "To assess Defense\u2019s management control and oversight processes for migration systems to determine whether the investments are economically justified and comply with Defense technical and data standards, we reviewed the department-level management and oversight processes for approving the PSAs\u2019 migration system selections and for overseeing major migration systems\u2019 acquisitions by the Major Automated Information System Review Council (MAISRC). Our review did not focus on the process by which the PSAs select, develop, and manage their migration systems.", "Nor did we examine acquisition review processes within the individual functional areas employed for nonmajor system projects.", "To analyze Defense\u2019s oversight processes for reviewing and approving the PSAs\u2019 migration system selections, we reviewed department-level approval of the PSAs\u2019 selections. We obtained a list of migration systems that PSAs had selected for their functional areas. We then visited the Office of the ASD C3I and the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) and reviewed the business case analysis documentation, technical analysis documentation, and other documentation provided to those offices for department-level approval of the PSA\u2019s migration and interim system selections. We also interviewed officials from the Office of the ASD C3I, DISA, and the offices of selected PSAs regarding the documentation supporting the selections.", "To review Defense\u2019s acquisition oversight processes for major migration systems, we first identified the major migration systems, as defined by Defense regulations. We then obtained and analyzed the progress reports and other documentation provided to MAISRC for those systems. We also interviewed Defense representatives and officials responsible for information systems oversight in the Office of the ASD C3I and offices of DISA, the Defense Acquisition Board (DAB), MAISRC, and Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E). We also interviewed representatives of the program offices or oversight offices for selected systems for which oversight had been delegated by MAISRC. Through document reviews and interviews, we determined whether economic analyses for major migration systems had been independently reviewed and if so, whether the reviews had identified problems in the analyses. We also determined whether DOD guidance existed on preparing economic analyses for information systems. A GAO economist met with PA&E analysts, reviewed problems that were identified with economic analyses, and verified the validity of the problems reported.", "Additionally, we determined whether MAISRC had information on alternative analyses performed for major migration system selections. Lastly, we determined whether MAISRC has sufficient oversight information to ensure that major migration systems are complying with applicable technical and data standards that are necessary to achieve an interoperable systems environment.", "We reviewed Defense\u2019s policies and guidance for migration systems to ensure that information technology is acquired, managed, and used in the most efficient and effective manner.

First, in developing standard systems within functional areas, the Department had to carefully consider complex technical issues, such as interfacing migration systems with other systems and contending with nonstandard data formats and definitions. For Defense, such complexities were compounded by its sheer size and the numbers of disparate systems. We believe an even tougher obstacle facing Defense, however, was the prevailing culture, which was based on decentralized department organizational structure, nonstandard processes and procedures. In general, each military service and Defense agency has historically managed its own business functions and information technology projects, whereas CIM and migration required business improvements and information systems to be managed on a Departmentwide, or corporate basis.", "Therefore, to ensure the strategy\u2019s success, it was vital for Defense to establish an effective decision-making and oversight environment for making migration investments. It would need controls and processes that ensured inefficient administrative and mission-related work processes were modernized before significant technology investments were made to support them. It would also need controls that ensured that the migration projects themselves were effectively managed as investments so that the Department could target resources and attention to priority areas and stop those projects that failed to meet their goals. Finally, Defense needed life cycle management controls that ensured, on a system-by-system basis, that sound management and development practices were followed.", "However, Defense\u2019s primary corporate-level control mechanism for ensuring that sound management and development practices were followed for each migration investment has not been effective. This control requires that all selections to be submitted for approval by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (ASD C3I), who is also the Department\u2019s Chief Information Officer (CIO). In approving the systems, the Assistant Secretary is to review data, technical, and programmatic factors relating to the selection. We found, however, that most migration selections never came in for this approval and those that did were approved in the absence of critical technical and programmatic supporting documents. (A description of the migration decision process is provided in appendix II.)", "Because this control was playing a marginal role in ensuring the success of migration, we assessed whether Defense\u2019s acquisition oversight processes\u2014which are designed to augment management oversight for the Department\u2019s most expensive information systems\u2014were helping to ensure that the major migration investments were economically and technically sound. These processes have also broken down where migration is concerned. Had there been more rigorous attention to oversight in both areas, Defense may well have avoided the migration problems we identified in previous reviews that cost the Department hundreds of millions of dollars.", "In implementing the migration strategy, Defense did not ensure that it had adequate visibility over status, costs, and progress. As a result, it has not been able to (1) demonstrate whether the migration strategy has been successful, (2) provide the Congress with accurate and reliable information needed for oversight purposes, and (3) provide its own decisionmakers at the headquarters level with information needed to oversee the strategy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Systems Not Approved by Defense\u2019s Senior Technology Manager", "paragraphs": ["After selecting a migration system, the Principal Staff Assistant (PSA)responsible for a functional area is to submit the system for approval by the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence\u2014the Senior Information Management Official and Chief Information Officer in DOD. In his memorandum setting forth the requirements for selecting and reviewing migration systems, the ASD C3I stated that in approving the selections, he would consider data, technical, and programmatic factors. For example, the ASD C3I review would include such issues as whether the migration systems will lend themselves to data sharing and whether they conform to DOD\u2019s technical standards\u2014which act as a set of \u201cbuilding codes\u201d for constructing systems to ensure they will be compatible with its information infrastructure and technically interoperable with each other. This approval is important because, as the Department\u2019s Chief Information Officer, the Assistant Secretary needs to ensure that the migration systems help facilitate the sharing of information across service and agency lines.", "However, both the PSAs and the ASD C3I did not adhere to this oversight process. First, 245 selections, or about 67 percent, were never submitted for this oversight even though all 363 system selections should have  been.4, 5 Of the 49 major, or large scale, migration systems, only 16 were submitted for this review. Thus, for the bulk of migration systems, the Assistant Secretary was unable to ensure that Defense technical standards would be met and that the best system development practices were being followed.", "Nine of the systems that were submitted for approval were grandfathered into approval because development for them was well underway at the time the accelerated migration system strategy began in 1993.", "Forty-two of the systems that were approved by the ASD C3I as migration systems did not follow DOD\u2019s migration system approval process described in appendix II.

The reviews involve assessing such matters as whether the proposed system is being developed in accordance with Defense policies, procedures, and regulations; whether the systems\u2019 program managers took steps to minimize the cost of a new system by ensuring full and open competition; and whether the program managers will effectively use advanced system design and software engineering technology to minimize software and maintenance costs.", "However, these reviews have not been effective for the migration effort.

If done properly, it can enable reviewers to determine whether DOD has sufficient funds in its budget to pay for the system, that is, whether the system is affordable. It can also reveal potential conflicts between available funding and the planned schedule for deployments. To arrive at these conclusions, the economic analysis establishes baseline life-cycle costs and benefit estimates for the project and calculates the project\u2019s return on investment.", "The importance of developing complete and accurate economic analyses is underscored by several governmentwide requirements. For example, the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Circular A-130, Management of Federal Information Resources, calls on agencies \u201cto conduct benefit-cost analyses to support ongoing management oversight processes that maximize return on investment and minimize financial and operational risks for investments in major information systems on an agencywide basis.\u201d Likewise, OMB\u2019s Circular A-11, Part 3, Planning Budgeting and Acquisition of Fixed Assets, (July 16, 1996), and its Bulletin No. 95-03, Planning and Budgeting for the Acquisition of Fixed Assets, state that \u201cthe planning for fixed asset acquisitions should be based on a systematic analysis of expected benefits and costs.\u201d", "However, even though economic analyses play a critical role in assessing whether system development efforts will be cost-effective and beneficial, Defense has not yet established a set of minimum standards that an economic analysis must meet to be considered valid. In addition, it has not published official guidance for preparing an economic analysis. PA&E developed and published an unofficial economic analysis guide that recommended, but did not require, standard methods and formats for preparing an economic analysis for an information system development/modernization project. According to a PA&E representative, this unofficial guide is no longer adequate because it does not require the degree of standardization in methodology and analytic techniques needed to support a portfolio management approach for managing information technology investments, as required by the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. For example, the guide does not require that returns on investment for systems development/modernization projects be calculated in a standard manner using a standard definition. This lack of standardization results in economic analyses for different systems that are not comparable enough for DOD managers to have a good basis for deciding which systems offer the highest payoffs. The PA&E official stated that in conjunction with DOD\u2019s implementation of a portfolio management approach, it plans to officially publish appropriate documents and provide minimum standards and guidance for the economic analyses process.", "Our review also found that DOD decisionmakers do not view economic analyses as key tools for deciding whether to invest in an information system development or modernization project. As a result, DOD often lacks complete and accurate information on system development/modernization projects\u2019 estimated costs and benefits at the time decisions are made to invest in the projects. Specifically, as the following examples show, we found that (1) economic analyses for many systems have not been submitted for independent review and (2) a significant portion of those that were submitted were inadequately prepared. Thus, many of the benefits that could be derived from this tool have not been realized.", "Twelve of the 43 major migration systems have not yet submitted an economic analysis, or an update of a previously prepared economic analysis, for independent review. These systems were under development or modernization and DOD had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in them in total. These included 5 systems that were under direct MAISRC oversight and 7 systems for which MAISRC delegated oversight responsibility to a service or agency. These 12 systems, or components of them, are all in the second development phase or beyond. Delaying the preparation or updating of a previously prepared economic analysis to the later stages of development for these 12 systems defeats the purpose of the economic analysis, which is to demonstrate that a proposal to invest in a new system is valid before that investment is made.", "Four systems that were under direct MAISRC oversight, were in the first development phase\u2014concept exploration\u2014and were, therefore, not yet required by DOD\u2019s acquisition regulations to submit an economic analysis or an update of a previously prepared economic analysis for independent review. Although these four systems were technically in compliance with Defense\u2019s acquisition regulations, DOD had already made major investments in them without the benefit of knowing whether returns on investment are going to be acceptable.", "Even though Defense has not established standards for the required analyses, Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) staff who review the economic analyses that are under direct MAISRC oversight told us that 10 of the 19 economic analyses reviewed had problems. These problems included the following:", "Understating or omitting the costs of standardizing data, implementing the standard data in the systems, and developing system interfaces.", "Failing to estimate the amount of savings expected for terminating duplicative legacy systems.", "Relying on professional judgment to make unsupported assumptions rather than making objective analyses to estimate the value of benefits and costs. For example, in one case, the economic analysis estimated a cost avoidance associated with replacing an old system by assuming that both the old and the replacement systems\u2019 software maintenance costs could be accurately estimated using two different rates per line of code, but the analysis provided no data supporting the validity of either rate.", "After identifying problems with these 10 economic analyses, PA&E staff worked with MAISRC analysts and the systems\u2019 program managers to address the problems. However, DOD continued to develop the systems in spite of the fact that the investments had not been justified by complete and accurate economic analyses.", "PA&E analysts told us that there were other problems that impeded their review and verification of the economic analyses. For example, economic analyses are often not updated and provided to PA&E for review after major changes occur in the project, such as significant cost growth or redirection of the project. A second problem is that economic analyses are often not supported by analyses of alternatives that weigh the cost and benefits of various technical options, such as whether to buy commercial off-the-shelf software or develop a system in-house. This analysis would help Defense decisionmakers make sound decisions on whether the proposed alternatives offer sufficient military or economic benefits to be worth their cost, and to determine which alternative is the best approach. It would also identify alternatives that DOD may want to reconsider at a later time if the selected approach runs into difficulties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Acquisition Oversight Organizations Lack Assurance That Major Systems Comply With Technical and Data Standards", "paragraphs": ["Defense has established several sets of standards that are designed to ensure that systems developed are compatible with its communications and computing infrastructure and that they are technically interoperable with each other. Some Defense leaders consider systems interoperability and the ability to exchange data across functional lines to be the most important consideration in migration system development, transcending economic benefits. These standards include the Technical Architecture Framework for Information Management (TAFIM), Defense Information Infrastructure Common Operating Environment (DII COE), and DOD standard data. DOD system acquisition directives call on MAISRC and DAB to ensure that program managers comply with the Department\u2019s policies and procedures and use best practices in developing and modernizing individual information systems. These best practices include building systems and databases that comply with applicable technical standards and use DOD standard data.", "However, MAISRC and DAB do not have adequate assurance that the major migration systems are complying with applicable technical standards and are using standard data. For example, out of 43 major systems under MAISRC oversight, program managers reported to MAISRC that (1) only 19 were in compliance with the TAFIM standards or had plans to comply with the TAFIM standards and (2) 9 systems were using DOD standard data or had plans to use standard data. We found similar results for compliance with DII COE standards. Specifically, program managers reported that only 25 systems were in compliance or had plans to be in compliance with DII COE. These self-reports by program managers are questionable because they are not independently verified.", "In addition to obtaining information on technical and data standards directly from program managers, MAISRC and DAB also obtain such information from the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA). DISA supports MAISRC and DAB oversight of major systems by performing technical reviews of system documentation to determine if it indicates that interoperability issues are being addressed or will be addressed as the system is developed. According to a DISA representative, DISA reviewed system documentation that had been prepared for 37 of the 43 MAISRC migration systems and all 6 of the DAB systems and found that the documentation indicated interoperability issues were planned to be addressed for each of them.", "DISA also provides feedback, advice, and assistance on interoperability and related issues during integrated product team meetings with MAISRC, DAB, and system program managers. During these meetings and on other occasions when it is asked to do so, DISA provides MAISRC and DAB general information on compliance with standards, such as whether the major systems\u2019 program managers have contacted DISA and appear to be making reasonable attempts to bring their systems into compliance with applicable standards. DISA also assists program managers in developing strategies and cost estimates for achieving compliance with standards.", "However, DISA does not regularly report detailed information to MAISRC and DAB that would enable these oversight organizations to ensure that each major system is adequately complying with applicable technical and data standards. For example, DISA does not regularly report to MAISRC and DAB such detailed information as (1) each system\u2019s current compliance with applicable standards\u2014that is, each system\u2019s current status relative to the eight levels that DOD has defined for the DII COE, and each system\u2019s number and percentage of data elements that have been approved as DOD data standards in the Defense Data Dictionary System, (2) whether each program office prepared sound strategies, schedules, and cost estimates for achieving compliance with applicable standards, (3) whether each system\u2019s compliance strategy and cost estimate were approved by DISA, (4) each system\u2019s current schedule and cost status for achieving compliance compared with its baseline schedule and cost estimate, and (5) whether each system has been independently certified by DISA\u2019s Joint Interoperability Testing Command to be in compliance with the technical and data standards. MAISRC analysts responsible for overseeing the major migration systems confirmed that they did not know many of the systems\u2019 current status regarding compliance with applicable technical standards and use of DOD standard data, or whether the program managers had developed and were following sound strategies for bringing the systems into compliance.", "The technical and data standards are supposed to help pave the way to an interoperable systems environment.

These findings are highlighted as follows.", "In reviewing the depot maintenance standard system migration effort, we found that Defense did not address the full costs of developing interfaces needed to allow system components to exchange data with information systems currently used by the services to accomplish their missions. One official estimated that this represented $70 million in costs.In analyzing what it would cost to develop its Standard Accounting and Reporting System (STARS), we reported that Defense neglected to consider internal project management costs and costs to enhance all of the STARS components to bring them into compliance with DOD\u2019s standard general ledger, key accounting requirements, and the standard budget and accounting classification code.", "In reviewing the transportation migration effort, we found that Defense did not include all costs associated with its evaluation of in-house systems when analyzing costs and savings for its 28 migration systems. These included $16 million for its analysis of candidate migration systems and $2 million for maintaining migration system hardware. We also found that if these costs were included in its systems selection analyses, Defense would have found that the overall return on investment would have decreased and that it may actually lose money on its investment.", "In previous reviews, we also found that Defense functional areas did not adequately consider other alternatives to developing systems in-house. For example, while the transportation area reviewed commercial off-the-shelf transportation software projects for some transportation business areas, this review was inadequate because it did not (1) analyze the degree to which unmodified software could meet unique Defense requirements, (2) identify the expected cost to make necessary software modifications, (3) determine the time required to make the modifications, and (4) provide for a hands-on view of the software in operation. In addition, Defense concluded that software packages that could provide some degree of transportation functionality would require modifications that were too costly. However, Defense could not provide documented analysis to support this conclusion. Further, Defense planned on making $13 million worth of software modifications to just five of its in-house selections. We believe better oversight by the CIO (then referred to as the Senior Information Management Official) may well have forced greater consideration of commercial packages in the transportation area.", "Finally, our review of Defense\u2019s effort to develop a standard suite of migration systems for materiel management showed that the Department spent hundreds of millions of dollars without achieving the expected benefits because it did not adequately anticipate and mitigate risks. From 1992 to late 1995, Defense spent about $714 million developing standard systems with minimal results. During that time, there were dramatic changes in the goals and expectations for the program and only one application was partially deployed. Because of changes in objectives and scheduling and problems in development, prospects for achieving the original objective of implementing a standard suite of integrated materiel management systems appeared dim.", "In 1996, Defense finally abandoned its strategy to develop a standard suite of materiel management systems because of funding cuts, cost overruns, and schedule delays and embarked on a new strategy that involved individual deployment of nine system applications at selected sites as the applications were developed. However, the decision to drastically change the course of the strategy was initiated without first conducting critical economic and risk assessments that would estimate the costs, benefits, and risks of alternative strategies and having the analyses independently reviewed by MAISRC and PA&E.

In 1995, the House Committee on National Security directed Defense to reevaluate its measures. In March of 1997, a Defense working group proposed a revised set of performance measures relating to migration systems and other information technology issues within the Department.

But, when accounting for costs for the systems, DOD does not factor in the cost to maintain this oversight responsibility.

As we reported in May 1996, attackers have seized control of entire Defense systems, many of which support critical functions, such as weapons systems research and development, logistics, and finance. Attackers have also stolen, modified, and destroyed data and software. In addition, Defense needs its CIO to help ensure that Year 2000 corrections are made to all of DOD\u2019s information systems. If systems are not corrected on time, the impact on Defense operations could be widespread, costly, and debilitating to important warfighting and administrative operations. While DOD has delegated year 2000 responsibility to its components, it still needs to ensure, at the department level, that sufficient priority and resources are being devoted to the problem and that all systems have been identified and corrected.", "There is also a direct conflict of responsibilites between the oversight and programmatic obligations associated with the two positions.

For example, at the oversight level, systems that clearly lacked key pieces of technical, programmatic, and economic justification were allowed to go forward. At the decision-making level, many functional areas did not even bother to submit their systems or analyses that supported their decisions to department-level oversight controls. If they were effectively followed, the life-cycle management controls would have helped ensure that sound business and development practices were followed for the migration systems.", "Perhaps, the greatest challenge to successful operation, however, will be operating in an organizational environment that has resisted departmentwide oversight and visibility over information resources.

When we found that these policies were not executed as intended, we turned to the Department\u2019s acquisition review process, which should have supplemented oversight for the major migration systems. However, even here, we found that DOD for the most part, was not providing sufficient assurance that migration investments were worthwhile. Specifically, we found that controls that Defense built into this process would not ensure success.", "In addition, the migration strategy is a high-risk endeavor because it requires Defense to carefully consider complex technical issues that are compounded by the sheer size of the Department, the number of disparate systems, and the prevailing culture, which promotes stovepiped systems solutions and hampers departmentwide oversight or visibility over information resources. As such, the success of the strategy hinges on whether practical and sound management practices\u2014such as conducting economic, risk, and alternative analyses and providing rigorous oversight over the selection process\u2014are followed. As we note in the report, these practices are required by executive branch policies; congressional reform initiatives, including the Clinger-Cohen Act, which took effect August 8, 1996; and/or Defense regulations. Under the Clinger-Cohen Act, for example, Defense is required to implement a process for selecting information technology investments using specific criteria for comparing and ranking alternative information system projects. The best practices on which the act is based have shown that to ensure the success of an investment process, top executives need to make funding decisions based on factors such as cost, risk, return on investment, and support of mission-related outcomes. Thus, unless Defense promptly embraces the need to develop and review economic, risk, and alternative analyses, it stands little chance of successfully implementing the Clinger-Cohen Act.", "In its comments, Defense also expressed concern that the scope of our report was unnecessarily broader than it was when we began our review. We were originally asked for information on the status and cost of the migration effort. However, when we found that Defense could not provide accurate and reliable information on migration or convincingly demonstrate whether the strategy has been successful, our congressional requester asked that we review whether Defense\u2019s management control and oversight processes for migration were ensuring that the investments are economically sound and complied with technical and data standards. We reviewed the reliability of the acquisition process controls over migration investments because they are the leading Defense-recognized controls over major investments. Our congressional requester also asked that we focus on DOD\u2019s implementation of the Clinger-Cohen Act because it offered a chance for DOD to bring meaningful reform to the management of migration and other information technology investments. Many information technology investments for systems in the Department are, in fact, migration systems.", "Finally, Defense\u2019s comments on our report identify a number of other disagreements with our findings and conclusions. We reviewed these comments, incorporated them into our report where appropriate, and followed up with Defense on additional information it provided after submitting its response to us."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
