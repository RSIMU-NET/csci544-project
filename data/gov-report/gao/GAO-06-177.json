In 2000, Congress enacted the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act to compensate those individuals who have developed cancer or other specified diseases related to on-the-job exposure to radiation and other hazards at these work sites. Under Subtitle B, determining the eligibility of claimants for compensation is a complex process, involving several federal agencies and a reconstruction of the historical evidence available. The Department of Labor must consider a claimant's case based on records of his or her employment and work activities, which are provided by the Department of Energy. Labor considers the compensability of certain claims by relying on estimates of the likely radiation levels to which particular workers were exposed. These \"dose reconstructions\" are developed by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). NIOSH also compiles information in \"site profiles\" about the radiation protection practices and hazardous materials used at various plants and facilities, which helps complete the dose reconstructions. Because certain facilities are known to have exposed employees to radiation while keeping few records of individuals' exposure, their employees have been designated under the law as members of a \"special exposure cohort,\" and their claims may be paid without individual dose reconstructions. The law also allows the Secretary of HHS to add additional groups of employees to the special exposure cohort. For quality control and to raise public confidence in the fairness of the claims process, the compensation act also created a citizen's advisory board of scientists, physicians, and employee representatives--the President's Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health.

In addition, the designated federal officer for the advisory board, who is responsible for scheduling and attending board meetings, was the director of the dose reconstruction program being reviewed. The progress of the contracted review of NIOSH's site profiles and dose reconstructions has been hindered by the complexity of the work.

The law also allows the Secretary  of HHS to add additional groups of employees to the special exposure  cohort.", "For quality control and to raise public confidence in the fairness of the  claims process, the compensation act also created a citizen\u2019s advisory  board of scientists, physicians, and employee representatives\u2014the  President\u2019s Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. Members of  the board serve part-time and the board has limited staff support. The  advisory board is tasked to review the scientific validity and quality of  NIOSH\u2019s dose reconstructions and advise the Secretary of HHS. The board  has the flexibility to determine the scope and methodology for this review.  In addition, the advisory board is tasked with reviewing NIOSH\u2019s  evaluation of petitions for special exposure cohort status and  recommending whether such status should be granted. To facilitate the  advisory board\u2019s review, HHS awarded a 5-year $3 million contract to  Sanford Cohen & Associates (SC&A) in October 2003 to perform a variety  of tasks, such as examining selected site profiles and a sample of dose  reconstructions.  The contract awarded was an indefinite-delivery,  indefinite-quantity type of contract, which establishes the basic terms of  the contract but then allows the advisory board to develop specific task  orders requiring the contractor to complete certain tasks within specified  time frames and budgets. SC&A is to be reimbursed for its costs and  receive an additional fixed fee. However, this effort has been marked by  delays and higher than originally anticipated costs and some concerns  over the roles of the federal officials assigned by the Secretary of HHS to  oversee this work. Because citizen advisory bodies do not have direct  authority to spend federal monies, the government is responsible for  awarding and managing support contracts. Insofar as the charge of the  advisory board has been not merely to advise but to review the scientific  validity and quality of NIOSH\u2019s work, there could potentially be a conflict  of roles for agency officials responsible for the program under review if  they also oversee the contract work or assist the advisory board. In  addition, there are congressional concerns about whether the advisory  board is using the contractor\u2019s expertise as the board evaluates special  exposure cohort petitions.", "There is another contractor\u2014Oak Ridge Associated Universities  (ORAU)\u2014that also plays an important role in the Energy Employees  Occupational Illness Compensation Program. In September 2002, NIOSH  awarded a 5-year contract to ORAU to support NIOSH in performing its  responsibilities related to the program, such as developing site profiles  and performing dose reconstructions.  About $70 million was originally  allocated to this contract, but this figure had increased to over $200  million by 2004.", "We assessed how well the advisory board\u2019s review and the contracted  work with SC&A are proceeding. We focused on three questions: (1) Are  the roles of key federal officials involved in the review of NIOSH\u2019s dose  reconstructions sufficiently independent to assure the objectivity of the  review? (2) Have the agency\u2019s management controls and the advisory  board\u2019s oversight been sufficient to ensure that the contract to review site  profiles and dose reconstructions is adequately carried out? and (3) Is the  advisory board using the contractor\u2019s expertise in reviewing special  exposure cohort petitions?", "To perform our review, we analyzed pertinent contract-related materials,  including the contract; monthly progress reports submitted by the  contractor; minutes of advisory board meetings; special exposure cohort  regulations; and correspondence between the contractor, agency, and  advisory board. In addition, we interviewed agency officials, contractor  officials, and advisory board members, and also attended meetings of the  advisory board. The scope of our work did not include examining NIOSH\u2019s  contract with ORAU. We conducted our review from March 2005 to  November 2005 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. On December 13, 2005, we briefed your office on the  results of our work (see app. I). This report conveys the information  provided at that briefing, as updated to reflect changes we made in  response to comments received on a draft of this report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Summary of Findings", "paragraphs": ["The roles of certain key federal officials initially involved in the advisory  board\u2019s review of the dose reconstructions may not have been sufficiently  independent and actions were taken to replace these officials.

Initially, the project officer assigned responsibility for reviewing the  monthly progress reports and monitoring the technical performance of the  contractor was also a manager of the NIOSH dose reconstruction program  being reviewed. In addition, the designated federal officer for the advisory  board, who is responsible for scheduling and attending board meetings,  was the director of the dose reconstruction program being reviewed. In  response to concerns about the appearance of conflicting roles, the  director of NIOSH replaced both of these officials in December 2004 with a  senior NIOSH official not involved in the NIOSH program under review.  The contractor and members of the board told us that implementation of  the contract improved after these replacements were made. With regard to  structural independence, we found it appropriate that the contracting  officers, who are responsible for managing the contract on behalf of the  advisory board, have been federal officials with the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC), NIOSH\u2019s parent agency. The contracting  officers do not have responsibilities for the NIOSH program under review  and are not accountable to its managers. Members of the advisory board  helped facilitate the independence of the contractor\u2019s work by playing the  leading role in developing and approving the initial statement of work for  the contractor and the independent cost estimate for the contract.", "The progress of the contracted review of NIOSH\u2019s site profiles and dose  reconstructions has been hindered by the complexity of the work.  Specifically, in the first 2 years, the contractor spent almost 90 percent of  the $3 million that had been allocated to the contract for a 5-year  undertaking. Various adjustments have been made in the review approach  in light of the identified complexities, which were not initially understood.   However, further improvements could be made in the oversight and  planning of the review process. First, the contractor\u2019s expenditure levels  were not adequately monitored by the agency in the initial months and the  contractor\u2019s monthly progress reports did not provide sufficient details on  the level of work completed compared to funds expended.  The monthly  report for each individual task order was subsequently revised to provide  more details but developing more integrated data across the various tasks  could further improve the board\u2019s ability to track the progress of the  overall review. Second, while the advisory board has made mid-course  adjustments to the contractor\u2019s task orders and review procedures, the  board has not comprehensively reexamined its long-term plan for the  overall project. The board revised the task orders for the contractor  several times, in part to reflect adjustments made as the board gained a  deeper understanding of the needs of the project.  Nonetheless, the board  has not reexamined its original plan for the total number of site profile and  dose reconstruction reviews needed, and the time frames and funding  levels for completing them. Third, there is still a gap with regard to  management controls for the resolution of the findings and  recommendations that emerge from SC&A\u2019s review. The advisory board  developed a six-step resolution process to help resolve technical issues  between the contractor and NIOSH, and this process uses matrices to  track the findings and recommendations of the contractor and advisory  board.  However, NIOSH currently lacks a system for documenting that  changes it agrees to make as part of this resolution process are  implemented.", "With regard to reviewing special exposure cohort petitions, the advisory  board has asked for and received the contractor\u2019s assistance, expanded its  charge, and acknowledged the need for the board to review the petitions  in a timely manner.

These  experiences have prompted the board to make various adjustments to the  contractor\u2019s work that are intended to better meet the needs of the review,  such as the establishment of a formal six-step resolution process that  increases transparency. Nonetheless, further improvements could be made  to the oversight and planning of the contracted review. Even though the  advisory board has made numerous midcourse adjustments to the work of  the contractor, the board has not comprehensively reexamined its long- term plan for the project to determine whether the plan needs to be  modified in light of the knowledge gained over the past few years.  In  addition, while the contractor\u2019s monthly reports were modified to provide  more detailed expenditure data, the lack of integrated and comprehensive  data across the various tasks makes it more difficult for the advisory board  to track the progress of the overall review or make adjustments to funding  or deliverables across tasks. Finally, without a system to track the actions  taken by NIOSH in response to the findings and recommendations of the  advisory board and contractor, there is no assurance that any needed  improvements are being made."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making three recommendations to the Secretary of HHS.", "To assist the advisory board meet its statutory responsibilities, we  recommend that the Secretary of HHS  (1) direct the contracting and project officers to develop and share with  the advisory board more integrated and comprehensive data on contractor  spending levels compared to work completed and  (2) consider the need for providing HHS staff to collect and analyze  pertinent information that would help the advisory board comprehensively  reexamine its long-term plan for assessing the NIOSH site profiles and  dose reconstructions.", "To ensure that the findings and recommendations of the advisory board  and the contractor are promptly resolved, we recommend that the  Secretary of HHS direct the Director of NIOSH to establish a system to  track the actions taken by the agency in response to these findings and  recommendations and update the advisory board periodically on the status  of such actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Other Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS, the contractor, and all the  members of the advisory board for comment.  We received comments  from HHS, the contractor, and four individual members of the advisory  board.  The comments from the four members of the board represent the  views of these individuals and not an official position of the advisory  board.  HHS agreed with GAO\u2019s recommendations to provide more  integrated and comprehensive data to the advisory board and said that it  will consider the need to provide staff to help the advisory board  reexamine its overall plan for assessing NIOSH site profiles and dose  reconstructions.  With regard to the third recommendation, HHS stated  that a system is already in place to track actions taken by the agency in  response to advisory board recommendations in letters from the board to  the Secretary of HHS.  HHS added that matrices used in conjunction with  the six-step resolution process outline the contractor\u2019s concerns, NIOSH\u2019s  response, and the actions to be taken.  However, we believe that these  matrices do not provide sufficient closure with regard to tracking the  actions NIOSH has actually implemented in response to advisory board  and contractor findings and recommendations.  For example, in some of  the matrices, the advisory board has made numerous recommendations  that NIOSH perform certain actions to resolve various issues, but there is  no system in place to provide assurance that these actions have in fact  been taken.  Thus, we continue to see a need for this recommendation.", "Some individual advisory board members who provided comments  expressed concerns about our recommendations, although differing in  their reasons.  One individual board member expressed concern about the  recommendations to provide more integrated and comprehensive data to  the advisory board or to provide staff to help in reexamining the overall  review plan, suggesting that these changes might not be very helpful.  We  still believe that these recommendations are necessary to ensure that the  advisory board has more complete information to better oversee the  review as well as a long-term plan for completing the review; hence we did  not revise the recommendation.  Another individual board member  suggested that a system be established to track the advisory board\u2019s  recommendations rather than the contractor\u2019s recommendations since it is  these that should be of greater concern.  While GAO believes it is  important to track the resolution of the board\u2019s recommendations, it also  important to track the resolution of the contractor\u2019s recommendations,  and we therefore revised the wording of our recommendation to reflect  this position.", "HHS, the contractor, and individual advisory board members took issue  with statements in the report about the contractor being over budget and  behind schedule.  While they agreed with GAO\u2019s assessment that the  review process got off to a slow start, they thought that the report did not  provide sufficient information about the various factors that complicated  or led to an expansion of work for the contractor, the revisions to the  contractor\u2019s task orders, and the performance of the contractor with  respect to the revised task orders.  For example, commenters pointed out  that in some instances, the contractor had to review a site profile more  than once after NIOSH had revised the site profile to include additional  information.  Commenters added that the contractor\u2019s work also had to  shift to accommodate changing priorities.  For instance, NIOSH\u2019s  increased reliance on using the site profiles to complete dose  reconstructions prompted a shift in contractor priorities to devote more  time and resources to site profile reviews than originally anticipated.  The  commenters added that since the task orders were revised, the contractor  has been meeting the time frames and budgets specified in the task orders.   We therefore revised the report to incorporate additional information on  factors that complicated or led to an expansion in the work of the  contractor, the revisions that were made to the task orders, and the  contractor\u2019s progress in meeting the terms of the revised task orders.", "HHS, the contractor, and some of the individual members of the advisory  board maintained that the advisory board has taken actions to reexamine  and adjust its strategy for reviewing site profiles and dose reconstruction  cases.  For instance, HHS stated that during the advisory board\u2019s meetings  in 2005, the board regularly discussed the future of contract activities and  altered the review schedule and scope of work several times.  For  example, the contractor was asked to perform site profile reviews for sites  not originally anticipated in order to facilitate the advisory board\u2019s review  of related special exposure cohort petitions.  Other commenters pointed  out the board\u2019s development of a six-step resolution process for use by  NIOSH and the contractor to resolve differences on technical issues.  We  revised the report to more fully reflect actions taken by the advisory board  to reexamine and adjust its strategy for the review.  We also changed the  report title to reflect changes made in the report in this regard.  However,  we continue to see a need for the advisory board to build on its actions by  comprehensively reexamining whether its original long-term plan for the  overall project is still appropriate.", "Several individual advisory board members commented that they remain  concerned about the independence of the board and its contractor.   Although acknowledging that replacement of the original officials  appointed as the designated federal officer and project officer has helped  reduce possible challenges to independence, the members pointed out that  NIOSH officials remain involved in managing the contract and could still  potentially influence the work of the contractor.  These individual board  members also emphasized that the board has no independent budgetary  authority and that it relies on NIOSH to obtain funding.  Our review  suggests that the contractor has been able to demonstrate its  independence during the review.  For instance, our report notes that the  contractor\u2019s reports have criticized numerous aspects of NIOSH site  profiles and dose reconstructions.  Further, contractor officials told us  that they believe relations with NIOSH are thoroughly professional and  board members told us that they are satisfied with the information  provided by the contractor.  We acknowledge that the potential for  impairment of the contractor\u2019s efforts remains. In fact, our draft report  concluded that there is a need for continued diligence in avoiding actual or  perceived conflicts of roles as new candidates are considered for certain  positions over the life of the advisory board. We have further highlighted  this point in the final report.", "HHS\u2019s comments are provided in appendix II, and the contractor\u2019s  comments are provided in appendix III.
