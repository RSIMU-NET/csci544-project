For years, the Congress has been seeking detailed cost information on this assistance as it examined USDA budget requests. In part, because NRCS's financial system was not designed for estimating future budgets, in 1998 NRCS began developing additional cost data and a computer model for estimating future technical assistance costs. GAO was asked to (1) review NRCS's technical assistance cost estimates and (2) identify causes of any differences between the estimates and actual costs ultimately reported by NRCS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, NRCS started testing its computer model by comparing estimates of technical assistance costs for 10 Farm Bill conservation programs, with actual costs reported by NRCS. GAO's analysis of these comparisons shows that NRCS's model made estimates, program-by-program, which varied considerably from the agency's actual costs. For fiscal year 2003, for example, NRCS's model estimated that the technical assistance costs for seven Farm Bill programs would be higher by 9 to 50 percent, than NRCS ultimately incurred. For three other Farm Bill programs, the estimates were lower than the agency incurred by 16 to 60 percent. Most of the estimates fell outside NRCS's goal of estimating to within 10 percent of the agency's actual costs. In addition, for the 10 Farm Bill conservation programs combined, NRCS estimated its technical assistance costs at $295 million for fiscal year 2003, which is about 15 percent more than the $257 million that NRCS incurred. NRCS officials generally agreed with this analysis. GAO identified several reasons for the differences between the cost estimates and the actual costs. First, some of NRCS's technical assistance work was delayed, occurring later than NRCS assumed when it estimated its costs. This contributed to some overestimation by the model, according to NRCS officials. Second, NRCS's estimates include costs incurred by NRCS's partners. Such costs are generally not included in the actual costs reported by NRCS. Third, some data NRCS uses in its model are based on inaccurate assumptions. For example, when developing estimates about the time it takes NRCS staff to perform technical assistance tasks for use in the model, NRCS assumes, among other things, that its staff are fully trained and perform technical assistance work without interruption. These assumptions do not reflect actual workplace conditions and lead to underestimates. NRCS officials said they would reconsider these and other assumptions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducts various conservation  programs that help protect our nation\u2019s soil, water, and wildlife. In  partnership with state and local agencies, USDA\u2019s Natural Resources  Conservation Service (NRCS) provides technical assistance to farmers,  ranchers, and others to help them take part in these conservation  programs. For example, through the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP),  the largest program for retiring farmland for conservation purposes, USDA  and its partners provide technical and financial assistance to eligible  farmers who contract with USDA to take such conservation actions as  planting native grasses in place of crops to prevent erosion. This technical  assistance generally consists of making on-site visits to identify the  conservation needs of the land, advising landowners on selection, design,  and application of conservation measures, determining landowners\u2019  eligibility to participate in the program, and developing and monitoring  contracts the agency signs with landowners to implement conservation  measures. In fiscal year 2003\u2014the latest year for which data are  available\u2014NRCS reported that it spent $257 million on technical assistance  to implement this and nine other farm-related conservation programs. In  future years, NRCS officials are anticipating growth in its conservation  programs, and that this growth will sharply increase the agency\u2019s technical  assistance costs.", "For years, the Congress has been seeking more detailed and accurate  technical assistance cost information to better understand NRCS\u2019s costs  and how program growth might affect the agency\u2019s budget. Although NRCS  has had historical and anecdotal information on its technical assistance  expenditures, its financial system has not contained the detailed technical  assistance cost information by program and contract that is needed for  estimating future program budgets. In response to congressional concerns  about this lack of information about the cost of NRCS technical assistance  work, NRCS began developing a method and the cost data needed for  estimating its future technical assistance costs and budgets in 1998. These  efforts include  a workload analysis process, which provides estimates of the time  required for technical assistance tasks, and   a computer model, called the cost of programs model, which uses time  estimates from the workload analysis and other cost data about NRCS  salaries and expenses, for estimating NRCS\u2019s costs and future budgets.", "In 2003, NRCS began using cost estimates from its model to provide USDA  and congressional decision makers with detailed information on the cost of  providing technical assistance. In 2004, NRCS also used its model to  estimate the agency\u2019s budget requirements. When technical assistance  funds exceeded actual costs, the excess funds were converted to and used  as financial assistance to landowners, according to NRCS officials. In  addition, to assess and improve the quality of the estimates made by the  model, NRCS compared the model\u2019s program cost estimates for fiscal years  2002 and 2003 to program costs reported by its information systems for  those fiscal years.", "Because of your continuing interest in ensuring the development of  accurate information about the costs of NRCS programs, you asked us to  (1) review the technical assistance cost estimates produced by NRCS\u2019s  model and (2) identify the causes of any differences between the estimated  costs and the actual costs ultimately reported by NRCS.", "To review the technical assistance cost estimates produced by NRCS\u2019s  model, we assessed NRCS\u2019s comparisons of its model results with costs  reported by NRCS for 10 Farm Bill conservation programs for fiscal years  2002 and 2003. The 10 conservation programs authorized or reauthorized  by the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 (the 2002 Farm Bill)  and discussed in this report are the Agricultural Management Assistance  Program, the Conservation Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality  Incentives Program, the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program, the  Ground and Surface Water Conservation Program, Klamath Basin, the  Wetlands Reserve Program, the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program, the  Conservation Security Program, and the Grassland Reserve Program.

This opinion covers, in part, the salary cost data that NRCS relies on when  reporting its costs. To identify causes of differences between the estimated  costs and the costs reported by NRCS, we reviewed NRCS\u2019s assumptions  and data used in the cost estimates. As part of this effort, we analyzed  NRCS\u2019s model and related documentation to determine whether the model  appeared to be a logical and reasonable method for estimating technical  assistance costs. To determine the reliability of workload data used in the  model, we evaluated NRCS\u2019s instructions for developing them, and  obtained the views of NRCS officials and staff who led the development of  the workload analyses in the 10 states that performed over half of the  agency\u2019s CRP technical assistance and over 40 percent of its Wetlands  Reserve Program (WRP) in fiscal year 2002.

NRCS staff  work with the landowner to develop a conservation plan that describes the  strategy to be used, the schedule of activities, and estimated costs. In some  instances, plans are revised several times until the landowner selects a final  alternative. If the landowner applies to implement the conservation plan  under a Farm Bill program and the land meets the eligibility criteria and is  accepted, NRCS develops a contract. After a contract is developed and  signed, NRCS staff complete paperwork for payments to the landowner.  NRCS staff assist with installation of practices, for example, by surveying  land, providing practice standards and specifications, and ensuring  contractors have carried out the terms of the contract. In addition, NRCS  continues to document activities throughout the life of the contract, which  may be years or decades. Staff also periodically certify that the participant  is complying with the contract terms, depending on the program  requirements.", "In 1998, the Chief of NRCS called for a new agencywide effort to improve  NRCS\u2019s accountability by providing better information and analyses on  how the agency uses its resources and what it achieves with its funds. As  part of these efforts, NRCS has taken steps to estimate its future technical  assistance costs and budgets, as described in figure 1.", "NRCS\u2019s model for estimating the cost of programs consists of an Excel  spreadsheet that makes program-by-program calculations using such data  as time per task estimates and salary benefits and support costs, as well as  assumptions about the average length of a contract and the proportion of  work that will be performed during each year of the contract.

According to  NRCS\u2019s process for developing time per task estimates, these teams first  define the typical work in their area\u2014that is, the sizes and types of land  they work with and the conservation practices they plan for this land. For  example, a Texas team determined that one type of typical conservation  work in its area was planting grass cover on a 150-acre dairy farm. Using  this description, the team discussed and agreed on estimates of time  required for each of the 29 tasks associated with performing this work,  such as the time it would take them to design a grass-planting plan.  Generally, after developing the time per task estimates, the team leader  submits them to the state time per task leader to review and input into an  NRCS database. The methods of review the state offices use include  comparing the areas\u2019 estimates with each other.

First, NRCS estimates have assumed that full  funding would be available for new contracts at the start of the fiscal year,  but in practice, this has not occurred. For example, in 2002, the Farm Bill  was enacted in May, later than NRCS expected, and OMB apportioned  funds to USDA for implementing the Farm Bill programs in July\u2014about  three quarters of the way through the fiscal year.  Since only 2-1/2 months  of the fiscal year remained, different work\u2014and in some cases, less work\u2014  was performed under the Farm Bill than NRCS had anticipated, according  to NRCS officials. The general 2002 sign-up period for CRP contracts did  not start until August 2002, limiting the amount of work performed on new  CRP contracts. Moreover, in fiscal year 2003, USDA operated under a  continuing resolution until receiving fiscal year 2003 appropriations in  February and an OMB apportionment in March\u2014about half way through  the fiscal year. While NRCS can adjust its assumptions, it is not possible to  eliminate uncertainties and variances related to the timing of funding  approvals that cause differences between the estimated and actual  program costs.

For example, according to 1999 NRCS staff  estimates, the most recent available, NRCS\u2019s partners were responsible for  about 17 percent of total CRP costs and 15 percent of total WRP costs that  year. Using those percentages, we calculated that NRCS\u2019s partners might  have added about $15 million to these two programs\u2019 fiscal year 2002  technical assistance costs.", "To further illustrate the effects of including partners\u2019 costs, we conducted  two comparisons.

We then  made the same comparison but with partners\u2019 costs excluded. (See table 2.)   The results show that the differences between the estimated and actual  costs increase when partner costs are excluded. For the CRP program, for  example, the difference between the estimated and reported costs  increases from a 5 percent underestimate to a 22 percent underestimate  when partner costs are excluded. For WRP, the difference between the  estimated and reported costs also increases from a 22 percent  underestimate to a 34 percent underestimate when partner costs are  excluded.", "However, NRCS officials believe that the differences between their  estimates, which include partners\u2019 costs, and the reported actual costs are  less significant because their partner costs have decreased\u2014they could not  say by how much.

Similarly, most of the officials we spoke  with from conservation districts\u2014which are key partner organizations\u2014 reported that conservation districts have increased the amount of technical  assistance work they have performed in the past few years. Finally,  partner\u2019s costs should not be included when NRCS reports its costs, and  when it compares its estimated and actual costs.

NRCS guidance tells teams to develop descriptions of their  typical work, but does not tell them how to do this for areas in which  conditions are diverse. In the absence of more specific guidance, staff have  encountered difficulty with the concept of typical work. According to one  team leader, for example, the guidance does not tell teams how to  determine what is typical when there are significantly varying land sizes,  types of farms, or conservation practices, and several team leaders told us  that such variations made identifying typical work difficult or impossible.  For example, a North Dakota team leader said that the conservation work  in his area varies considerably, ranging from installing pipelines to creating  ponds to building fences. Moreover, a Wisconsin team leader told us that at  least three typical descriptions would be needed to represent the variety of  farms in his area: one each for dairy, vegetable, and cranberry farms. Other  NRCS staff commented that it may not be possible to describe what is  typical for western rangeland, where operations vary from hundreds of  acres to tens of thousands of acres. Finally, another team leader told us that  NRCS\u2019s guidance is vague, and as a result, his team interpreted the term  \u201ctypical\u201d to mean average, while another understood it to be the median or  middle value.  NRCS staff raised these concerns in 2000, and NRCS officials  are aware of the difficulties staff have encountered in describing their  typical work. According to these officials, the scope of this estimating  problem is nationwide and resolving this concern is important for making  more accurate estimates. NRCS is considering whether it is possible to  resolve difficulties staff face in describing typical work by enlarging the  number of areas for which estimates are developed or collecting data for  more than one \u201ctypical\u201d unit per area, and thereby reducing the extent of  diversity within each.

According to one NRCS official, staff need 1  to 1.5 years to become able to independently perform most technical  assistance for CRP and 3 to 5 years for WRP. Because not all staff are fully  trained, assuming that they are is likely to inappropriately lower the time  per task estimates. The second assumption is that staff are not interrupted  during their workday. Under normal conditions, staff regularly experience  interruptions that decrease productivity. Assuming that this is not the case  is also likely to contribute to inappropriately lowering the time per task  estimates. A third assumption, which would likely lead to raising the time  per task estimates, is that NRCS staff completely follow NRCS\u2019s policies,  procedures, and guidance in performing work. Actually, however, staff  sometimes take shortcuts that do not comply with all policies, procedures,  and guidance\u2014thereby completing tasks faster than expected.", "In contrast, NRCS\u2019s reported actual costs are based on actual work  conditions.

Although we could not determine the precise effects of these assumptions,  some information is available to indicate that they warrant reexamination.

When this  occurs, they must determine how much travel time they should assign to  each program.

NRCS\u2019s  overall technical assistance cost estimate for 10 Farm Bill conservation  programs for fiscal year 2003 is closer to the reported cost than the  estimate was for fiscal year 2002, but too much variation is evident on a  program-by-program basis in both years. Until improvements in NRCS\u2019s  technical assistance cost estimating are demonstrated through tests of the  model\u2019s results, we believe NRCS cost estimates should be used with  caution. Without identifying costs incurred by its partners when assessing  the reasonableness of the estimates made by its model, NRCS cannot  ensure the validity of its cost comparisons. Also, unless NRCS modifies its  assumptions to better reflect actual workplace conditions, its technical  assistance cost estimates will not be as precise as they could be.

To assess NRCS\u2019s cost model, we analyzed the model  and related documentation to determine whether the model appeared to be  a reasonable method for estimating program costs. In addition, we checked  whether the model formulas, contained in a MS Excel file, used the  appropriate data, and we reviewed the formulas to ensure that they were  logical. In addition, we replicated the model formulas using the proper data  and ensured that the resulting figures matched those shown in the model.  We interviewed NRCS officials responsible for developing the cost model  to gain an understanding of the model and its development. These officials  were staffed in NRCS\u2019s Budget Planning and Analysis Division, Operations  Management and Oversight Division, and in field offices.", "We conducted sensitivity analyses to illustrate the possible importance of  different variables in the model. These sensitivity analyses were conducted  using Monte Carlo simulation, which uses random numbers to measure the  effects of uncertainty on model output\u2014in this case, the technical  assistance cost estimates. Our analysis was based on general assumptions  about the probability distributions characterizing some of the variables in  the model.", "Also, we interviewed and requested documentation from 20 officials of  state government agencies and conservation district associations to assess  whether the nonreimbursed contributions of conservation districts  increased or decreased in the past several years. We did so for each of the  10 states with the most CRP and WRP contracts.  The 10 states are Illinois,  Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, New York,  North Dakota, and Wisconsin. Of the 20 officials we contacted, 13  responded to our request and provided some information about partners\u2019  contributions.", "To assess NRCS\u2019s means for ensuring the reliability of the data used in the  cost model, we traced the time per task and other data to their respective  sources, which included agency reports and databases. Since information  regarding data sources was not always readily available in writing, we met  with NRCS officials who described and provided the sources of the model\u2019s  data. Once we identified the source, we verified that the data had been  correctly transferred from the source to the model. In addition, we  performed limited reliability tests, primarily tests for omitted entries and  outliers, of the available source data. Furthermore, to obtain NRCS\u2019s field  staff views on the reliability of the time per task estimates and time and  attendance data used in the model, we used a semistructured interview  guide to interview all 10 officials leading estimate development efforts in  the 10 states that had the most CRP and WRP contracts in 2002. The 10  states had over half of NRCS\u2019s total CRP contracts and over 40 percent of  its WRP contracts. Using another semistructured interview guide, we  interviewed 10 randomly selected NRCS team leaders (out of 44 leaders)  who each led a team developing time per task estimates in one area in each  of the 10 states.  However, we could not assess the quality of NRCS\u2019s  reviews of its workload analysis at state offices because NRCS state  officials retained insufficient documentation of the reasons for changes in  data made during their reviews.", "To assess the reliability of other data used in NRCS\u2019s model, we reviewed  NRCS\u2019s method for developing overhead cost data and salary cost data,  which relies on the time and attendance system. Overall, we noted that  USDA obtained an unqualified opinion on its financial management  activities in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. This opinion covers, in part, the  salary cost data that NRCS relies on when reporting its costs. In addition,  we reviewed NRCS\u2019s development of overhead cost information that is  based on Office of Management and Budget budget object classifications,  which include such costs as rent, utilities, equipment, and supplies.  In  addition, we reviewed an NRCS draft report about the quality of NRCS time  and attendance data. That 2001 NRCS draft report found that about half of  NRCS field offices had deficiencies in documenting their use of time, but  the report did not provide sufficient detail to reveal the precise extent of  the problems. Since then, NRCS has implemented corrective actions,  according to agency officials, and has verified on a limited basis that  improvement has occurred.", "Our issues with the reliability of data are discussed throughout the report.  We performed our work between September 2003 and October 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Charles W.
