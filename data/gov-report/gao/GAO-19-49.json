FITARA also provided an opportunity to strengthen the authority of CIOs to provide needed direction and oversight of agencies' IT budgets.", "GAO was asked to review whether CIOs' IT budgeting practices are consistent with FITARA and OMB's implementing guidance. This report addresses the extent to which selected federal agencies (1) established policies and procedures that address IT budgeting requirements, (2) could demonstrate that they had developed fiscal year 2017 IT budgets for sampled investments consistent with FITARA and OMB guidance, and (3) implemented processes to ensure that annual IT budgets are informed by reliable cost information.", "GAO selected four departments to review. These departments had the two highest and the two lowest average initial selfassessments scores of compliance with OMB's FITARA guidance, as well as a fiscal year 2017 IT budget of at least $1 billion. Within each of the departments, GAO also selected the component agencies with the largest fiscal year 2017 IT budget. For each selected department and component agency, GAO reviewed relevant IT budget policies and procedures, analyzed a sample of major and non-major investment proposals against key OMB requirements, and determined whether selected departments captured government labor costs, among other things."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The departments GAO reviewed\u2014the Departments of Energy (DOE), Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice (DOJ), and the Treasury (Treasury)\u2014took steps to establish policies and procedures that align with eight selected Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requirements intended to implement information technology (IT) acquisition reform legislation (commonly referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, or FITARA) and to provide the chief information officer (CIO) visibility into and oversight over the IT budget. For example, of the eight OMB requirements, all four departments had established policies and procedures related to the level of detail with which IT resources are to be described in order to inform the CIO during the planning and budgeting processes. Agencies varied, however, as to how fully they had established policies and procedures related to some other OMB requirements, and none of the four departments had yet established procedures for ensuring that the CIO had reviewed whether the IT portfolio includes appropriate estimates of all IT resources included in the budget request. (See table.)", "Where the departments had not fully established policies and procedures, it was due, in part, to having not addressed in their FITARA implementation and delegation plans how they intended to implement the OMB requirements. Until departments develop comprehensive policies and procedures that address IT budgeting requirements established by OMB, they risk inconsistently applying requirements that are intended to facilitate the CIO's oversight and approval of the IT budget.", "Departments varied in the extent to which they could demonstrate implementation of key IT budgeting requirements when developing fiscal year 2017 funding requests for sampled investments. Specifically, while DOJ demonstrated that it had fully implemented the selected requirements for the majority of the investments GAO sampled, HHS and Treasury partially demonstrated implementation for a majority of the sampled investments, and DOE could not demonstrate implementation for the majority of the sampled investments. For example, DOE, HHS, and Treasury were not able to fully show that their CIOs had reviewed whether estimates of IT resources included in the budget request were appropriate for two of their respective departments' largest fiscal year 2017 IT investments. Departments often could not demonstrate that they had implemented selected IT budgeting requirements at the investment level because they had not established comprehensive policies and procedures that required them to do so. As a result, departments could not show that CIOs were sufficiently involved in planning fiscal year 2017 IT expenditures at the individual investment level.", "All four selected departments lacked quality assurance processes for ensuring their IT budgets were informed by reliable cost information. Specifically, the selected departments did not have IT capital planning processes for (1) ensuring government labor costs have been accurately reported, (2) aligning contract costs with IT investments, and (3) utilizing budget object class data to capture all IT programs. This resulted in billions of dollars in requested IT expenditures without departments having comprehensive information to support those requests, and nearly $4.6 billion in IT contract spending that was not explicitly aligned with investments in selected departments' IT portfolios. This was due to a lack of processes for periodically reviewing data quality and estimation methods for government labor estimates, as well as a lack of mechanisms to cross-walk IT spending data in their procurement and accounting systems with investment data in their IT portfolio management systems. In August 2017, OMB developed a new approach of using a standard set of categories to group IT spending that, if properly implemented, has the potential to provide departments and CIOs enhanced visibility into IT costs across the portfolio. Nevertheless, until departments establish processes for assessing or otherwise ensuring the quality of relevant IT cost data used to inform their IT budgets, department CIOs will have less assurance that their budget includes appropriate and comprehensive estimates of IT resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 43 recommendations to the eight selected departments and component agencies to address gaps in their IT budgeting policies and procedures, demonstrate implementation of OMB requirements, and establish procedures to ensure IT budgets are informed by reliable cost information.

However, as we have previously reported, prior IT expenditures  have too often produced failed projects\u2014that is, projects with multimillion  dollar cost overruns and schedule delays measured in years, and with  questionable mission-related achievements.", "Moreover, the President\u2019s Management Agenda has pointed out that  federal executives have been challenged by the lack of visibility into, and  accuracy of IT spending data. In this regard, the agenda noted that 84  percent of the federal IT budget was assigned to the spending category of  \u201cother,\u201d and was not tied to a specific category of IT spending. The  Administration stated that this lack of granularity makes it difficult to  baseline federal IT investments and show the public whether the  government is spending taxpayer dollars effectively in order to drive the  large-scale change needed to improve business transformation and  citizen services.", "Recognizing the severity of issues related to the government-wide  management of IT, in December 2014, Congress enacted IT acquisition  reform legislation (commonly referred to as the Federal Information  Technology Acquisition Reform Act, or FITARA) as part of the Carl Levin  and Howard P. \u2018Buck\u2019 McKeon National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2015. FITARA was intended to improve covered agencies\u2019  acquisitions of IT and enable Congress to monitor their progress, as well as hold those agencies accountable for reducing duplication and  achieving cost savings. In addition, with the enactment of FITARA, the  federal government is to strengthen the authority of chief information  officers (CIO) to provide needed direction and oversight of covered  agencies\u2019 IT budgets. Among other things, FITARA requires the CIOs of  certain major civilian agencies to have a significant role in the decision  processes for all annual and multi-year planning and to approve the IT  budget requests of the agencies.", "In June 2015, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) released  FITARA guidance (referred to as the \u201ccommon baseline\u201d). The common  baseline describes how covered agencies are to implement the  requirements of the law through the use of management controls,  including controls related to the development of IT budgets.", "With these requirements in mind, you asked us to determine whether  CIOs\u2019 IT budgeting practices are consistent with FITARA and  implementing guidance. This report examines the extent to which  selected federal agencies (1) established policies and procedures that  address the IT budgeting requirements of FITARA and related OMB IT  budget guidance, (2) could demonstrate that they had developed fiscal  year 2017 IT budgets for sampled investments consistent with FITARA  and OMB guidance, and (3) implemented processes to ensure that  annual IT budgets are informed by reliable cost information.", "To address our objectives, we selected four departments to review. First,  we identified a subset of the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial  Officers Act that had a fiscal year 2017 IT budget request of at least $1  billion. From this subset, we then identified the four agencies having the  two highest and the two lowest average initial FITARA self-assessment  scores (which reflected the extent to which the agencies had reported  implementing the specific requirements called for in the act\u2019s provisions).  In the event that one or more agencies had the same average  self-assessment scores, we selected the agency with the largest fiscal  year 2017 IT budget. Based on these criteria, we selected four  departments for our review: (1) the Department of Energy (DOE), (2) the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), (3) the Department of  Justice (DOJ), and (4) the Department of the Treasury (Treasury).", "In addition, for each of these four departments, we selected the  component agency that had the largest fiscal year 2017 IT budget  request. The component agencies within the four selected departments  were: (1) the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) within  DOE, (2) the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) within  HHS, (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) within DOJ, and  (4) the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) within Treasury.", "For the first objective, we compared the selected departments\u2019 IT  budgeting and capital planning policies and procedures to those  requirements in OMB\u2019s FITARA guidance that related to developing IT  budgets. In selecting the requirements, we reviewed 10 areas within  OMB\u2019s common baseline that related to budget formulation and  execution, and selected 8 requirements\u2014such as including the CIO in the  planning and budgeting stages for programs that are fully or partially  supported with IT resources\u2014that, in our professional judgment, would  significantly impact the development and approval of departments\u2019 annual  IT budgets.", "We also assessed selected component agencies\u2019 IT budgeting and  capital planning policies and procedures in cases where the department  had delegated the responsibility for performing the requirement to its  components. Of the four departments we reviewed, three departments\u2014 DOE, HHS, and Treasury\u2014had delegated the responsibility to component  agencies for performing certain IT budgeting and capital planning  requirements.", "With regard to the second objective, we determined whether the  departments had implemented key IT budgeting requirements for a  non-generalizable sample of investments in their fiscal year 2017 budget  formulation. In doing so, we chose 16 investments\u2014the largest major and  non-major investments at the department level and the largest major and  non-major investments at the component level\u2014based on the selected  departments\u2019 fiscal year 2017 IT budget requests.", "We then reviewed investment-related IT budget formulation artifacts\u2014 such as briefings, reports, meeting minutes, memorandums, and other  relevant documentation\u2014for the sampled major and non-major  investments at each of the departments and component agencies included in our review. We compared this documentation to the actions  agencies should have taken to implement five of the eight selected  requirements from the first objective. We focused on these five  requirements because, based on our professional judgment, the actions  taken to implement these requirements could be observed for individual  investments, such as whether the CIO was included in the planning and  budgeting stages for investments with IT resources.", "To address the third objective, we assessed the departments\u2019 efforts to  develop their fiscal year 2017 budget with reliable cost information by  comparing the selected departments\u2019 IT capital planning and budgeting  processes against three best practices (from among others) that we and  the International Organization for Standardization have identified:  capturing government labor costs, aligning contract costs with  investments, and utilizing budget object class data. We selected these  three practices because of their potential to inform the development of a  complete and accurate IT budget for a federal department.", "We then reviewed, for each selected department, government labor  estimates and contract-related information in the 2017 budget submission  reported on the Federal IT Dashboard, contract obligation data reported  within the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation,  documentation identifying the department\u2019s budget object classes, and  each selected department\u2019s IT capital planning policies and procedures.", "We analyzed each department\u2019s IT investment proposals and capital  planning procedures to determine whether the department was capturing  government labor costs for each investment, aligning contract costs with  investments, and utilizing budget object class data to inform its IT budget  formulation.", "We supplemented our analyses with interviews of relevant officials in the  selected departments\u2019 offices of the CIO and Chief Financial Officer, as  well as program offices. These interviews included discussions of our  observations of any shortfalls in their processes. A full description of our  objectives, scope, and methodology can be found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to November  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

In this regard, the act requires CIOs to have a significant role in the  decision processes for all annual and multi-year planning, and to approve  the IT budget requests of the agency.", "In June 2015, OMB released guidance that describes how agencies are  to implement the requirements of FITARA. The guidance is intended to,  among other things: assist agencies in aligning their IT resources with statutory  requirements; establish government-wide IT management controls that will meet the  law\u2019s requirements, while providing agencies with flexibility to adapt to  unique agency processes and requirements;  strengthen the relationship between agency CIOs and component  CIOs; and  strengthen the CIO\u2019s accountability for IT costs, schedules,  performance, and security.", "The guidance identifies a number of actions that agencies are to take to  establish a basic set of roles and responsibilities (the common baseline)  for CIOs and other senior agency officials. One such action is that  agencies are to conduct a self-assessment to determine whether their  current policies and procedures meet or do not meet the common  baseline requirements. If the agencies do not meet the requirements, they  are to submit an implementation plan describing the changes they intend  to make to their policies and procedures in order to ensure that the  common baseline requirements are met. Further, the guidance notes that  senior agency officials\u2014including Chief Financial Officers and Chief  Acquisition Officers\u2014are to work in partnership to facilitate successful  implementation of the common baseline and to ensure the CIO is a  strategic partner in agency strategies, budgets, and operations.", "In its guidance, OMB states that agency CIOs are allowed to delegate  certain responsibilities from the common baseline to other agency  officials, such as component agency CIOs. For example, CIOs can  delegate to these officials, inclusion in the planning, programming, and  budgeting stages for programs with IT resources. However, according to  the guidance, agency CIOs cannot delegate their responsibility for  reviewing and approving the major IT investments portion of the budget  request. The guidance further states that, for delegated responsibilities,  agency CIOs are to establish plans that demonstrate how they will retain  accountability. These delegation plans should include procedures for  ensuring that the delegated official will execute the responsibility with the  appropriate level of rigor.", "In addition to the FITARA implementation guidance, OMB Circular A-130  establishes general requirements for the planning; budgeting;  governance; acquisition; and management of federal information,  personnel, equipment, funds, IT resources, and supporting infrastructure  and services. The circular identifies responsibilities for planning,  programming, and budgeting that reinforce requirements in OMB\u2019s  FITARA implementation guidance.", "Moreover, in May 2018 the President issued an executive order that  reinforces requirements in OMB\u2019s FITARA implementation guidance.  The order noted that its purpose was to further enhance the effectiveness  of CIOs by, among other things, requiring agency heads to ensure that  the CIO has a significant role in all IT-related annual and multi-year  planning, programming, budgeting, and execution decisions. In addition,  the executive order noted that agency heads are to direct the CIO to be a  voting member of and to chair agency governance boards, including  investment review boards, that have purview over IT or that set  agency-wide IT standards.", "We have previously testified that, while agencies have made progress in  implementing FITARA, its further implementation is critical to improving IT  management. We have also noted that, continued congressional  oversight of agencies\u2019 implementation of this law is essential to help  ensure that these efforts succeed.", "In addition, in an August 2018 report, we noted that 23 federal agencies  had reported wide variations in the authority over component-level IT  spending. For example, 8 agencies reported that the CIO had 100  percent authority over the agencies\u2019 IT spending (including for  components), while 10 agencies reported that these officials had authority  for less than 50 percent of such spending. These widely varying levels of  authority over agency-wide IT spending existed, in part, because OMB\u2019s  guidance did not completely define the authority that CIOs should have  over this spending. Accordingly, we recommended that OMB define the authority that the CIOs are to have when agencies report on their  authority over IT spending. OMB subsequently agreed with our  recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Departments Took Steps to Establish Policies and Procedures for IT Budgeting, but Lacked Plans to Fully Implement FITARA Requirements", "paragraphs": ["As previously mentioned, OMB\u2019s guidance on implementing FITARA  requires departments to develop policies and procedures to address a  number of requirements identified in the basic set of roles and  responsibilities (the common baseline) for CIOs.

As identified in table 1, these requirements  can be categorized into three areas: (1) CIO visibility into IT resources,  (2) CIO input into IT resource plans, and (3) CIO review and approval of  IT budgets.", "OMB required federal agencies and departments to establish FITARA  implementation plans that articulated policies and procedures for  addressing each of the common baseline requirements and that  described changes the departments intended to make to address any  gaps in their policies and procedures. Further, for delegated  responsibilities, OMB required agency CIOs to establish delegation plans  that demonstrate how they intend to retain accountability for the  requirement and ensure that the delegated official will execute the  responsibility with the appropriate level of rigor.", "Toward this end, the selected departments had taken steps to establish  policies and procedures that addressed the common baseline  requirements established by OMB; however, most of the departments, or  their component agencies, lacked comprehensive policies and  procedures that fully addressed all of the requirements.

From this subset, we then  identified the four agencies having the two highest and the two lowest  average initial FITARA self-assessment scores, which included an  assessment of OMB\u2019s common baseline for IT management (common  baseline). In the event that one or more agencies had the same average  self-assessment scores, we selected the agency with the largest fiscal  year 2017 IT budget. Based on these criteria, we selected four  departments for our review: (1) the Department of Energy (DOE), (2) the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), (3) the Department of  Justice (DOJ), and (4) the Department of the Treasury (Treasury).", "In addition, for each of these four departments, we selected their  component agencies that had the largest fiscal year 2017 IT budget  request. The components within the four selected departments were:  (1) the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) within DOE,  (2) the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) within HHS,  (3) the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) within DOJ, and (4) the  Internal Revenue Service (IRS) within Treasury.", "For the first objective, we compared the selected departments\u2019 policies  and procedures to requirements selected from OMB\u2019s FITARA guidance  (referred to as the common baseline) that related to developing  departments\u2019 IT budgets. In selecting the requirements, we reviewed 10  areas related to budget formulation and execution within OMB\u2019s common  baseline, and used professional judgment to select 8 requirements that  we believed would significantly impact the development and approval of  departments\u2019 annual IT budgets. In doing so, we excluded one  requirement that affected the development of annual IT budgets to a  lesser extent and combined one requirement that was similar to another.  Specifically, we excluded the requirement from the area related to the  chief information officer\u2019s (CIO) role in program management because the  CIO\u2019s review of program management artifacts could not be directly  related to the IT budget review and approval process.", "In addition, two common baseline areas had a similar requirement that  the CIO be involved in the internal planning of IT resources prior to the  budget submission. We combined these into one requirement for our  review. We consulted with OMB officials in the Office of the Federal CIO  on the requirements that we selected and how we planned to evaluate  them and the officials agreed with our approach.", "The eight OMB common baseline requirements within budget formulation  and execution that we identified and selected are: establish the level of detail with which IT resources are to be  described in order to inform the CIO during the planning and  budgeting processes; establish agency-wide policy for the level of detail with which planned  expenditures for all transactions that include IT resources are to be  reported to the CIO;  include the CIO in the planning and budgeting stages for programs  that are fully or partially supported with IT resources;  include the CIO as a member of governance boards that inform  decisions regarding all IT resources, including component-level  governance boards; document the processes by which program leadership works with the  CIO to plan an overall portfolio of IT resources; ensure the CIO has reviewed and approved the major IT investments  portion of the budget request; ensure the CIO has reviewed IT resources that are to support major  program objectives and significant increases and decreases in IT  resources; and ensure the CIO has reviewed whether the IT portfolio includes  appropriate estimates of all IT resources included in the budget  request.", "After determining the eight requirements that we would review, we  categorized them into three areas: CIO visibility into IT resources, CIO  input to IT resource plans, and CIO review and approval of IT budgets.", "We then reviewed the current policies and procedures that each  department had documented for its IT budgeting process to determine  whether the department documented a process for how they would  address each of the eight common baseline requirements we selected for  review. In addition to policies and procedures, we also reviewed each  department\u2019s FITARA implementation plan, which included a description  of the steps the department must take to ensure that all FITARA and  OMB requirements would be implemented; and the delegation  memorandums from department CIOs, in which formal assignments of  responsibilities to other department officials are documented, where  applicable.", "In cases where the department CIO fully or partially delegated  responsibilities to component officials, we requested relevant  documentation from the agency component with the largest fiscal year  2017 IT budget request. In such cases, we based our determination of  departments\u2019 implementation of the requirement on (1) the extent to  which the component agency had documented policies and procedures  that carried out the delegated requirement and (2) the extent to which the  department CIO had procedures for ensuring the delegation was being  carried out by the components.", "With regard to our second objective, we determined whether the selected  departments had implemented key IT budgeting requirements for a  non-generalizable sample of investments in their fiscal year 2017 budget  formulation. In doing so, we chose 16 investments\u2014the largest major and  non-major investments at the department level and the largest major and  non-major investments at the component level\u2014based on the selected  departments\u2019 fiscal year 2017 IT budget request. Although the  information obtained is not generalizable to all of the departments\u2019  investments, the sample provided a range of examples and conditions  under which the departments were implementing requirements found in  OMB\u2019s common baseline.", "We then identified a subset of requirements from the eight department  requirements for developing IT budgets found in OMB\u2019s common baseline  for which implementation could be observed at the investment level. In  doing so, we used professional judgment to select the subset of  requirements where actions taken to implement these requirements could  be observed for individual investments. Specifically, we did not select the  requirement to establish agency-wide policy for the level of detail with  which planned expenditures for all transactions that include IT resources  are to be reported to the CIO, because the requirement primarily applied  to enterprise-wide policymaking and reporting. Also, we did not select the  requirement to include the CIO as a member of governance boards that  inform decisions regarding all IT resources for review on individual  investments because certain investments may not have been subject to  governance board reviews during fiscal year 2017. In addition, we did not  select the requirement to ensure the CIO has reviewed and approved the  major IT investments portion of the budget request for review on  individual investments because half of the investments we selected were  not classified as major investments.", "The five requirements for which we selected and reviewed  implementation at the investment level were:  IT resources for each investment are described in order to inform the  CIO during the planning and budgeting processes;  the CIO is included in the planning and budgeting stages for  investments with IT resources; program leadership works with the CIO to plan the investment\u2019s IT  the CIO reviews whether the investment\u2019s IT resources support major  program objectives and have increased or decreased significantly;  and  the CIO reviews whether the investment\u2019s estimates of IT resources in  the portfolio and budget request are appropriate.", "For each investment, if available, we obtained artifacts for the fiscal year  2017 budget submission\u2014such as briefings, reports, meeting minutes,  memorandums, and other relevant documentation showing the CIO\u2019s  involvement in relevant reviews or decisions. We compared this  documentation to relevant OMB requirements for developing the IT  budget at the individual investment level.", "To address our third objective, we assessed the selected departments\u2019  efforts to develop their fiscal year 2017 budget with reliable cost  information by comparing the department\u2019s IT capital planning and  budgeting processes against best practices identified by us and the  International Organization for Standardization\u2014such as capturing  government labor costs, aligning contract costs with investments, and  utilizing budget object class data. We selected these three practices  (from among others) because of their potential to inform the development  of a complete and accurate IT budget for a federal department.", "Capturing government labor costs. We reviewed each selected  departments\u2019 IT capital planning policies and procedures and  government labor estimates within the 2017 IT budget submission  reported on the Federal IT Dashboard. For each selected department,  we identified the processes by which forecasted government labor  costs are to be captured within investment proposals submitted with  the annual IT budget. We then analyzed each department\u2019s 2017 IT  investment proposals to determine whether the department was  capturing government labor for each investment. In doing so, we  analyzed each selected department\u2019s IT portfolio submitted with its  fiscal year 2017 budget to determine whether the identified  investments had included planned government labor costs, as  required by OMB.", "Aligning contract costs with investments.

From these document reviews, we identified the  processes by which contract-related costs are to be captured within  investment proposals submitted with the annual IT budget. We then  determined whether departments were able to align current contracts  with 2017 IT investment proposals. In doing so, we identified fiscal  year 2016 contracts that departments reported in the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation that had an IT-related  product or service code and an expected completion date that  extended into fiscal year 2017 or beyond. We then attempted to  match, using the unique procurement identification number for each  contract, a corresponding IT investment for those contracts in  departments\u2019 fiscal year 2017 IT budget data. For contracts that we  could not find a match, or alignment, with investments in departments\u2019  fiscal year 2017 IT budget data, we identified dollars obligated on  those contracts from October 2016 through September 2017.", "Utilizing budget object class data. We reviewed each selected  departments\u2019 IT capital planning policies and procedures, budget  object classes that are to help track IT financial transactions, and  OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2019 IT capital planning guidance that calls for  greater use of IT financial data.
