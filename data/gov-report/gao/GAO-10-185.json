In such cases, the cost plan must discontinue serving that area beginning in 2011. The Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) required the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to examine issues related to the conversion of Medicare cost plans to MA plans.

Nearly all beneficiaries enrolled in cost plans had at least 5 MA plans serving their county in June 2009, and more than 57 percent had a choice of 15 or more MA plans. Some of the differences between cost plans and MA plans that affect beneficiaries are out-of-network coverage, enrollment periods, and prescription drug coverage. Cost plans' quality scores, on average, were higher than the average of competing MA plans' scores in the county with the cost plan's highest enrollment. Estimated out-of-pocket costs varied between cost plans and other options depending on the self-reported health status of the beneficiary. In general, beneficiaries reporting poor health had lower estimated average out-of-pocket costs in most cost plans compared to competitor MA plans and FFS, while beneficiaries reporting good or excellent health had relatively higher estimated costs in most cost plans compared to MA plans and FFS. Half of the 18 organizations offering cost plans also offered at least one MA plan in some or all of their cost plans' service area. These 9 organizations operated a total of 12 cost plans. In general, organizations that offer cost plans and MA plans in the same service area must close their cost plan to enrollment. Officials from organizations that offered cost plans cited potential future changes to MA payments and difficulty assuming financial risk as concerns about converting cost plans to MA plans. Unlike cost plans, MA plans assume financial risk if payments from CMS do not cover their costs. Officials from 13 of the 18 organizations offering cost plans identified past and the potential for future payment changes in the MA program as reasons the decision to convert was difficult, though 6 of these organizations offered an MA plan in some or all of their cost plan's service area in 2009. Additionally, officials from 5 organizations said that their enrollment was insufficient to manage the financial risk plans would need to accept in the MA program. Officials from more than half of the organizations that offered cost plans also expressed concerns about the potential disruption to beneficiaries caused by transferring beneficiaries from cost plans to MA plans.

Despite their relatively  small enrollment, industry representatives stated that cost plans fill a  unique niche by providing a Medicare managed care option in rural and  other areas that traditionally had few or no MA plans. Congress acted to  curtail the expansion of cost plans multiple times. In 1997 Congress passed  legislation prohibiting new cost plans from entering the Medicare market  and prohibiting existing cost plans from being renewed or extended  beyond 2002. Subsequent legislation extended the authorization of existing  cost plans and, most recently, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and  Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) allowed existing Medicare cost plans to  continue to operate except where MA plans of sufficient enrollment  served a cost plan\u2019s service area for the previous year.

We examined quality data for  cost plans and MA plans. We limited our quality analysis to the county in  each cost plan\u2019s service area with the highest cost plan enrollment  because the MA competitor plans for a cost plan may differ depending on  the county within the service area. If a cost plan was missing a quality  score, we did not report a comparison. We also analyzed CMS data that  estimate total monthly out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries in different  managed care benefit packages and Medicare FFS. CMS reports the  estimated out-of-pocket costs according to self-reported health status  within a range of age groups, for example, among 80 to 84 year olds  reporting good health. For our analysis, we compared enrollment- weighted averages of estimated out-of-pocket costs for each cost plan  benefit package to enrollment-weighted estimates for MA benefit packages  in the same service area. We separated the analysis according to whether  the benefit package included Part D, Medicare\u2019s prescription drug benefit.  Similarly, because the FFS-only estimate does not include Part D coverage,  we compared the estimated out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries enrolled  in non-Part D cost plan benefit packages to the out-of-pocket costs for  beneficiaries in Medicare FFS. We presented the results for beneficiaries  that reported themselves as 80 to 84 years old and in poor, good, and  excellent health; we used results for this age group because officials from  the industry and CMS told us that beneficiaries in cost plans are generally  older than the average MA beneficiary.", "To determine the extent to which organizations that offer cost plans also  offer MA plans, we analyzed CMS service area and enrollment data to  identify organizations offering both. We interviewed officials from each  organization that offers a cost plan to verify the CMS data. We then  compared the service areas of the MA plans with those of the cost plans  offered by the same organizations.", "To describe the concerns that cost plans have about converting to MA  plans, we interviewed officials from each organization that offers a cost  plan, the CMS office responsible for oversight of Medicare\u2019s managed care  programs, the Medicare Cost Contractors Alliance, which is an alliance of  cost plans that advocates for cost plans in Congress and with CMS, and the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), which is the  organization of state insurance regulators.", "To determine the reliability of the data, we reviewed documentation for all  the data sets we used. We conducted tests to look for obvious errors in the  data and compared results to other published sources for CMS data on  cost plan and MA plan service areas and enrollment.

Under the M+C program, the method used to pay participating  plans was revised significantly, and, due in part to these payment changes,  by 2000 many health plans began to withdraw from the program.  Enrollment fell from 6.3 million in 1999 to 4.6 million by 2003.

Cost plans receive an  advance interim payment per member per month based on the cost plan\u2019s  estimated reimbursable costs. CMS and the cost plans make adjustments  after the contract period to align the payments with the actual costs  incurred following the plan\u2019s submission of an independently certified cost  report that details cost, utilization, and enrollment data for the entire  contract period.", "As of December 2009, 18 organizations operated 22 cost plans, with  enrollments ranging from 50 to 74,190.

Eight cost  plans offered Part D coverage in 2009. Cost plans served at least one  county in 16 states and the District of Columbia in 2009. Cost plans were  most prevalent in Minnesota, where 3 cost plans operated across most of  the state. (See fig. 1.)", "Congress acted to curtail the expansion of cost plans multiple times. The  BBA provided that upon enactment, with few exceptions, the Secretary of  Health and Human Services could not enter into any new cost plan  contracts and could not extend or renew a cost plan contract beyond  December 31, 2002. Subsequent laws modified the circumstances under  which existing cost plans could continue to operate. The MMA, for  example, allowed existing cost plans to be extended indefinitely, with the  exception that, beginning January 1, 2008, the Secretary could no longer  renew or extend contracts for cost plans serving an area that for the  previous year was also served by two or more regional CCPs or two or  more local CCPs and that also met specified enrollment thresholds. A  cost plan would only be required to leave the counties within its service  area that were also served by the CCPs. Most recently, MIPPA extended  the exception provision to January 1, 2010, meaning cost plans affected by  this provision would close at the beginning of calendar year 2011. MIPPA  also requires that the qualifying CCPs used to determine whether the cost  plan must close must be offered by more than one organization (see fig. 2).
