These offenders, who had either been high-ranking officials of companies or operated their own business, pled guilty to crimes for which the courts ordered restitution totaling about $568 million to victims. As of the completion of GAO's fieldwork, which was up to 8 years after the offenders' sentencing, court records showed that amounts collected for the victims in these cases totaled only about $40 million, or about 7 percent of the ordered restitution. At some point prior to the judgments establishing the restitution debts, each of the five offenders either reported having wealth or significant financial resources to the courts or to Justice, or there were indicators of such. However, following the judgments, the offenders claimed that they were not financially able to pay full restitution to their victims. Justice's Financial Litigation Units (FLU) that were responsible for collection performed certain activities to collect the debts after the judgments, but the debts had not been significantly reduced as a result of the FLUs' identification and liquidation of additional assets of the offenders. The FLUs' prospects are not good for collecting additional restitution amounts on these cases. A major problem hindering the FLUs' ability to collect restitution debt in the selected cases was the long time intervals between the criminal offense and the judgment. Court records show that 5 to 13 years passed between when the offenders began to engage in the criminal activity for which they were sentenced and the date of their judgments. For each of the selected cases, by the time the court rendered the judgment establishing the restitution debt, certain of the offenders' assets had been, among other things, transferred to family members or others, involved in forfeiture actions, subject to bankruptcy, or moved to a foreign account. In addition, one of the selected cases involved an offender who was jointly and severally liable for the debt with another offender who had been deported. Justice acknowledged that such dispositions or circumstances are not uncommon and create major debt collection challenges for the FLUs. Moreover, there were minimal, if any, apparent negative consequences to these offenders for not paying their restitution debts. Recently, to further implementation of a related recommendation made in 2001 by GAO, the Congress directed the Attorney General to develop a strategic plan with certain other federal agencies to improve criminal debt collection. Given the significant upward trend in outstanding criminal debt and the difficulty experienced by Justice in collecting criminal restitution debt, it is important that Justice include in such a plan legislative initiatives, operational initiatives, or both to enhance the federal government's capacity to collect restitution for victims of financial crimes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In March 2004, we reported that the Department of Justice\u2019s (Justice)  unaudited records indicated that the total amount of outstanding criminal  debt had more than quadrupled over a 6-year period, growing from about  $6 billion as of September 30, 1996, to almost $25 billion as of   September 30, 2002. This significant upward trend started with enactment  of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA). One feature of  that law substantially increased the restitution amounts the courts were  required to order for certain offenses. Our 2004 report included detailed  information on the reported amount and growth of criminal debt for fiscal  years 2000 through 2002, including specific amounts related to white-collar  financial fraud. As discussed in that report, Justice\u2019s unaudited records  indicate that for each of these 3 fiscal years, about two-thirds or more of  criminal debt was related to white-collar financial fraud. About 80 percent  of the white-collar financial fraud debt as of September 30, 2002, was  categorized as nonfederal restitution, which is criminal debt owed to other  than the federal government and for which Justice has a significant  responsibility to collect on behalf of crime victims.", "We noted in our earlier July 2001 report, and reaffirmed in our 2004 report,  that the collection of outstanding criminal debt is inherently difficult due to  a number of factors, including the nature of the debt, in that it involves  criminals who may be incarcerated, may have been deported, or may have  minimal earning capacity; the MVRA requirement that the assessment of  restitution be based on actual loss and not on an offender\u2019s ability to pay;  and the significant amount of time that may pass between offenders\u2019 arrest  and sentencing, thus affording opportunities for offenders to hide  fraudulently obtained assets in offshore accounts, shell corporations,  family members\u2019 names and accounts, or other ways. Our 2001 report also  noted as contributing factors to the growth of reported uncollected  criminal debt Justice\u2019s inadequate policies and procedures for collecting  criminal debt, lack of adherence to established criminal debt collection  procedures in certain judicial districts, and Justice\u2019s insufficient  coordination with other entities involved in the collection of criminal debt.", "In the wake of a recent wave of corporate scandals, you noted that the  American taxpayers have a right to expect that those who have committed  corporate fraud and other criminal or civil wrongdoing will be punished,  and that the federal government will make every effort to recover assets  and the ill-gotten gains held by such offenders. Recognizing that we  previously reported on specific deficiencies in Justice\u2019s and other federal  agencies\u2019 criminal debt collection processes and had made  recommendations to improve collections, you asked us to study several  specific criminal restitution debt cases to shed additional light on the  difficulties involved in attempting to collect restitution for victims of crime.

According to Justice,  the FLUs typically become involved in the criminal debt collection process  after the judgment, which occurs when an offender is convicted and a  judge orders the offender to pay a fine or restitution. The U.S. Courts and  their probation offices may also assist in collecting moneys owed. AOUSC  provides national standards and promulgates administrative and  management guidance, including standards and guidance required for debt  collection, to the various U.S. judicial districts.", "In July 2001, we reported on the growth of uncollected criminal debt  through fiscal year 1999. We noted that although some of the key factors  that contributed to the increasing amount of criminal debt were beyond  Justice\u2019s control, certain of Justice\u2019s criminal debt collection processes  were inadequate. Accordingly, in the 2001 report, we made 14  recommendations to Justice to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of  its criminal debt collection processes.", "In our March 2004 report, we discussed the extent to which Justice had  acted on our previous recommendations to it to improve criminal debt  collection. Our follow-up work on Justice\u2019s efforts to implement our 2001  recommendations showed that it had completed actions on 7 of the 14  recommendations, most of which were completed about 2 years after we  made the recommendations, and had efforts under way to address 6 other  recommendations. We noted that because many of these recommendations  largely focused on establishing policies and procedures, it is important that  they be effectively implemented once they are established, and it will likely  take some time for collection results to be realized from full  implementation. However, efforts to implement the recommendation that  we considered the most critical had not progressed\u2014namely for Justice to  participate in a multiagency effort to develop a unified strategy for criminal  debt collection. Specifically, we reported that Justice had not yet worked  with other agencies, including AOUSC, OMB, and Treasury, to implement a  key recommendation to work as a joint task force to develop a strategic  plan that addresses managing, accounting for, and reporting criminal debt.

We selected debts  involving offenders who were not currently in prison and for which the  offenders had paid a relatively small amount of the outstanding restitution  amounts as of September 30, 2002. Also, our review only involved selected  cases for which we could clearly identify the lead debtor in court and  Justice records.", "We obtained sufficient information to address our three reporting  objectives; however, we were not provided all of the details pertaining to  each of the five selected cases and thus cannot be assured that there was  not additional relevant information. Because Justice still considers these  cases to be open law enforcement cases for collection purposes, the  information Justice provided for each case was limited primarily to what  was included in its debt collection file minus personal identifiers, such as  the names of the offenders, their addresses, and their Social Security  numbers. Therefore, we are not providing a comprehensive account of any  particular case.", "For each selected debt, we reviewed Justice\u2019s debt collection file or files,  minus all personal identifiers. We interviewed appropriate officials from  Justice\u2019s EOUSA and the responsible FLUs concerning actions taken to  collect the debt, obstacles to collection, and prospects for future  collections. To supplement or attempt to further corroborate the  information obtained from Justice for each case, we obtained and reviewed  pertinent information about the selected debts and debtors from certain  records made available by the courts and from public sources available  through the Internet, such as property records.

The vast majority of these collections  resulted from asset forfeiture actions and from payments that were made  before the offenders were sent to prison or placed on probation. We found  that the FLUs, which typically become involved in criminal debt collection  after the debt is established at judgment, performed certain debt collection  activities; however, they were not able to reduce the restitution debts  significantly by identifying and liquidating additional assets of the  offenders to pay the victims.

Restitution amounts for  individual cases ranged from over $7 million to more than $400 million.  Court records show that each of the offenders, who pled guilty to engaging  in criminal activity, had been high-ranking officials of companies and  lending institutions or operated their own business. The crimes in these  cases consisted of fraudulently manipulating company sales figures and  inventories to increase stock values or to obtain loans, engaging in  schemes to convert business loan proceeds for personal use, selling  securities to private investors under false pretenses, and illegally sharing in  loan proceeds from a federally insured financial institution. The victims of  the crimes involving the offenders of our selected cases included corporate  shareholders, large lending institutions, and small investors\u2014many of  whom were elderly and had been harmed financially. In addition to the  court-ordered restitution, prison terms ordered by the courts for four of  these offenders ranged from 1 to 5 years followed by 3 to 5 years of  supervised release.

Collections for the individual cases ranged from less than 1 percent to  about 10 percent of the restitution amounts owed. About $24 million of   these collections resulted from asset forfeiture actions, and over   $11 million from payments that were made prior to the offenders\u2019  sentencing. After the judgments were rendered, the FLUs performed  certain debt collection activities, such as filing liens on the offenders\u2019 real  property; issuing restraining notices forbidding the transfer or disposition  of assets; performing title searches; and requesting, obtaining, and  reviewing financial information from the offenders.

At some point prior to the judgments establishing the restitution  debts, each of the offenders either reported having wealth or significant  financial resources to the courts or to Justice, or there were indicators of  such. Specifically, prior to sentencing, one or more of the offenders  reported earning millions of dollars in annual gross income, having millions  of dollars in net worth, or spending thousands of dollars per month on  clothing and entertainment. In addition, court records indicate that certain  of the offenders converted millions of dollars of fraudulently obtained  assets for personal use, established businesses for their children, or held  residential properties worth millions that were located in upscale  communities. In spite of the reported wealth or financial resources or  indications of such, following their judgments, each of the offenders  reported to either the courts or Justice a modest income or net worth and  claimed to have limited financial means to pay restitution debt. Further, at  the time of our file reviews, three of the offenders were on supervised  release and making monthly or yearly payments set by the courts that will  do little to reduce the outstanding balance of their restitution debts, one  offender had stopped making routine monthly payments after supervised  release terminated, and one offender had negotiated a settlement with the  crime victim, which was approved by Justice and the court, for far less than  the initial court-ordered restitution.", "There were minimal, if any, apparent negative consequences to the  offenders for not paying restitution to their victims as initially ordered by  the courts. First, information obtained from the courts and public  documents indicated that the offenders were living in reasonable comfort.  For example, one offender and his immediate family owned and, at the time  of our review, resided in a property worth millions of dollars; another  offender owns a home worth over $1 million; and two offenders took  overseas trips while on supervised release. Second, after probation or  supervised release has expired, the offenders cannot be sent to prison for  failure to pay their restitution debts. According to Justice, although it does  not apply to restitution, the willful failure to pay a fine is a crime of criminal  default, which can result in the offender\u2019s receiving an additional fine of not  more than twice the amount of the unpaid balance of the fine or $10,000,  whichever is greater; being imprisoned not more than 1 year; or both.  However, there is no such similar crime for willful failure to pay restitution.

Justice also stated that the primary focus during the criminal  investigation, prior to judgment, is on the discovery and prosecution of the  offender\u2019s criminal acts rather than on the potential future debt recovery by  the federal government. During the intervals between criminal activities  and the related judgments, Justice acknowledged that dispositions and  circumstances involving the offenders\u2019 assets or the offenders often occur  that create major debt collection challenges for the FLUs. According to  Justice, criminals with any degree of sophistication, especially those  engaged in fraudulent criminal enterprises, commonly dissipate their  criminal gains quickly and in an untraceable manner. Assets acquired  illegally are often rapidly depleted on intangible and excess \u201clifestyle\u201d  expenses. Specifically, travel, entertainment, gambling, clothes, and gifts  are high on the list of means to rapidly dispose of such assets. Moreover,  money stolen from others is rarely invested into easily located or  exchanged assets, such as readily identifiable bank accounts, stocks or  bonds, or real property. Justice emphasized that the initial efforts by  criminal law enforcement investigators, federal prosecutors, and the  probation office promise the greatest opportunity for meaningful recovery  of illegally obtained assets. Therefore, in our view, coordination among the  FLUs and other entities involved in criminal debt collection is critical."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Transfer of Assets", "paragraphs": ["According to Justice, there is no general statutory authority for Justice to  obtain pretrial restraint of assets in order to satisfy a potential criminal  judgment that may result in a restitution debt.

Justice  emphasized that it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the  offender fraudulently transferred assets, which often involves a lengthy  and time-consuming process. Moreover, even when a valid claim is made  against a third party for a fraudulent transfer, the third party may have a  \u201cgood faith\u201d defense if the transfer was accepted in exchange for a  \u201creasonably equivalent value.\u201d", "The challenges encountered in collecting restitution debt from offenders  who may have transferred assets to others through legal or potentially  fraudulent means were evident in our review of selected cases.

At the time of our file review, the FLU was not certain whether  any forfeited assets had been, or could be, applied toward the offender\u2019s  restitution debt.

When a bankruptcy proceeding is initiated  after the criminal judgment, the United States may file a proof of claim in  the bankruptcy proceeding and may have secured status if its lien was  perfected against any of the defendant\u2019s property. However, there may be  other creditors seeking payment from the offender\u2019s estate, including often  the Internal Revenue Service.

Shortly after the judgment, which was rendered over 5 years  ago, the FLU issued a restraining notice to the offender, forbidding the  transfer or disposition of his assets, and filed a lien on certain property.  However, according to the FLU, the ongoing bankruptcy has prevented it  from taking additional collection action. Recently, Justice stated that it had  been advised by the bankruptcy trustee that for this case, most of the  offender\u2019s bankruptcy estate of several million dollars would be distributed  to the victim.

For another case  involving two offenders who were jointly and severally liable for the  restitution debt, one offender had settled his liability for the debt, with the  approval of Justice and the court, by paying the victim far less than the  amount initially ordered by the court. With regard to this offender, Justice  stated that his reported assets and net worth were such that the thought  that additional collection efforts would have positive results was not  considered by the FLU to be reasonable.

EOUSA stated that consistent with our  recommendation and the conference report that accompanied the  Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005, Justice is in the process of  organizing an interagency joint task force to develop a strategic plan for  improving criminal debt collection.", "EOUSA did not specifically comment on our recommendations including  the recommendation that the Attorney General include in the strategic plan  legislative initiatives, operational initiatives, or both that are directed  toward maximizing opportunities to make offenders\u2019 assets available to pay  victims once restitution debts are established by judges. However, EOUSA  did emphasize that current statutes do not provide adequate remedies for  the collection of criminal debt and cited several examples including the  lack of general statutory authority for the United States to obtain pretrial  restraint of assets in order to satisfy a potential criminal judgment that may  result in a restitution debt. Regarding operational initiatives, as stated in  this report, because many of the recommendations we have previously  made to Justice to improve criminal debt collection focused on establishing  policies and procedures, it is important that the policies and procedures be  effectively implemented once they are established.  Moreover, any  multiagency effort to develop a unified strategy for criminal debt collection  will need to address operational issues.", "Both EOUSA and AOUSC provided technical comments that have been  addressed as appropriate in this report.", "As agreed with your office, unless you announce its contents earlier, we  plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its issuance  date.

As discussed in this report, only about $40 million, or about 7 percent, of  the $568 million restitution for these five selected cases had been paid as of  June 2004, and collections for these individual cases ranged from less than  1 percent to about 10 percent of the restitution amounts owed. Prospects  are not good for collecting additional restitution to fully compensate the  crime victims for the selected cases in our study. Regardless of whether  these offenders currently have, or once had, wealth equal to the restitution  amounts, the disparity between restitution owed to the crime victims for  the financial losses they incurred as a result of criminal activity and  amounts paid to the victims by the offenders makes it necessary for Justice  to take advantage of all debt collection opportunities to better achieve the  intent of MVRA, which is to compensate crime victims to the extent of their  financial loss. 2.  EOUSA stated that the USAOs had collected over $4 billion on behalf of  victims of crime over the last 5 years. However, as stated in this report, the  low collection rate (about 7 percent of the ordered restitution) for the  selected cases coincides with overall collection rates for criminal debt as  we have previously reported. In 2004, we reported that according to  Justice\u2019s unaudited records, collections relative to outstanding criminal  debt averaged about 4 percent for fiscal years 2000, 2001, and 2002 (GAO- 04-338). In 2001, we reported that criminal debt collection averaged about 7  percent for fiscal years 1995 through 1999 (GAO-01-664)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Richard T.
