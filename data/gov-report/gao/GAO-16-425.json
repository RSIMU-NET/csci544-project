Among other things, FDA\u2014an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014held 13 public meetings and offered extended comment periods on the rules. However, FDA did not consult with Indian tribes before publication of the proposed rules, as directed by the HHS tribal consultation policy. Under that policy, each HHS agency is to establish its own tribal consultation policy, which should include an accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely input by tribal officials. FDA has begun to develop such a policy and issued a draft in late February 2016. FDA's draft policy, however, does not explicitly provide for early consultation on all rules with tribal implications. Without early consultation, tribes are unable to provide input at a time when it is most likely to have a meaningful impact on FDA's decision making. Moreover, FDA has not established a timetable to guide the policy's finalization, without which FDA risks continued delays.", "FDA has begun to develop plans to ensure compliance with the FSMA-mandated rules through coordinated implementation with nonfederal agencies and is working to overcome related challenges. For example, according to FDA, insufficient data exist on businesses subject to the rules, making it difficult to assign inspection responsibilities, among other things. In response, FDA is taking steps, such as exploring new data sources. In addition, associations of nonfederal officials that GAO interviewed stated that nonfederal agencies have varying legal authorities and regulatory structures. For example, they stated that most nonfederal agencies lack authority to oversee produce, which is needed for coordinated implementation. In response, FDA is taking steps such as funding the National Association of State Departments of Agriculture's development of a model produce rule that states can adopt. Associations suggested that FDA consider opportunities to improve coordinated implementation, including establishing a system to share information on industry compliance and a process to answer questions from regulators on the rules. According to FDA, it is taking steps to implement these and other suggestions. For example, FDA is developing a new system to allow regulators to access information housed in existing FDA information systems before, during, and after an inspection.", "FDA has developed, and begun to administer, a plan for training regulators on the human and animal food rules. As of February 2016, FDA had begun to develop, but not to administer, a plan for training regulators on the produce rule. FDA is working to overcome challenges related to regulator training. For example, one challenge relates to the thousands of regulators who must be trained. FDA plans to, among other things, use a phased training strategy, administering training in 2016 to regulators in areas with the highest concentrations of large businesses, for which compliance is due first; in 2017 to regulators in areas with the highest concentrations of small businesses, for which compliance is due later; and in 2018 to regulators in areas with the highest concentrations of very small businesses, for which compliance is due last."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDA (1) make certain that its tribal consultation policy explicitly provides for early tribal consultation and (2) develop a timetable for finalizing the policy.

According to a September 2013 bulletin from  the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Economic Research  Service, the study that used the more conservative approach estimated  the cost to be $14.1 billion per year. CDC data indicate that as a result of  foodborne illness, roughly 1 in 6 Americans (or 48 million people) get sick  each year, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die. As reflected in figure  1, CDC data also show that the number of reported multistate foodborne  illness outbreaks is increasing. This is notable because multistate  outbreaks constitute a small proportion of total outbreaks but affect  greater numbers of people. For example, according to CDC data, 3  percent of reported outbreaks from 2010 to 2014 were multistate, but they  were associated with 11 percent of illnesses, 34 percent of  hospitalizations, and 56 percent of deaths. CDC cites several potential  contributors to the increase in reported multistate outbreaks, including  greater centralization of food processing practices, wider food distribution,  and improved detection and investigation methods.", "The safety and quality of the U.S. food supply, both imported and  domestic, are governed by a highly complex system stemming from at  least 30 federal laws that are collectively administered by 15 federal  agencies.

FSMA marked a historic turning point by requiring that FDA  focus on preventing rather than reacting to foodborne illnesses. FSMA did  so, in part, by requiring a number of new rules that together provide a  framework for preventing foodborne illness across the food safety system.  Of these rules, those on produce, human food, and animal food took aim  at the entities in the earliest stages of the farm-to-fork continuum (see  illustration of that continuum in fig. 2): the farms that grow and facilities  that process food for human and animal consumption.", "Produce is an important part of a healthy diet but is susceptible to  contamination from numerous sources, including agricultural water,  animal manure, equipment, and agricultural workers. Because produce is  often consumed raw without processing to reduce or eliminate  contaminants, steps to prevent contamination are key to ensuring safe  consumption. Prior to FSMA, there were no enforceable national  standards for on-farm practices related to produce safety. FDA and others  had taken several actions to address produce safety, including issuing  guidance documents and letters to industry, but in spite of these efforts,  produce-associated foodborne illnesses occurred regularly. According to  FDA, from 1996 through 2010, produce accounted for 42.3 percent of all  outbreak-related illnesses linked to FDA-regulated foods.", "The FSMA-mandated rule on produce established the first enforceable  national standards for on-farm growing, harvesting, packing, and holding  of domestic and imported produce. Among other things, the rule  established standards related to agricultural water quality; the use of soil  amendments, such as raw manure; the use of domesticated animals;  intrusion by wild animals; worker training, health, and hygiene; and  sanitation of equipment, tools, and buildings. The rule also established  standards specific to sprouts, which are especially vulnerable to  contamination because of the warm, moist, and nutrient-rich conditions  needed to grow them. The rule included several exemptions. For  example, it does not apply to produce that is rarely consumed raw, such  as asparagus and black beans; produce that is to be consumed on farm;  or produce that is to undergo commercial processing, such as refining  produce into sugar or distilling it into wine, that adequately reduces  contaminants of public health significance.

New and innovative food products are created daily  in response to advances in science and technology as well as consumer  demand. For example, ready-to-eat, refrigerated, and heat-and-serve  foods are more popular than ever. Contamination of processed foods can  come from a wide range of sources, including raw ingredients, processing  equipment, and shipping containers. Once contamination occurs, it can  spread widely because of mass production and global supply chains. For  processed foods that require little to no preparation before consumption,  contaminants can be especially dangerous because consumers may not  take steps such as cooking to reduce or eliminate the hazard.", "Prior to FSMA, FDA had issued various regulations to protect against  contamination of processed foods. For example, FDA required  processors to meet Current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements  (CGMP), which established minimum standards for processing of human  food. Among other things, the standards covered food industry personnel;  operations and equipment; plants, grounds, and facilities; and  warehousing and distribution. However, an FDA work group reported in  2005 that it was unclear whether the CGMPs\u2014last updated in 1986\u2014 adequately addressed new food safety challenges, including more  sophisticated and increasingly automated technologies and newly  recognized contaminants. In addition to requiring processors to meet  CGMPs, FDA required processors of certain food products, such as  seafood and juice, to have programs in place to prevent contamination  through, among other things, monitoring, recordkeeping, verification of  monitoring practices, and corrective actions. However, no such  requirements applied comprehensively across the food processing  industry.", "The FSMA-mandated rule on human food revised existing requirements  for processors in a number of ways. Two key revisions were updated  CGMPs and the establishment, for the first time, of requirements for  contamination prevention programs (known as preventive control  programs) across much of the industry. Among other things, under the  preventive control programs required by the rule, food processors must  develop and implement written plans that identify and evaluate known or  reasonably foreseeable food safety hazards; specify the steps, or  controls, that will be put in place to significantly minimize or prevent the  hazards; specify how the controls will be monitored, verified, and  corrected, as needed, to ensure that they are working; and maintain  records documenting these actions.

In addition, FDA had a program aimed at protecting  against Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (commonly known as mad  cow disease) and had issued CGMPs for medicated animal feed.  However, in 2010, an FDA-led work group issued a report identifying  gaps in the regulation of animal food products, including the lack of  federal regulations to fully address all aspects of producing safe animal  food. The FSMA-mandated animal food rule was designed to fill that gap.  Like the human food rule, it established two sets of requirements\u2014one  relating to CGMPs and one to preventive control programs.

Moreover, FSMA  specifically required FDA to coordinate with state departments of  agriculture in publishing the proposed produce rule. Further, in  recognition of the unique government-to-government relationship  between the federal government and Indian tribes grounded in the  Constitution, separate requirements apply to consultation with tribes.  Specifically, Executive Order 13175 requires federal agencies to have  an accountable process to ensure meaningful and timely input by  tribal officials in developing federal policies that have tribal  implications.

In September  1998, FDA, in cooperation with other federal and nonfederal agencies,  hosted a meeting of food safety officials from all 50 states (referred to as  a 50-state meeting) to examine the idea of integration. Around the same  time, FDA established the National Food Safety System project to  strengthen partnerships among federal and nonfederal agencies to better  ensure safe food and respond to outbreaks.

As part of FDA\u2019s effort to implement  its new plan, FDA hosted its second 50-state meeting in August 2008. At  that meeting, participants reflected on accomplishments made since the  initial 50-state meeting 10 years earlier and concluded that despite  progress in some areas, many obstacles to integration remained.

Three months later, the White House Food Safety Working Group\u2014which  was created in 2009 and stopped meeting after about 2 years\u2014submitted  a report to the President identifying food safety integration as a priority.  In September 2009, FDA again embraced the concept of an integrated  food safety system by publishing a vision statement for achieving  integration. In June of the following year, the National Academy of  Sciences issued a second report on food safety, supporting, among other  things, an integrated food safety system and describing remaining steps  necessary to facilitate such integration.

FDA is involved in a number  of collaborative mechanisms focused on foodborne illness  surveillance and outbreak response. For example, FDA co-chairs the  steering committee of the Food Emergency Response Network, which  integrates the nation\u2019s food-testing laboratories at the federal and  nonfederal levels to better respond to emergencies involving  biological, chemical, or radiological contamination of food. In addition,  FDA coordinates the Electronic Laboratory Exchange Network, a web- based information network that allows federal and nonfederal food  safety officials to compare, share, and coordinate laboratory analysis  findings.

In 2010, 1  year before FSMA was signed into law, the National Academy of  Sciences reported that it agreed with the recommendations of the George  Washington University-led study published the prior year. The study  found that the most fundamental prerequisite for achieving integration  was high-level political commitment to that goal and accountability for  achieving it. The study noted that the absence of an integration mandate  did not by itself preclude collaboration, as evidenced by the extensive  collaboration that already existed, but it meant that in the end officials  were not fully empowered and accountable for integrating their food  safety efforts. Accordingly, the study\u2019s first recommendation was for a  congressional mandate and accountability at the federal level for building  an integrated food safety system.

FDA  indicated in the memorandum that each of the listed departments was  represented during at least one of the 13 meetings. FDA did not,  however, provide detailed information in the memorandum regarding the  specific attendees or the extent or nature of the discussions, making it  difficult to assess whether the requirement was met.", "We contacted officials from 8 of the listed state departments of  agriculture. These officials confirmed that one or more representatives  from each of their departments attended at least one of the meetings  referenced by FDA.

Specifically,  officials from 2 departments characterized the quality as very good, 3  characterized it as good, 2 characterized it as moderately good, and 1  characterized it as very poor. Officials from one of the departments that  characterized the coordination as very good explained that FDA was very  open to discussing states\u2019 concerns. One of the officials that  characterized the coordination as moderately good stated that FDA did  not seek as much input from states as the official would have liked. The  official that characterized the coordination as very poor noted that states  had many outstanding concerns that had not been addressed, including  the produce rule\u2019s complexity and compliance costs.", "We also interviewed officials from two associations that represent state  departments of agriculture. According to one of these associations, FDA  was more willing to discuss its general intent for the rule than has  previously been FDA\u2019s practice, which the association said was helpful,  but this did not constitute coordination. The other association said that  FDA coordinated well with it, holding monthly meetings with the  association since FSMA\u2019s enactment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Did Not Fully Meet Its Tribal Consultation Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["FDA did not fully meet its tribal consultation responsibilities. In particular,  FDA did not consult with tribes throughout all stages of development of  the proposed rules, as is directed under the HHS tribal consultation policy  for all rules with tribal implications where the federal government does not  provide the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance costs incurred  by tribes. The FSMA mandate that FDA develop rules on produce and  human and animal food had several tribal implications. For example,  FSMA authorized and encouraged FDA to leverage tribal agencies,  among other nonfederal agencies, in conducting activities to determine  compliance with all FSMA food safety provisions. Other potential  implications included the effect of compliance costs on the sustainability  of tribal businesses, the effect of produce rule requirements on traditional  farming practices, questions regarding who would be responsible for  ensuring compliance on tribal lands, and the effect of water standards on  tribal water rights.", "Given the tribal implications and the fact that the federal government did  not provide the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance costs  incurred by tribes, FDA should have consulted with tribes before  publishing the proposed rules. Instead, the first formal consultation took  place 1 month after publication of the proposed rule on animal food and  10 months after publication of the proposed rules on produce and human  food. As reflected in figure 4, the proposed rules on produce and human  food were published in January 2013, with an initial comment period set  to end in May 2013. As of April 2013, FDA had conducted no direct  outreach to tribes. On April 4, the National Congress of American Indians  wrote a letter to FDA stressing the need for tribal consultation. On April  24, FDA announced that it would extend the comment period for the  proposed produce and human food rules; the comment periods were  ultimately extended to late November 2013. FDA\u2019s formal efforts to  consult with tribes began with a letter sent by mail in mid-August 2013 to  all federally recognized tribes, notifying them of FDA\u2019s intent to prepare  an environmental impact statement for the produce rule and inviting  consultation on that statement. In mid-September 2013, FDA sent  another letter to all federally recognized tribes, notifying them of a 2-hour  consultation webinar on the FSMA rules to be held with all interested  tribes in early October 2013. FDA subsequently rescheduled the  webinar for early November 2013, the month after FDA published the  proposed rule on animal food. Starting in April 2014, FDA also held four  in-person consultations with some tribes. According to FDA, attendees  were tribes that had requested consultation or that had responded to FDA  invitations to consult.", "FDA acknowledged that its official tribal consultation did not begin prior to  promulgation of the proposed rules but noted that it held public meetings  at which tribes could have provided input. However, meetings for the  general public are not consistent with the government-to-government  relationship and dialogue called for in Executive Order 13175 or the  HHS tribal consultation policy, and at least one federal court has made  that assertion. FDA also stated that tribal consultation can be initiated  when either the agency or tribes identify potential tribal implications but  that no tribal concerns were brought to FDA\u2019s attention until the spring of  2013. FDA stated that once it was notified of tribal concerns, the agency  began taking steps to formally consult with tribal leaders and did so  before the final rules were drafted. The HHS tribal consultation policy  does allow for identification of potential tribal implications by either an  agency or tribes but places the onus on the agency to initiate the  consultation and to ensure that it occurs in a timely manner. Moreover,  early consultation is clearly emphasized in the HHS tribal consultation  policy. In fact, the requirement that consultation occur \u201cthroughout all  stages\u201d of the rulemaking process was specifically added to the HHS  policy when it was revised in December 2010. According to HHS, this  change was made to ensure that tribal concerns are heard and that  responses are given in a timely manner whenever possible.", "Under the HHS tribal consultation policy, each agency within HHS must  establish its own tribal consultation policy, which should include an  accountable process\u2014one that among other things, measures and  reports on the results and outcomes of the agency\u2019s tribal consultation  performance\u2014to ensure meaningful and timely input by Indian tribes. A  senior HHS official told us that each agency within HHS that does not  have its own consultation policy, such as FDA, follows the HHS policy.  However, the HHS policy establishes a minimum set of requirements and  expectations\u2014including collaboration with tribes on meeting development  and reporting on consultation outcomes\u2014and directs agencies to  establish their own processes to ensure compliance with those directives  and expectations, which FDA has not done. We discussed this issue with  FDA officials several times from July 2015 through February 2016. On  each occasion, these officials stated that they were in the process of  developing a draft tribal consultation policy but did not have a timetable  for finalizing the policy. On February 29, 2016, FDA released its draft  tribal consultation policy and published a notice in the Federal Register  inviting comments through May 31, 2016. FDA also sent the draft by  mail to all federally recognized tribes and notified the tribes of a  teleconference to be held on April 21 to provide an overview of the draft  and to hear comments and answer questions about it.", "We reviewed the draft policy and noted that unlike the HHS policy, it did  not explicitly provide for early consultation with tribes on all rules with  tribal implications where the federal government does not provide the  funds necessary to pay the direct compliance costs incurred by tribes,  including before promulgation of proposed regulations. For example,  whereas the HHS policy discusses consultation \u201cthroughout all stages of  the process of developing the proposed regulation,\u201d the draft FDA policy  removes \u201cproposed\u201d from this statement. According to FDA officials, they  did not intend to exclude early consultation and instead consider early  consultation to be implicitly included in the phrase \u201cthroughout the  process of developing the regulation.\u201d However, without early consultation  explicitly provided for\u2014as it is in the HHS policy\u2014there is a risk that it  may not occur. According to FDA, the most frequent comment made by  tribes and tribal organizations on the FSMA rules, generally, was that  FDA should have done more to consult with the tribes when the proposed  FSMA rules were being drafted. FDA\u2019s draft tribal consultation policy does  not explicitly ensure that this concern will be addressed in future  rulemaking. Courts have found that early consultation is important  because, by the time an agency has published a proposed rule, the  agency has already narrowed down and largely determined the regulatory  approach it plans to take. Going forward, the final rule is required to be  a logical outgrowth of what the agency has previously proposed.  Consultation before publication of a proposed rule allows for input at a  time when it is most likely to have the greatest impact on the agency\u2019s  decision making and also allows for public comment and discourse on the  results of that input.", "In addition, as of February 2016, FDA still did not have a timetable for  finalizing its tribal consultation policy. Our body of work has shown that  timetables with milestones and interim steps can be used to show  progress toward implementing efforts or to make adjustments to those  efforts when necessary, and that without defined tasks and milestones, it  is difficult for an agency to set priorities, use resources efficiently,  measure progress, and provide management a means to monitor this  progress. Developing a draft tribal consultation policy and releasing it for  comment are good first steps, but without setting a timetable with  milestones and interim steps, it will be difficult for FDA to set priorities,  use resources efficiently, measure progress, and provide management a  means to monitor this progress in finalizing the policy. FDA therefore risks  continued delays in establishing a process to ensure meaningful and  timely tribal consultation. As a November 2009 presidential memorandum  on tribal consultation states, \u201cistory has shown that failure to include  the voices of tribal officials in formulating policy affecting their  communities has all too often led to undesirable and, at times,  devastating and tragic results. By contrast, meaningful dialogue between  Federal officials and tribal officials has greatly improved Federal policy  toward Indian tribes. Consultation is a critical ingredient of a sound and  productive Federal-tribal relationship.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FDA Has Begun to Develop Plans for Coordinated Rule Implementation and Is Working to Overcome Challenges", "paragraphs": ["FDA has begun to develop plans to ensure compliance with the FSMA- mandated rules on produce, human food, and animal food through  coordinated implementation with nonfederal agencies.

Under this cooperative agreement, NASDA is, among  other things, developing a plan that will outline processes for state  agriculture departments to consider as they develop regulatory programs  for the produce rule, with applicability to the other FSMA-mandated rules  as well.

This could include funding for start- up costs incurred in developing new regulatory structures for overseeing  produce.

This, in turn, required the development of  entirely new regulator training courses on produce standards and animal  food CGMPs and preventive controls and updated courses on human  food CGMPs. In addition, because the produce industry has not been  subject to routine regulatory inspections to date, FDA officials and  association representatives explained that the produce training courses  will need to train regulators on how to interact with an industry that is  unaccustomed, and potentially resistant, to government oversight.

FSMA mandated, among other  things, that FDA take steps that once taken, would better integrate its  food safety oversight with that of nonfederal agencies. Integrating food  safety oversight across federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial  jurisdictions is a daunting task that is complicated by numerous  coordination challenges. FDA has demonstrated progress working with  nonfederal agencies to address these challenges, but many hurdles  remain as FDA continues its work to implement the FSMA-mandated  rules on produce, human food, and animal food.", "FSMA\u2019s mandated steps related to integration touch on areas including  rulemaking. FDA\u2019s rulemaking is also subject to other laws and executive  orders requiring consultation with nonfederal agencies. We found that  FDA took steps to work with nonfederal agencies on developing the  FSMA-mandated rules on produce, human food, and animal food and  developing plans for coordinated implementation of those rules. However,  FDA did not consult with tribes throughout all stages of developing the  proposed rules, as is directed by HHS\u2019s tribal consultation policy for all  rules with tribal implications where the federal government does not  provide the funds necessary to pay the direct compliance costs incurred  by tribes. In particular, FDA did not consult with tribes before publication  of the proposed rules. Instead, FDA\u2019s first formal consultation took place  1 month after it published the proposed animal food rule and 10 months  after it published the proposed produce and human food rules.", "Under the HHS tribal consultation policy, each agency within HHS must  establish a tribal consultation policy, which should include an accountable  process to ensure meaningful and timely input by tribal officials.

FDA has  begun to develop such a policy and issued a draft in late February 2016.  FDA\u2019s draft policy, however, does not explicitly provide for early  consultation with tribes on all rules with tribal implications where the  federal government does not provide the funds necessary to pay the  direct compliance costs incurred by tribes, including before promulgation  of proposed regulations. Without early consultation, tribes are unable to  provide input at a time when it is most likely to have a meaningful impact  on the agency\u2019s decision making. Moreover, FDA has not established a  timetable to guide the policy\u2019s finalization. Developing a draft policy is a  good first step, but without setting a timetable, with milestones and interim  steps, it will be difficult for FDA to set priorities, use resources efficiently,  measure progress, and provide management a means to monitor this  progress in finalizing the policy.
