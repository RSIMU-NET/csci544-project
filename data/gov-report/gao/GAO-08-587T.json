The EAC was established by Comptroller General David Walker to provide a consolidated forum for him to meet with representatives from the various employee liaison groups (e.g. Advisory Council for Persons with Disabilities, Blacks In Government, Gay and Lesbian Employee Association, etc.) so that these groups could voice the concerns of their constituency groups. He also decided to include representatives from each of the staff positions (i.e. Administrative Professional Support Staff (APSS), attorneys, and each of the Band levels). Consequently, the EAC was chartered in January 2000 to serve as an advisory body to the Comptroller General and other senior executives by seeking and conveying the views and concerns of the individual employee groups they represent, proposing solutions to those concerns where appropriate, providing input by assessing and commenting on GAO policies, procedures, plans and practices, and communicating issues and concerns of the CG and senior managers to employees."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In general, Band IIA staff reported more unfavorable responses to many of the topics covered in this survey (Band II restructuring, the Watson Wyatt studies -analyst and APSS, market-based pay, and overall GAO climate) than staff in other bands and positions.

The highest nonresponse was from  Asian employees (the number who responded and identified themselves as  Asian represents only 40% of those eligible) and African Americans (the  number who responded and identified themselves as African American  represents only 49% of those eligible).

Specifically, 19% of  APSS staff reported participating, while only 4% of analysts and 8% of  attorneys reported participating.", "Only 4% of all respondents at GAO prior to that date reported being  interviewed by Watson Wyatt. More APSS than other staff reported being  interviewed (21%). Of particular note, no Band I or Band II respondents  reported being interviewed by Watson Wyatt.

Similarly, 81% of respondents also felt that employee  input on the transition was ultimately only slightly or not at all considered.  42% responded that employee input was not at all considered.  57% of all respondents at GAO prior to January 2006 felt the level of  transparency of the Watson Wyatt study to be very or somewhat  unreasonable. Similarly, 58% also felt that the level of transparency of the  GAO decision-making process was somewhat or very unreasonable.  Generally, the more years of service a respondent had at GAO, the more  likely he or she was to report feeling the GAO decision-making process  was somewhat or very unreasonable. 75% of respondents with over 20  years of service felt this way compared to 55% or respondents with 2 years  or less.  46% of survey respondents felt generally dissatisfied or very dissatisfied  with GAO\u2019s market-based pay system compared to 34% of survey  respondents who were generally or very satisfied. 20% of respondents  reported that they were neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.", "There were notable differences in dissatisfaction level based on position,  age, and race.
