The stated goal of subvention is to implement an alternative for delivering accessible and quality care to Medicare-eligible military retirees and certain Medicare-eligible veterans, without increasing the cost to DOD or VA, or to Medicare. In principle, Medicare-eligible military retirees who enrolled in the subvention program would get higher priority at military facilities than before, permitting them to get Medicare-covered care from DOD\u2014a new alternative to retirees\u2019 current Medicare options. Similarly, proposals have surfaced to allow certain Medicare-eligible veterans to use their Medicare benefits at VA facilities. Subvention could allow DOD and VA to augment appropriated funds with Medicare payments and to use excess capacity where it exists. Medicare might gain because under subvention it would pay DOD and VA less than the rate paid to private Medicare providers and managed care plans.", "The 3-year DOD demonstration involves about 30,000 enrolled retirees and limits Medicare payments to DOD to at most $65 million a year. A nationwide DOD subvention program with all eligibles participating could potentially provide military health care to at least 600,000 retirees and might generate, by one estimate, as much as $2 billion a year in Medicare payments to DOD. (Experience to estimate the percentage of eligibles who would enroll does not exist.) In VA, the potential may be even greater.", "These outcomes are not, however, guaranteed, so the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) authorized a large-scale, 3-year demonstration of DOD subvention and directed GAO to evaluate the demonstration\u2019s results.

We are currently surveying approximately 20,000 military retirees, dependents, and survivors so we can profile the characteristics of those who enrolled and did not enroll, their access to health care, and their satisfaction with it. We are also analyzing the costs to DOD and to Medicare\u2014compared with what the costs would have been without the demonstration\u2014for the 125,000 people eligible for the demonstration.

Most important, the demonstration\u2019s final results, in terms of access to health care, quality of patient care, and costs to DOD, Medicare, and retirees, will not be known until the evaluation is completed, several months after the end of the demonstration in December 2000.", "DOD\u2019s early experience with subvention does offer insights if proposals are acted on to permit Medicare subvention for VA. In particular, it would need to consider, in collaboration with the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), how to determine its baseline costs and payment rules, as well as the need for good data for implementation, management, and controlling costs. Moreover, VA would need to make its regular enrollment of veterans who wish to use VA health care services interface smoothly with subvention demonstration enrollment. VA would also need to be concerned about potential crowding-out of other, currently higher-priority veterans by subvention enrollees.

However, this payment mechanism may not be appropriate over the longer term for an extended or expanded subvention program.
