The objectives were to (1) assess agencies' progress in achieving savings from their IT reform efforts, (2) evaluate agencies' plans to reinvest their savings, and (3) evaluate how selected agencies have reinvested their savings and governance processes to oversee the reinvestments. GAO assessed 26 agencies' cost savings and avoidance documentation, evaluated 27 agencies' (including the Smithsonian Institution) reinvestment plans against OMB's guidance, and compared 4 of the agencies' governance processes against best practices. The 4 agencies were selected, in part, because they had the highest dollar amounts of proposed IT reinvestments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-four of the 26 federal agencies participating in the Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) information technology (IT) reform initiatives reported achieving an estimated total of $3.6 billion dollars in cost savings and avoidances between fiscal years 2011 and 2014. Slightly more than half (or about $2.0 billion) of the savings and avoidances were from data center consolidation and optimization efforts. Notably, of the $3.6 billion total, the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Treasury, and the Social Security Administration accounted for about $2.5 billion (or 69 percent).", "Most agencies did not fully meet OMB's requirements to submit reinvestment plan information. Of the 27 agencies required to submit reinvestment plans (including one-time and ongoing plans), 5 agencies had fully implemented OMB's guidance, while the remaining 22 had only partially implemented it. For example, most agencies had not fully implemented OMB's guidance for submitting one-time fiscal year 2014 IT reduction and reinvestment plans as part of OMB's \u201ccut and reinvest\u201d effort. As a result, agencies' plans were substantially short of OMB's overall fiscal year 2014 targets: $3.0 billion in proposed reductions and $2.1 billion in proposed reinvestments, compared to OMB's targets of $7.6 billion in reductions and as much as $7.6 billion in reinvestments. Agencies provided varied reasons for not meeting OMB's requirements, such as that their components had not fully tracked and reported how their savings were to be reinvested. Until agencies complete their ongoing reinvestment plans, they will be challenged to ensure that their considerable savings are being used in the most efficient and effective manner possible.", "Four selected agencies\u2014the Departments of Education, Interior, Labor, and the Social Security Administration\u2014had documented key governance processes to guide the development of their fiscal year 2014 budget submission, which included proposed IT reinvestments of $350 million. However, none of the four agencies had tracked the reinvestment performance results. They provided varied reasons for not doing so, and two agencies noted the lack of visibility into their components' reinvestments. The lack of performance tracking is also due to OMB not requiring agencies to document actual results. In addition, OMB has not defined targets for reinvestments beyond fiscal year 2014. Until OMB requires agencies to track actual reinvestment performance and defines targets, it will be limited in its ability to ensure that agencies are actually reinvesting funds as planned and may not be able to hold them accountable. Finally, without improved tracking, selected agencies may lack assurance that their components are reinvesting in areas consistent with agency-wide goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that agencies complete their IT savings reinvestment plans and improve tracking, and that OMB define targets for agency reinvestment and require that agencies complete their plans and track actual reinvestment performance.

According  to OMB\u2019s guidance, reductions were to be in duplicative,  underperforming, or lower-priority investments, while reinvestments were  to be in innovative solutions that would, among other things, produce a  favorable return on investment within 18 months or demonstrably improve  citizen services or administrative efficiencies.", "Given the importance of OMB\u2019s IT reform efforts, you asked us to review  agencies\u2019 savings from such efforts and determine how agencies are  reinvesting their savings.

This documentation included quarterly status reports to OMB and other  agency-developed spreadsheets and reporting tools. We then identified  the total agency-reported savings and avoidances achieved from fiscal  years 2011 to 2014. To address our second objective, we compared the  26 PortfolioStat agencies\u2019 long-range (e.g., 3-5 year) reinvestment plans,  as documented in their information resource management (IRM) strategic  plans, to requirements documented in OMB\u2019s March 2013 PortfolioStat  memorandum.

To help agencies  manage their IT more effectively, reduce duplication, and achieve cost  savings, OMB implemented a series of initiatives beginning in 2010:", "Data Center Consolidation and Optimization. In February 2010, the  Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) established the Federal Data  Center Consolidation Initiative (FDCCI) to address the growing  number of federal data centers. This initiative\u2019s four high-level goals  were to reduce the overall energy and real estate footprint of  government data centers; reduce the cost of data center hardware,  software, and operations; increase the overall IT security posture of  the government; and shift IT investments to more efficient computing  platforms and technologies. OMB estimates that the initiative has the  potential to provide about $3 billion in savings by the end of 2015. In  March 2013, OMB issued a memorandum that expanded FDCCI to  include measuring the extent to which agencies have optimized their  core data centers in areas such as energy, labor, and storage, and  subsequently released a set of 11 data center optimization metrics to  measure agency progress.", "IT Reform Plan. In December 2010, the Federal CIO established a 25- Point IT Reform Plan designed to address challenges in IT  acquisition, improve operational efficiencies, and deliver more IT  value to the American taxpayer. The plan set forth action items and  required activities to consolidate the growing number of federal data  centers, shift to increased use of cloud computing, and promote the  use of shared service solutions. In addition, as part of an effort to  reduce the risk associated with IT acquisitions, the plan calls for  federal IT programs to deploy capabilities or functionality in release  cycles no longer than 12 months, and ideally, less than 6 months.", "Cloud Computing Strategy. In order to accelerate the adoption of  cloud computing solutions across the government, OMB\u2019s 25-Point IT  Reform Plan included a \u201cCloud First\u201d policy that required each agency  CIO to fully migrate three services to a cloud solution by June 2012,  and implement cloud-based solutions whenever a secure, reliable,  and cost-effective cloud option exists. Building on this requirement, in  February 2011, OMB issued the Federal Cloud Computing Strategy,  which provided definitions of cloud computing services; benefits of  cloud services, such as accelerating data center consolidations; case  studies to support agencies\u2019 migration to cloud computing; and roles  and responsibilities for federal agencies. According to OMB, shifting  from building custom systems to adopting cloud technologies and  shared solutions will improve the government\u2019s operational  efficiencies and result in substantial cost savings.", "PortfolioStat. In March 2012, OMB launched the PortfolioStat  initiative, which requires agencies to conduct an annual agency-wide  IT portfolio review to, among other things, reduce commodity IT  spending and demonstrate how its IT investments align with the  agency\u2019s mission and business functions. PortfolioStat is designed  to assist agencies in assessing the current maturity of their IT portfolio  management process, make decisions on eliminating duplication, and  move to shared solutions in order to maximize the return on IT  investments across the portfolio. OMB reported that the PortfolioStat  effort has the potential to save the government $2.5 billion between  fiscal years 2013 and 2015 by consolidating and eliminating  duplicative systems.", "IT Shared Services Strategy. In May 2012, building on a requirement  established in its 25-Point IT Reform Plan, OMB released its Federal  IT Shared Services Strategy. The strategy requires agencies to use  shared services\u2014IT functions that are provided for consumption by  multiple organizations within or between federal agencies\u2014for IT  service delivery in order to increase return on investment, eliminate  waste and duplication, and improve the effectiveness of IT solutions.  Examples of commodity IT areas to consider migrating to a shared  environment, as described in the strategy, include software licenses,  e-mail systems, and human resource systems.

More specifically, agencies were required to reduce agency  spending in the following IT areas: duplicative commodity IT  investments or contracts; underperforming projects or investments of  any type; and lower-value or lower-priority investments of any type.  Regarding reinvestments, agencies were required to propose  reinvestments that were expected to demonstrate a favorable return  on investment (quantitative or qualitative) to the agency within 18  months from the enactment of the fiscal year 2014 appropriations.

These key initiatives include FDCCI, PortfolioStat, and cloud computing.", "Between July 2011 and September 2014, we issued several reports and  testified on agency efforts to consolidate federal data centers and  achieve cost savings. Most recently, in September 2014, we reported that  19 of the 24 agencies that participate in FDCCI collectively reported  achieving an estimated $1.1 billion in cost savings between fiscal years  2011 and 2013, and that, by 2017, that figure was estimated to rise to a  total of about $5.3 billion. However, we found that planned savings may  be higher because six agencies that reported closing as many as 67 data  centers reported limited or no savings.", "In addition, 11 of the 21 agencies with planned cost savings had  underreported their fiscal years 2012 through 2015 figures to OMB by  approximately $2.2 billion. While several agencies noted communication  issues as the reason for this, others did not provide a reason. We  concluded that until agencies fully report their savings, the $5.3 billion in  total savings will be understated. Accordingly, we recommended that  OMB assist agencies in reporting savings, and that agencies fully report  their consolidation cost savings. OMB and the agencies to which we  made recommendations generally agreed and described planned actions  to implement them. Further, Defense noted in a November 2014  response to our report that, in addition to the $2.6 billion in cost savings  planned by fiscal year 2017, the department expects that figure to  increase to $4.7 billion in future years as efficiencies are gained.", "We have also previously reported on the implementation of OMB\u2019s  PortfolioStat initiative. Specifically, in November 2013, we determined  that additional OMB and agency actions were needed to achieve savings  from OMB\u2019s PortfolioStat initiative. For example, although all of the 26  federal agencies that were required to participate in the PortfolioStat  initiative had fully addressed four of seven key requirements established  by OMB, only 1 of the 26 agencies addressed all the requirements.  Further, agencies had not developed action plans that addressed all  elements, such as criteria for identifying wasteful, low-value, or  duplicative investments, or migrated two commodity IT areas\u2014such as  enterprise IT systems and infrastructure\u2014to a shared service by the end  of 2012.", "In addition, we reported that OMB\u2019s estimate of about 100 consolidation  opportunities and a potential $2.5 billion in savings from the PortfolioStat  initiative was understated because, among other things, it did not include  estimates from the Departments of Defense and Justice. Our analysis,  which included these estimates, showed that, collectively, the 26  agencies were reporting 204 opportunities and at least $5.8 billion in  potential savings through fiscal year 2015. To address these  shortcomings, we made a total of 64 recommendations, including that  OMB require agencies to fully disclose limitations in CIOs\u2019 ability to  exercise their authority and that 24 agencies take steps to improve their  PortfolioStat implementation. OMB agreed with some of the  recommendations and disagreed with others; likewise, responses from  the 24 other agencies we made recommendations to varied.", "More recently, in April 2015, we reviewed OMB\u2019s second iteration of  PortfolioStat and reported that agencies had achieved a total of  approximately $1.1 billion in PortfolioStat-related savings during fiscal  years 2013 and 2014. However, agencies\u2019 total planned PortfolioStat  savings from fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2015 had decreased by about  66 percent (from at least $5.8 billion to approximately $2 billion)  compared to what they had reported in 2013. In addition, agencies had  not consistently included savings from FDCCI in their PortfolioStat  reporting, which means that the total savings amount is understated.  Finally, the report notes that, while three selected agencies were able to  explain how they reinvested their PortfolioStat savings, they were not  always able to provide support for how such savings were used. We  recommended, among other things, that OMB ensure that its reports to  Congress accurately reflect savings generated from all PortfolioStat  initiatives, including those associated with FDCCI, and require agencies  to document how such savings are being reinvested. OMB agreed with  our recommendations and described plans to implement them.", "We have also reported on agencies\u2019 cloud computing efforts. For  example, we reported in September 2014 that, while agencies had  made progress in implementing OMB\u2019s \u201cCloud First\u201d policy, additional  opportunities for implementing cloud services and achieving savings  needed to be pursued. Specifically, although the seven agencies  reviewed had increased their cloud computing services since we last  reported on their progress in 2012, the overall increase in their IT  budgets was just 1 percent. We determined that the relatively small  increase in cloud spending was attributed, in part, to the fact that these  agencies collectively had not considered cloud computing services for  about 67 percent of their investments, which was inconsistent with OMB\u2019s  policy that calls for cloud solutions to be considered first whenever a  secure, reliable, and cost-effective option exists regardless of where the  investment is in its life cycle.", "We also found that the seven agencies collectively reported cost savings  of about $96 million from the implementation of cloud services, but that  other cloud services implemented did not save money, in part, because  the associated costs negated any savings. We concluded that, until the  agencies fully assess all their IT investments, they will not be able to  achieve the resulting benefits of operational efficiencies and cost savings.  To address these shortcomings, we recommended that the seven  agencies assess the IT investments identified in the report that have yet  to be evaluated for suitability for cloud computing services. The seven  agencies generally agreed with our recommendations.", "Finally, in light of the project failures that continue to plague the federal  government and the duplicative and wasteful management of IT  operations, in the February 2015 update to our High-Risk List, we  designated the management of IT acquisitions and operations as a new  government-wide high-risk area. In doing so, we emphasized the  importance of federal agencies expeditiously implementing the  requirements of the December 2014 IT acquisition reform legislation to (1)  improve the transparency and management of IT acquisitions and  operations across the government and (2) strengthen CIOs\u2019 authority to  provide needed direction and oversight. Our High-Risk List update also  notes that, beyond implementing legislation, OMB and the agencies need  to continue to implement our previous recommendations in order to  improve their ability to effectively and efficiently invest in IT.

We attributed these  inconsistencies to several reasons, including that agencies did not always  follow OMB\u2019s instructions regarding what savings information to report, or  when to report it, and that several agencies had stated that their reported  savings were not always included in OMB\u2019s report to Congress. We  concluded that, until these inconsistencies are addressed, it will be  difficult to determine the extent to which the PortfolioStat initiative is  meeting its goals. As a result, we recommended that OMB ensure that its  reports to Congress related to the results of IT reform efforts accurately  reflect savings generated from all PortfolioStat initiatives, including those  associated with FDCCI. OMB agreed with our recommendation.", "The importance of agencies identifying and reporting their cost savings to  OMB, and OMB reporting such savings to Congress, has also been  emphasized in recent legislation.

For example, DHS was required by OMB\u2019s guidance to  submit $563 million in reductions and provided almost $574 million in  reductions, in areas such as enterprise IT systems and data centers. The  department also proposed reinvesting $316 million of its savings across  39 IT investments aimed at improving shared services, security posture,  and citizen services.

For example, OPM met the guidance for providing  reductions amounting to 10 percent and proposing reinvestments for at  least half of that amount, but did not provide a description of the favorable  return on investment for each of its reinvestments. According to OPM\u2019s  Chief of Investment Management, Operations Technology Management,  the agency\u2019s offices did not provide a description of the favorable return  on investment, so the information could not be provided in the  department\u2019s submission.", "As another example, Energy did not meet OMB\u2019s guidance for the  percentage of reductions and reinvestments, but did provide complete  supplemental information for the reductions and reinvestments that the  department reported. Energy officials acknowledged that the department  did not meet the target IT reduction set by OMB, but stated that they felt  that the target did not account for significant IT reductions already  achieved in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 in response to other OMB and  internal IT cost savings initiatives. Officials further noted that several  programs had just completed significant IT reduction efforts in the  previous years and found it difficult to identify additional reductions for the  fiscal year 2014 budget submission. Similarly, NASA also did not meet  OMB\u2019s guidance for reductions and reinvestments, but provided complete  supplemental information. According to NASA officials, the agency could  not meet the target for reinvestment due to having already completed  many of its projects that would have provided OMB\u2019s expected benefits  and that the agency was working with its Office of the Chief Technologist  to identify new IT investments for future years.", "Five agencies did not meet OMB\u2019s guidance because they did not meet  OMB\u2019s one-time reduction and reinvestment targets for fiscal year 2014  and did not provide supplemental information for all required fields.

For example, a  Department of Justice official from the Office of the CIO stated that the  department had made significant reductions in its IT spending in the  previous two budget cycles and did the best it could to meet OMB\u2019s  guidance, but ultimately fell short. In addition, the Department of Housing  and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD) Deputy CIO for Customer Relations and  Performance Management stated that the department had focused on  proposing reductions that were possible to achieve as opposed to  reductions that were not feasible. Although the department did not meet  OMB\u2019s targets, the official added that, since OMB did not convey any  objection to HUD\u2019s approach, the department inferred that OMB did not  have any objection to the reductions and reinvestments that HUD  provided.", "As another example, EPA officials stated that their initial submission was  rejected by OMB because the information was not submitted according to  OMB\u2019s guidance. As a result, the agency submitted a revised version to  address OMB\u2019s feedback; however, our assessment of that version  showed that it did not meet OMB\u2019s guidance. Finally, Veterans Affairs  (VA) officials stated that the department believed that the OMB target did  not take into consideration spending reductions made in prior years. As a  result, VA submitted $120 million in proposed spending reductions  (compared to its target of $316 million) for fiscal year 2014 that the  Deputy Assistant Secretary believed were appropriate. The officials  stated that the $196 million difference was funding that was being spent  on mission-related priorities (instead of IT-related priorities).", "The two agencies that did not submit one-time fiscal year 2014 reduction  and reinvestment plan information\u2014Defense and HHS\u2014provided varying  reasons for not doing so. Specifically, rather than submit the required  documentation, Defense requested an exemption from the requirement  from OMB on the basis that an arbitrary 10 percent reduction was not in  the best interests of national security and also cited system limitations  that prevented the department from providing the requested information.  Defense officials also stated that OMB\u2019s guidance on what information to  include in the reduction and reinvestment plans was issued too late to  make changes to the department\u2019s budgeting process in order to provide  the requested information. In addition, HHS did not submit fiscal year  2014 IT reduction and reinvestment plans. According to HHS officials, the  department requested additional guidance from OMB on how the  reductions and proposed reinvestments submitted would be incorporated  into the department\u2019s budget request, but did not receive a response, so  the department chose not to submit the required documentation.", "Because not all agencies followed OMB\u2019s guidance, the totals of  agencies\u2019 proposed reductions and reinvestments were substantially  short of OMB\u2019s overall goals for its \u201ccut and reinvest\u201d initiative.  Specifically, agencies should have submitted a total of $7.6 billion in  reductions and proposed reinvestments between $3.8 and $7.6 billion.  Instead, agencies collectively proposed reductions of about $3.0 billion  and reinvestments of $2.1 billion in their fiscal year 2014 budget  submissions. The difference is primarily due to two agencies\u2014Defense,  which was expected to propose about $3.5 billion in reductions and  between $1.75 and $3.5 billion in reinvestments, and HHS, which was  expected to propose $662 million in reductions and between $331 and  $662 million in reinvestments.

In addition, the lack of agency compliance with  OMB\u2019s guidance is also due, in large part, to OMB not enforcing the  requirements in its guidance. Most agencies reported that they did not  receive explicit approval or disapproval of their IT reduction and  reinvestment proposals. As a result, many of the agencies considered  their submissions to be approved once the budget request submission  process had been concluded, even in cases where they did not meet the  expected reduction or reinvestment targets. According to staff from  OMB\u2019s Office of E-Government and Information Technology, all agencies,  except for Defense, adhered to the requirements for the IT reduction and  reinvestment plan submission; however, OMB was unable to provide  documentation to support this claim.

The resulting $16.4 million  in cost avoidances since 2012 has been used to help fund projects  related to data center operations, as well as other mission-related  projects and initiatives. In addition, the National Archives and Records  Administration has saved $6.0 million in Electronic Records Archives  activities in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 that it plans to use to help adapt  its archives into a cloud-based solution to support increases in the volume  of records managed. As another example, SSA has expanded use of its  Electronic Case Analysis Tool that automatically identifies and speeds the  processing of people\u2019s cases with severe medical conditions.

The remaining 6 agencies provided  reinvestment categories and the related reinvestment details for a portion,  but not all, of their cost savings and avoidance initiatives.

However, continued discrepancies of more than $484 million in the  savings being reported by agencies and those being reported in OMB\u2019s  quarterly reports to Congress indicates that agencies are still not  reporting all of their savings to OMB. OMB and agency implementation of  our prior recommendations in this area could help ensure that agencies  report all data center consolidation savings, and that OMB\u2019s quarterly  reports to Congress accurately reflect savings achieved. Ensuring  accurate reporting is increasingly important in light of the December 2014  IT acquisition reform legislation that specifically addresses agency and  OMB reporting of IT reform-related savings.", "The extent of savings reported through fiscal year 2014 makes evident  the increasing importance for agencies to establish complete  reinvestment plans.

We compared the cost savings and avoidances  reported to us by agencies with cost savings identified in OMB\u2019s quarterly  reports to Congress on the status of IT reform efforts. In addition, we  interviewed agency officials to confirm our understanding of their reported  savings and avoidances and obtain additional supporting information  regarding the steps that the agency took to ensure the reliability of its  figures and validate these figures. We also discussed with agency  officials any discrepancies or potential errors identified during our review  of their supporting documentation to determine the cause or request  additional information. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable to report on agencies\u2019 cost savings and avoidances achieved to  date. However, as part of our reliability assessment, we identified issues  with the reliability of OMB\u2019s quarterly reports to Congress, including that  agencies\u2019 cost savings and avoidances were not being fully reflected in  OMB\u2019s report. We have highlighted this issue in our report.", "To evaluate the extent to which agencies have established plans to  reinvest their savings, we compared 26 PortfolioStat agencies\u2019 long-range  (e.g., 3-5 year) reinvestment plan information in their information resource  management (IRM) strategic plans to OMB\u2019s guidance, as documented in  OMB\u2019s March 2013 PortfolioStat memorandum.

We chose these agencies because, of the agencies with  the highest percentage of proposed reinvestment (i.e., 100 percent  reinvestment of proposed reductions), these agencies had the four  highest proposed reinvestment dollar amounts. We compared the  governance processes used by these agencies to develop their fiscal  year 2014 budget submission (including planned IT reductions and  reinvestments) to key practices for establishing investment boards in our  IT Investment Management Framework. We also analyzed agencies\u2019  actual performance against their proposed fiscal year 2014 IT reductions  and reinvestments.
