The Congress, while expressing support for DOD\u2019s plan to reengineer the process, is concerned that the reengineered program could adversely affect the moving industry, particularly small business. Therefore, the Congress directed DOD to report on small business concerns prior to implementing a pilot test. Since this report did not satisfactorily address congressional concerns about the impact this might have on small business, the Congress directed DOD to convene a DOD/industry working group to develop a mutually agreeable program to pilot test.", "Although the working group came to a consensus on many issues, including a set of program goals, it could not reach agreement on the approach to take for the pilot test. Consequently, the two sides presented separate proposals.

All these problems contributed to a poor quality of service for persons using the system.", "Consequently, DOD proposed reengineering the personal property program as a quality-of-life initiative. Its primary goals were to substantially improve and put on par with corporate customer standards, the quality its military personnel and their families received from DOD\u2019s contracted movers; simplify the total process\u2014from arranging the moves to settling the claims; and base the program on business processes characteristic of world-class customers and suppliers.", "Generally, DOD must acquire the goods and services it needs through the competitive acquisition system consisting of the statutes in chapter 137 of title 10 of the United States Code and the primary implementing regulations contained in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). However, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 13712, the acquisition of transportation services of a common carrier through the use of a government bill of lading is not subject to the acquisition laws. Instead, these services have been acquired based upon published rates in accordance with procedures contained in DOD transportation regulations.", "A key feature of MTMC\u2019s proposal to reengineer the personal property program is to simplify the process of acquiring transportation services and to bring it in line with the government\u2019s acquisition of most other services by using multiple award, fixed-price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity-type contracts awarded under the competitive acquisition system. MTMC\u2019s proposed contracts would cover statewide services and provide for a base and several option years. The solicitations for the contracts would be open to all responsible offerors, including carriers, forwarders, and relocation companies. Awardees would be selected in accordance with solicitation evaluation factors, which will include such elements as technical or operational requirements, past performance, subcontract plan, and price.", "To achieve these goals and to comply with congressional direction, MTMC is proposing to begin a pilot test. The plan is to begin the test in early 1997 and run it for at least a year. Fifty percent of the DOD household goods and unaccompanied baggage moving from the test area\u2014North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida\u2014to all other states, except Alaska and Hawaii, and to Europe, would be included in the test. The other 50 percent would continue moving in the existing program.", "Industry objected to MTMC\u2019s proposal, particularly because of what it perceived as the negative impact that MTMC\u2019s proposal would have on small business moving companies.

In the domestic program, traffic is distributed on the basis of low-to-high rate, with highest quality scored carriers given the first 20,000 pounds.

Following that meeting, on June 24, 1996, MTMC provided the working group with a draft request for proposals summary. The summary described a standardized program for handling both domestic and international shipments. It laid out MTMC\u2019s proposed acquisition strategy and the major events that MTMC expected to occur in the proposed acquisition process. The MTMC proposal is the result of the DOD/industry working group process and includes a number of features put forward by industry.", "Under its plan, MTMC would make major changes to the existing carrier/forwarder approval, rate solicitation, and traffic distribution processes. The existing approval process would be eliminated and replaced by a contract award process. Prices would be fixed for 1 year, with no provision for increases during the contract period. Rate solicitation would be based on competitive acquisition procedures used by government in procuring other types of goods and services and eliminate the twice yearly re-solicitation of rates under the current system. Traffic distribution would be limited to the number of contractors receiving awards.", "Key points in MTMC\u2019s acquisition strategy were that offerors would be required to submit proposals addressing technical factors (i.e., how the offeror proposed to perform specified technical or operational requirements), past performance, subcontracting plan, and price. MTMC said that it anticipated that price would be less important than the other factors combined. Award would be made only to responsible offerors whose offers conformed to the solicitation and represented the best overall value to the government\u2014price and other evaluation criteria considered. There were no restrictions on the type of company that could compete for the contracts. Therefore, companies other than licensed carriers and forwarders\u2014the only type of companies now allowed to compete for DOD traffic\u2014would be allowed to make an offer for the DOD business.", "MTMC\u2019s proposal also detailed DOD\u2019s movement and storage requirements, shipment origins (all areas of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida) and destinations (13 regions in the contiguous 48 states and 5 regions in Europe), categories of shipments (household goods and unaccompanied baggage) that would and would not be handled under the pilot test, minimum contractor personnel requirements, specific tasks that were to be performed, length of the contract (1 year plus an unspecified number of option years), the way offerors should specify price for each traffic channel (expressed as a discount percentage using the commercial rate tariff for domestic shipments and a fixed dollar and cents per hundredweight rate for international shipments), the accessorial services DOD would be requiring, contractor\u2019s liability and loss and damage claims procedures (full value protection based on certain minimum declared valuations subject to an overall cap), contractor\u2019s required quality assurance procedures (use of a customer survey), certain performance standards for shipment pickup and delivery, and the invoicing and payment process.", "MTMC also indicated that it would establish and specify in the solicitation a total contract minimum guaranteed tonnage amount from each origin pilot state to each destination region included in the pilot program. It will request that offerors furnish by traffic channel a maximum daily capacity that they are willing to commit to the contract, stated in pounds, from each installation in the pilot test to any or all destination pilot regions that they may wish to serve.", "MTMC\u2019s proposal, as amended, was endorsed and supported by one of the five industry associations attending the meetings\u2014the Military Mobility Coalition, an industry group with members from relocation companies; move management companies; independent and van line-affiliated carriers and forwarders; and industry specialty firms, such as cargo insurance companies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Proposal", "paragraphs": ["The household goods carrier/forwarder industry associations prepared and submitted for comment an alternative plan (referred to in this report as the industry proposal) on June 24, 1996.

Its proposal also indicated that carriers and forwarders in the domestic program could submit a \u201cbest and final\u201d rate  3 months into the rate cycle to improve their competitive position and that forwarders in the international program could lower their originally filed rates 60 days prior to the start of the rate cycle. Accompanying the proposal was some discussion on how the industry would provide for program simplification and eliminate \u201cpaper companies.\u201d That is, paper companies are companies in the domestic program that lack actual operating assets but are affiliates of companies that have assets. These paper companies do not increase DOD\u2019s capacity.", "The industry proposal was signed by the presidents of the four carrier associations\u2014American Movers Conference, the Household Goods Forwarders Association of America, the National Moving and Storage Association, and the Independent Movers Conference.

Consequently, our assessment of the extent to which each proposal met the goals was necessarily limited by the lack of precise definitions of each goal and the way to achieve it.", "Every goal was debated at length by DOD and industry officials without complete agreement. For example, there were varying interpretations of the goals to improve quality service and to achieve best value. We assessed each proposal\u2019s ability to meet those goals using our knowledge of the existing personal property program, our understanding of the proposals, associated documents, information gathered from our attendance at all of the working group meetings, review of the transcripts of the meetings, and our prior studies.", "In table 1, we list the goals and provide a general comment about the extent to which each proposal is likely to meet the goals.

For example, to achieve high customer satisfaction, each proposal provides for more direct communication between servicemember and contractor (matters such as the pre-move survey, movement counseling, phone numbers to check with the contractors, and intransit visibility) and use of a customer survey as a tool for obtaining feedback on contractor performance. Included would be such questions as the timeliness of pickup, timeliness of delivery, loss and damage occurrence, evaluation of origin and destination agent service, and the customer\u2019s decision on whether to use the particular contractor again.", "To reduce claims and the problems associated with them, each proposal provides for increased contractor liability (full value protection) and more streamlined claims settlement, including direct settlement (servicemember with contractor)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Proposals: Greater and Lesser Extent", "paragraphs": ["MTMC\u2019s proposal meets 5 of the 10 goals for reengineering the personal property program to a greater extent than the industry plan.

It would require prospective contractors to address before contract award how they would perform MTMC-specified technical or operational requirements. This would provide DOD the opportunity to assess a prospective contractor\u2019s plan to improve the quality of the service DOD receives prior to contract award. It would give MTMC an opportunity to assess \u201cbest value,\u201d that is, the ability to assess the trade-offs between price and technical factors. Awards would not have to be made on price alone. Therefore, we believe MTMC\u2019s proposal would achieve the goal of quality service and best value to a greater extent than the industry proposal.", "MTMC had indicated that before any company is awarded DOD business, it wants to ensure that company has submitted a proposal indicating its \u201cbest value,\u201d that is addressing the technical factors (e.g., how the offeror proposed to perform specified technical or operational requirements), identifying its past performance, subcontracting plan, and price. MTMC said that it anticipated that price would be less important than the other factors combined. Award would be made only to responsible offerors whose offers conformed to the solicitation and represented the best overall value to the government, price and other evaluation criteria considered.", "Both MTMC and industry agreed that in order to obtain quality service, there would be a need for longer term binding arrangements. In the current system, rates are re-bid every 6 months, and there are periods within each rate cycle when rates can be canceled. However, there was no agreement on the exact length of the longer term, nor on the type of binding arrangement. MTMC originally proposed establishing fixed prices for 1 year, with option years. Industry proposed 1 year with no options, plus the opportunity to cancel rates or meet other contractors\u2019 rates at the 3-month point of the year-long price cycle. MTMC wanted multiple award, fixed-price, indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity-type contracts with a base and several option years awarded under the FAR, whereas industry wanted continuation of the current non-FAR arrangements with modifications.", "Industry\u2019s proposal defines \u201cbest value\u201d in terms of ranking carriers and forwarders on the basis of price and performance. It would require MTMC to develop a best value score for each carrier wanting to participate in the program. The contractor\u2019s \u201cbest value\u201d score would be based 30 percent on price and 70 percent on customer survey. Traffic would be distributed to the top-rated 30 to 50 carriers and forwarders. The industry proposal would not be based on the competitive acquisition system but would use a government bill of lading to acquire the services in accordance with procedures contained in DOD and the General Services Administration transportation regulations. It would not require prospective contractors to address how they would perform MTMC-specified technical or operational requirements before contract award. Consequently, MTMC would not have opportunity to assess a prospective contractor\u2019s plan to improve the quality prior to contract award and would limit MTMC\u2019s ability to assess the trade-offs between price and technical factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Simplification (Goal 7)", "paragraphs": ["MTMC has stated that it is looking for administrative simplification of the program. This relates to simplifying the total process from arranging the movement to settling the claim.", "Elements of both proposals offer some simplification. For example, both proposals price services on the basis of most corporate move contracts (percentage discount off industry\u2019s Domestic Commercial Tariff for domestic household goods shipments and single factor rates for international household goods and unaccompanied baggage shipments). They agreed to simplify the pricing of certain accessorial services.", "For reasons described below, MTMC\u2019s proposal meets this goal to a greater extent than the industry\u2019s proposal. MTMC\u2019s program is a standardized, domestic and international program. Industry\u2019s proposal is composed of separate domestic and international programs. MTMC proposed to have offerors submit prices and fix them for at least 1 year. Industry proposed offering prices that could be changed or canceled. In industry\u2019s domestic program, prices would be established for 1 year, effective January 1 of each year, with specific escalation provisions to account for significant increases, such as fuel costs, insurance, containers, and labor costs. The proposal also included allowing prices to be re-submitted as \u201cbest and final\u201d on April 1 of each year. In industry\u2019s international program, industry proposed to allow for increases 6 months into the contract period to compensate for currency exchange adjustments.", "We have previously urged DOD to take the actions it is proposing here, such as eliminating the frequent rate re-solicitations. In a previous report, we recommended that MTMC replace or modify the two-phase (me-too) domestic household goods bidding system so that all carriers have incentive to initially bid the lowest possible rates. We also noted that as a result of the current acquisition process, the domestic segment of the industry had created many paper companies that significantly added to DOD\u2019s workload but did not increase industry operating asset capacity. The MTMC proposal would implement our recommendation and limit the participation of paper companies through the use of the competitive acquisition system and provide for simplification. The carrier industry acknowledges that nearly half of the currently approved interstate carriers may be paper companies. Its proposal states that it will eliminate from the domestic program the many paper companies that do not provide \u201clegitimate capacity,\u201d but would still require MTMC to determine what is \u201clegitimate capacity.\u201d", "MTMC anticipates making awards to fewer contractors and basing the system on fewer, more consolidated traffic channels. Currently, in the domestic program, each of the roughly 170 U.S.-located shipping offices has to maintain a traffic distribution roster for every traffic channel, or destination state. Each channel can involve several hundred carriers or forwarders. Industry suggests a distribution system that involves fewer companies on each channel, but the numbers would still involve 30 to 50 companies.", "Neither proposal specifically addresses the numbers of staff and other resources needed to implement them. There is no way to tell from the proposal specifically how many people would be involved in reviewing the proposal, how many people or resources are needed to handle the rate solicitation process or any specific traffic distribution roster system. Accordingly, our analysis is necessarily limited. However, we believe that MTMC\u2019s proposal offers the greater opportunity to provide for administrative simplification because it (1) is a consolidated domestic and international proposal; (2) changes the rate solicitation process by eliminating re-solicitation; (3) provides for use of fewer companies to handle the traffic, necessitating less administrative effort for military installation traffic management personnel; and (4) relies on traffic channels that cover entire states. The industry proposal, though it improves on the current program somewhat, retains the rate re-solicitation process in both the domestic and international programs; continues the need to administer a large, complex traffic distribution roster process for every channel; and continues to base traffic channels on each individual military shipping office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adopting Corporate Business Practices (Goal 5)", "paragraphs": ["MTMC has said that it is attempting to capitalize on the best applicable commercial business practices. This relates to adopting business practices characteristic of world-class customers and suppliers, such as using contractual arrangements to simplify contractor selection.", "For the following reasons, MTMC\u2019s proposal meets this goal to a greater extent than industry. It would eliminate DOD-unique transportation regulations for the acquisition of services. As we noted earlier, the industry proposal, similar to the existing MTMC program, would not be based on the competitive acquisition system but would use a government bill of lading to acquire the services in accordance with procedures contained in DOD and the General Services Administration transportation regulations.", "In addition, in the past, we have recommended that DOD adopt commercial practices, such as using a smaller number of carriers to achieve quality and cost benefits. In the personal property program, we note that MTMC has approved more than 1,100 motor van carriers and regulated forwarders to handle its domestic moving needs. It has more than 150 forwarders at its disposal for its international traffic. All military shipping offices have to spend considerable time and effort to allocate a relatively small number of shipments to an enormous number of carriers. Fort Bragg, North Carolina, a typical example of the roughly 170 shipping offices in the contiguous 48 states, is serviced by more than 200 different domestic movers, more than 160 international forwarders, and 50 local carrier/forwarder agents. It has on average about 100 domestic and 40 international household goods shipments a week, moving in roughly 50 domestic and 30 international traffic channels, each requiring a separate shipment distribution roster. Some carriers and forwarders get but one shipment a week, if that. Many of the companies that get a shipment are \u201cpaper companies\u201d that provide DOD no new operating asset capacity but were formed by their parent company to increase the parent company\u2019s market share of the DOD business. The administrative effort does little to improve the quality of life for the servicemember and his or her family.", "In the same report, we recommended greater use of corporate practices that promote use of contractual arrangements to simplify the carrier selection.

There was no consensus, however, as to how to achieve the goal. MTMC is looking for commitment from the contractors to meet their needs, particularly during peak shipping periods. Over the years, there have been many examples of carriers and forwarders not being able to provide services when needed.", "MTMC\u2019s proposal, we believe, provides the greater opportunity to meet this goal than does the industry proposal because it (1) would involve the award of contracts that would obligate the contractors to provide specific minimum capacity and (2) would not limit participation in the program to only licensed carriers or forwarders. MTMC\u2019s proposal would allow any company, whether carrier, forwarder, relocation company, or anyone else, to participate. Relocation companies stated that they are prepared to make capacity available to DOD as needed. Industry\u2019s proposal specifically excludes relocation company participation unless such companies are licensed carriers or forwarders.", "Carrier/forwarder industry officials state that MTMC\u2019s proposal with regard to noncarrier/forwarder relocation company participation sets bad public policy and raises serious legal questions. Under such a system, a relocation company, with legal status as a broker, could be awarded a prime contract to effect the moves from a given base or locality. It would be the responsibility of that company to secure the services of carriers to perform the actual packing and moving services under the contract. Industry believes that a federal agency purchasing goods or services should contract only with entities actually providing those goods or services. Allowing relocation companies to compete for prime contracts, industry argues, would create logistical problems and raise questions concerning possible violations of the Anti-Kickback Act of 1986,  41 U.S.C. 51-58 and antitrust laws.", "As previously discussed, we believe MTMC\u2019s proposal to meet its goals has the potential for eliminating paper companies and opens the way for more competition among companies having or bringing to DOD actual capacity. It does not appear that MTMC wishes to restrict competition. The competitive acquisition system that MTMC proposes to use requires, as a general rule, that DOD obtain full and open competition in its acquisitions  (10 U.S.C. 2304). Concerning the potential for legal problems, the propriety of the relationship between firms participating in an acquisition as prime contractor and/or subcontractor is governed by the particular facts and circumstances in the context of the applicable laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessment of Proposals: Unknown Extent", "paragraphs": ["We are unable to determine the extent that either proposal provides or does not provide opportunity for small business to participate in the personal property program (goal 9). As was pointed out during the DOD/industry working group meetings, opportunities for small business and the impact on small business is difficult to assess or measure. The moving industry is made up of both large and small businesses, with many different types of organizational structures. The majority of moves are handled by the large business, van lines, but the work itself\u2014packing and unpacking of the household goods, the loading and unloading of the trucks, and the actual truck driving\u2014is done by small businesses, some independent and some part of the van line.", "In addition, our data indicate that there are about 25 major, nationwide van lines; a thousand independent van lines; several hundred freight forwarder moving companies; about 4,500 agents; and thousands of owner-operator truckers. In some instances, the agents actually own the major van lines. In other instances, the agents are independent companies working for the van lines. More recently, the industry has expanded to include relocation companies that handle the moves as part of a total package relocation service.", "On April 17, 1996, as directed by the Fiscal Year 1996 Defense Appropriations Bill Conference Report (House Conference Report  Number 104-344), MTMC reported on the impact of the reengineering program on small business. It said that it believed small businesses can reasonably be expected to fare as well or better than they do in the existing program. The reason, it said, was that MTMC\u2019s program would provide small businesses additional protection and opportunities, based on the establishment of subcontracting goals. However, the extent that small business is impacted remains a concern to the Congress and the industry because of the many uncertainties involved in implementing a new program.", "The two sides agreed, however, to reduce the size of traffic channels for the test, at least in part, to allow for greater participation of small business as prime contractors. MTMC had originally wanted contractors to submit offers by regions (4 in the contiguous 48 states). For the pilot test, MTMC significantly decreased the size of the contract area, from regions to states. The pilot test includes three states\u2014North Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida\u2014and although contractors will be required to serve all points within a state, they can offer on any or all of the other 13 regions into which MTMC has divided the country. Furthermore, the test includes only 50 percent of the shipments from those states and only certain types of shipments. Intrastate and local shipments, for example, are not in any test plans. Industry preference is for traffic channels much as the current system exists, where traffic channels are based on personal property shipping offices (presently, more than 150 in the contiguous 48 states).", "MTMC officials state that if a small business is intimidated by the size of the contracts, it can participate as a subcontractor of a large company or of another small business. MTMC indicated that for purposes of its proposal, small business would be defined as any company with annual receipts less than $18.5 million. The carrier association officials, however, do not believe that subcontracting counts toward this goal. Accordingly, the association officials believe that the MTMC proposal, by relegating small business to a subcontractor role, would reduce the number of small business prime contractors, resulting in the goal not being met. DOD\u2019s position is based on the opportunity to compete, not numbers. We based our assessment on the opportunity to compete.", "Under MTMC\u2019s proposal, contracts for transportation services will be awarded under the competitive acquisition system. The requirements of the Small Business Act, 15 U.S.C. 631, et seq.; FAR part 19; and the applicable part of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations Supplement will apply to these acquisitions. These provisions include such matters as subcontracting plans for the utilization of small, small disadvantaged, and women-owned small business, and set-asides for small business. Therefore, the protection for small business appear to reside in the proposed MTMC plan as it would in any other contract awarded under the government\u2019s competitive acquisition system."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["We support moving forward with the pilot test of a reengineered personal property program because it will provide the necessary data to ultimately design an improved system.

In addition, it is important that performance standards be developed and data gathered in a way that enables measurable results of the program, particularly as they relate to quality of service and small business participation. We recognize that our assessment of the extent to which the proposals met the program goals required judgments about likely outcomes and that only actual data can determine with greater certainty the impact of the proposals.

Thus, they believe that MTMC\u2019s proposal represents a joint DOD/industry proposal. DOD officials stated that testing the independent industry proposal would be a disservice to the collaborative process and would obviate the instructions of the congressional defense committees to reach agreement on a single plan. Moreover, DOD officials stated that if directed to pilot test the industry proposal in addition to the industry/DOD proposal, DOD would want to test it against MTMC\u2019s original proposal. Furthermore, they expressed concern that testing of the industry proposal would further delay their effort to improve the quality of service and reduce the $100 million annual claims for loss and damage now being experienced by military members and their families.", "DOD officials also stated that they do not have enough detail on the industry proposal to go forward without significant delay. They said that the industry proposal was not debated during the working group meetings; consequently, a number of areas are unclear, vague, and ambiguous from their point of view. Further, they were concerned that the industry proposal would be technically and operationally difficult to implement, costly to administer, and cumbersome for installation transportation officials to handle simultaneously with the other pilot. Moreover, DOD officials stated the industry proposal would not provide the opportunity to improve quality of service, which is one of the primary goals of the reengineering effort. \u201cThe Working Group has agreed to disagree on one major area: our plan to use Part 12 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) as the basis for our projected contracts. . . .

The Military Mobility Coalition, however, agreed with our analysis of the proposals.", "In addition, the carrier associations strongly supported the option we presented as a matter for congressional consideration to pilot both proposals. They said that an advantage to piloting both proposals would be to obtain with certainty the impact of the proposals on small business participation. They added that to pilot their proposal should not be difficult to implement and stated that they would be willing to work with DOD to help implement a dual pilot. However, the Military Mobility Coalition officials expressed concern about the time it would take to set up and run two pilots, the significant administrative effort that would be required, and the limited value such a test would yield. The Coalition believes that the carrier association\u2019s proposal is so similar to the structure of the current program that it negates the need for a pilot program.", "The following are key points provided by the four carrier associations where they disagreed with our analysis of the proposals. Most of the concerns raised by the four carrier associations were regarding MTMC\u2019s proposal, our characterization of the industry proposal, and our assessment of the proposals. We have revised the report to reflect their concerns, provided additional information to support our position, or clarified the position of DOD and industry, as appropriate.", "Regarding our analysis of the goal to provide opportunity to small business to participate as prime contractors (goal 9), the carrier associations stated that they believed we had sufficient information to conclude that small business would be negatively impacted under MTMC\u2019s proposal. They took issue with MTMC\u2019s conclusion that the small business goal would be met through small business competing as either subcontractors or prime contractors. The carrier associations point out that the stated goal relates to participation of small business concerns as prime contractors. Accordingly, the associations state that MTMC\u2019s proposal, by relegating small business to a subcontractor role, would substantially reduce the number of small business prime contractors and therefore, would not meet the stated goal. As we stated, there was insufficient data for us to assess this area. However, we revised the report to more fully discuss the carrier associations\u2019 concerns.", "Regarding our analysis of the goal to ensure capacity to meet DOD\u2019s needs (goal 8), the carrier associations stated that the industry proposal would not limit new capacity, it would only limit companies not properly licensed as carriers or forwarders from participating in the program. They also argue that MTMC\u2019s proposal would be too complicated to successfully guarantee adequate capacity and would reduce capacity by reducing the number of service providers with assets. The Military Mobility Coalition countered that many in the moving industry do not now participate because of the current cumbersome methods, but would enter the program under the MTMC proposal. Our overall basis for favoring MTMC\u2019s proposal in this area was based on the fact that contractors would be required to commit minimum capacity and participation of contractors would not be limited to licensed carriers and forwarders. The four carrier associations provided us no new information to change our view in this area.", "Regarding our analysis of the goal to simplify the system (goal 7), the carrier associations stated that we limited our analysis only to certain aspects of simplification and did not consider, in their opinion, the complicated systems and processes that would be added under MTMC\u2019s proposal. These included the complex method MTMC proposed to allocate traffic, bid on channels, and use the FAR. The associations stated that the MTMC-proposed program would become administratively cumbersome if expanded worldwide. The Military Mobility Coalition, having operated under competitive FAR procedures, believes the FAR is less cumbersome than contracting with thousands of individual carriers, which occurs under MTMC\u2019s current operating system and the carrier associations\u2019 proposal.", "Regarding the carrier associations\u2019 concerns, we added information on why we believed MTMC\u2019s proposal better met this goal, particularly as it relates to simplifying the rate solicitation and traffic distribution processes. In addition, we explained that the proposals do not specifically address the numbers of staff and other resources needed to implement them, limiting our analysis. Thus, we focused on the extent that the proposed process changes would simplify traffic management processes. Finally, we pointed out that industry\u2019s proposal represents two separate programs, as opposed to MTMC\u2019s single program, for handling both domestic and international traffic.", "Regarding the goal to adopt corporate business processes (goal 5), the carrier associations stated that using the government competitive acquisition system, the FAR, and other practices proposed by MTMC does not represent corporate business practices. We agree that the FAR is not used in the corporate world. However, we believe MTMC\u2019s proposal moves closer toward adopting corporate business practices, such as using contractual arrangements to simplify the carrier selection process.", "Regarding the goals to provide quality service and best value (goals 1 and 10), the carrier associations noted that awarding contracts for these services pursuant to the FAR would involve the evaluation of complex proposals that must be prepared by the competing firms. According to the association officials, such proposals are best prepared by large companies, and there is not always a direct relationship between well-written proposals and actual quality service. The Military Mobility Coalition pointed out that small businesses in this carrier field can have annual receipts up to $18.5 million and should be able to handle preparing proposals. Given the conflicting views, we have no basis for judging the extent to which proposal preparation would or would not be a problem. This type of issue illustrates why we strongly support a pilot program.", "The carrier associations pointed out that our report in many places referred specifically to the domestic program and was silent about issues surrounding the international program and the impact of the MTMC pilot program on international service providers. We have revised the report to more fully discuss the international aspect of the industry proposal.", "Other comments were provided to us that clarified or corrected our characterization of the industry proposal. We incorporated, as appropriate, these comments into the report. For example, we added that the industry proposal actually is composed of two programs\u2014one for handling domestic traffic and another for international traffic. In addition, we clarified that the industry proposal modifies the current system, provides for selecting carriers on quality as well as price, and has features that address the problem of paper companies.", "According to the four carrier associations, the specific reasons relied on for their position is contained in the Industry Critique of MTMC\u2019s Proposed Pilot Program for Domestic and International, signed by American Movers Conference and the Household Goods Forwarders Association of America and agreed to by the Independent Movers Conference and the National Moving and Storage Association.
