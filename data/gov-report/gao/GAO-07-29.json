NCUA has approved federal community charters with increasingly larger geographic areas and potential for economically diverse membership. Much of the shift toward the larger community-based credit unions was due to conversions from other charters. NCUA's approval of these charters appears to have been triggered by changes in the economic environment and financial services industry and to diversify membership to accomplish goals such as increasing service to those of modest means. NCUA has established the low-income credit union program and allowed adoption of \"underserved areas\" to increase credit union services to individuals of modest means. Despite increased credit union participation in these programs and the expansion of community charters, the 2004 and 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances indicated that credit unions lagged behind banks in serving low- and moderate-income households. NCUA officials told GAO that, given the nascent nature of its two initiatives and the relatively recent shift to community charters, they did not yet expect observable changes in the data. Also, NCUA recently has undertaken a pilot effort to collect data on the income characteristics of credit union members. Because limited data exist on the extent to which credit unions serve those of modest means, any assessment would be enhanced if NCUA were to move beyond its pilot and systematically collect income data. Based on GAO analysis, credit unions typically had more favorable rates than banks, particularly for consumer loans. For example, credit unions auto loans were 1 to 2 percentage points lower than similarly sized banks, on average. However, it was not clear the extent that the more favorable rates fully reflected the tax subsidy that credit unions receive by tax-exemption. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has been reviewing state-chartered credit union activities (federal credit unions are exempt) to determine compliance with unrelated business income tax (UBIT) requirements, but such determinations are difficult due to complicated criteria and because many credit unions file group rather than individual returns. IRS stated that it plans to issue technical guidance in the first quarter of 2007 that the agency believes will help ensure credit union compliance with UBIT. Finally, credit union executive compensation is not transparent. Federal credit unions, unlike other tax-exempt organizations, do not file information returns, which contain data on executive compensation, with IRS. NCUA is collecting compensation data as part of its pilot, but it is unclear whether NCUA will conduct future reviews. NCUA officials noted a number of alternatives that could be used to increase transparency, such as requiring federal credit unions to provide compensation information in call reports or require that credit unions disclose compensation data at annual meetings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Changes in credit union membership restrictions and the blurring of  distinctions in the products and services offered by credit unions and other  depository institutions, as well as concerns about the extent to which  credit unions are serving people of modest means, have resulted in  questions about the tax-exempt status of credit unions. Unlike banks,  credit unions are (1) not-for-profit entities that build capital by retaining  earnings (they do not issue capital stock); (2) member-owned cooperatives  run by boards elected by the membership; (3) subject to field of  membership requirements that limit membership to persons sharing  certain circumstances, such as a common bond of occupation or  association; and (4) exempt from federal income tax. As a result of recent  legal and regulatory developments, the National Credit Union  Administration (NCUA) has approved progressively larger geographic- based fields of membership for federal credit unions, including areas as  large as whole counties or major metropolitan areas. Additionally, credit  unions are increasingly offering products and services similar to those  provided by banks, such as real estate and business loans. With the  expansion of credit union membership and products, concerns have been  raised whether the tax- exempt status of credit unions provides an unfair  competitive advantage over comparably sized banks and the extent to  which credit unions remain unique in terms of the population they serve  versus that served by other depository institutions.", "Credit unions can be chartered by the federal government or by a state  government. NCUA has oversight authority for federally chartered credit  unions; the states have primary oversight responsibility for state-chartered  credit unions. NCUA also provides share insurance to all federally  chartered and most state-chartered credit unions. As of December 2005,  there were nearly 8,700 federally insured credit unions\u2014about 5,400 federally chartered and 3,300 state-chartered\u2014with about $679 billion in  total assets.", "Under the Federal Credit Union Act, federal charters are subject to a field  of membership requirement. The act provides for three types of federal  credit union charter\u2014single common bond, multiple common bond, and  community. A single common-bond credit union has a field of membership  that comprises one group having a common bond of occupation or  association. In a multiple common-bond charter, the field of membership  comprises more than one group, with each group having a common bond of  occupation or association (within the group). In a community charter, the  membership comprises persons or organizations within a \u201cwell-defined  local community, neighborhood, or rural district.\u201d", "Although they are exempt from federal income tax, both federally and  state-chartered credit unions do pay other taxes at the federal and state  levels. For example, both types of credit unions pay federal employment  taxes such as social security tax on behalf of their employees. According to  the National Association of State Credit Union Supervisors (NASCUS),  most states impose real property taxes on state-chartered credit unions; and in a few states, federally chartered credit unions are subject to state  real property taxes.", "As part of the House Ways and Means Committee\u2019s continuing oversight of  the tax-exempt sector, you asked us to review a variety of credit union  issues. The objectives of this study were to (1) assess the effect of the 1998  Credit Union Membership Access Act (CUMAA) on federal credit union  membership and charter expansion; (2) review NCUA\u2019s efforts to expand  credit union services to low- and moderate-income individuals; (3)  compare rates offered by credit unions with rates at comparably sized  banks, as one indicator of how tax-exemption might benefit credit union  members; (4) discuss issues associated with the application of the federal  unrelated business income tax (UBIT) to credit unions; and (5) assess the  transparency of credit union executives and board member compensation.", "To assess the effect of CUMAA on federal credit union membership and  charter expansion, we obtained data from NCUA regarding charter types  and membership, including data on recent new charter approvals,  conversions, and expansions. To review NCUA efforts to expand credit  union services to low- and moderate-income individuals, we obtained  information from NCUA on its low-income credit union program and recent  underserved area expansions. We also obtained and analyzed the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System\u2019s (Federal Reserve) 2004 Survey  of Consumer Finances (SCF) to assess the extent to which credit union  members were of low- and moderate-income households and discussed  with NCUA officials their effort to measure the income levels of credit  union members. To compare rates offered by credit unions with those of  comparably sized banks, we obtained and reviewed rate data on more than  15 loan and savings products to identify any systematic differences. To  facilitate our discussion of issues related to the application of UBIT to  credit unions, we reviewed provisions of the Internal Revenue Code,  Federal Credit Union Act, judicial decisions, and Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) documents concerning the unrelated business income tax (UBIT) and  the taxation of credit unions. We also obtained and analyzed IRS data  regarding its activities to identify state-chartered credit union activities  subject to UBIT. To provide information on transparency of compensation  of credit union executives and board members, we discussed  compensation reporting requirements of credit unions with IRS and  obtained publicly available data regarding the compensation of board  members and senior executives of credit unions and banks. Appendix I  provides additional information about our scope and methodology. We  conducted our work in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco from  November 2005 through November 2006 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Both federally and state-chartered credit unions are exempt from federal  income taxes. However, their exempt status arises from different  provisions of federal law. Federal credit unions are specifically exempt  from federal and state income taxes under a provision of the Federal Credit Union Act. State-chartered credit unions are exempt under a provision of  the Internal Revenue Code that describes as exempt, \u201cCredit unions  without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes and  without profit.\u201d The code also imposes UBIT on state-chartered credit  unions, but not on their federally chartered counterparts.", "The tax-exempt status of credit unions originally was predicated on the  similarity of credit unions and mutual financial institutions. Section  11(a)(4) of the Revenue Act of 1916, the statutory forerunner of section  501(c)(14)(A), exempted from federal income tax \u201ccooperative banks  without capital stock organized and operated for mutual purposes and  without profit.\u201d The exemption of credit unions stems from an opinion of  the Attorney General,  31 O.A.G. 176 (1917), holding that credit unions  organized under the laws of Massachusetts were so similar to cooperative  banks as to come within the scope of section 11(a)(4).  IRS regulations  subsequently applied this ruling to credit unions generally.", "While other institutions lost their exemption in the Revenue Act of 1951,  Congress specifically retained the exemption for credit unions by removing  cooperative banks, savings and loan societies, and building and loan  associations from exemption and inserting credit unions in their place.   The Senate Finance Committee report accompanying the Revenue Act of  1951 stated that the exemption of mutual savings banks was repealed to  establish parity with other banking institutions because the savings banks had become functionally similar to those other institutions. According to  the Senate report, tax-exempt status gave mutual savings banks the  advantage of being able to finance growth out of untaxed retained earnings,  while competing corporations (commercial banks) paid tax on income  retained by the corporation. The report stated that the exemptions for  savings and loan associations had been repealed on the same ground. The  report did not state why the tax-exempt status of credit unions was  preserved.", "Credit unions are an important, but relatively small segment of the financial  industry. According to NCUA and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  data, federally and state-chartered credit unions represented 7.5 percent of  all deposits and shares insured by the federal government as of December  31, 2005. Additionally, credit unions typically are much smaller than banks  and thrifts in terms of total assets. For example, NCUA data indicated that  approximately 88 percent of federally chartered credit unions had $100  million or less in assets with 83 percent having assets less than $50 million  as of September 30, 2005. According to NCUA, the average size of a  federally chartered credit union was $73.2 million in total assets and the  median asset size was $11 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCUA Rules Interpreting CUMAA Appear to Have Fueled Expansion of Community-Chartered Credit Unions", "paragraphs": ["Since the passage of CUMAA in 1998 and subsequent NCUA rule changes,  NCUA has approved community charters with increasingly larger  geographic fields of membership\u2014for example, covering entire cities or  multiple counties.

Most of  the new community charters approved between 2000 and 2005 were  charter conversions by multiple-bond credit unions rather than new credit  unions.

In 1998, the Supreme  Court determined that NCUA had erroneously interpreted the Federal  Credit Union Act to permit federally chartered credit unions to have  multiple common bonds. In response, Congress passed a provision in  CUMAA to specifically permit multiple-bond credit unions subject to a  general limitation on the number of members sharing a particular common  bond. Also in CUMAA, Congress amended the provision of the act  permitting the federal community charter by changing the description of its  field of membership from \u201cgroups within a well-defined neighborhood,  community, or rural district\u201d to \u201cpersons or organizations within a well- defined local community, neighborhood, or rural district.\u201d", "Subsequent to the passage of CUMAA, NCUA revised its regulations to  approve community charters consisting of larger geographic areas of  coverage and potential members. For example, NCUA recently approved  one credit union for a community charter covering the entirety of Los  Angeles County. Thus, an estimated 9.6 million persons who live, worship,  and go to school or work in the county and businesses and other legal  entities within county boundaries qualify for membership in this credit  union. We reported in 2003 that previous NCUA regulations required  credit unions to document that residents of a proposed community area  interacted or had common interests. Credit unions seeking to serve a  single political jurisdiction (e.g., a city or a county) with more than 300,000  residents were required to submit more extensive paper work. However,  NCUA revised its regulations in 2003, defining a local community as any  city, county, or political equivalent in a single political jurisdiction,  regardless of population size and eliminated the documentation  requirements.", "As shown in table 1, the number of community-chartered federal credit  unions doubled from 2000 through 2005, while the number of multiple-bond  credit unions declined by about 22 percent. In spite of the recent decline,  multiple-bond credit unions remain the largest group of federally chartered  credit unions in number and in total membership and assets.

Of these  616 approved federal community charters, 600 were conversions from  single- or multiple-bond credit unions while only 16 were for new credit  union charters.

NCUA believes that community charter expansion allows federal credit  unions to attract a more diverse membership base. According to the  officials, this in turn can enhance a credit union\u2019s economic viability, safety  and soundness, as well as provide greater opportunities to serve members  of modest means. For example, officials explained that single- and  multiple-bond credit unions often tend to be organized around employer or  occupationally based associations, which in turn creates greater economic  risk exposure since the membership base is intertwined with the economic  cycles of a particular employer or occupation. Additionally, NCUA  officials noted that employer or occupational bonds result in a greater  concentration of members with middle rather than lower incomes. Since  community charters are organized around geographically based  associations, credit unions would be able to provide individuals from a  broad range of occupations and income levels in these communities with  access to their products and services.

NCUA also has made it  easier for federal credit unions, regardless of location, to expand their  fields of membership into underserved areas (areas experiencing economic  difficulty).

According to NCUA, its LICU program is designed to assist credit unions  serving predominantly low-income members in obtaining technical and  financial services. Credit unions that receive a low-income designation  receive certain opportunities, such as the following:  greater authority to accept deposits from nonmembers such as  voluntary health and welfare organizations;  access to low-interest loans, deposits, and technical assistance through  participation in NCUA\u2019s Community Development Revolving Loan Fund;  ability to offer uninsured secondary capital accounts and include these  accounts in the credit union\u2019s net worth for the purposes of meeting its  regulatory capital requirements; and  a waiver of the aggregate loan limit for member business loans.", "From 2000 through 2005, the number of LICUs grew from 632 to 1,032, an  increase of more than 63 percent (see fig. 1).", "Credit union expansion into underserved areas also has increased in recent  years. From 1994 through 1998, NCUA rules permitted federal credit  unions, regardless of charter type, to include residents in low-income  communities and associations in their fields of membership.", "In 1998, CUMAA expressly recognized that multiple-bond credit unions  would be authorized to serve persons or organizations within an area that  was underserved. The Federal Credit Union Act defines an underserved  area as a local community, neighborhood, or rural district that is an  \u201cinvestment area\u201d as defined by the Community Development Banking and  Financial Institutions Act of 1994\u2014that is, experiencing poverty, low  income, or unemployment. NCUA\u2019s Chartering and Field of Membership  Manual (Interpretive Ruling and Policy Statement 03-1 or IRPS 03-1)  allowed credit unions to include underserved areas in their fields of  membership, without regard to location or changes to their charter type.   For example, NCUA recently approved a credit union in the state of  Maryland to serve residents within an area of Washington, D.C., determined  to be \u201cunderserved.\u201d Between 2000 and 2005, the number of credit unions  receiving NCUA approval to adopt underserved areas grew from 40 to 641.  As shown in table 3, the largest proportion of the 641 credit unions  approved through year-end 2005 were multiple-bond credit unions (410 or  64 percent), followed by community-chartered credit unions (196 or 31  percent).", "However, recent changes in NCUA policies may limit the growth of the  underserved areas program. In connection with a lawsuit instituted in  November 2005, NCUA stopped permitting single-bond and community  federal credit unions to include underserved areas in their fields of  membership. This had the effect of allowing access only for multiple-bond  credit unions, which is permitted specifically in a provision of the Federal  Credit Union Act. In the lawsuit, the American Banker\u2019s Association  (ABA) challenged NCUA\u2019s approval of community-chartered credit unions  adding underserved areas to their field of membership. ABA argued that  NCUA misinterpreted the Federal Credit Union Act by allowing a  community federal credit union to expand into several communities in  Utah. ABA contended that the Federal Credit Union Act allows multiple- bond credit unions, but not community-chartered credit unions, to add  underserved areas to their fields of membership. In response, NCUA  subsequently amended its chartering regulations to limit the adoption of  underserved areas to multiple-bond credit unions. NCUA\u2019s final rule,  incorporating these amendments, took effect on July 28, 2006. On July 20,  2006, ABA announced that it had agreed to dismiss its lawsuit.", "Despite the expansion into underserved areas and the LICU program,  NCUA cannot specifically quantify the extent to which these programs  have increased use of credit union services by individuals of modest  means.

These results were similar to the results of our analysis of  the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2001 SCF data, which we discussed in our 2003  report.", "We combined the 2004 SCF data into two main groups\u2014households that  only and primarily used credit unions (credit union customers) and  households that only and primarily used banks (bank customers). We  then computed the proportions of credit union customers and bank  customers in each of these four income categories\u2014low, moderate, middle,  and upper. We based our income categories on criteria that financial  regulators use to assess compliance with the Community Reinvestment  Act, which is intended to encourage depository institutions to help meet  the credit needs of the communities that they serve. Specifically, (1) a low- income household had less than 50 percent of the national median  household income; (2) a moderate-income household had an income of at  least 50 percent, but less than 80 percent, of the national median household  income; (3) a middle-income household had an income of at least 80  percent, but less than 120 percent, of the national median household  income; and (4) an upper-income household had an income of at least 120  percent of the national median household income. We estimated that 14  percent of credit union customers were of low-income and 17 percent were  of moderate-income, compared with 24 percent and 16 percent for banks.  We found the difference between the proportion of low-income customers  at banks and credit unions to be statistically significant (that is, the  evidence suggested that the difference between the two was not simply the  result of chance). Moreover, we estimated that 20 percent of credit union  customers were of middle-income and 49 percent were of upper-income,  compared with 18 percent and 41 percent for banks. We found the  difference between the proportion of upper-income customers at banks  and credit unions to be statistically significant as well.", "In an effort to assess the extent to which credit unions served people of  \u201cmodest means,\u201d we combined households with low- or moderate-incomes  into one group (as a proxy for modest means) and combined households with middle or upper incomes into another group. We found that 31  percent of credit union customers were of \u201cmodest means,\u201d compared with  41 percent of bank customers, suggesting that banks served a higher  proportion of people of \u201cmodest means.\u201d The difference between banks  and credit unions was statistically significant.", "As shown in figure 2, the proportion of credit union customers that were in  the upper-income category grew from 2001 to 2004. This increase, from 43  percent to 49 percent, was statistically significant. Thus, the statistically  significant difference between banks and credit unions in serving people of  \u201cmodest means\u201d that we documented in our 2003 report using 2001 data  appears to have persisted in the 2004 data. Moreover, we found the decline  from 2001 to 2004 in the proportion of credit union customers in the  \u201cmodest means\u201d category to be statistically significant. Additionally, the  relatively high percentage of households in the moderate- and middle- income categories that used credit unions (37 percent) in the 2004 SCF may  be reflective of credit union membership traditionally being based on  occupational- or employer-based fields of membership.", "However, NCUA officials told us that since growth in the agency\u2019s  programs to expand services to lower-income persons and undeserved  areas are relatively recent, it was probably too soon to expect any changes  in the SCF data, with respect to customer income. Further, NCUA felt that  it would take time for any results to appear in the data, as credit unions  seeking to expand into new areas and reaching new types of customers  would face a learning curve in their efforts. Additionally, NCUA officials  stated that since most of the conversions to the community charter  occurred within the last 5 years, within a reasonable period they expected  to see a change in the customers these credit unions were serving. It should  also be kept in mind that the latest available data from SCF are 2-years old,  so any more recent changes would not be reflected in our analysis.", "As we noted in our 2003 report, limitations in SCF data preclude its use in  drawing definitive conclusions about the income characteristics of credit  union members. Additional information\u2014especially about the income  levels of credit union members receiving consumer loans and other credit  union services\u2014would be required to assess more completely whom credit  unions serve. As further noted in our 2003 report, NCUA has noted that  credit union members were likely to have higher incomes than  nonmembers because credit unions are occupationally based. As NCUA  and others have noted\u2014because of the statutory limitations on who can  join federal credit unions\u2014credit union membership is largely based on  employment, and credit unions are restricted to the income composition of  the individuals within fields of membership containing employed  individuals. However, as we noted earlier, SCF provides the best data  currently available regarding the income characteristics of credit union  members.", "To determine how sensitive our results were to our income categorization,  we used median family income in addition to median household income to  analyze the 2001 and 2004 SCF data. We found similar results using both  median family and household income. Recognizing the limitations of the  SCF and other available data, our 2003 report suggested that Congress  consider requiring NCUA to obtain data on the extent that credit unions  provided loans and other services to low- and moderate-income  households within each federally insured credit union\u2019s field of  membership."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NCUA Has Pilot Survey to Measure Income of Credit Union Members, but Will Not Be Able to Use Results to Determine What Services Members at Various Income Levels Receive", "paragraphs": ["In response to your Committee\u2019s concerns regarding the lack of available  information to evaluate credit union member income and services, NUCA  undertook a data collection effort to profile federal credit union member  income information, identify the credit union services offered to credit  union members, and provide information on the compensation of credit  union executives.

As of August 31, 2006, NCUA had completed its data  collection phase, as agreed with the Office of Management and Budget  under the Paperwork Reduction Act, which is intended to minimize the  paperwork burden for nonprofit institutions.", "NCUA took a random sample of 481 federal credit unions and relied on two  different data collection methods to determine member incomes. NCUA  officials told us they intended to compare the results of the two methods to  determine the extent of any income differences and identify which of the  two approaches might be relied upon in the future. One method involved  obtaining information such as a credit union member\u2019s zip code from  NCUA\u2019s Automated Integrated Regulatory Examination System to make  projections of median household income. The other method involved using  the street address and zip codes of credit union members and applying a  software package that uses geo-coding to determine median family income  averages. The officials told us that the software package is widely used in  the banking industry to help make income determinations for fair lending  examinations.", "NCUA also gathered information from the credit unions on the type of  services the institutions offer to their members, including services that may  be of value to members with lower incomes or little financial experience.  Using the same sample of credit unions, NCUA collected information on  whether or not certain services are provided by the credit union. For  example, NCUA gathered information on the extent to which the sampled  credit unions offer low-balance checking accounts and whether they offer  some type of financial literacy training.", "NCUA officials stated to us that there are limitations of the data collection  effort. First, although the information collected represents a statistically  valid random sample of the federal credit union population and will provide  information on the income levels of overall federal credit union members,  the data will not enable NCUA to make statistically valid conclusions by  charter type or make conclusions about the extent of credit union services  being provided to various income levels. The officials explained that to do  so would require a larger and more time-consuming data collection effort,  requiring an increase in sample from the current effort of 481 to a sample of  almost 1,200 credit unions. According to the officials, a larger sample  would not allow them to meet their goal to report results by year-end 2006.", "NCUA indicated that despite these limitations, the data collected will add  to the agency\u2019s knowledge and should be valuable in deciding what actions,  if any, might be appropriate over the longer term. At the time of our  discussions, NCUA had not developed benchmarks to use as a measure for  a \u201cmodest means\u201d category related to member income data. NCUA  indicated that its data collection effort will help the agency better  understand the concept of \u201cmodest means\u201d in relation to geographically  dispersed, limited, and diverse fields of membership. NCUA\u2019s data  collection effort represents 61 percent of all credit unions because the  regulator has oversight authority for federally chartered credit unions,  while state governments have responsibility for overseeing the remaining  39 percent of the credit unions (state-chartered credit unions). Finally,  while NCUA\u2019s data collection effort will be useful for establishing a  baseline, NCUA officials stated that there are no plans to gather the  information on a continual or routine basis.", "In response to a March 2006 congressional request, National Association of  State Credit Union Supervisors (NASCUS) officials told us they and state  regulatory agencies have initiated a data collection effort for state- chartered credit unions. NASCUS will collect some information similar to  that collected in the NCUA pilot, such as membership income and  executive compensation. However, NASCUS also will collect data in two  additional areas: credit union service organizations (CUSO) and UBIT.   NASCUS is using a methodology similar to NCUA\u2019s to determine member  income levels. According to NASCUS, they have developed a representative  sample by applying different weights to unique state credit union  characteristics, including size, field of membership, and charter type.  Credit unions selected in the representative sample will respond to a  questionnaire developed by state regulatory agencies. The questionnaire  addresses membership, CUSOs, UBIT and executive compensation.

Similarly, the rate data that we  obtained for various loan products indicated that on average credit unions  tended to offer lower interest rates than comparably sized banks,  particularly for consumer loans such as automobile loans.

However, the differences among the rates of  comparably sized credit unions and banks tended to get larger as the size of  the institutions increased. For example, for institutions with assets of less  than $100 million, the difference between credit unions and banks averaged  about 0.15 of a percentage point in this period, while the difference for  institutions with assets greater than $1 billion averaged almost 0.7 of a  percentage point. More recently, the gap in rates between larger credit  unions and banks closed considerably; in the greater than $1 billion asset  range, the gap was more than 1 percentage point in 2000, but about one-half  of 1 percent in 2005. We observed similar trends throughout the period for  other savings products such as money market accounts and certificates of  deposit (see app. III).", "The difference between credit unions and banks was more pronounced for  consumer loans. For example, over the 6-year period, the rates that credit  unions charged for 60-month new car loans tended to be lower than the  rates charged by similarly sized banks, by 1 or 2 percentage points. As  shown in figure 4, the trend was consistent for the larger asset category as  well. However, unlike savings products, the rate differences between credit  unions and banks for car loans widened in 2005. These trends held true for  rates for other consumer products such as credit cards.", "Although credit unions charged lower interest rates for consumer loans,  similarly sized credit unions and banks charged virtually identical rates on  larger loans such as mortgages, from 2000 through 2005 (see fig. 5).

Also, larger institutions in general offered lower rates than smaller  institutions.", "Our analysis of deposit and loan rate data for credit unions and banks does  not fully identify how the tax-exemption of credit unions might benefit  credit union members. First, there may be other reasons for differences in  rates beside tax differences. For example, loan rates may differ because of  differences in borrower characteristics, such as creditworthiness, or  because of geographic market differences. In addition, tax-exemption may  benefit members in other ways than through loan and deposit rates. Credit  unions might also charge lower fees than they otherwise would for services  and products provided to members. We did not identify any comprehensive  studies or data sources that addressed differences in fees charged by credit  union and banks on a national basis. Unlike banks, credit unions can  finance additional services and add to desired or required reserves through  untaxed retained income.

Yet, it is difficult to determine to what extent credit unions  actually serve individuals of modest means. Although NCUA has  established programs to expand services to this group, the relative  newness of the programs, combined with the absence of long-term,  continuing, and systematic collection of data on the income of credit union  members, currently preclude an assessment both of the programs\u2019  effectiveness and overall industry performance. However, limited data  (SCF) suggest that in both 2001 and 2004, credit unions had a smaller  proportion of low- and moderate-income customers than banks. NCUA  officials have noted that it may be too soon for data to fully reflect NCUA  initiatives and industry activities and that growth in the community charter  will allow credit unions to draw members from larger and more diverse  populations, including people of modest means.", "While NCUA has taken steps to identify the income levels of credit union  members, several limitations in NCUA\u2019s data collection effort will make it  difficult to fully assess the extent to which credit unions have been serving  low- and moderate-income populations.

Obtaining more detailed information on credit union member income and  the financial services they used could help NCUA track the performance of  credit unions and help monitor progress over time. Furthermore, this  information would provide Congress and the public with clear evidence  that, as CUMAA notes, credit unions were accomplishing their \u201cspecified  mission\u201d of \u201cmeeting the credit and savings needs of consumers, especially  persons of modest means.\u201d  However, the NCUA effort, while laudable,  currently is confined to a pilot project.

In the private sector, SEC\u2019s recent  efforts to increase the transparency of publicly held companies underscore  the importance of enhancing accountability and greater disclosure of  information. In contrast, credit union executive compensation is not  transparent due to the lack of information available to the public. Increased  public opportunities to review executive salaries would promote greater  credit union accountability, similar to requirements for publicly held  companies. While the Form 990 is an avenue for increasing both the  quantity and transparency of publicly available information about  executive compensation at credit unions, federal credit unions are not  required to file the form.

NCUA, however, expressed  concerns with certain important aspects of the draft report. In particular,  NCUA stated in its letter that a meaningful comparison between federally  chartered credit unions and other financial institutions should include an  in-depth assessment of their structural and governance differences. NCUA  also noted that the substantive differences among federal credit unions in  charter types and fields of membership significantly impact, among other  things, who credit unions serve and how they operate and provide services.", "We agree that there are important structural and governance differences  between credit unions and other depository institutions, which are  highlighted in the report. For example, page one of the draft and current  report notes that credit unions, unlike banks, are (1) not-for-profit entities  that build capital by retaining earnings (they do not issue capital stock); (2)  member-owned cooperatives run by boards elected by the membership; (3)  subject to field of membership requirements that limit membership to  persons sharing certain circumstances, such as a common bond of  occupation or association; and (4) exempt from federal income tax.  Additionally, we agree that differences in charter types and fields of  membership are important factors that should be considered in assessing  who credit unions serve. However, as we note in the report, statistically  reliable data on credit union members by charter type and field of  membership were not available at the time of our review. The lack of this  type of data was the primary basis for the report\u2019s recommendation that  NCUA systematically obtain information on the income levels of federal  credit union members. We are encouraged by NCUA\u2019s pilot effort to obtain  information on the income levels of federal credit union members and  continue to believe the value of the information collected would be greatly  enhanced if NCUA were to continue its data collection efforts and address  some of the limitations of the pilot. Specifically, NCUA\u2019s data collection  efforts could be strengthened by (1) providing benchmark data, such as  general population income statistics or other appropriate measures, to  allow comparisons with the data collected on the income levels of credit  union members; (2) obtaining data on the extent of services offered by  credit unions (e.g., free checking accounts, no charge ATMs, low-cost wire  transfers, etc.) are being used by income category; (3) expanding the data  collection effort to allow the results to be projectable by charter type; and  (4) conducting the study on a systematic or periodic basis to assess the  extent of progress over time.", "NCUA\u2019s letter also stated that it was inaccurate and inappropriate to  measure the success of federally chartered credit unions in serving persons  of modest means by reference only to the low- and moderate-income  categories associated with the Community Reinvestment Act. Specifically,  NCUA noted that there was legal and historical evidence that the term  modest means, as used by Congress in the context of the Federal Credit  Union Act, is intended to include a broader range of individuals than those  in low- and moderate-income categories. As we noted in the report, neither  the Federal Credit Union Act nor NCUA have established definitions as to  what constitutes modest means. Thus, we used the group consisting of low-  and moderate-income households as a proxy for persons of modest means  for the purposes of our analysis. This allowed us to use the definitions  established for the Community Reinvestment Act as the basis for income  categories used on our analysis. Our analysis not only included  comparisons between credit unions and banks of low- and moderate- income households but also middle and upper income households for both  the 2001 and 2004 SCF. This analysis shows that between 2001 and 2004  credit unions continued to serve a higher proportion of middle- and upper- income households and a smaller proportion of low- and moderate-income  households than did banks.", "In its letter, NCUA noted that our income category benchmarks were  inconsistent with the specific definitions of the CRA categories the other  federal financial regulators used\u2014specifically the use of national versus  local median income for our benchmarks. Because the most  comprehensive and statistically reliable data available on the income  characteristics of credit union and bank customers at the time of our  review\u2014the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances\u2014were  nationally representative, we used national median income measures as the  basis for our income categories whereas the categories used for the  Community Reinvestment Act are based on more local measures.", "NCUA\u2019s letter also expressed concerns about the reliability of conclusions  reached using the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances data.

NCUA believes that a meaningful comparison between FCUs and other financial institutions must include an in-depth assessment of their structural and governance differences.  Furthermore, comparisons among FCUs must consider charter types and field of membership differences.  These substantive differences significantly impact who credit unions serve, how they operate and provide services, how they develop and maintain their net worth and working capital, and how they affect the continued viability of the FCU system.  Such a framework is missing in the Report, thus limiting its reliability. moderate-income categories associated with the Community Reinvestment Act  (CRA), as these categories only extend to families at or below 80 percent of the  median income.  There is ample legal and historical evidence that the term  modest means, as used by Congress in the context of the FCU Act, is intended  to include both below average wage earners and a broader class of working  individuals generally.  Further, GAO elected to use income category benchmarks  that are inconsistent with the specific definitions of the CRA categories used by  the other federal financial regulators.  Using broad income categories and  equating modest means to low- and moderate-income individuals precludes a  valid assessment of the economic demographics of FCU membership.", "Additionally, NCUA has serious concerns about the reliability of conclusions  reached using the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) data.

GAO\u2019s Definition of \u201cmodest means\u201d", "It is inaccurate for GAO to define the term modest means as only including low-  and moderate-income individuals.  To use a proxy definition for modest means,  although convenient for drafting the Report, contradicts clear congressional intent  and disregards important statutory mandates on whom FCUs can serve.  NCUA  strongly believes that using the terms modest means and low- and moderate- income individuals interchangeably creates confusion and a perception  inconsistent with statutory intent and regulatory policies put in place to achieve  that intent.", "While the Report recognizes in footnote 30 on page 26 that there is no commonly  accepted definition of modest means, the following statement on page 6 equates  low- and moderate-income to modest means:  he Federal Reserve\u2019s 2004 Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) - - indicates that credit unions continued to lag behind banks in the  percentage of their customers or members that were of low- and  moderate-income households.  Our analysis of the 2004 SCF  indicated that 32 percent of households that only and primarily used  credit unions were of modest means (emphasis added). . . . .", "The history of the Credit Union Membership Access Act of 1998 (CUMAA)demonstrates congressional intent when the term \u201cmodest means\u201d was used. This term was first introduced in proposed amendments to the FCU Act in 1998  describing the mission of credit unions.  Although these amendments were not  adopted in the final version of CUMAA, the House Report accompanying the  proposed bill noted: \u201cSection 204 reaffirms the continuing and affirmative  obligation of insured credit unions to meet the financial services needs of persons  of modest means, including those with low- and moderate-incomes,  consistent with safe and sound operation.\u201d", "The Senate Report followed a similar usage in referring to section 204 of the bill. Specifically, the Senate Report also discussed the calling of credit unions to  serve the entire range of membership and to provide \u201caffordable credit union  services to all individuals of modest means, including those with low- and  moderate-incomes, within the field of membership of such credit union.\u201d", "These congressional views reflect the clear understanding that the term modest  means indicates a meaning broader than individuals with low- and moderate- income, and those that meet the definition of modest means must also be within  the field of membership (FOM).  In this respect, the term, though not specifically  defined, conforms explicitly with its earlier counterpart, \u201csmall means,\u201d as a  shorthand reference to members of the broad working class.", "CUMAA also served notice that outreach programs to reach low- and moderate- income individuals, and the support for credit unions designated to serve low- income memberships, should still continue.  Additional authorities granted to low- income designated credit unions, and the ability for multiple common bond FCUs  to adopt underserved areas are also consistent with a more expansive definition  for modest means.  2.  Use of CRA-type definitions for income levels  The Report, in footnote 27 on page 24, provides an explanation for the use of the  Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF) and income categories,  and states:  We  based our groups on income categories used by  financial regulators for federal Community Reinvestment Act  examinations intended to encourage depository institutions to help  meet credit needs in all areas of the communities that they serve:  (1) a low-income household had an income of less than 50 percent  of the national median household income; (2) a moderate-income  had an income of at least 50 percent of but less than 80 percent of  the national median household income; (3) a middle-income  household had an income of at least 80 percent of but less than  120 percent of the national median household income; and (4) an  upper-income household had an income of at least 120 percent of  the national median household income.", "H.R. REP. NO. 105-472, at 22 (1998)(emphasis added).", "S. REP. NO. 105-193, at 11 (1998)(emphasis added).", "Enclosure 2  This footnote does not accurately reflect the income categories established by  the federal financial regulators for CRA examinations and contradicts Table 5 in  Appendix I of the Report.  The income categories identified in the Code of  Federal Regulations for CRA purposes are based on median family income as a  percent of metropolitan statistical area (local area) median family income.  The  income categories utilized in the Report use median household income as a  percent of national (not local area) median household income.  Although the  Report utilizes median family income in its additional analysis, this not only  contradicts the SCF\u2019s methodology, but also does not correct for CRA  inconsistency.  Consequently, the statement that the income levels used are  similar to those used in other governmental programs is misleading and implies  the analyses are based on CRA income categories when, in fact, the income  categories are GAO-defined.", "Additionally, footnote 27 illustrates CRA is intended to \u201cencourage depository  institutions to help meet credit needs in all areas of the communities that they  serve. . .\u201d  Given 80 percent of FCUs are occupational or associational based,  the CRA-type categories have limited, if any, applicability for the assessment of  FCUs. 3.  Basing Assessment on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer  NCUA recognizes the lack of reliable data to serve as a basis for valid  conclusions regarding income distribution of FCU members at the time of the  drafting of the Report.  NCUA also accepts that the SCF was the only source of  data available that provided income figures, albeit of limited application, for FCU  members.  As correctly pointed out by GAO, the SCF was not designed to  analyze credit union member income distribution or make comparisons between  credit union members and bank customers.  For example, the SCF does not  provide proportional representation of credit union members and bank customers  necessary to develop valid conclusions pertaining to income distribution. Notwithstanding these known deficiencies, the SCF is the primary source for the  conclusions reached in the Report, which has the potential for misleading  assessments about whom credit unions serve compared to banks.", "See 12 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 228.12(b) and (m)(Federal Reserve), 345.12(b) and (m)(FDIC), 25.12(b) and (m)(OCC), and  563e.12(b) and (m)(OTS).", "The number of households primarily using credit unions included in the 2004 SCF is only 14 percent of those surveyed.   The number of FCU member households included in this small number is unknown.  See page 63 of the Report.", "Enclosure 2  comparisons, they are also insufficient for providing a comprehensive view of  member incomes.", "The use of additional tables, in the body of the report, depicting the same data in  various ways would have allowed a more complete view of member incomes. For example, the Federal Reserve uses income percentiles in its assessment of  the SCF, which provides a more objective presentation of income distribution  than the broad income categories used in the Report.  Table 1 presents the data  used in the Report based on these income percentiles.", "Banks  19.2%  20.0%  20.7%  20.2%  $89,301 to $129,400  11.5%  18.8%  23.2%  24.8%  13.2%  Further, including both average and median incomes for comparative purposes,  rather than using only median as reflected in the Report, provides for a more  complete view of member incomes.  According the SCF results and as  demonstrated in Table 2, while credit union members have the highest median  income, bank customers have the highest average income.", "Table compiled by NCUA to illustrate other alternatives for SCF data analysis.", "Table compiled by NCUA to illustrate other alternatives for SCF data analysis using the median income included in the  Report.", "Enclosure 2  family income for comparison is inconsistent with the SCF methodology, which  utilized median household income.  Therefore, this comparison does not add  validity to the results of the study since it only changes the comparative  benchmark. 4.  Providing a limited framework for credit union membership assessment  Although the Report correctly recognizes that credit unions retain their distinction  in terms of structure and governance, it does not provide a framework that would  allow for an appropriate interpretation of the assessments presented.  For  example, factual background information about credit unions and their important  differences from banks, which is vital for an understanding of this issue, is not  adequately addressed.  To fully understand and assess any data that attempts to  compare credit union members with depositors in other types of financial  institutions, the Report should include discussion of the following:  A.  Statutory limitations on FCU membership  MSAP data confirms the importance of the statutory mandate concerning  common bond when assessing membership profiles.  It also confirms that  comparisons with other financial institutions, as well as among different charter- types of FCUs, are difficult.  FCUs are chartered as cooperatives to serve  individuals only within their FOM.  They are, therefore, limited in whom they can  serve and are restricted to the income composition of the individuals within their  allowed FOM.  It is misleading to draw definitive conclusions about the success  of FCUs in serving individuals and groups outside their traditional membership  base without fully focusing on their authorized FOMs.  This is particularly  important in view of the fact that, as of December 2005, approximately 80  percent of all FCUs had single-or multiple-common bond charter types based on  occupation or association.  The implication of this FOM concentration, based  primarily on working individuals, is far reaching within the context of assessing  the membership profile of FCUs.", "Understanding statutory limitations on who can join FCUs is critical in conducting  an objective assessment of the FCU system membership profile, any policy  consideration on who benefits from credit union services, and the impact of FCUs  on the financial sector.  The statutory limitations also emphasize the differences  between FCUs and banks and draw into question the reasonableness of any  general comparison between income distribution of FCU members and bank  customers.  To conduct a reasonable comparative assessment of whom FCUs  and banks serve, both types of institutions would need to have a similar structure  and other characteristics.  Although community-chartered FCUs and community  banks may share some similarities relative to location, structurally, community- chartered FCUs remain cooperatives with the limitations of building capital/net  worth, geographic constraints, and numerous other restrictions.", "B.  Composition of the FCUs  The Report provides an extensive review of the characteristics and growth  patterns of community-chartered FCUs. However, the proportion of FCUs that  are community-chartered, the need for charter conversions to ensure continued  viability, and the challenges community-chartered FCUs face when converting  from a single or multiple common bond charter, as well as other issues, are not  thoroughly addressed.  For example: 1.  Despite recent growth in FCU community charters, they still only represent  approximately 20 percent of FCUs and 30 percent of FCU membership. This is a significant portion of the FCU system, but, as noted in the Report,  this growth has primarily been within the last five years.  Additionally, it  should be emphasized that much of this growth is a result of FCUs  converting from an already existing occupational or associational FOM. Instead, the Report concentrates on the growth of this subset when  characterizing the entire FCU system, in particular the perceived \u201cblurring\u201d  of the distinction between FCUs and other depository institutions. 2.  A thorough assessment of the causes for the recent community charter  conversions is not provided.  The primary reason for these conversions  has been to ensure continued viability of FCUs in changing economic and  financial industry environments.  A review of several examples documents  this point.  Clearview FCU (formally US Airways); Bethpage FCU (formally  Grumman); JAX FCU (formally Jacksonville Naval Base); and New  Cumberland FCU (formally New Cumberland Army Depot Defense  Distribution Center) all converted to community charters in response to  changes in their primary sponsors. 3.  The time necessary to successfully implement a different business model  when converting to a community charter is not adequately addressed. This is critical since the cutoff for the SCF data is 2003, yet the period  under review extends to and includes 2005.  Consequently, the SCF does  not allow for an assessment of any appreciable changes based on the  recent growth of FCU community charters, as the majority of the  conversions to a community charter have occurred since 2000, and 192  have occurred since 2003.  Since the growth of community charters is  discussed at length, it should also be fully explained that relative to the  overall issue of reaching out to low- and moderate-income individuals, the  impact of this growth can not be expected to be represented in the SCF  data.  Because the SCF does not overlay the time period of the review, its  relevance is further diminished.  4.  The intent of NCUA\u2019s regulations pertaining to community charters is not  accurately described.  On page 1 the Report states:  \u201cAs a result of recent  Enclosure 2  legal and regulatory developments, field of membership requirements for  credit unions have been relaxed \u2013 member groups now can include  anyone who lives, works, worships, or attends school in areas as large as  whole counties or major metropolitan areas.\u201d This statement suggests  that the affinity requirement (lives, works, worships\u2026) of NCUA\u2019s field of  membership rules and the geographic limits on community charters are  recent developments.  That suggestion is not accurate.  Both of these  NCUA regulatory policies predate CUMAA.  NCUA did grant community  charters prior to CUMAA that encompassed whole counties and  metropolitan areas.  It is true that the documentation requirements for  single political jurisdictions were reduced through regulatory amendments  that post-dated CUMAA, but that change was based on NCUA\u2019s  experience in chartering communities constituting a single political  jurisdiction. 5.  The size and extent of the community charters approved by NCUA are not  appropriately represented.  By using the approval of Los Angeles County,  on page 13, as an example of a community charter conversion, it  misrepresents the size of the community charter conversions commonly  authorized.  The data provided to GAO reflects the average population  size for those community charter conversions approved during the period  from 2000 to 2005 was 304,886, and the median size was 125,000.  6.  The Report states in the Highlights, as well as on page 6 and elsewhere,  that NCUA\u2019s change in chartering policy is \u201ctriggered partly by concerns  about competing with states with more expansive credit union chartering  rules. . .\u201d  It is inaccurate to indicate that FOM parity with state-chartered  credit unions is a primary objective when revising FOM policies for FCUs. Although this issue has surfaced during the regulatory comment period on  proposed policy changes, it has not been a factor in NCUA\u2019s policy  making.", "C.  The size and market share comparison of credit unions and banks  Although the Report attempts to compare credit unions to banks, it does not  provide a framework for an objective analysis, which, in addition to the  membership limitations discussed above, should reflect the relative industry  position of the two types of financial institutions.", "As with all institutions in the financial industry, FCUs have evolved to ensure their  continued viability.  Since 1934, dramatic changes in the overall economic  environment in which FCUs must operate have occurred.  These changes have  required that FCUs adapt in order to meet the financial needs and expectations  of their members.  Specifically, in the last forty years, changing demographics in  the United States were characterized both by the loss of numerous well-paying  blue collar jobs in the manufacturing sector and an increasing disparity in the  Enclosure 2  income range between persons in the working class and the upper class. Operational evolution can be seen at several levels, including the offering of a  wider range of services to a more broadly defined FOM.  Fundamentally,  however, even though some FOMs are broader today, FCUs have adhered to  and preserved the integrity of both the common bond and their cooperative  structure, which is reflected in regulatory policies.", "In addition, the types of services FCUs now increasingly offer have changed.  As  with the common bond, FCUs have found it necessary to adapt in order to meet  member expectations and demand for products and services.  On page 1 the  Report states \u201ccredit unions are now allowed to offer many products and services  similar to those provided by banks, such as real estate and business loans.\u201d Such a conclusion, however, fails to adequately assess the changing economic  environment.  Further, this statement misrepresents the services credit unions  have historically provided.  FCUs, for example, have been offering member  business loans since their inception, often providing loans to entrepreneurs  initiating a small business.  As to the issue of mortgage lending, the FCU Act first  authorized mortgage lending for FCUs in 1978.  State-chartered credit unions in  several states, most notably in the New England area, have provided this type of  lending since the 1950s.", "In regard to rate comparisons, the Report recognizes the rate differences  between banks and credit unions on savings and lending products.  However, it  should further recognize the interest rate environment during the period of the  GAO review when interest rates were at historic lows.  An assessment of the  interest rate environment alone may have explained the reason for the  decreasing gap in the rate paid on savings.  This analysis is also crucial in  assessing the mortgage rates since these loans of long-term maturity  significantly affect the asset/liability management and ultimately the safety and  soundness of a financial institution.", "Additionally, as shown in Table 3, credit unions are an important, but relatively  small, segment of the financial industry.  This size disparity draws into question  the appropriateness of the comparison and conclusions in the Report.", "Credit Unions Insured by NCUSIF (Federally-Insured Credit Unions)", "NCUA also has concerns relating to the asset groups used in the Report for the comparison between banks and credit unions.  The smallest group size used for comparative purposes in the Report is $100 million or less in assets.  It is not disclosed, however, that approximately 88 percent of FCUs fall into that category, with 80 percent having assets less than $50 million as of September 30, 2005.  It should also be noted that the average asset size of FCUs is $73.2 million with the median asset size just $11 million. 5. NCUA\u2019s efforts to target credit union services to low- and moderate- One of GAO\u2019s stated objectives was to review NCUA\u2019s efforts to expand credit union services to individuals of low- and moderate-income.  The Report correctly focuses on two principal programs in this context:  (1) NCUA\u2019s Low-Income Credit Union (LICU) program; and (2) NCUA\u2019s strategic efforts to encourage FCUs to expand services into specifically designated underserved areas.  It also correctly notes that NCUA\u2019s support for these programs has resulted in increased participation in both programs by FCUs in recent years.", "Information obtained from FDIC Statistics on Banking: A Statistical Profile of the United States Banking Industry as published by FDIC, Division of Insurance and Research, for 2003, 2004, and 2005.", "Information obtained from Yearend Statistics for FICUs as published by the National Credit Union Administration for  2003, 2004, and 2005.   115 Cong. Rec. S13997 (May 27, 1969) (statement of Sen. Scott). membership base must necessarily be different, and broader.  Although  Congress recognized the difference, it did not believe an amendment to the  overall statutory purpose for FCUs, which at that time was service to persons of  \u201csmall means,\u201d was required.", "Instead, Congress implicitly endorsed FCU service to the traditional membership  base and specifically directed that NCUA should supply its own definition of low  income for purposes of implementing the provisions of the new law.  By  regulation, NCUA did so, specifying that the term low income means individuals  who make less than either 80 percent of the average for all wage earners, as  established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or whose household income is at  or below 80 percent of the national median household income as established by  the Census Bureau.", "To qualify for low-income designation, a credit union must have more than 50  percent of its membership consisting of individuals defined as low income.  This  was a specific initiative by NCUA to recognize credit unions that predominately  served a low-income population but were challenged in providing additional  services and/or programs to their members.  This initiative opened opportunities  for these credit unions to obtain additional capital from philanthropic  organizations and assistance from the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Community  Development Financial Institution Fund (CDFI), the NCUA\u2019s Community  Development Revolving Loan Fund (CDRLF), and other organizations to  enhance and expand services to the low-income population.", "Page 20 of the Report accurately describes the other unique characteristics of  LICUs and correctly notes LICUs grew in number between 2000 and 2005, from  632 to 1,032, a 63 percent increase.  This result was achieved with NCUA\u2019s  vigorous encouragement and evidences dramatic success in NCUA\u2019s effort to  increase service to low-income members.  Although NCUA has not collected  income and service usage data, the descriptive analyses conducted by NCUA on  the data collected in MSAP reflect LICUs and FCUs with underserved areas are  serving a relatively greater proportion of low- and moderate-income individuals  than the FCU system as a whole.", "12 C.F.R. \u00a7 701.34(a)(2).  As originally implemented, NCUA\u2019s rule used 70 percent of median as the relevant  percentage indicator of \u201clow income.\u201d  The rule was changed to its current usage of 80 percent in 1993.", "Enclosure 2  is contrary to congressional intent, inhibits the ability of both types of FCUs to  increase service to low- and moderate-income individuals who are outside the  credit union\u2019s FOM.", "In addition, the Report on page 22 uses Washington, D.C. as an example of an  underserved area approved by NCUA without regard to location.  This  presentation is misleading.  It is not explained that once an FCU identifies an  area meeting the underserved requirement, as defined in Section 103(16) of the  Community Development Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1994, it must  apply to NCUA to add the area to its field of membership.  A detailed marketing  plan, emphasizing how the FCU plans to reach out and serve all individuals in the  underserved area, must be submitted.  A detailed business plan must also be  submitted indicating how the FCU will meet the needs of the individuals in the  underserved area by describing the products (e.g., free checking, micro-credit  loans) and services (e.g., bilingual staff, financial education seminars) the credit  union offers or is planning to offer.  Once approved to serve a specific  underserved area, the credit union must maintain or open an office or service  facility in the underserved area within two years.", "Other outreach initiatives by NCUA to increase service to underserved individuals  have not been sufficiently acknowledged or described.  NCUA has initiated  several programs focused on assisting LICUs and on providing all credit unions  with best practices to consider when converting to community charters or adding  underserved areas.  Since 1987, NCUA has administered the CDRLF, which was  established by Congress, to provide technical assistance grants and low-cost  loans for any LICU interested in enhancing service to its membership.  Under  NCUA\u2019s auspices, the CDRLF has granted 273 loans totaling $40.5 million, and  1,923 grants totaling $5.8 million.", "In addition to the CDRLF, the Access Across America initiative, announced in  February of 2002, incorporated NCUA\u2019s activities for small and low-income  designated credit unions, as well as those FCUs adopting underserved areas. The program was designed to partner with federal government agencies and  other organizations to identify and facilitate use of resources available for credit  unions to assist in their efforts to serve low- and moderate-income individuals. Workshops continue to provide partnering opportunities with federal government  agencies, as well as non-profit and private organizations.  This initiative has  resulted in NCUA entering into Memoranda of Agreement with the Internal  Revenue Service, Operation Hope, and the Department of Agriculture, each of  which committed to provide assistance in sharing opportunities with participating  credit unions.  Moreover, NCUA maintains a working relationship with the  Department of Health and Human Services, CDFI, and Fannie Mae to provide  opportunities for credit unions to expand the products and services particularly  useful to those members with low- and moderate-incomes.", "Pub. L. 103-325, 108 Stat. 2163 (Sept. 23, 1994)(codified at 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4701 et seq.).", "Enclosure 2  As an adjunct to the Access Across America initiative, the Partnering and  Leadership Successes program was introduced in 2003 to provide best practices  in serving members and marketing to potential members in all credit unions,  especially in underserved areas and communities.  The agency coordinates  widely attended workshops where a mix of credit unions present programs  focused on serving low- and moderate-income individuals.  A few of these  programs include partnering opportunities with the Neighborhood Reinvestment  Corporation, Latino outreach, and micro-business lending opportunities with the  Small Business Administration.", "In conjunction with these workshops, numerous Letters to Credit Unions have  been published that augment the workshops, providing information to the credit  union system about opportunities available to enhance service and marketing to  individuals in underserved areas.  Two early examples of these letters include  the February 2002 Letter to Federal Credit Unions, Letter No. 02-FCU-02 titled  Partnership Opportunities with IRS, which introduced the credit union system to  the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, and the September 2001 Letter  to Federal Credit Unions, Letter No. 01-FCU-06 titled Financial Education  Curriculum, which announced FDIC\u2019s new Money Smart Financial Education  Curriculum.", "The overall objective of NCUA\u2019s initiatives is to provide increased opportunities  for FCUs to diversify their membership profile and to assist small and low-income  designated credit unions as they manage their operations in compliance with the  increasing number of complex laws and regulations.  If successful, the viability of  some low-income designated FCUs will be preserved, thus further enhancing the  opportunity for low- and moderate-income individuals in their FOM to join and  participate in the financial services offered by small and low-income designated  FCUs.", "Each of these initiatives was in direct response to CUMAA.  But these types of  initiatives have long been a part of NCUA\u2019s, or its predecessor agency\u2019s,  regulatory fabric.  There have been others, such as the 1960s era initiative,  undertaken jointly with the Office of Economic Opportunity, to establish FCUs to  serve low-income communities, the drive to increase the number of LICUs, and  the regulatory encouragement to add underserved areas.", "More recently, in 1993, NCUA created the Office of Community Development  Credit Unions which is dedicated to ensuring the long-term viability of small and  low-income designated credit unions.  Today this activity is handled by the Office  of Small Credit Union Initiatives (OSCUI), which has expanded considerably in  terms of staff, resources, and programs.", "NCUA Home Page \u2013 http://www.ncua.gov \u2013 Letters to Credit Unions, 2001 to 2005.", "Enclosure 2  2006 to date, OSCUI has held fifteen national workshops covering subjects such  as establishing financial literacy programs, disaster recovery planning, and  compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act.  In addition to the national workshops,  OSCUI coordinates with NCUA\u2019s regional offices to conduct smaller roundtable  training sessions focused on the needs of small and low-income designated  credit union officials.  6.  Transparency of Executive Compensation  NCUA agrees with the conclusion that credit union executive compensation is not  readily transparent.  Absent compensation information captured by IRS Form  990, it can be difficult for FCU members to ascertain the exact compensation and  benefits received by their executives.  In the past, NCUA, while not objecting to  disclosure of this information, has deferred to applicable state law on whether  compensation and benefit information should be disclosed.", "As the Report points out, staff have indicated more efficient methods to capture  and disseminate executive compensation information in lieu of filing Form 990. Such methods include: (1) amending NCUA\u2019s regulations to require FCUs to  include executive compensation information in their annual reports; (2) requiring  the reporting of such information in NCUA\u2019s quarterly call reports; or (3)  amending the standard FCU Bylaws to require disclosure of compensation  information during an FCU\u2019s annual membership meeting.  These and other  methods may be considered by the NCUA Board in evaluating the transparency  of executive compensation.", "While NCUA agrees FCU executive compensation is not readily transparent,  several matters in the Report warrant clarification.  They include:  1.  Despite the absence of a standardized reporting mechanism, NCUA does  not ignore the issue of executive compensation.  Contrary to the  implication on page 45, NCUA does assess executive compensation  during the examination process primarily to determine its reasonableness  as it relates to safety and soundness.  There has never been a system- wide issue relating to executive compensation.  As such, NCUA has not  considered it necessary to collect or aggregate executive compensation  data. 2.  On Page 42, it is implied that MSAP is deficient because it does not collect  executive compensation information for banks, thereby preventing a direct  comparison between FCUs and banks.  However, it is not within NCUA\u2019s  authority to collect data from banks or thrifts.  Additionally, since this is not  a safety and soundness issue for the credit union system, NCUA\u2019s  authority to collect executive compensation extends only to FCUs. 3.  Comparing executive compensation of FCUs and banks was not a stated  objective for GAO\u2019s study.  Attempting to make a direct comparison is not  Enclosure 2  only irrelevant to the issue of transparency, but is impossible given the  differences in the forms of compensation available to FCU versus bank  executives.  For example, as the Report notes, stock options and stock  bonuses are routinely paid to bank executives, but are unavailable to  credit union executives.  Nevertheless, the discussion of this matter  seems to imply that somehow credit union executive compensation may  be askew.  Only by delving into the data provided in Appendix IV of the  Report is it clear that credit union executives on average make  significantly less than their banking counterparts. 4.  Since the Report addressed comparisons between senior officers of credit  unions and banks, it should have also included a more detailed  comparison between directors of credit unions and banks.  It neither  discusses nor includes any data regarding the compensation paid to  directors of banks, which in some instances can be rather lucrative.  At  least some discussion would have been appropriate, especially since FCU  boards are comprised of volunteers.  Including such data and discussion  would have made for a more thorough and accurate comparison of  executive compensation.  5.  The Report states on page 48 that MSAP will not stratify executive  compensation by asset size of credit unions.  This is not accurate.  MSAP  compensation data can be stratified into two statistically valid subsets  based on asset size of the credit unions surveyed.  In addition, limited  descriptive conclusions can be derived from the data about other asset  subgroups.", "As referenced in MSAP and this response, NCUA recognizes the difficulty in  addressing the issues of membership profiles and the transparency of executive  compensation in the absence of comprehensive data.  NCUA also understands  that the time allotted for completion of the Report did not allow for consideration  of the MSAP data and similar data being compiled by NASCUS.  Although the  Report includes significant new detail and qualifies its reliance on the SCF,  NCUA anticipates the general conclusions reached will be reported without the  appropriate qualifiers.  In order to assure a complete and thorough understanding  of the FCU system, NCUA suggests that GAO include in its Report the  information and data contained in MSAP.  It is also suggested that the  completeness of the Report would be further enhanced by inclusion of the data  now being collected by NASCUS, thus allowing for a thorough assessment of the  entire credit union system.", "Pursuant to the FCU Act, no member of an FCU board may be compensated; however, an FCU may compensate one  individual who serves as an officer of the board.  For example, if the credit union\u2019s paid CEO is also a member of the  board.  See 12 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1761(c) and 1761a.", "The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the National Credit Union  Administration\u2019s letter dated November 14, 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. As noted in NCUA\u2019s letter, we did not receive the results of its pilot  survey on the membership profile of federal credit unions (Member  Service Assessment Pilot Program) in time to include it as part of our  study. The report can be found at NCUA\u2019s website www.ncua.gov. 2. NCUA questioned GAO\u2019s use of low- and moderate-income as a proxy  for the term modest means. As we note in our 2003 and current report,  neither the legislative history of the Federal Credit Union Act, as  amended, nor NCUA have established definitions as to what constitutes  modest means. As a result, we used the low- and moderate-income  categories that we defined in our 2003 report, which are based on what  the other federal financial regulators use for Community Reinvestment  Act purposes, as a proxy for modest means. Moreover, both citations  identified by NCUA in the House and Senate reports for the bill that  ultimately was enacted as CUMAA specifically identify low- and  moderate-income as components of what is referred to as modest  means. We agree that the term modest means also indicates a meaning  broader than individuals with low- and moderate-income. Further, our  analysis included comparisons between credit unions and banks of  households with middle- or upper-incomes. This analysis showed that  between 2001 and 2004 credit unions continued to serve a higher  proportion of middle- and upper-income households and a smaller  proportion of low- and moderate-income households than did banks.  3. NCUA stated that the text in footnote 27 of the draft report did not  accurately reflect the income categories that the federal financial  regulators established for CRA examinations. The text in question has  been moved up into the body of the report and modified to more clearly  state that our categories were based on, but not identical to, that used  by the other federal financial regulators for CRA purposes. The primary  difference between our income categories and those used for CRA  purposes was the use of national median income rather than local  metropolitan statistical area median income as a benchmark for the  various income categories. We use the national measure since the SCF  is a national survey. Further, we agree with NCUA\u2019s assertion that  occupational and associational based credit unions have restricted  membership bases, which limit their ability to serve all income  categories. However, as we note in the report, although the number of  credit unions with single or multiple common bonds have been  decreasing since 2000 and the number of credit unions with more  inclusive community charters have been increasing, 2001 and 2004 SCF  data indicated that credit unions continue to serve a higher proportion  of middle- and upper-income households than banks.  4. NCUA questioned our use of SCF data as the primary source for  conclusions reached in the report regarding the income characteristics  of credit union members. We believe that the report as stated clearly  outlines the limitations of SCF data in conducting the analysis, but as  we noted in our prior report, the SCF is the only source of  comprehensive data to conduct such an analysis. We agree that there  are other ways of analyzing and presenting these data. However, we  believe that figure 2 in our report provides a valid comparison of bank  and credit union customers in the SCF data. In addition, it uses the  methodology of our 2003 report, which allows us to directly compare  the results of our 2003 report with our current report. We focus on the  median income, as we did in our prior report, since this measure is less  susceptible to the influence of extreme values than the mean. As noted  in the report, we performed an additional analysis using the median  family income to provide additional context to our analysis within the  same methodological framework. 5. NCUA suggested that our report does not provide a framework for  understanding the effect of statutory limitations on federal credit  unions when comparing the income distribution of federal credit union  members and bank customers. We explicitly acknowledged the  importance of these limitations in our 2003 report and have added some  additional text to reflect these limitations in our current report.  Nevertheless, we believe that our analysis of SCF data on the income  levels of credit union members versus bank customers provides  important contextual information on the extent, if any, that credit union  members are different from individuals that use banks. The lack of data  on the income distribution of credit union members by charter type  was one of the primary factors behind our recommendation that NCUA  expand its pilot survey to allow the agency to systematically obtain and  monitor credit union member income data by charter type. 6. NCUA stated that the report does not thoroughly address the  proportion of federal credit unions that are community chartered. We  believe our report addresses this issue correctly, as originally  presented. Both in table 1 of our report and the related text, we note  that despite the growth in community charters, multiple-bond credit  unions remain the largest group of federally chartered credit unions in  number, total membership, and assets. However, as we noted in our  report, it is important to emphasize that community-chartered credit  unions overtook multiple-bond credit unions as the largest of the three  federal charter types, in terms of average membership and average size  in terms of assets, beginning in 2003. 7. NCUA stated that the report does not thoroughly address the agency\u2019s  position on the need for charter conversions to ensure continued  viability. We believe our report addresses this issue correctly, as  originally presented.  As noted in our report, we attributed to NCUA  some of the causes for growth in the community charter, including the  agency\u2019s belief that community charter expansion allows federal credit  unions to attract a more diverse membership base that can enhance a  credit union\u2019s economic viability or safety and soundness as well as  provide greater opportunities to serve members of modest means. We  further note in our report that NCUA explained that single- and  multiple-bond credit unions often tend to be organized around  employer or occupationally based associations, which in turn creates  greater economic risk exposure since the membership base is  intertwined with the economic cycles of a particular employer or  occupation. Finally, we cite a Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta research  paper, which concluded that there are material benefits of credit union  membership diversification and that these benefits derive from  expanded investment opportunities and reduced concentration risk. 8. NCUA stated that the time necessary to successfully implement a  different business model when converting to a community charter is  not adequately addressed. We believe our report addresses this issue  correctly, as originally presented.  Specifically, the report cites NCUA\u2019s  belief that it would take time for any results to appear in the SCF data  as credit unions seeking to expand into new areas and reaching new  types of customers would face a learning curve in their efforts. Our  report further notes that the latest available data from SCF are 2-years  old, so any more recent changes would not be reflected in our analysis.  9. NCUA stated that the intent of NCUA\u2019s regulations pertaining to  community charters was not accurately described. Specifically, NCUA  stated that introductory text in the draft report suggested that the  affinity requirements of NCUA\u2019s field of membership rules and the  geographic limits on community charters are recent developments.", "NCUA noted that both of these regulatory policies predated CUMAA.  We have clarified the text of our report to reduce the potential for  confusion by stating that since the passage of CUMAA, NCUA has  approved progressively larger geographic-based fields of membership.  10. Text has been added to reflect the average and median population size  of community charter conversions approved from 2000 to 2005.  11. NCUA stated that we inaccurately attributed its change in chartering  policy as being triggered partly by concerns about competing with  states having more expansive credit union chartering rules. As we  reported in 2003, NCUA stated to us at that time that a major reason for  its regulatory changes was to maintain the competitiveness of the  federal charter in a dual (federal and state) chartering system. In  subsequent discussions with NCUA they indicated that it would be  more accurate to attribute changes in chartering policy to factors such  as the continued viability of federal credit unions in changing economic  and financial industry developments. We have modified the text of our  report to reflect the influence of these factors.  12. Text has been added to reflect that credit unions historically have had  the ability to offer real estate and business loans. 13. Text has been added to the report to recognize that interest rates during  the period of our credit union and bank rate analysis were at historic  lows.  14. Text has been added to the background section of the report based on  the information provided by NCUA in its comment letter regarding the  proportion size of the credit union industry in comparison with other  federally insured depository institutions and the relatively small size of  most federally chartered credit unions. However, it is important to note  that the disparity in size between the credit union and banking  industries does not affect our rate analysis methodology or our  conclusions since that analysis is broken out by asset groupings,  starting with institutions with assets of $100 million or less. 15. NCUA stated that it was inaccurate and inappropriate to use its Low- Income Credit Union program and underserved area expansion  program to define and assess service to people of modest means. As  noted previously, we used low- and moderate-income as a proxy for  modest means due to a lack of a legislative or regulatory definition or  other criteria. Moreover, we note that NCUA\u2019s regulations for its  underserved program includes criteria (area in a metropolitan area  where the median family income is at or below 80 percent of the  metropolitan area median family income or the national metropolitan  area median family income) that is roughly similar to that used to  define low- and moderate-income for CRA purposes (less than 80  percent of the median family income for the Metropolitan Statistical  Area).  16. We clarified in the report that both single-bond and community credit  unions are currently not permitted to include underserved areas in their  fields of membership. As noted in the report, the American Bankers  Association contended that the Federal Credit Union Act allows  multiple-bond credit unions, but it does not specifically identify single  or community credit unions to add underserved areas to their field of  membership. 17. We added additional information in the report on NCUA\u2019s criteria for  federal credit unions applying to include underserved areas in the  credit union\u2019s field of membership. However, we disagree with NCUA\u2019s  assertion that the example we provided in our report is misleading.  18. We clarified in the report that NCUA examiners assess executive  compensation during the examination process primarily to determine  its reasonableness as it relates to safety and soundness, but that since it  has not found a systemwide issue with executive compensation, NCUA  has not considered it necessary to collect or aggregate executive  compensation data. 19. NCUA noted that our characterization of NCUA\u2019s Member Service  Assessment Pilot implies that the pilot is deficient because it does not  collect executive compensation information for banks; thereby,  preventing a direct comparison between federal credit unions and  banks. It also noted that it is not within NCUA\u2019s authority to collect data  from banks or thrifts and that its authority to collect executive  compensation data extends only to federal credit unions in the context  of credit union safety and soundness issues. We do not intend to imply  that collecting compensation data from banks is the responsibility of  NCUA but point out the lack of available data that would allow a direct  comparison of credit union and bank executive compensation. 20. NCUA indicated that comparing executive compensation of federal  credit unions and banks was not a stated objective for our study and  that attempting to make a direct comparison is impossible, given the  differences in the forms of compensation available to federal credit  unions versus bank executives. We acknowledge that comparing  executive compensation of federal credit unions and banks was not a  stated objective for this study. Our report text merely points out that  due to the lack of consistent, available, and transparent compensation  data for credit unions, any overall comparison is difficult. For this  reason, we did not provide bank executive compensation data in the  main body of the report or make any direct comparisons between  credit union and bank executive compensation. However, we believe  that inclusion of bank executive compensation data in the appendix  provides a useful benchmark on selected executive positions.  21. NCUA noted that the report neither discusses nor includes any data  regarding the compensation paid to directors of banks and that  including such data and discussion would make a more thorough and  accurate comparison of executive compensation. We acknowledge this  point and added some additional discussion on bank director  compensation for context.  22. Our original characterization of NCUA\u2019s Member Service Assessment  Pilot was based on a discussion with NCUA officials. We have revised  the text of the report to reflect that compensation data that NCUA  obtained can be stratified into two statistically valid subsets based on  the asset size of the credit unions surveyed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the above contact, Harry Medina, Assistant Director; Janet  Fong; May Lee; John Lord; Donald Marples; Edward Nannenhorn; Jasminee  Persaud; Carl Ramirez; Barbara Roesmann; Paul Thompson; and Richard  Vagnoni made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
