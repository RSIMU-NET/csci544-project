GAO also found that in rising interest rate environments, the FRNs may be more costly than these alternatives.", "Multiple components contribute to achieving lowest cost financing over time: issuing FRNs is part of Treasury's approach to achieving this goal. GAO analysis identified a number of design elements that may affect how FRNs contribute to that goal. Treasury officials believe it is prudent for Treasury to extend the average maturity of its debt portfolio because the debt level is already high and is expected to grow. Relative to issuing shorter-term debt, 2-year FRNs will help Treasury extend the average maturity of the debt portfolio and thereby reduce the risk inherent in going to market. Because the interest rate on a FRN can change during the life of the security, FRNs expose Treasury to the risk of rising interest rates whereas fixed-rate securities of the same maturity do not. These shifts in risk are likely to be small because currently FRNs are expected to constitute a small proportion of Treasury debt. Although managing interest rate risk is an important aspect of Treasury's goal to borrow at the lowest cost over time, Treasury does not track and report a measure of the average maturity of the portfolio that captures the additional interest rate risk of FRNs.", "One element of the design of the 2-year FRN\u2014the difference between the term of its index rate (13 weeks) and the length of its effective reset period (one week)\u2014is not typical for floating rate notes and creates tradeoffs in interest rate risks but also may result in additional demand for the product. The risks could affect the pricing of FRNs and raise Treasury's borrowing costs in environments of high and volatile interest rates. Treasury officials told us they examined design elements, including this difference, before issuing the 2-year FRN. However, Treasury had not analyzed how the difference may affect FRN pricing.", "FRNs give Treasury debt managers additional flexibility by increasing demand for Treasury securities and by adding a new security that meets the high demand for short-term securities.

This mismatch  introduces a tradeoff between yield curve risk and interest rate risk.  Unlike a typical FRN, the price of the Treasury 2-year FRN will not reliably  return precisely to par at each reset date before its 2 year maturity. This is  because investors factor in changes between the 1-week bill rate and the  13-week bill rate. However, the price of the Treasury 2-year FRN should  return close to par weekly, which is more frequent than if it had a 13-week  reset. Treasury officials told us they believe that the frequent resets  provide increased price stability for the FRN. They said that they expect  investors to price the 2-year FRN in a way that reflects the expectation  that the yield curve risk for Treasury\u2019s 2-year FRN is likely to be small  relative to its reduced interest rate risk. However, if the difference  between the 1-week rate and the 13-week rate changes substantially over  the two year term, either in fact or in expectations, then the yield curve  risk that the investor faces would be more substantial. It is possible that in  higher and changing interest rate environments, the tradeoff between  yield curve risk and interest rate risk may not be favorable to investors.

This suggests that the  price discovery mechanism of the market was functioning well for FRNs  and that the market embraces and understands the security, which in turn  indicates strong current and continuing demand that helps Treasury  borrow at lower cost over time.", "When-Issued Market  When-issued trades are contracts for the  purchase and sale of a new security before  the security has been auctioned.

Survey respondents noted a number of reasons why  Treasury FRNs are an attractive investment option, including the interest  rate risk protection they provide the purchaser, their price stability, their  use as a cash management tool, their consistency with investment  guidelines and regulatory requirements, and the liquidity of the securities.  The successful launch of a new type of security relies both on the  readiness of investors and on Treasury\u2019s own operational readiness.  Overall, market participants felt prepared for the introduction of a new  security. According to almost all of the market participants we surveyed,  Treasury provided sufficient information regarding its plans to issue FRNs  (53 out of 62 respondents noted that Treasury provided sufficient  information and the remaining 9 noted that they had \u201cno opinion or no  basis to judge.\u201d) In addition, of the 48 survey respondents that said that  they would need to make systems changes to purchase FRNs, 36 said  that Treasury or the Federal Reserve had provided adequate assistance  or information to make the necessary changes. Some respondents noted  that as of March 2014, they had not yet completed systems changes that  will be needed to purchase FRNs. Demand for FRNs may increase as  additional investors complete systems changes.", "Although issuance of FRNs brings incremental demand for Treasury  securities and demand in the initial auctions was high and is likely to  grow, one design feature of the 2-year FRN may constrain Treasury\u2019s  flexibility in the issuance of 13-week bills. Treasury officials and market  participants both told us that because the FRN is indexed to the 13-week  Treasury bill rate, Treasury will have to be more judicious in adjusting the  size or timing of Treasury auctions of 13-week bills. As some comments  on the proposed rule noted, there is some risk in indexing a floating rate  note to a product from the same issuer.

Interest in the 1-year FRN  varied by sector, with mutual funds (including money market funds)  expressing substantial interest in this maturity, while retail and  commercial banks had little interest.

Treasury officials said they might consider issuing  FRNs with longer maturities once both they and the market gain some  experience with the 2-year Treasury FRN. Over the long run, Treasury  FRNs with maturities other than 2 years are likely to provide a cost  savings to Treasury relative to issuance of fixed-rate securities with the  same maturity.", "Survey respondents expressed their views on certain design features of  FRNs with maturities other than 2 years. For instance, if Treasury were to  issue FRNs with different maturities, almost all survey respondents (57  out of 62) thought those FRNs should also be indexed to the 13-week  Treasury bill. More respondents said they would prefer daily interest rate  resets to any other reset period for FRNs with maturities other than 2  years.

Nevertheless, Treasury faces challenges in  managing the debt at a time when debt levels are high and projected to  increase and when interest rates are also expected to rise. Given the  market uncertainties and the federal government\u2019s fiscal challenges,  increasing Treasury\u2019s flexibility to respond to changing market conditions  in ways that minimize costs is prudent. FRNs are a tool that can help  meet these goals. Over the long term, FRNs can reduce Treasury interest  costs relative to fixed-rate securities that lock in funding for the same  term. FRNs can also help enhance Treasury flexibility by marginally  increasing demand for Treasury securities.", "The design and implementation of FRNs has implications for Treasury\u2019s  ability to minimize borrowing costs over time and for the balance of risks  in Treasury\u2019s debt portfolio. Our cost analysis finds that in comparison to  issuance of 2-year fixed-rate notes, Treasury is taking on additional  interest rate risk but is likely to achieve interest cost savings while not  increasing market access risk. The mismatch feature of Treasury\u2019s first  FRN presents a tradeoff between different risks for both investors and  Treasury that could raise Treasury\u2019s borrowing costs when interest rates  are high and the yield curve is volatile. However, the mismatch also helps  Treasury tap into the current high demand for high-quality short-term  securities. Without analyzing how the mismatch between the frequency of  the reset period and the maturity of the index could affect pricing,  however, Treasury is unable to judge either (1) the risks (and therefore  the ultimate cost) of FRNs in a different interest environment, or (2)  whether the additional demand from money market funds due to the  mismatch feature outweighs the potential costs it creates. A better  understanding of these tradeoffs will be important when Treasury  considers issuing FRNs with maturities other than 2 years. Furthermore,  with the addition of FRNs to Treasury\u2019s debt portfolio, the weighted  average maturity length of securities in the portfolio (i.e., the WAM) is now  an incomplete measure of rollover risk because it does not accurately  measure interest rate risk. Tracking and reporting an additional measure  of the length of the debt portfolio that captures interest rate risk could help  Treasury debt managers understand and weigh risks in the portfolio, and  publicly reporting that measure would facilitate transparency and market  understanding of Treasury debt management decisions.", "Introducing FRNs at this time\u2014when demand is high\u2014can help Treasury  and market participants become more familiar with the new security so  that Treasury can expand to FRNs with different maturities if Treasury  determines that doing so would enhance its flexibility and advance its  debt management goals. It will also be important for Treasury to gauge  market demand for FRNs and other products by soliciting input from all  sectors of Treasury investors, specifically state and local government  retirement fund managers. Such input can help inform Treasury decisions  about changes to Treasury issuance or debt management practices that  could enhance overall demand for Treasury securities. When deciding  what to issue, Treasury must make prudent decisions about investor  demand by product. If Treasury issues the wrong mix of products, its  overall cost of funding will increase, as investors express their  preferences in prices bid at auction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help minimize Treasury borrowing costs over time by better  understanding and managing the risks posed by Treasury floating rate  notes and by enhancing demand for Treasury securities, we recommend  that the Secretary of the Treasury take the following four actions:  1.
