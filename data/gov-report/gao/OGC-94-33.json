The settlement of claims against the United States, called \u201cpayment claims,\u201d is the subject of this chapter. Claims by the government against others, called \u201cdebt claims,\u201d are covered in Chapter 13.", "Claims against the government can arise out of virtually any aspect of federal operations. Any federal program that involves the disbursement of funds can generate claims. Claims may arise in areas covered by other chapters of this publication. For example, Chapter 4 discusses a number of restrictions on the purposes for which appropriated funds may be used. Questions in these areas frequently arise in the form of claims which cannot be paid because of a particular restriction. Assistance programs generate claims. Also, a great many claims involve areas covered by GAO\u2019s Civilian and Military Personnel Law Manuals. The purpose of this chapter is to present an overview of the claims settlement process, a description of GAO\u2019s claims settlement functions, and a brief discussion of several types of claims not covered elsewhere.", "When, over 100 years ago, First Comptroller Lawrence wrote the words quoted at the top of this page, claims settlement was viewed as largely an adversarial process. \u201cThey\u201d (the claimants) were out there, like a horde of invading Huns, trying to get money from the Treasury; \u201cwe\u201d (government officials) were the army of the righteous trying to prevent them from doing so. Claims settlement was much simpler back then. Many of the key claim-generating statutes, such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, had not yet been enacted. Most claimants who bothered to file with the accounting officers were denied for lack of a legal basis. Of this group, most lacked access to the courts and could do little else but seek private relief legislation.", "To say that the law has changed over the last hundred years is to barely hint at the enormity of the change. Literally dozens of statutes, in varying degrees of detail, now permit claims against the United States in a wide variety of contexts. Persons injured by negligent acts of government employees have the Federal Tort Claims Act. There is now a highly sophisticated mechanism for settling contract claims. Victims of certain types of discrimination have avenues of redress unheard of in Lawrence\u2019s era. And the list goes on and on. It can scarcely be disputed that the United States has taken huge strides in recent decades towards the goal of a fair and just relationship with its citizens.", "Along with these changes in the law, attitudes have also begun to change. To be sure, there is still an adversarial element in claims settlement, especially when a claim is taken to court. There is nothing wrong with this. Certainly the government has the right, if not the duty, to present and argue available defenses, and to the extent the American adversarial approach to litigation has value to begin with, that value applies equally to federal claims litigation. At the administrative level, however, federal claims officials are increasingly recognizing the duality of their role. On the one hand, they are, and will remain, guardians of the Treasury. Claims settlement must be more than just giving away the taxpayers\u2019 money. Yet on the other hand, the function of claims settlement is to provide fair compensation, as and to the extent authorized by law, to those harmed by actions of the government. Claims settlement succeeds to the extent it is able to do this in a fiscally responsible manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "B. Claims Settlement in the Federal Government", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "1. Sources of Authority and Role of the Administrative Process", "paragraphs": ["The fundamental tenet of this entire publication is that the expenditure of public funds must be authorized by law. The payment of claims is no exception. As with other fiscal contexts, \u201cauthorized by law\u201d may take various forms. A few claims are authorized directly by the Constitution. For example, the Fifth Amendment mandates the payment of just compensation for governmental takings of private property. You may find statutes telling you what courts to use (28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(a)(2), 1491), but you do not need a statute authorizing you to assert the claim. The Fifth Amendment itself fills that role.", "Contractual relationships provide another source of authority. A contract is a legal instrument from which legal rights, duties, and obligations flow. A federal agency has the inherent power\u2014no statute is needed\u2014to enter into contracts in the execution of its duties. E.g., United States v. Tingey, 30 U.S. (5 Pet.) 115, 127 28 (1831). While contract claims are now governed by statute, there is authority for the proposition that agencies have the inherent authority, as an incident to the power to enter into contracts, to settle at least certain types of contract claims. United States v. Corliss Steam-Engine Co., 91 U.S. 321 (1875); Cannon Construction Co. v. United States, 319 F.2d 173 (Ct. Cl. 1963); Brock & Blevins Co. v. United States, 343 F.2d 951 (Ct. Cl. 1965). Cannon contains the best discussion.", "Another broad source of claims activity is statutes which create a right or entitlement, whether or not they specifically address claims. For example, under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5702(a), an employee traveling on official business \u201cis entitled to\u201d certain travel allowances. An employee who is erroneously not paid travel allowances otherwise due does not need a statute to authorize him or her to file a claim for the proper allowance. The right to file a claim derives from the entitlement. Similarly, if an agency misapplies a mandatory allocation formula under an assistance program, the beneficiary who got too little does not need specific statutory authority to file a claim for the right amount.", "Finally, there is a fairly large universe of claims statutes that serve a wide range of functions. Some establish the authority to settle certain types of claims in situations where that authority would not otherwise exist. A prime example here is the Federal Tort Claims Act. Others, the Contract Disputes Act for example, do not necessarily create the right to file claims but nevertheless provide a statutory basis and establish procedures. Some, as the two cited, are governmentwide. Many others are agency-specific. An example is 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3724, which authorizes the Attorney General to settle claims of not more than $50,000 for personal injury or property damage caused by law enforcement officers employed by the Department of Justice which cannot be settled under the Federal Tort Claims Act.", "Thus, while claims settlement must be authorized by law, there is no particular form that authority must take. When dealing with statutes, however, whether they specifically address claims or create entitlements from which the right to file claims is inferred, the guiding principle is that \u201cliability . . . is not to be imposed upon a government without clear words.\u201d Pine Hill Coal Co. v. United States, 259 U.S. 191, 196 (1922). Where the liability is potentially large, \u201conly the plainest language\u201d will suffice. Id. See also United States v. Zazove, 334 U.S. 602, 616 17 (1948); Brookfield Construction Co. v. United States, 661 F.2d 159, 163 64 (Ct. Cl. 1981); Schellfeffer v. United States, 343 F.2d 936, 942 (Ct. Cl. 1965). \u201cAgents and officers of the Government have no authority to give away the money or property of the United States, either directly or under the guise of a contract that obligates the Government to pay a claim not otherwise enforcible against it.\u201d", "Bausch & Lomb Optical Co. v. United States, 78 Ct. Cl. 584, 607 (1934), cert. denied, 292 U.S. 645.", "If there is no common basis of claims authority throughout the federal government, there is also no common set of procedures. Certainly the courts often have the final word, but the first step in the process is usually an administrative determination, and the care (or lack thereof) with which the agency handles the initial administrative stage can and often does influence the rest of the process. Indeed, most claims against the federal government are resolved administratively without the need for court action. No one has any idea how many claims are processed by the federal government each year. If, however, every claim against the United States had to go to court, the federal court system would sink without a trace. \u201cThe United States may create rights in individuals against itself and provide only an administrative remedy. . . . It may provide a legal remedy, but make resort to the courts available only after all administrative remedies have been exhausted. . . . It may give to the individual the option of either an administrative or a legal remedy. . . . Or it may provide only a legal remedy.\u201d", "Tutun v. United States, 270 U.S. 568, 576 77 (1926). Taking these in reverse order, at one extreme there may be no administrative process at all. A statute may require that claims of a given type be resolved only by court adjudication. Statutes of this type usually deal with temporary or \u201cad hoc\u201d situations. An example is the so-called \u201cTris Act,\u201d Pub. L. No. 97-395, 96 Stat. 2001 (1982), enacted to provide a mechanism to indemnify manufacturers, distributors, and retailers adversely affected when the Consumer Product Safety Commission banned the chemical known as \u201cTris\u201d in 1977. The statute did not provide for administrative adjudication, but required that claims be filed in what was then the United States Claims Court.", "At the other extreme, the administrative process may be the only process there is. Congress may make administrative decisions final and is not required to provide for judicial review. United States v. Babcock, 250 U.S. 328, 331 (1919); Milliken v. Gleason, 332 F.2d 122 (1st Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 1002; Gross v. United States, 505 F.2d 1271 (Ct. Cl. 1974); Simons v. United States, 25 Cl. Ct. 685 (1992). Under one type of statute known as a \u201cstatute of grace,\u201d Congress gives agencies discretionary authority to settle claims of a particular type for which legal liability does not otherwise exist. The statute provides for administrative settlement, but not judicial review. An example is the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees\u2019 Claims Act of 1964, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721. Under this type of statute, the courts may compel an agency to actually exercise its discretion and may enforce constitutional requirements, but may not otherwise review the merits of the agency\u2019s decision on an individual claim. E.g., Work v. Rives, 267 U.S. 175 (1925).", "In between the two extremes one encounters a variety of situations. Under some of the major claim statutes, an attempt at administrative resolution is a mandatory prerequisite to being able to sue. Examples are the Federal Tort Claims Act and Contract Disputes Act. Under statutes of this type, the merits of the agency\u2019s decision will be subject to judicial scrutiny.", "As we have noted, a great many claims arise under statutes which do not directly address claims settlement or procedures. For example, 19 U.S.C.  \u00a7 1619 authorizes rewards to persons furnishing information concerning violations of the customs laws. The statute nowhere mentions the processing of claims. As discussed in Chapter 4, a person claiming a reward under this statute can file suit under the Tucker Act. This being the case, it follows that the claimant should be able to pursue the presumably faster and less expensive route of administrative adjudication, without the need to file a lawsuit. For claims in this broad category, administrative settlement is an available option, although it is not legally required as a prerequisite to suit.", "For now, the point to emphasize is that every federal agency is exposed to claims. At an absolute minimum, the agency will have employees with various entitlements; it will enter into contracts of one sort or another; and it will be exposed to potential tort liability. Thus, every agency engages in administrative claims settlement. The degree of formality and sophistication will vary with the agency\u2019s size and the types of programs it administers, but every agency does it and must therefore be prepared to do it.", "There can be no doubt that the policy of the United States Government is to encourage the resolution of claims at the administrative level and thereby minimize the need to resort to the courts. The success of this system requires public confidence in the basic fairness and integrity of the administrative process. This, apart from the fact that we have to do it anyway, is why administrative claims settlement is important."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2.

The Statute", "paragraphs": ["\u201cExcept as provided in this chapter or another law, the Comptroller General shall settle all claims of or against the United States Government.\u201d", "This statute is derived from legislation originally enacted in 1817 (3 Stat. 366). The claims settlement function was originally lodged in the Treasury Department, and was transferred to GAO by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921. The origins and history of the statute are discussed in Lambert Lumber Co. v. Jones Engineering & Construction Co., 47 F.2d 74 (8th Cir. 1931), cert. denied, 283 U.S. 842. GAO\u2019s regulations on claims settlement are found in 4 C.F.R. Parts 30 36 and Title 4 of  GAO\u2019s Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies. \u201cThe word \u2018settlement\u2019 in connection with public transactions and accounts has been used from the beginning to describe administrative determination of the amount due. . . . The words \u2018settled and adjusted\u2019 [as used in the predecessor of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a)] were taken to mean the determination . . . for administrative purposes of the state of the account and the amount due. . . . \u201cWe should not say, of course, that instances may not be found in which the word \u2018settlement\u2019 has been used in acts of Congress in other senses, or in the sense of \u2018payment.\u2019 But it is apparent that the word \u2018settlement\u2019 in connection with public contracts and accounts, which are the subject of prescribed scrutiny for the purpose of ascertaining the rights and obligations of the United States, has a well defined meaning as denoting the appropriate administrative determination with respect to the amount due.\u201d", "Illinois Surety Co. v. United States ex rel. Peeler, 240 U.S. 214, 219 221 (1916).", "Thus, to settle a claim means to administratively determine the validity of that claim. Peeler at 220; Cooke v. United States, 91 U.S. 389, 399 (1875); Antrim Lumber Co. v. Hannan, 18 F.2d 548, 549 (8th Cir. 1927); 20 Comp. Gen. 573 (1941). Settlement includes the making of both factual and legal determinations. 20 Comp. Gen. at 577. The authority to settle and adjust claims does not, however, include the authority to compromise. B-200112, May 5, 1983; B-133616, October 25, 1957; B-122319, August 21, 1956. In the context of payment claims, the rationale for this is simply that a claim determined to be valid should be paid in full. Likewise, public funds should not be used to pay any part of a claim determined not to be valid. Thus, the authority to compromise a given claim against the United States depends on the existence of statutory authority above and beyond the authority to \u201csettle and adjust\u201d claims of that type. A survey of claims legislation will bear this out. One example is the specific inclusion of the word \u201ccompromise\u201d in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2672 (Federal Tort Claims Act).", "A number of agencies and government corporations are empowered by statute to \u201csue and be sued.\u201d This has been held to include the authority to compromise a claim without a lawsuit. 25 Comp. Gen. 685 (1946); B-190806, April 13, 1978. However, compromise authority in this context is incident to the specific \u201csue and be sued\u201d power and not to more general claims settlement authority.", "The settlement function also includes the determination of whether an appropriation is legally available for making payment. 18 Comp.

Limitations on GAO\u2019s Claims Settlement Authority", "paragraphs": ["(1) Monetary vs. nonmonetary claims A claim for purposes of GAO\u2019s claims settlement authority means a monetary claim\u2014a claim for the payment of money. Without specific statutory authority, GAO is not authorized to consider nonmonetary claims, such as specific performance (B-179702, October 10, 1973). Also, GAO does not regard its claims settlement jurisdiction as extending to issues involving title to land. 19 Comp. Gen. 196 (1939); B-227438, November 13, 1987; B-223750, March 13, 1987; B-207613, April 6, 1983.", "Claims for the recrediting of annual or sick leave, while not calling for the immediate payment of money, are nevertheless regarded as monetary claims within GAO\u2019s settlement jurisdiction. 67 Comp.

(2) Authority otherwise provided for Even with respect to monetary claims, GAO\u2019s claims settlement jurisdiction under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) applies only in the absence of some other statutory scheme. This can come about in several ways. If an agency has statutory authority to settle its own claims, either generally or of some particular type, this specific authority will take precedence over 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3702(a). Thus: (a) The United States Postal Service has specific authority under the Postal Reorganization Act to settle its own claims. B-179464,  March 27, 1974. (b) GAO has no jurisdiction to settle claims against the District of Columbia Government. 1 Comp. Gen. 451 (1922); B-168704, January 16, 1970; B-129677, October 22, 1957. See also 36 Comp. Gen. 457 (1956). (Part of the rationale here is based on the status of the District of Columbia Government as a separate legal entity.) (c) GAO\u2019s claims settlement authority does not extend to government corporations where the corporation has authority to sue and be sued and to determine the character and necessity of its expenditures. 53 Comp. Gen. 337 (1973); 27 Comp. Gen. 429 (1948); B-190806, April 13, 1978; B-156202, March 9, 1965. (These decisions involve the Federal Housing Administration and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.) (d) Prior to 1979 legislation implementing the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977, the Panama Canal Company, as a government corporation, could settle its own claims but the Canal Zone Government was an independent agency of the United States subject to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a). B-179464, March 27, 1974. In 1979, both agencies were replaced by the Panama Canal Commission which has its own claims settlement authority in certain areas. This authority is discussed in B-197052, April 22, 1980, as modified by B-197052, February 4, 1981.", "In the absence of legislation expressly placing the authority elsewhere, however, as in the examples noted above, GAO\u2019s claims settlement jurisdiction under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) extends to all federal agencies. E.g., B-203638, December 23, 1981 (former Federal Home Loan Bank Board).", "If a statute authorizes agencies in general to settle claims of a particular type, and provides further that the agency\u2019s settlement shall be \u201cfinal and conclusive,\u201d GAO has no authority to review the merits of agency settlements. Examples are the Federal Tort Claims Act and the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees\u2019 Claims Act of 1964, discussed later in this chapter.", "A statutory scheme may be regarded as exclusive even without explicit \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d language. An example is claims subject to negotiated grievance procedures under collective bargaining agreements authorized by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. GAO\u2019s initial inclination was to accept jurisdiction where neither the agency nor the union objected. See 62 Comp. Gen. 274 (1983); 61 Comp. Gen. 20 (1981); 61 Comp. Gen. 15 (1981). To implement this policy, GAO issued regulations defining when it would and would not accept jurisdiction in this area. See, e.g., 60 Comp. Gen. 578 (1981); B-235624.2, December 4, 1989.", "Subsequent to GAO\u2019s regulations, the courts issued a series of decisions holding that, by virtue of the exclusivity language of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121, the grievance procedure is the exclusive means of resolving matters within the scope of a negotiated agreement, except for matters specifically excluded by statute or by the agreement itself. E.g., Aamodt v. United States, 976 F.2d 691 (Fed. Cir. 1992); Carter v. Gibbs, 909 F.2d 1452 (Fed. Cir. 1990), cert. denied sub nom. Carter v. Goldberg, 498 U.S. 811; Adams v. United States, 20 Cl.

Gen. 374 (1992), GAO announced that it was adopting the result of these decisions, and repealed its regulations shortly thereafter. 57 Fed. Reg. 31272 (July 14, 1992). Since that time, GAO has declined jurisdiction over claims subject to negotiated grievance procedures regardless of who consents. E.g., B-251784, February 19, 1993. Of course, GAO\u2019s jurisdiction continues to extend to claims involving employees who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. E.g., B-249168, July 30, 1992. It also continues to extend to claims subject to the grievance procedures of the Foreign Service Act of 1980, which does not contain an exclusivity provision comparable to that of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121, unless the claimant has elected to proceed before the Foreign Service Grievance Board. B-254556, January 21, 1994.", "Another area in which GAO has declined settlement jurisdiction is claims for patent infringement. B-209159, October 21, 1982; B-160745, February 13, 1967, aff\u2019d, B-160745, July 27, 1967; B-149392, August 1, 1962. The main reason for this is that the remedy provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498(a) (action in the Court of Federal Claims) is viewed as exclusive. The Comptroller General may nevertheless render decisions on the use of appropriated funds in patent-related contexts. For example, 37 Comp. Gen. 199 (1957) held that 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2386 authorizes the military departments to enter into agreements, using procurement appropriations, for the settlement of claims arising out of patent infringements. Absent such a statute, however, this authority would not exist. 11 Comp. Gen. 44 (1931).", "Also, GAO cannot resolve issues of mental competency. B-191904, July 19, 1978 (non-decision letter); B-196052-O.M., January 7, 1980. Both of these were claims for the refund of money allegedly donated to the United States in which the claimant contended that mental incompetency precluded the donor from forming the necessary donative intent. This type of issue must be resolved by court action.(3) Merits vs. cognizability Even though GAO may not question the merits of a settlement under a statute which makes an agency\u2019s settlement action final and conclusive, GAO retains the authority to consider the threshold question of whether a given claim is cognizable under the statute. As stated in 47 Comp. Gen. 316, 318 (1967) with respect to the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees\u2019 Claims Act of 1964, an agency\u2019s settlement \u201cif made in accordance with the provisions of the . . . act and applicable regulations, would be final and conclusive.\u201d", "To take a simple illustration, if an agency settles a tort claim resulting from an automobile accident, GAO has no authority to question the agency\u2019s determination that its employee was negligent, nor can it question the amount of the award (assuming, of course, that it does not exceed the amount claimed). However, if the claim arose in a foreign country, the agency\u2019s settlement would not be entitled to \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d status because, in view of the specific exception in the Federal Tort Claims Act for claims arising in foreign countries, the claim would not be properly cognizable under the statute. If the claim is not of the type covered by the statute to begin with, the agency never acquires the authority to make a \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d settlement.", "The concept was discussed in an early decision of the Comptroller of the Treasury, 21 Comp. Dec. 250 (1914). In that case, the Secretary of Agriculture asked whether he could pay a claim under a statute (now 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 502(d)) which authorized the Secretary to reimburse owners of horses, vehicles, and other equipment lost or damaged while being used for official business. The claim was for a mule, owned by a Forest Service employee, which had died presumably while engaged in official business. The Comptroller pointed out that the statute gave the Secretary jurisdiction to determine the facts as to whether loss or damage occurred incident to official business and the amount of the loss or damage. However, this conclusion \u201cdoes not deprive the Comptroller of his jurisdiction to determine generally the scope and purpose of the legislation and to limit expenditures thereunder to the contemplated purposes . . . .\u201d 21 Comp. Dec. at 251. See also 4 Comp. Gen. 876 (1925); B-190106, March 6, 1978; B-153031, January 28, 1964. \u201cwas without jurisdiction, his decision is not binding upon anyone.

If, for example, the statute of limitations has expired and there is no applicable basis for tolling, paying the claim amounts to giving away the taxpayers\u2019 money. Another corollary is that, absent a statutory basis, an agency has no authority to issue regulations purporting to accept liability on claims it perceives to be fair and equitable.

Arbitration has often been characterized as a \u201csplit the baby in half\u201d approach. Under the classic form of arbitration, assuming a two-party dispute, each party selects an arbitrator, those two arbitrators then select a third, and the parties agree to be bound by the outcome. Arbitration under the ADR Act is somewhat different.", "Agencies may use arbitration if all parties to the dispute consent. Id.  \u00a7 575(a)(1).

First, it amended the Contract Disputes Act to authorize the contractor and contracting officer to use ADR procedures to resolve claims. An arbitration award is subject to judicial review under the standards of 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9 13, and the court is expressly authorized to modify or set aside any award that violates limitations imposed by federal statute.

Thus, the final decisionmaking power remains, as it should, in government hands.", "Some other examples of statutes authorizing the federal government to submit various matters to arbitration are 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7121, 7122 (part of grievance procedure under collective bargaining agreement); 20 U.S.C.  \u00a7 107d-2 (Randolph-Sheppard Act); 46 U.S.C.

There is no option involved. For any given claim, one of these methods will apply to the exclusion of the other two. The first place to look, of course, is the statute authorizing the settlement, although this will not always provide the complete answer. (1) Payment from agency appropriations This is by far the most common source of payment and will apply unless one of the other methods is expressly directed by statute. In some cases, the relevant claims statute will specifically address payment. For example, under the Federal Tort Claims Act, administrative settlements of $2,500 or less are paid \u201cby the head of the Federal agency concerned out of appropriations available to that agency.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2672.

The authority was made permanent in 1990.", "If payment is to be made from agency appropriations, it is necessary to determine when the obligation occurs and hence what fiscal year to charge. The governing principle, stated in a number of earlier decisions, is that a claim against an annual appropriation is chargeable to the appropriation for the fiscal year in which the liability was incurred. E.g., 18 Comp. Gen. 363, 365 (1938). Exactly when this happens depends on the type of claim.", "As a general proposition, claims involving property damage or personal injury will be chargeable to the fiscal year in which the final determination of the government\u2019s liability is made. The theory is that there is no obligation on the part of the government until the claim is adjudicated and allowed. Thus, administrative awards of $2,500 or less under the Federal Tort Claims Act are payable from funds current when the award is made. 38 Comp. Gen. 338 (1958); 35 Comp.

GAO applied the same reasoning and result to expenses of hospitalization and related transportation paid by the State Department under the discretionary authority of the Foreign Service Act of 1946. Under the statute, there is no obligation until the State Department administratively determines that the illness or injury occurred in the line of duty and not as the result of misconduct. B-80060, September 30, 1948.", "Contract claims settled at the contracting officer level are chargeable to appropriations current at the time the basic contract was executed if they are based on \u201cantecedent liability.\u201d A contract claim is based on antecedent liability if the modification or adjustment is within the general scope of the original contract and is made pursuant to a provision, such as a \u201cChanges\u201d clause, in the original contract. Contract claims not based on antecedent liability are chargeable to appropriations current when the claim is allowed. For example, a contractor provided supplemental research services under a contract with the Interior Department without the issuance of written contract amendments. Since the government received the benefit of the services and ratified the transaction, the contractor was entitled to be paid. The work was within the general scope of the original contract and the government\u2019s liability was viewed as deriving from the \u201cChanges\u201d clause.

The latter case held that agency contributions to an employee\u2019s retirement account, where not payable from the permanent judgment appropriation, must be prorated among the fiscal years covered. While the case does not discuss administrative payments of back pay, it implies that back pay under the Back Pay Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and the Veterans Preference Act should be treated similarly.(2) Payment from separate appropriation or fund In a number of instances, Congress has prescribed that claims of a particular type be paid from a separate fund established for that purpose. If this is the case, the agency does not have a choice. Since a specific statutory provision governs over a more general one, the agency must use the prescribed source and may not use its regular operating appropriations.

This statute authorizes the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to settle claims for death, personal injury, or property damage resulting from the conduct of NASA\u2019s functions, if presented in writing within 2 years after the incident giving rise to the claim. Claims of $25,000 or less are paid directly by NASA from its own funds. Claims in excess of $25,000 are paid from the judgment appropriation. The NASA statute differs from the Military, Foreign, and National Guard Claims Acts in one important respect. Under the military statutes, if a claim exceeds the amount payable from agency funds, only the excess over that amount is paid from the judgment appropriation, Under the NASA statute, the entire amount of claims in excess of $25,000 is paid from the judgment appropriation.", "A key point about the claims under this heading\u2014payable from separate appropriation or fund\u2014is that, even though the agency may not use its own appropriations, a source is available for immediate payment. (3) Payment from specific congressional appropriation There are several instances in which there is no source of funds available for immediate payment. If the legislation governing a particular type of claim requires specific appropriations, then payment must await congressional action.

This means the assurance that the payment is discharging the government\u2019s obligation and that the government will not find itself embroiled in controversy between competing claimants with the resulting possibility of being required to pay twice. Also relevant is the government\u2019s policy against serving as agent for the collection of private debts. E.g., 54 Comp. Gen. 424, 427 (1974).", "If the payee is an individual who is (a) alive, (b) not a minor, (c) mentally competent, and (d) at a known location, the matter is simple. The check is drawn payable to the individual and sent to his or her address of record. See, e.g., B-217468, June 25, 1985 (where individual who was also incorporated had been retained to provide services as an individual, payment should be made to the individual and not to the corporation). If any of the 4 elements noted are not present, the matter becomes more complicated.", "If the payee is deceased, payment should be made to the legal representative (executor or administrator) of the payee\u2019s estate. Normally, this refers to probate proceedings in the state of the decedent\u2019s domicile at the time of death. In appropriate circumstances, however, this does not preclude a person from qualifying as legal representative where the decedent\u2019s will has been properly probated in a state other than the state of domicile, for example, a state in which the decedent\u2019s property is located. See Miniafee v. United States, 17 Cl. Ct. 571, 577 (1989) (reaching this conclusion with respect to final settlement of accounts of deceased members of armed forces under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2771). If the estate has been closed and state law has a procedure for handling the distribution of property found after closing, that procedure should be followed. B-234425, May 30, 1989. \u201cIn a large number of cases, where the Government is found indebted to a person who dies before payment can be effected, it happens that the amount of the indebtedness is so small that to insist upon the appointment of an administrator before payment would result in a virtual confiscation of the amount due or at least reduce it so as to leave little for the beneficiaries of the estate.\u201d", "See also 12 Comp. Dec. 439, 440 (1906). GAO\u2019s current policy stems from B-69787-O.M., May 2, 1979. Payments of $3,000 or less may be made without requiring the appointment of a legal representative. For payments larger than $3,000, appointment should be required if and only if required by the law of the decedent\u2019s domicile at the time of death. If there are no probate proceedings, payment is made in accordance with the law of the decedent\u2019s domicile.", "Similarly, if a settlement involves payment to or on behalf of a minor, appointment of a legal guardian generally will be required where required by state law, for example, if state law limits the amount payable to a parent or natural guardian and the award exceeds that amount. B-176252-O.M., September 5, 1972. See 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.5 for documentation requirements. For payments to \u201cincompetent public creditors,\u201d see 4 C.F.R. Part 36. If the payee\u2019s whereabouts are unknown, the money is credited to a trust account described later in this chapter under the Unclaimed Money/Property heading.", "Payments to a corporate payee which is no longer in existence also present complications. Some guidance exists in GAO\u2019s determinations under the International Claims Settlement Act discussed later in this chapter. In a case where a corporation had been dissolved and potential claimants (e.g., creditors, stockholders) were unknown, GAO advised the agency to simply close its file and deobligate the money. If a claimant should subsequently surface, payment could be made in accordance with 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1553 for expired or closed accounts. B-203676, September 21, 1981. In Automatic Sprinkler Corp. v. Darla Environmental Specialists, Inc., 852 F. Supp. 16 (N.D. Ill. 1994), the General Services Administration was holding money concededly owed to a contractor which had been dissolved under state law. To prevent what it regarded as a \u201cwindfall\u201d for the government, the court ordered the money paid to a state court judgment creditor of the defunct corporation, subject to an outstanding federal tax lien.", "There will be the occasional case in which the proper payee cannot be determined short of an adversary proceeding, in which event the proper course of action is to deny payment administratively and leave the competing claimants to their remedy in the courts. E.g., 68 Comp. Gen. 284 (1989).", "As a general proposition, government checks should be delivered directly to the payees. 16 Comp. Gen. 840 (1937). However, they may be delivered to the agency involved for subsequent forwarding to the payees where there is some valid reason for doing so. 65 Comp. Gen. 81 (1985). (2) Payment to wrong person Payment to the wrong person does not discharge the government\u2019s obligation. If, through administrative mistake of fact or law, or clerical error, a payment is made to a person not entitled to it, the government is still obligated to make payment to the proper claimant. The agency should take action to recover from the first payee, but payment to the proper claimant should not be held up pending recovery of the erroneous payment, even though this may result in a duplicate payment. Illustrative cases are 66 Comp. Gen. 617 (1987), affirmed upon reconsideration, B-226540.2, August 24, 1988 (agency which breached joint payment agreement by erroneously sending check to only one of the parties was liable to co-payee); 37 Comp.

United States, 27 Fed. Cl. 628, 632 (1993); Aris Gloves, Inc. v. United States, 420 F.2d 1386, 1391 (Ct. Cl. 1970).", "There is no rule or formula for determining whether a taking has occurred; the determination depends on the particular circumstances of each case. Aris Gloves, 420 F.2d at 1391; Althaus, 7 Cl. Ct. at 693. The mere indication of ownership, such as the publication of a map inadvertently indicating government ownership of the claimant\u2019s land, does not amount to a taking. Poorbaugh, 27 Fed. Cl. at 632. Destruction of trees without the taking of the underlying land is also not a taking for Fifth Amendment purposes. Id. at 633.", "The taking need not be a fee simple taking but may be the taking of an easement, such as an air easement. Aircraft flights which are sufficiently low, loud, and frequent may support inverse condemnation liability if the interference is permanent, or at least constructively permanent. Some of the cases are Griggs v. Allegheny County, 369 U.S. 84 (1962); United States v. Causby, 328 U.S. 256 (1946); Batten v. United States, 306 F.2d 580 (10th Cir. 1962), cert. denied, 371 U.S. 955; Wilfong v. United States, 480 F.2d 1326 (Ct. Cl. 1973); Brown v. United States, 30 Fed.

The distinction is based generally on the permanency of the damage. One of the more common situations is flood damage caused by government construction activities such as levee construction by the Corps of Engineers. In order for the damage to constitute an inverse condemnation, either the land must be permanently flooded or it must be subject to frequent and inevitably recurring overflows. Damage short of this is a tort. Turner v. United States, 17 Cl. Ct. 832, 835 (1989), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 901 F.2d 1093 (Fed. Cir. 1990); B-190362, December 14, 1977; B-137765, December 19, 1958.", "The tort vs. taking distinction is important because different remedies and procedures apply. See B-226619, July 2, 1987; B-127766, February 13, 1959. For example, if the case is a tort, the claimant must file an administrative claim before going to court; there is no similar requirement for inverse condemnations. Tort claims must go to a United States district court; inverse condemnation claims over $10,000 must go to the Court of Federal Claims. E.g., Myers v. United States, 323 F.2d 580 (9th Cir. 1963). It has also been suggested that the Military Claims Act might be an available remedy in appropriate cases. See B-215491, June 13, 1984; B-134854, January 29, 1958.", "In addition, if the claim is viewed as a tort claim, any administrative consideration must be by the agency whose activities gave rise to the claim; GAO review is not available. On the other hand, an inverse condemnation claim is within GAO\u2019s claims settlement jurisdiction inasmuch as it is a monetary claim against the United States and there is no other statutory settlement procedure. B-139543-O.M., June 10, 1959. An example is 71 Comp. Gen. 60 (1991) (claim for flood damage caused by Corps of Engineers construction of hydroelectric plant denied because project was a legitimate exercise of government\u2019s dominant servitude over navigable waters under the Commerce Clause). An older example is B-22355, January 7, 1942 (damage to private property resulting from water wave caused by launching of Navy vessel not a compensable taking). Since the claims are within GAO\u2019s settlement jurisdiction, they are subject to the 6-year statute of limitations of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b). B-192917-O.M., March 6, 1980.", "GAO\u2019s role in settling inverse condemnation claims is limited. GAO settles claims based on the written record, and inverse condemnation claims often involve issues which are not amenable to resolution in this manner. GAO has been able to settle taking claims where there is no disagreement as to amount. E.g., B-146291-O.M., August 3, 1961. In a case where the parties had not reached agreement, GAO authorized settlement in the amount determined by the agency. B-157405, August 30, 1965. In many cases, however, when faced with conflicts which could not be resolved from the written record, GAO has been forced to disallow the claims, leaving the claimants to their remedy in the courts.

Prior to the 1964 statute, similar authority had existed for the military departments, the immediate predecessor being the Military Personnel Claims Act of 1945 (59 Stat. 225), but no such authority existed for the civilian agencies. E.g., 45 Comp. Gen. 468 (1966); B-146256, August 16, 1961. The 1964 enactment incorporated the existing authority and extended it to the civilian agencies.", "The Act authorizes the President to prescribe uniform implementation policies, at least for the civilian agencies (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721(j)), but the authority has not been exercised. Thus, it is up to each department and agency to determine its own policies subject to the statutory criteria.", "The Act applies to all federal agencies, but does not apply to nonappropriated fund activities or contractors. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101, 3721(a)(1).", "Apart from the specified exclusions, GAO has liberally construed the Act as applicable to all branches of the government. For example, it applies to the Library of Congress. 44 Comp. Gen. 402 (1965); B-163125, February 12, 1968. It also applies to the judicial branch. B-155877, June 22, 1971. \u201cSettle\u201d is defined as \u201cconsider, determine, adjust, and dispose of a claim by disallowance or by complete or partial allowance.\u201d 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3721(a)(3). Denial of a claim therefore constitutes settlement. Macomber v. United States, 335 F. Supp. 197 (D.R.I. 1971). There is no mention of compromise.", "An agency\u2019s settlement of a claim is \u201cfinal and conclusive.\u201d 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3721(k). Thus, GAO has no jurisdiction to settle claims under the Act except for claims by GAO employees, nor may it question an agency\u2019s settlement as long as it was made in accordance with the statutory criteria and applicable regulations. E.g., 62 Comp. Gen. 641, 642 (1983); 47 Comp. Gen. 316 (1967); B-219094, December 5, 1985; B-185513, March 24, 1976; B-185008, October 29, 1975. Also, judicial review is not available. Meade v.

B-187913, February 9, 1977; B-185497, August 6, 1976. However, a certifying officer (or disbursing officer, as the case may be) who suspects fraud is not expected to don blinders and pay the claim anyway, but rather has a duty to inquire further. B-192978, February 28, 1979.", "It has been said that payment of a claim under the Act \u201cis not a matter of right but of grace resting in administrative discretion.\u201d 62 Comp. Gen. 641, 642 (1983), quoting B-144926, February 23, 1961 (statement originally made in context of military predecessor of 1964 statute). Within the limits of cognizability (e.g., claimant must be a government employee, loss or damage must be to personal property, etc.), each agency is free to determine what claims it will or will not consider. There are limits, however, in the sense that an agency must actually exercise its discretion and cannot merely refuse to consider all claims. 62 Comp. Gen. 641 (1983). Thus, if GAO advises an agency that it may consider claims of a particular type, this does not mean that the agency must consider them. The decision either way is within the agency\u2019s discretion. Stating this from the claimant\u2019s perspective, unless the agency has limited its discretion in its regulations, an employee does not have the right to have a particular claim paid; he or she, however, does have the right to submit a claim and to have the agency respond to it. Of course, the agency must exercise its discretion fairly and consistently.", "The authority and limitations of the statute may be described in the form of nine elements which must be present for an agency to settle a claim and to have that settlement entitled to \u201cfinal and conclusive\u201d status. These elements, which in effect comprise a checklist of the statutory requirements, are listed separately below. 1. The claimant must be a member of the uniformed services or a civilian officer or employee. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721(b). A claim by anyone else may not be considered. Thus, the Comptroller General held that the Federal Aviation Agency \u201ccommunity club\u201d in Guam, the property of which was either donated by club members or purchased with club funds, was not a proper claimant and that its claim was therefore not cognizable under the Act. B-190106, March 6, 1978.", "The Vice President of the United States is an \u201cofficer of the United States\u201d for purposes of the statute. B-202683, December 9, 1981. 2. The claim must be for damage to or loss of personal property. 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 3721(b). The Act does not cover damage to real property. B-197240-O.M., March 17, 1980. Within the universe of personal property, it generally applies to tangible property but not to intangible property such as the loss of a nonrefundable airline ticket when the employee is called back to duty. B-244256, June 14, 1991 (non-decision letter). It does cover lost or stolen cash, such as money representing an advance payment of per diem for temporary duty, if and to the extent permitted by agency regulations. B-208639, October 5, 1982; B-197927, September 12, 1980; B-190125, December 28, 1977. For example, where several Navy members gave their paychecks to an enlisted member to get them cashed and the enlisted member was robbed at gunpoint, the loss was viewed as a loss of personal property cognizable under section 3721. B-185008, October 29, 1975.", "The Act does not require that claims be filed only by the owner of the property. Thus, an employee who has borrowed property may file a claim under appropriate circumstances, generally where he or she has reimbursed the owner for the loss. B-192088-O.M., May 28, 1980.", "The claimant does not have to show that the loss or damage was caused by someone else\u2019s negligence, or indeed even be able to explain how it occurred. All the claimant needs to establish is that the loss or damage occurred and, if questioned by the agency, that there was no contributing fault attributable to the claimant. Anton v. Greyhound Van Lines, 591 F.2d 103, 109 (1st Cir. 1978); B-208627, September 16, 1983. 3. Maximum settlement authority is $40,000. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721(b). Of course, the loss may have been much greater, but a maximum of $40,000 is recoverable from the government. The claim may be paid in money or the property replaced in kind, presumably at the agency\u2019s discretion. Id. The monetary ceiling in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721(b) was intended to provide equal treatment and a uniform level of benefits for all covered employees. Thus, a provision in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 authorizing the use of funds without regard to laws and regulations governing the obligation and expenditure of United States funds as necessary to accomplish the Act\u2019s purposes does not authorize settlement in excess of the $40,000 limit. B-246211.2, December 7, 1992.", "If household goods are lost or destroyed in transit incident to a change of duty station, and it is necessary for the employee to ship replacement items, the cost of shipping the replacement items was at one time regarded as an allowable component of a section 3721 claim. In 68 Comp. Gen. 143 (1988), GAO advised that the cost of shipping the replacement items can be borne by the government wholly independent of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721 and its monetary limit. 68 Comp. Gen. 143 (1988).", "The statute does not require that payments received from another source, such as an insurance company, be applied against the $40,000. However, a claimant should not recover twice for the same loss. Thus, the more common approach, which GAO views as consistent with the legislative history, is to deduct third-party recoveries from the statutory limit when the loss does not exceed that limit. If the loss exceeds the $40,000 limit, third-party recoveries should be applied against the dollar amount of the loss, with the $40,000 ceiling then relating to the balance. B-91607-O.M., August 1, 1974. Thus, a claimant with a $10,000 loss who receives $10,000 in insurance payments should be entitled to claim nothing. A claimant with a $50,000 loss who receives $10,000 in insurance payments, however, would still be able to file a claim for up to the $40,000 limit.", "For claims involving possible third-party liability (carrier, insurer, etc.), the agency has a choice. It can require the employee/claimant to first pursue any third-party recoveries before filing a claim with the agency, or it can accept a claim for the full amount up to the monetary ceiling. 61 Comp. Gen. 537 (1982). The choice is discretionary with the agency, but the agency should declare its policy in its regulations and apply that policy consistently. Id. at 540. If the agency chooses the latter policy\u2014that is, if it is willing to consider claims without requiring the employee to first pursue any third-party recoveries\u2014settlement with the employee operates as an assignment of the third-party claim to the government. Id. at 537 38; 53 Comp. Gen. 61 (1973).", "If the agency then recovers from the liable third party, the recovery does not have to be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, but may be retained by the agency for credit to the appropriation used to pay the original claim. 61 Comp. Gen. 537 (1982); B-208627, September 16, 1983. 4. The loss or damage must be \u201cincident to service\u201d. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721(b). The decisions have frequently pointed out that neither the Act nor its legislative history defines the term \u201cincident to service.\u201d E.g., B-187913, February 9, 1977; B-185513, March 24, 1976; B-169236, April 21, 1970. One court has stated that the loss must bear some substantial relation to the claimant\u2019s service or employment. Fidelity-Phenix Fire Ins. Co. v. United States, 111 F. Supp. 899 (N.D. Cal. 1953), aff\u2019d sub nom. Preferred Ins. Co. v. United States, 222 F.2d 942 (9th Cir. 1955), cert. denied, 350 U.S. 837. The phrase is somewhat analogous to \u201cscope of employment\u201d in the Federal Tort Claims Act but the exact relationship has not been definitively established. \u201cThe Committee is also informed that most major losses of property by military and civilian personnel occur through no fault of the individual, but arise from fires in on-base military quarters, fires in warehouses where goods are being stored at government expense, destruction of moving vans transporting goods during permanent change-of-station moves, and losses at sea.\u201d", "H.R.

This being the case\u2014that is, if an agency can decide to completely exclude some particular type of claim\u2014it follows that the agency can set monetary limits on what it will allow. For example, an agency should be able to decide that it will consider claims for stolen cash but only up to some specified limit, or motor vehicle claims up to a specified amount. 5. The claim must be \u201csubstantiated\u201d. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721(f)(1). The degree of evidence necessary to satisfy this requirement is up to the agency. Thus, GAO denied a claim by one of its own employees for sterling silver flatware lost in shipment where the flatware was not listed on the shipper\u2019s inventory and there was no other documentary evidence to substantiate that the flatware was in fact included in the shipment. B-201703-O.M., June 8, 1981.", "If an agency suspects fraud or misrepresentation, in addition to pursuing other appropriate actions, the agency must decide how much of the claim should be denied. Thus, GAO found in B-192978, February 28, 1979, that it was within an agency\u2019s discretion under the statute to treat each item claimed as a separate claim for adjudication purposes. 6. The agency must determine that possession of the property was \u201creasonable or useful under the circumstances.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721(f)(2).

Standard concepts of accrual used under other statutes of limitation apply to this one as well. 8. A claim for loss or damage occurring at \u201cquarters\u201d occupied by the claimant within the 50 states or the District of Columbia is cognizable only if the quarters were \u201cassigned or provided in kind\u201d by the government. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721(e). This limitation does not apply to quarters outside of the 50 states or the District of Columbia.", "Claims by military personnel for damage occurring in government-owned quarters occupied on a rental basis have been held not excluded under this provision. Fidelity-Phenix Fire Ins. Co. v. United States, cited above; B-142446-O.M., June 3, 1960.

The Commission on Government Procurement had recommended that contract claims be paid from the appropriations of the contracting agency to the extent feasible. There were two reasons for this. First, prior to the CDA, board awards were paid directly by the agency whereas court judgments were paid from the permanent judgment appropriation established by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 without any form of charge-back to the agency. Under this system, it actually paid agencies to resist settlement and force the case to court. Second, charging agency appropriations would more accurately reflect the \u201ctrue economic costs\u201d of the agency\u2019s procurement activities. 4 Report of the Commission on Government Procurement 29 30 (1972). These considerations formed the backdrop of what became the CDA\u2019s payment provision. \u201cAny judgment against the United States on a claim under this chapter shall be paid promptly in accordance with the procedures provided by section 1304 of Title 31.\u201d", "There is nothing new here; subsection (a) merely states what the law was prior to the CDA. \u201cAny monetary award to a contractor by an agency board of contract appeals shall be paid promptly in accordance with the procedures contained in subsection (a) of this section.\u201d", "This was new. Board of contract appeals awards had never before been payable from the judgment appropriation. Without more, however, this would have stood the Procurement Commission\u2019s recommendation on its head by virtually assuring that claims would almost never end at the contracting officer\u2019s level. \u201cPayments made pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section shall be reimbursed to the fund provided by section 1304 of Title 31 by the agency whose appropriations were used for the contract out of available funds or by obtaining additional appropriations for such purposes.\u201d", "Thus, subsections (a) and (b) assure prompt payment to the successful claimant; subsection (c) implements the Procurement Commission\u2019s recommendation.", "Since payment of board awards is to be made \u201cin accordance with the procedures provided by\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304, the requirements relating to judgments discussed in Chapter 14 will be generally applicable. In view of the CDA\u2019s reimbursement requirement, the provision in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 that payment be \u201cnot otherwise provided for\u201d will generally not be an issue in Contract Disputes Act payments. However, payment may be made only upon certification by the Comptroller General, and the award or judgment must be \u201cfinal.\u201d Since the CDA authorizes the Court of Federal Claims to enter partial judgments (41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(e)), and authorizes a board to grant the same relief available from the Court of Federal Claims (id. \u00a7 607(d)), it is possible to have two or more partial judgments or awards in the same case, a result that is normally not permissible under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. Thus, in one case, the principal portion of a board award was held payable notwithstanding that an appeal had been taken on the interest award. 60 Comp. Gen. 573 (1981).", "Generally, a prerequisite for payment will be the certification by both parties that no further review will be sought. This tells GAO that the award or judgment is final and therefore ready for payment. There are no uniform procedures for obtaining payment of board awards although a system has evolved informally under which the board\u2019s clerk or recorder gathers the necessary documentation from both parties and submits the package to GAO.", "Note that 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 612(b) refers to \u201cmonetary awards\u201d by boards of contract appeals. There is no provision for payment if the parties reach a settlement while the case is still pending before a board. Of course, the agency can simply pay just as it would pay an award by the contracting officer. If the agency is faced with insufficient funds, however, it can take advantage of section 612(b) by consenting to the entry of an award by the board based on the settlement. E.g., Casson Construction Co., GSBCA No. 7276, 84-1 BCA \u00b6 17,010 (1983). See also Bath Iron Works Corp. v. United States, 20 F.3d 1567, 1583 (Fed. Cir. 1994) (one purpose of CDA\u2019s payment scheme was to permit payment without regard to adequacy of contracting agency\u2019s appropriations). No harm is done because the reimbursement requirement of section 612(c) will apply in all cases.", "Reimbursement under 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 612(c) is chargeable to appropriations available for the agency\u2019s procurement activities current at the time of the award or judgment. 63 Comp. Gen. 308 (1984). If the agency has insufficient funds available for reimbursement, the statute permits it to seek additional appropriations. This does not require a specific, line-item appropriation, but can be satisfied from subsequent lump-sum appropriations available for the agency\u2019s procurement. Id. at 312. This is a common-sense proposition. If it were not the case, an agency could avoid reimbursement simply by never making the request. \u201cIt is clear that Congress wanted the ultimate accountability to fall on the procuring agency, but we do not think the statute requires the agency to disrupt ongoing programs or activities in order to find the money. If this were not the case, Congress could just as easily have directed the agencies to pay the judgments and awards directly. Clearly, an agency does not violate the statute if it does not make the reimbursement in the same fiscal year that the award is paid. Similarly, an agency may not be in a position to reimburse in the following fiscal year without disrupting other activities, since the agency\u2019s budget for that fiscal year is set well in advance. In our opinion, the earliest time an agency can be said to be in violation of 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 612(c) is the beginning of the second fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the award is paid.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "b.

The lesson of Merrill is that the United States is not bound by the unauthorized acts of those who purport to act for it. While this rule can produce the occasional harsh result, a moment\u2019s reflection will confirm its necessity. \u201cClearly,\u201d the Federal Circuit has stated, \u201cfederal expenditures would be wholly uncontrollable if Government employees could, of their own volition, enter into contracts obligating the United States.\u201d City of El Centro v.

This section discusses some ways in which, in the interest of basic fairness, the corners have become somewhat rounded. (1) Contract implied-in-fact vs. contract implied-in-law Contract-related claims fall into three categories\u2014express, implied-in-fact, implied-in-law. An express contract is \u201can agreement or mutual assent by the parties manifested in words, oral or written.\u201d People\u2019s Bank & Trust Co. v. United States, 11 Cl. Ct. 554, 566 (1987). While an oral contract is thus possible, \u201cexpress contract\u201d usually refers to the traditional piece of paper signed by both parties. As we have seen, claims under an express contract are governed by the Contract Disputes Act. \u201cfounded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding.\u201d", "Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. United States, 261 U.S. 592, 597 (1923); DeRoo v. United States, 12 Cl. Ct. 356, 361 (1987); 55 Comp. Gen. 768, 777 (1976); B-238112, July 30, 1990. The requirements for an implied-in-fact contract are the same as for an express contract\u2014offer and acceptance, consideration, mutuality of intent. Haberman v. United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 1405, 1411 (1992); Chavez v. United States, 18 Cl. Ct. 540, 544 45 (1989); Eliel v. United States, 18 Cl. Ct. 461, 466 (1989), aff\u2019d mem., 909 F.2d 1495 (Fed.

In addition, whether the contract is express or implied, the person purporting to act for the government must have actual authority to do so. Construction Equipment Lease Co. v. United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 341, 346 (1992); Eliel, 18 Cl. Ct. at 466; New America Shipbuilders, 15 Cl. Ct. at 143; Pollack v. United States, 15 Cl. Ct. 46, 48 49 (1988). (All four cases cite Merrill .) This can be \u201cimplied actual authority\u201d as well as \u201cexpress actual authority.\u201d H. Landau & Co. v. United States, 886 F.2d 322 (Fed. Cir. 1989). The essential difference between an express contract and an implied-in-fact contract is the nature of the evidence (Chavez, 18 Cl. Ct. at 545)\u2014under an implied contract, the meeting of minds is not expressed but is inferred from the conduct of the parties. Thus, a contract implied-in-fact is a \u201creal\u201d contract and as such, it too is governed by the Contract Disputes Act. 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 602(a).", "A contract implied-in-fact can be found only in situations in which the government would have the authority to make a binding express contract. Grismac Corp. v. United States, 556 F.2d 494 (Ct. Cl. 1977).", "In contrast, a contract implied-in-law, also called a \u201cquasi contract,\u201d is not a contract at all. It is a legal fiction whose purpose is to prevent unjust enrichment. Hershey Foods Corp. v. Ralph Chapek, Inc., 828 F.2d 989, 998 (3d Cir. 1987). It is \u201cimposed by operation of law without regard to the intent of the parties\u201d and is treated as a contract \u201cfor purposes of remedy only.\u201d Nitol v. United States, 7 Cl. Ct. 405, 415 (1985). Unlike a contract implied-in-fact, there is no mutuality of intent. Hickman v. United States, 135 F. Supp. 919, 922 (W.D. La. 1955). A simple example will illustrate. Your neighbors hire someone to paint their house. The painter arrives but mistakenly starts to paint your house. You watch from the window, chuckling, thinking you are going to get your house painted for nothing. Wrong. There was certainly no \u201ccontract\u201d\u2014no meeting of minds between you and the housepainter\u2014but, in order to prevent unjust enrichment, you will be held liable for the fair value of the work as if there were.", "When analyzing a claim \u201csounding in contract\u201d\u2014i.e., a claim for goods furnished or services performed\u2014for which no contractual obligation can be found, the agency should first ask whether it can ratify the transaction. The FAR addresses the subject in 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.602-3, \u201cRatification of unauthorized commitments.\u201d The authority applies to agreements that are not binding on the government solely because the official purporting to represent the government lacked the authority to enter into that agreement. Id. \u00a7 1.602-3(a). This is not limited to officials with no contracting authority, but includes officials with limited authority who exceed the applicable limit. E.g., B-169745, May 27, 1970; B-169557, May 4, 1970. (Both cases involved regional officials who procured services in excess of a delegated monetary ceiling, with GAO advising in both cases that the transactions should be ratified under a prior version of the regulation.)", "The ratifying official must have had the authority to enter into the agreement at the time it was made, and must still have that authority at the time of ratification. Id. \u00a7 1.602-3(c)(2). This is a fundamental element of ratification under agency law. See 22 Comp. Gen. 1083, 1086 (1943). See also Consortium Venture Corp. v. United States, 5 Cl. Ct. 47, 51 (1984), aff\u2019d mem., 765 F.2d 163 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (same requirement under prior version of regulation). The courts have occasionally noted the concept of \u201cinstitutional ratification\u201d (ratification by agency action such as acceptance of benefits), but it is not clear under what circumstances it might form the basis of government liability. See City of El Centro v. United States, 922 F.2d 816, 821 (Fed. Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 111 S. Ct. 2851.", "The FAR also provides that the agreement to be ratified must have been \u201cotherwise proper.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.602-3(c)(3). GAO has cautioned not to equate \u201cotherwise proper\u201d with \u201cotherwise perfect.\u201d If the unauthorized individual either didn\u2019t know that he or she lacked the necessary legal authority or didn\u2019t care, one shouldn\u2019t be too surprised to find other procedural defects as well, but these should not preclude ratification of an otherwise ratifiable transaction. B-210808, May 24, 1984. In addition, the price must be \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.602-3(c)(4).", "The FAR cautions that the ratification of unauthorized commitments should not be viewed as an alternative to sound contracting procedures. While the authority does exist, agencies should take \u201cpositive action\u201d to minimize the need to resort to it. 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.602-3(b)(1).", "If the authority of 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.602-3 is not available, ratification may nevertheless be possible under the \u201cextraordinary relief\u201d authority of Public Law 85-804 for those agencies eligible to use it. See FAR, 48 C.F.R.  \u00a7\u00a7 50.101(b) (eligible agencies), 50.302-3 (formalizing informal commitments).", "For appropriations accounting purposes, ratification is treated the same as if there had been a valid contract all along. If the need arose and the work was performed in the same fiscal year, then the obligation is chargeable to that fiscal year regardless of when the ratification takes place. 58 Comp. Gen. 789 (1979); B-208730, January 6, 1983. If the need arose in one year and performance took place in another year, or if performance relates to a contract executed in a prior year, the chargeable fiscal year is determined by applying the relevant element of the bona fide needs rule covered in Chapter 5, again as if there had been a valid contract all along. See B-197344, August 21, 1980. (3) Quantum meruit claims If the agency determines that it cannot ratify the transaction in question, it should then proceed with the only remaining possibility, a quantum meruit analysis. The underlying premise is that the government should not be unjustly enriched by retaining a benefit conferred in good faith, even where there is no enforceable contractual obligation, as long as the \u201cbenefit\u201d is not prohibited by law. See 40 Comp. Gen. 447, 451 (1961). This is the pure \u201ccontract implied-in-law\u201d situation. The Court of Federal Claims and the boards of contract appeals decline jurisdiction over contract implied-in-law claims because there is no \u201ccontract\u201d for purposes of their jurisdictional statutes (Contract Disputes Act, Tucker Act). The district courts similarly lack Tucker Act jurisdiction, but may be able to find some other basis. E.g., Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Bankers Trust Co. of Albany, 791 F.2d 242, 244 (2d Cir. 1986). However, GAO regards claims of this type as coming within its general claims settlement jurisdiction (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702). E.g., 65 Comp. Gen. 692, 695 (1986); 64 Comp. Gen. 727, 727-28 (1985). Thus, contract implied-in-law claims can be settled administratively even though judicial review may be unavailable in many, if not most, cases.", "At one time, for all claims of this type, if the agency could not or chose not to ratify, and the claimant continued to request payment, the required procedure was referral to GAO. See B-210808, May 24, 1984. Now, however, GAO applies the general standard of 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.4\u2014agencies should adjudicate all claims in the first instance, with referral to GAO only (a) if the agency regards a claim as doubtful, or (b) if a claimant seeks review of a disallowance. Agencies should, of course, apply the criteria set forth in GAO\u2019s numerous quantum meruit decisions.", "In order to allow a quantum meruit claim, four elements must be established: (1) The goods or services would have been a permissible procurement if correct procedures had been followed. (2) The government must have received and accepted a benefit. (3) The contractor or other performing party must have acted in good faith. (4) The amount claimed\u2014or in any event the amount that can be paid on the claim\u2014must represent the reasonable value of the benefit received.", "E.g., 70 Comp. Gen. 664 (1991); 69 Comp. Gen. 13 (1989); 66 Comp. Gen. 351 (1987); B-215651, March 15, 1985; B-210808, May 24, 1984.", "The first element, the \u201cpermissible procurement\u201d test, is not concerned with procedural deficiencies, even where the procedures are statutorily mandated; it was procedural deficiencies that got the parties to this point in the first place. 63 Comp. Gen. 579, 584 (1984). In applying the test, it is important to distinguish between a procedurally deficient procurement of otherwise authorized goods or services, and a procurement of goods or services which are themselves unauthorized. See 71 Comp. Gen. 145 (1992). Thus, the question is whether the government could have made a binding express contract for the goods or services in question. B-187593, June 26, 1978 (applying the standard of Grismac Corp. v. United States, noted earlier in connection with contracts implied-in-fact).", "For example, violation of an old statute, since repealed, which required that certain contracts be in writing did not preclude payment on a quantum meruit basis where the goods procured were not unauthorized. Salomon v. United States, 86 U.S. 17 (1873); 8 Comp. Dec. 526 (1902). Examples of expenditures which did not meet the \u201cpermissible procurement\u201d test are 71 Comp. Gen. 145 (1992) (T-shirts to be given to Combined Federal Campaign donors); 64 Comp. Gen. 467 (1985) (security equipment purchased by bank on military installation in circumstances beyond scope of regulations authorizing reimbursement); B-252780, August 26, 1993 (printing by private establishment in violation of statutes requiring printing to be done by Government Printing Office); B-251541, July 21, 1993 (procurement of interpreter services from active duty military officer on fee basis); B-230382, December 22, 1989 (meals for federal employees attending a conference at their official duty station); B-195566, March 17, 1980 (another printing case). Similarly, expenditures for permanent improvements to non-government property, generally prohibited subject to a few exceptions, would not be a permissible procurement for quantum meruit purposes. B-226843-O.M., October 13, 1987.", "The second element is the firmly established principle that the government must have received some tangible benefit to support a quantum meruit payment. United States v. Mississippi Valley Generating Co., 364 U.S. 520, 566 n.22 (1961); 46 Comp. Gen. 348 (1966); 40 Comp. Gen. 447, 451 (1961). Without such benefit, loss to the claimant is not enough, regardless of good faith. If there is no benefit, there can be no unjust enrichment. The benefit must be clear and not merely speculative. B-215145, August 13, 1985.", "Determining the benefit is usually a fairly simple matter, at least in most cases. It either exists or it doesn\u2019t. Cases in which the benefit was clear include 70 Comp. Gen. 664 (1991) (repairs to government vehicles); 66 Comp. Gen. 351 (1987) (supplies which the government actually used); 64 Comp. Gen. 727 (1985) (emergency service to restore telephone service after power outage); B-215651, March 15, 1985 (dental services to Coast Guard recruits).

Bankers Trust Co. of Albany, 791 F.2d 242 (2d Cir. 1986). The claimant was a utility which had provided service to a housing complex for which the Department of Housing and Urban Development had provided mortgage insurance. The court found \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d to HUD on the theory that if the utility had stopped providing service, the tenants would inevitably have stopped paying rent, thereby hastening the development\u2019s insolvency and increasing HUD\u2019s financial exposure. An earlier similar holding on which the court relied is S.S. Silberblatt, Inc. v. East Harlem Pilot Block, 608 F.2d 28 (2d Cir. 1979).", "The third required element is that the claimant must have acted in good faith. Good faith will normally include the exercise of reasonable diligence. B-215145, August 13, 1985. However, negligence alone has been found insufficient to negate a finding of good faith. B-226733-O.M., October 13, 1987. A history of satisfactory prior dealings between the claimant and the government is evidence of good faith. 69 Comp. Gen. 13, 15 (1989). See also B-210808, May 24, 1984. Sometimes, especially when all other elements are clearly present, a finding of good faith can be based on the absence of any evidence in the record to suggest anything else. E.g., 70 Comp. Gen. 664, 666 (1991).", "Performance by a claimant entirely on his, her, or its own initiative, without the knowledge or consent of any government official, authorized or unauthorized, raises a question as to the claimant\u2019s good faith. The fact that services were provided on an emergency basis is an adequate answer. 64 Comp. Gen. 727 (1985).", "If the above three elements are satisfied, the claim may be allowed, but\u2014and this is the fourth and final element\u2014only for the fair value of the benefit received. The claim is not measured by the loss to the claimant nor necessarily by the value the claimant places on the goods or services, but on the reasonable value of those goods or services to the government, which may or may not be the same as the amount claimed.", "The \u201creasonable value of services and materials is generally considered to be the amount for which they could be obtained under like circumstances.\u201d Wunderlich Contracting Co. v. United States, 240 F.2d 201, 205 (10th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 353 U.S. 950. In 66 Comp. Gen. 351 (1987), for example, where an unauthorized official ordered supplies, agency contracting personnel determined that those supplies could have been procured for a lesser amount under competitive procedures. The supplier\u2019s quantum meruit claim was allowed, but only for that lesser amount. A quantum meruit payment may not exceed the price under a mandatory Federal Supply Schedule contract. 63 Comp. Gen. 579 (1984); B-213489, March 13, 1984; B-195123, July 11, 1979. The same rule applies with respect to non-mandatory schedules. 69 Comp. Gen. 13 (1989). The reason is that Supply Schedule prices are derived through competition and are therefore presumptively fair and reasonable. Id. at 16.", "Similarly, in a quantum meruit claim for transportation services, the measure of recovery is the lowest rate available to the government for the same or similar services. 64 Comp. Gen. 612, 614 (1985); B-212991, November 28, 1983.", "If there has been a prior contractual relationship between the parties, the most recent contract price is a relevant indication of fair value.

If there is no other evidence one way or the other, and all other elements of the claim have been satisfied, the agency may pay the \u201ccontract price\u201d or the amount claimed if it regards that amount as fair and reasonable. E.g., B-251728.2, June 9, 1993 (services provided to Office of Independent Counsel). However, the agency should make some attempt at an independent determination and should not blindly agree to whatever is claimed. B-197057-O.M., August 22, 1980. Also, a quantum meruit payment may, in appropriate circumstances, include an allowance for profit. 67 Comp. Gen. 507 (1988); 38 Comp.

In B-232148, October 3, 1988, for example, a towing company towed a government trailer which had caught fire on the highway, and subsequently made a quantum meruit claim for towing and storage services. The payment could properly include storage charges up to the time the government was ready to remove the trailer, but not for a period beyond that point, during which the company held the trailer as security for its payment. Storage during this \u201cexcess\u201d period was of no benefit to the government.", "If the amount claimed is questioned, the claimant must be prepared to support it. Unsupported, blanket statements are not enough. 65 Comp. Gen. 692, 696 (1986). If the primary source documents are no longer available, reasonable secondary evidence may be used.

B-210808, May 24, 1984; B-207557, July 11, 1983. The rationale is that the government incurred the obligation to pay when it received the benefit.", "As with ratification, the quantum meruit theory provides a way to reach a fair and equitable result in appropriate cases. While it is thus a useful and important concept, it should not be construed as encouraging a permissive view of informal commitments and, again like ratification, \u201cshould not be viewed as a routine alternative to proper contracting procedures.\u201d B-197057-O.M., August 22, 1980.", "We noted earlier that the Court of Federal Claims and its predecessors have traditionally declined jurisdiction over contract implied-in-law claims. The situation has become somewhat unclear, however, in view of a line of cases in which the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit seems to recognize a \u201ccontract implied-in-fact for a quantum meruit.\u201d The leading case for this concept is United States v. Amdahl Corp., 786 F.2d 387 (Fed. Cir. 1986). The rationale is very hard to distinguish from the traditional implied-in-law unjust enrichment reasoning. See 786 F.2d at 393. See also Gould, Inc. v. United States, 935 F.2d 1271, 1275 (Fed. Cir. 1991), citing Amdahl for the proposition that a \u201ccourt may grant equitable relief under an illegal contract if the government received a benefit from the contractor\u2019s performance\u201d; United International Investigative Services v. United States, 26 Cl. Ct. 892, 899 900 (1992) (\u201cActual mental assent is not required for the formation of an implied-in-fact contract for a quantum meruit\u201d).

Cl. 1978).", "Precisely what Amdahl means and how far the courts or the boards of contract appeals may be willing to take it are far from clear. See, e.g., Mega Construction Co. v. United States, 29 Fed. Cl. 396 (1993) (recognizing that Amdahl blurs the implied-in-fact vs. implied-in-law distinction and declining to apply it); Eastern Trans-Waste of Maryland, Inc. v.

Cir. 1989). In any event, at least in terms of what relief may be available in the Court of Federal Claims and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, what was once regarded as \u201cblack letter law\u201d (Chavez v. United States, 15 Cl. Ct. 353, 357 n.2 (1988)) is perhaps now best characterized as \u201cgray letter law.\u201d", "In addition, relief in unauthorized commitment cases is conceptually related to the doctrine of estoppel, although the extent of the relationship has yet to be definitively determined. The question is the extent to which the unauthorized commitment/quantum meruit cases are affected by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414 (1990), holding that estoppel cannot form the basis of a monetary claim against the United States, at least where the payment would contravene a statute.

The assignee won over a surety claiming on both its performance and payment bonds in Coconut Grove Exchange Bank v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., 149 F.2d 73 (5th Cir. 1945). However, the Coconut Grove holding is generally regarded as limited to funds already paid to the assignee which, by virtue of the Assignment of Claims Act, cannot be recovered. For example, a performance bond surety received priority to unpaid contract balances over an assignee in Industrial Bank of Washington v. United States, 424 F.2d 932 (D.C. Cir. 1970), and National Shawmut Bank of Boston v. New Amsterdam Casualty Co., 411 F.2d 843 (1st Cir. 1969). See also 63 Comp.

In one case, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held, in effect, that a claimant could not use its status as performance bond surety on contract A to enhance its priority position with respect to contract B on which it was only a payment bond surety. Dependable Ins. Co. v. United States, 846 F.2d 65 (Fed. Cir. 1988). However, as the court explained a few years later, this was because the government had a competing tax claim to the contract B funds. In a case where the government was merely a stakeholder, the court held that a performance bond surety could assert a claim for expenses incurred under contract A against an equitable adjustment payable to the contractor under contract B under which the surety had incurred no expenses. Transamerica Ins. Co. v. United States, 989 F.2d 1188 (Fed. Cir. 1993).", "Next after the performance bond surety are government claims.

B-189679, September 7, 1977.", "Next in line after government claims is the payment bond surety. The subordination of the payment bond surety to government claims, noted in many of the previously cited cases, stems from the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Munsey Trust Co., 332 U.S. 234 (1947). The most common government claim in this situation is a tax claim, which invariably wins. E.g., In re Lanny Jones Welding & Repair, 106 B.R. 446 (Bankr. E.D. Va. 1988); 65 Comp. Gen. 29 (1985); 64 Comp. Gen. 763 (1985); 54 Comp. Gen. 823 (1975); B-189125, June 7, 1977; B-187903, December 21, 1976; B-174488, December 29, 1971. The principle applies equally to a Labor Department wage underpayment claim (B-181695, April 7, 1975), or a Small Business Administration advance payment claim (68 Comp. Gen. 269 (1989)). Munsey Trust itself involved an excess reprocurement cost claim. An agreement purporting to commit the government to pay the surety without regard to government claims is unauthorized. 40 Comp. Gen. 85 (1960).", "After the payment bond surety is the assignee. The Court of Federal Claims and its predecessors have consistently held an assignee subordinate to a payment bond surety. E.g., Great American Ins. Co. v.", "United States, 492 F.2d 821, 824 (Ct. Cl. 1974); Royal Indemnity Co. v. United States, 93 F. Supp. 891 (Ct. Cl. 1950); Reliance Ins. Co. v. United States, 15 Cl. Ct. 62 (1988). Starting with 63 Comp. Gen. 533 (1984), GAO has followed suit. See also 64 Comp. Gen. 763 (1985) and 67 Comp. Gen. 309 (1988). If a payment bond surety takes priority over an assignee, logic suggests that any claim with priority over the payment bond surety also has priority over the assignee.", "The principle of the preceding paragraph works neatly when the surety and assignee are the only competing claimants. It runs into conceptual difficulties when a tax claim enters the picture. As discussed in more detail under the Assignment of Claims heading of this chapter, an assignee is protected against tax offsets if the contract contains an authorized no-setoff clause. E.g., 65 Comp. Gen. 554 (1986). Even without a no-setoff clause, the assignee will prevail over a tax claim arising after perfection of the assignment. 67 Comp. Gen. 505 (1988). The problem is that integrating this relationship with the payment bond surety\u2019s subordination to tax claims resembles the proverbial dog chasing its tail\u2014the IRS beats the surety who beats the assignee who beats the IRS who beats the surety, ad infinitum. See 63 Comp. Gen. at 536; 64 Comp. Gen. at 767. As both of these cases state, the solution is to recognize that the assignee is entitled to its priority over the tax claim only if it can show that it is otherwise entitled to the funds, which it cannot do by virtue of the surety\u2019s dominant claim. Id.", "If a payment bond surety could qualify as an assignee, it could in some cases enhance its position by taking advantage of a no-setoff clause. As a general proposition, this cannot happen since a surety is not a financing institution for purposes of the Assignment of Claims Act. E.g., B-187456, November 4, 1976; B-169420, October 22, 1970. Consistent with the rule for assignments in general, one board of contract appeals has held that an agency can waive the statutory protections and accept an otherwise non-qualifying assignment to a surety, at least for limited purposes. Rodgers Construction, Inc., and Federal Insurance Co., IBCA Nos. 2777 et al., 92-1 BCA \u00b6 24,503 (1991). Rodgers did not involve competing claims, however, and it is doubtful that the concept could be used to defeat an otherwise valid government claim.", "Next in line is the contractor\u2019s trustee in bankruptcy. If it can be said that the funds in question never became the property of the contractor, a payment bond surety will prevail over the trustee in bankruptcy. Pearlman v. Reliance Ins. Co., 371 U.S. 132 (1962); Great American Ins. Co. v. United States, 492 F.2d 821, 824 (Ct. Cl. 1974); B-221519, July 1, 1986; B-211539, September 26, 1983. Absent a preferential transfer, the trustee\u2019s claim has also been held subordinate to that of an assignee whose assignment has been perfected. 56 Comp. Gen. 499 (1977), overruled in part on other grounds, 60 Comp. Gen. 510 (1981). It may also be subordinate to certain government claims. 68 Comp. Gen. 215 (1989); B-211539, September 26, 1983. However, the government must comply with the automatic stay provisions of the Bankruptcy Code before attempting an offset. 68 Comp. Gen. at 219. If the contractor is not in bankruptcy, the contractor will occupy this rung on the ladder. See B-169420, October 22, 1970.", "To sum up, the priorities, in descending order, are: 1. Liquidated damages arising under the same contract. 2. Performance bond surety. 3. Government claims.         a. Labor Department unpaid/underpaid wage claims.         b. Labor Department liquidated damage claims.         c. Excess reprocurement costs on same contract.         d. Tax claims. 4. Payment bond surety. 5. Assignee under a proper assignment. 6. Trustee in bankruptcy or contractor, as applicable. (3) Government\u2019s obligations and liability as stakeholder Where performance of the contract is complete and there are no government claims to the unexpended balance, the government is a mere stakeholder with respect to that balance. The government doesn\u2019t particularly care who gets paid as long as it pays the right party and protects itself against the possibility of having to pay twice. \u201cSurely a stakeholder, caught in the middle between two competing claimants, cannot, in effect, decide the merits of their claims by the mere physical act of delivering the stake to one of them.\u201d", "Id. at 957. The result is the same where the government erroneously pays the contractor. Home Indemnity Co. v. United States, 376 F.2d 890 (Ct. Cl. 1967); International Fidelity Ins. Co. v. United States, 25 Cl.

Co. v. United States, 492 F.2d 821, 825 (Ct. Cl. 1974). This should not be construed to mean that the government should not try to resolve claims administratively. Following precedent would presumably be a \u201cvalid reason,\u201d although we have no case to cite for this proposition. Also, a good faith attempt to follow precedent would be more than \u201cthe mere physical act of delivering the stake.\u201d Certainly, however, if the claims cannot be resolved by applying precedent, the solution is to let a court sort it out. B-190181, December 8, 1977.", "Where a payment is found to be erroneous in disregard of a surety\u2019s superior claim, the fact that the payment depleted the stake is no defense and the government will still lose. Newark Ins. Co., 169 F. Supp. at 956 57; 62 Comp. Gen. 498 (1983). The stake is measured as of the time of default and is deemed to include amounts subsequently paid out in error. See Universal Surety Co. v. United States, 10 Cl. Ct. 794, 797 98 (1986); 62 Comp. Gen. 498. If the erroneous payment was made to the contractor, the government can and should pursue recovery against the contractor. 62 Comp. Gen. at 502. If the erroneous payment was made to an assignee, the Assignment of Claims Act prevents recovery from the assignee, but the government may still be able to recover from the contractor. Great American Ins. Co., 492 F.2d at 826 27.", "A variation occurred in B-214985, May 22, 1984, in which the contracting agency erroneously paid the contractor instead of a payment bond surety. Before the contractor could pay the surety, the IRS grabbed the money under a tax lien. Notwithstanding the government\u2019s error, the surety\u2019s claim was denied because of the tax claim\u2019s priority.", "In the preceding cases, the government was merely a stakeholder. Where a surety notifies the government of a claim while the contractor is still performing, the situation is different. The government \u201cis primarily concerned with completion of performance under the contract and is far from being a simple stakeholder.\u201d United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. United States, 475 F.2d 1377, 1384 (Ct. Cl. 1973). In this situation, the contracting officer must balance the interests of the government against possible harm to the surety, and must exercise reasoned discretion in deciding whether to pay the contractor, the surety, or neither.

United States, 676 F.2d 622, 628 (Ct. Cl. 1982). One reason for this broad range of discretion, as a district court has cautioned, is that \u201ccontractors rely upon contract proceeds administered through progress payments to properly finance the contract\u201d and the government therefore should not \u201clightly withhold funds the contractor may need for this purpose.\u201d Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins.

(2) Percentage of contract performance completed at time of notification by surety. (3) Efforts by government to determine progress made on the contract after notice by the surety. (4) Whether the contract was subsequently completed by the contractor. This is not conclusive but is relevant to show reasonableness of contracting officer\u2019s determination of the progress on the project. (5) Whether the payments to the contractor subsequently reached the subcontractors and suppliers. This relates to the government\u2019s \u201cequitable obligation\u201d to the subcontractors and suppliers and, in view of the surety\u2019s liability to these creditors, furthers the surety\u2019s objectives as well as those of the government.

That is, the government is not liable unless the damage is over and above the normal wear and tear incident to the purpose for which the property was leased. 5 Comp. Gen. 522 (1926); 4 Comp. Gen. 211 (1924); B-192230, November 27, 1978.", "The government\u2019s liability does not derive solely from the terms of the lease. Even in the absence of specific \u201cgood repair\u201d and \u201cordinary wear and tear\u201d clauses, unless the lease expressly provides to the contrary, there is in every lease an implied obligation on the tenant to surrender the leased property at the end of the tenancy in as good condition as at the beginning of the tenancy, except for reasonable wear and tear and damage over which the tenant had no control. 26 Comp. Gen. 585 (1947); 25 Comp. Gen. 349 (1945); 23 Comp. Gen. 477, 479 80 (1944).

E.g., B-181236, October 20, 1977.", "The lease may require timely notice of the lessor\u2019s demand for restoration. If so, compliance with the notice requirement will be a condition precedent to the lessor\u2019s restoration rights. 6 Comp. Gen. 533 (1927). However, if there has been substantial compliance with the notice requirement\u2014that is, if notice is given within a reasonable time after the premises are vacated\u2014and if the lessor\u2019s failure to strictly comply with the requirement does not affect the merits of the restoration claim or operate to the prejudice of the United States, the failure will not defeat an otherwise proper restoration claim. 40 Comp. Gen. 300, 304 (1960); 26 Comp. Gen. 585, 588 (1947). The \u201creasonable notice\u201d principle would generally apply even in the absence of a notice requirement in the lease. 26 Comp.

Gen. 300 (1960) (failure to give timely notice of demand for restoration held not to destroy lessor\u2019s restoration rights where government continued to occupy premises under subsequent lease). Thus, in a case where the government occupied land under a lease and subsequently decided to acquire the land in fee simple by condemnation, with the just compensation to be based on the current value of the property as if in undamaged condition, claims for restoration of the land could not be paid so long as the government continued to occupy the premises under the lease. B-181236, October 20, 1977. If, however, improvements to the land have been completely destroyed and the government does not intend to restore them, the considerations which mandate delaying claims for damage to the land itself do not exist with regard to the obligation to restore the improvements. Thus, claims for the restoration of the improvements in B-181236 could be settled without awaiting the government\u2019s acquisition by condemnation.", "Although land with improvements and appurtenances is ordinarily considered a single unit for valuation purposes (the \u201cunit rule\u201d), departures from the unit rule have been sanctioned in appropriate circumstances. One such circumstance where improvements can be valued apart from the rest of the premises to settle a restoration claim is where the improvements have been completely lost or destroyed during a temporary occupation by the government, as in B-181236. Claims for restoration of improvements only should be computed on the basis of the replacement or reproduction cost. Thus, in order to account for the ordinary wear and tear which has occurred over a period of years, it is necessary to depreciate the improvements\u2019 replacement value as determined on the termination date of the lease so that the amount allowed reflects only the damage done by the government. B-181236, cited above.", "Although a lease agreement may expressly exempt the government from restoration liability for certain types of damage, if the government subleases the property and later assesses its sublessee for the exempted damage, the government may be found to hold such amounts as are assessed in constructive trust for the lessor. B-177989-O.M., March 23, 1973.", "Even if damage exceeds that attributable to normal wear and tear, the government may avoid liability for restoration if the damage can be attributed to the lessor\u2019s breach of an express covenant in the lease to maintain the premises or property in good repair and tenantable condition.", "A lessor\u2019s obligation to maintain premises or property in good repair and tenantable condition \u201cembraces acts of repair to prevent a decline in the condition of the premises.\u201d 48 Comp.

A 1964 decision involved a claim by the University of Mississippi for damage to University property resulting from the occupation of the University by federal troops under presidential order. The University argued that the occupation constituted an implied contract of lease and thus created a landlord-tenant relationship. Under this theory, the government was under an implied obligation to return the premises in the same condition as they were in when federal occupancy began, reasonable wear and tear excepted. Noting the University\u2019s opposition to the presence of the federal troops and the absence of any indication in the record that the United States contemplated paying rent, GAO was unwilling to allow the claim under the implied lease theory absent a judicial determination. However, GAO advised that the claim appeared cognizable under the Military Claims Act. 43 Comp. Gen. 711 (1964).", "Claims may also involve the rental of personal property. The principles involved are generally similar. As in the case of real property, the terms of the lease agreement control. Several cases have found the government not liable where there was no negligence on the part of the government and the lease did not impose a more stringent standard of liability. 55 Comp. Gen. 356 (1975) (no liability for typewriter destroyed in fire where no government negligence, \u201cabsent any contractual provision increasing the Government\u2019s liability beyond its duty of ordinary care as a bailee\u201d); 23 Comp.

Conversely, negligence will make the government liable. E.g., 8 Comp. Gen. 448 (1929). As in the case of real property, the duty to use due care and to return the property in the same condition as when received, reasonable wear and tear excepted, is implied by law even where not expressly stated in the lease. 21 Comp.

Canceled Hotel Reservations", "paragraphs": ["Ordinarily the cancellation of hotel reservations within a reasonable time prior to the dates of the reservations involves no liability on the part of the government. 41 Comp. Gen. 780 (1962). However, a claim for the actual cost of unused hotel rooms may be allowed when (1) it is clear that the reservations were made by and on behalf of the government; (2) there is sufficient basis to conclude that the making of reservations gave rise to a contractual relationship between the hotel and the government; (3) the government failed to cancel within a reasonable time; and (4) the hotel attempted to mitigate its damages. Since the basis of the government\u2019s liability is contractual, either express or implied-in-fact, the claims should be resolved under the Contract Disputes Act. As with the preceding section on leased property, GAO had looked at a number of these claims prior to the CDA.", "Allowable claims must be distinguished from cases in which an employee is reimbursed on a per diem basis and makes a hotel or motel reservation himself or through an agent on his behalf. Under such circumstances, there is no basis for the government to pay a claim because the government was not a party to the agreement. 48 Comp. Gen. 75 (1968). The distinction is between cases in which a block reservation is made on a contractual basis between the government and the hotel through official administrative action, and cases in which the agreement is essentially one between the individual and the hotel, even though the reservation may have been made by some other government employee on the traveler\u2019s behalf. Thus, in B-190503-O.M., December 19, 1977, a member of the Casualty Branch on an Army post, determined by the Army to have been acting \u201cin his official capacity,\u201d made motel reservations for an 11-member funeral detail. The bus carrying the detail broke down and the detail had to travel through the night to reach the funeral on time. The reservations were never canceled and the motel held the rooms open. GAO viewed the agreement to reserve the rooms as an obligation of the government and allowed the motel\u2019s claim for the cost of the rooms. Similarly, GAO allowed payment for reservations made by military officials acting in their official capacity where the members for whom the reservations were made had been notified that, because of the nature of their mission, the reservations could not be altered without official approval. B-192767, May 3, 1979.", "In contrast is B-181266, December 5, 1974. An employee was scheduled to travel from Washington to Kansas City on official business and agency employees in Kansas City made a hotel reservation for him. The trip was canceled and the Kansas City office canceled the reservation but not until after the employee had been scheduled to arrive. The situation was viewed as a transaction between the individual and the hotel which did not obligate the government. A similar decision is B-192804, December 18, 1978.", "Since claims may be allowed only on the basis of legal liability, it is necessary to find some contractual or similar binding arrangement between the government and the hotel whereby the government agrees to either pay for the rooms reserved or cancel within a reasonable time. However, evidence of the contractual arrangement need not necessarily be in writing. In B-194389-O.M., June 25, 1979, the reservations were initially made by telephone. Later, an advance party inspected and approved the accommodations and follow-up telephone calls were made to remind the hotel of the booking. The hotel relied on the conduct and representations of the government and incurred a loss as a result of that reliance. GAO concluded that the booking was viewed by the parties as more than only tentative, and that a contractual relationship existed despite the absence of written evidence. On the other hand, where such facts do not exist, even subsequent issuance of a purchase order by the government will not provide adequate evidence of a contract. B-181266, December 5, 1974.", "Once the existence of a contractual agreement to either pay for the rooms reserved or cancel within a reasonable time is established, the government can avoid liability only by showing that the time of cancellation was reasonable. What is \u201creasonable\u201d depends on the specific circumstances involved. For example, in 41 Comp. Gen. 780 (1962), payment was approved for unused rooms when the reservations were canceled late in the afternoon of the day for which the rooms had been reserved, and the hotel was unable to rent all the rooms after the receipt of the cancellation notice. That holding was followed in 51 Comp. Gen. 453 (1972), in which the reservations were canceled a week ahead but it was found that the hotel was unable to use the space reserved by the government despite attempts to do so. Other circumstances such as special events taking place in the city and the relative difficulty of re-letting accommodations on short notice may also have a bearing on reasonableness. B-194389-O.M., June 25, 1979.", "The hotel must generally attempt to mitigate its loss, and its attempts to do so will be relevant in evaluating the claim. For example, in one case when the hotel received three days notice of the cancellation of all accommodations being held, it immediately took steps to insure that the canceled accommodations were re-let. By moving some guests, utilizing its waiting list, and accepting new bookings for the vacancies, the hotel was able to re-let the majority of the rooms canceled. These efforts were held sufficient to discharge the hotel\u2019s duty to mitigate its losses. B-194389-O.M., June 25, 1979. See also 41 Comp. Gen. 780 and 51 Comp.

Certain other elements of damage may be allowed if it can be established that they represent a liability of the hotel regardless of occupancy. Thus, a Value Added Tax and a service charge were allowed on a claim by a hotel in London. The tax was based on revenues received by the hotel and payment of the claim counted as revenue. The service charge represented staff wages for which the hotel was also liable regardless of occupancy. B-194389-O.M., June 25, 1979.

Commercial Rental Vehicles", "paragraphs": ["Government employees are often authorized to use commercial rental vehicles in the performance of their jobs, particularly on temporary duty assignments. A set of rules and procedures for handling damage claims had developed over the years. In the late 1980s, the Defense Department\u2019s Military Traffic Management Command (MTMC) negotiated an agreement with the majority of rental companies on behalf of the entire government. Situations not covered by the MTMC agreement continue to be governed by the \u201cold\u201d rules. Thus, two systems for handling rental vehicle damage claims exist side-by-side. (1) Collision damage waiver Under the traditional form of rental agreement, the rental company assumes responsibility for damage to the vehicle, whether or not caused by the renter\u2019s negligence, except for the deductible portion of its commercial insurance policy. The standard rental contract gives the renter the option to purchase what is commonly called \u201ccollision damage waiver\u201d (CDW) coverage, or something similar, for an additional daily charge. If the optional coverage is purchased, the renter will generally have no liability to the rental company for damage to the vehicle. If the optional coverage is not purchased, the renter is liable to the rental company for damage to the vehicle up to an amount specified in the contract, regardless of whether or not the damage was caused by the renter\u2019s negligence. See Federal Travel Regulations (FTR), 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 301-3.2(c). Not too many years ago, the specified amount tended to represent the rental company\u2019s own deductible and was relatively small, $100 or $250 being fairly common. The amount jumped substantially in the 1970s and 1980s, and amounts in the thousands are now encountered, and even \u201cactual cash value\u201d in some cases.", "At one time, both civilian employees and military personnel who purchased the optional collision damage waiver coverage could be reimbursed. E.g., 35 Comp. Gen. 553 (1956); B-172721, July 19, 1971. The rationale was that the employee\u2019s election to purchase the CDW was not an unreasonable exercise of discretion. However, in view of the government\u2019s general policy of self-insurance, GAO also recognized that an employee\u2019s failure to purchase this optional coverage should not be viewed as unreasonable. Thus, it was held in 47 Comp. Gen. 145 (1967) that an employee could be reimbursed who had declined the collision damage waiver and who was required to pay the rental company $100 (the rental company\u2019s exclusion as specified in the rental contract) for damage to the vehicle incident to the performance of official business but not attributable to the employee\u2019s negligence.", "Subsequently, because it was viewed as more economical to the government to assume the risk of loss covered by a collision damage waiver than to reimburse federal personnel for the continually growing cost of these waivers, the travel regulations applicable to civilian employees and military personnel were revised to prohibit reimbursement of the cost of optional CDW coverage. GAO endorsed the change. B-158712, November 16, 1970.", "Now, if an employee chooses to purchase this optional coverage, it is viewed as a personal expense and not reimbursable by the government. FTR, 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 301-3.2(c)(1); B-215614, April 18, 1985; B-190698, April 6, 1978; B-184623, October 21, 1975; B-172721, March 13, 1972. This is true even if the employee has been erroneously advised by his agency that he should purchase this coverage. B-181180/B-181187, June 27, 1974. Absent special circumstances, it makes no difference that the rental occurs in a foreign country. B-185454, July 1, 1976. The prohibition applies to direct payment to the rental company as well as reimbursement of the employee, notwithstanding an erroneous authorization by a contracting officer. B-208630, March 22, 1983. \u201cgencies are authorized to pay for damage to the rented vehicle up to the deductible amount contained in the rental contract if the damage occurs while the vehicle is being used for official business.\u201d \u201c use shall be limited to official purposes . . . which include transportation between places where the employee\u2019s presence is required incident to official business; between such places and places of temporary lodging when public transportation is unavailable or its use is impractical; and between either of the above places and suitable eating places, drug stores, barber shops, places of worship, cleaning establishments, and similar places necessary for the sustenance, comfort, or health of the employee to foster the continued efficient performance of Government business.\u201d", "FTR, 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 301-2.6(a).

In B-209951, June 7, 1983, an accident occurred while the employee was outside the primary duty area on his way to a restaurant with friends, one of whom he had allowed to drive. The agency determined that he did not meet the \u201cofficial business\u201d test, and his claim for reimbursement was denied.", "In some instances, the rental company may be willing to file its claim directly with the government. However, the rental contract is between the company and the employee, and the government is not a party. Therefore, in many cases, the company will demand payment from the employee, with the employee then filing a claim for reimbursement.", "If the damage was caused by the negligence of a third party, the government, upon paying a claim, will become subrogated to the employee\u2019s rights against the third party. There is no requirement that the employee first seek to recover from the third party before filing the reimbursement claim. B-176235, August 2, 1972.", "The \u201cthird party\u201d may be another government employee. In a 1989 case, a military officer who had rented a car under travel orders left the keys with two colleagues so they could go to dinner. Another member of the group took the car, however, consumed a quantity of beer, and drove the car through the hotel wall. Certainly the officer who had rented the car did nothing wrong and the rental company was entitled to be paid. The solution: pay the rental company\u2019s claim and get the money back from the person who assaulted the hotel. 68 Comp. Gen. 309 (1989).", "In B-202186, March 9, 1982, GAO considered a claim for damage to a commercial rental vehicle under a Federal Supply Schedule contract. Under the contract, the contractor assumed full responsibility for loss or damage to the vehicle, except that the contractor could exclude \u201cthe deductible amount as set forth in its normal commercial insurance policy.\u201d A rental company in a state where collision insurance was not required argued that its \u201cnormal commercial insurance policy\u201d did not include collision coverage and therefore the government should be liable for the full amount of the damage. However, the apparent intent of the relevant contract provision was that the rental company bear the full risk of loss or damage to its vehicles, except to the limited extent of the deductible that is commonly included in insurance policies. The rental company\u2019s decision not to procure commercial collision insurance could not operate to shift that risk to the government. The claim was therefore denied. (3) The MTMC agreement In the late 1980s, the Military Traffic Management Command, Department of Defense, negotiated a standard rental car agreement with many of the rental companies. The MTMC agreement greatly simplifies the damage claim process. The agreement is not mandatory for government agencies or employees, although the General Services Administration strongly encourages its use. The terms of the agreement are summarized in the \u201cRental Car Information\u201d section of GSA\u2019s Federal Travel Directory, published monthly.", "The rental company agrees to carry liability insurance, or to self-insure, up to specified limits, for death, personal injury, and property damage. This insurance is designated as \u201cprimary in all respects.\u201d MTMC Agreement, para. 9.a. Thus, claims by a third party should be referred to the rental company rather than processed under the Federal Tort Claims Act.", "For government employees renting a car on government business, CDW is included in the basic daily rate. Contract forms may still include the option boxes because the companies are unlikely to redesign their forms to accommodate just one segment of their business. The MTMC agreement (para. 1) anticipates this by providing that its terms \u201ctake precedence over any contrary policies and provisions of any Company rental document that the Government employee signs when renting a vehicle.\u201d", "Damage to the vehicle is covered in para. 9.b of the agreement. Basically, the company \u201cassumes and shall bear the entire risk of loss\u201d or damage \u201cfrom any and every cause whatsoever,\u201d unless the loss or damage is caused by one of several listed factors. One of the factors listed is operation of the vehicle by a person other than an authorized driver. Another is \u201cwillful or wanton misconduct\u201d on the part of a driver. Under para. 9.c, the company agrees to submit any damage claims to the employee\u2019s agency and not to the employee, and not to include loss of use in any such claim.", "Exactly what \u201cwillful or wanton misconduct\u201d means is not entirely clear. What is clear, at a minimum, is that it requires more than ordinary negligence. The best approach in any given case, whether or not required as a matter of law, would appear to be to examine the law of the state where the accident occurred. In one case, for example, GAO looked to Florida law and found that it defined three separate degrees of negligence\u2014ordinary, gross, and willful and wanton\u2014with \u201cwillful and wanton\u201d being very close to intentional conduct. Under this standard, GAO denied a claim where an employee had driven a car down a boat ramp into a lake. While, under the particular facts and circumstances, it would have been difficult to deny ordinary negligence, the conduct did not amount to \u201cwillful and wanton misconduct.\u201d B-230064, April 14, 1988.", "Maximum use of the MTMC program should substantially reduce the number of rental vehicle damage claims agencies must consider.

Id. \u00a7 1626(d).", "Awards by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission are frequently divided into installments which are then paid out over a number of years. A 1968 amendment to the statute raised the dollar amount of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1626(c)(1) from $500 to $1,000 and substituted the words \u201cany payment\u201d for \u201ctotal award.\u201d Consequently, GAO is authorized to make determinations under subsection (c)(1) where the amount of an individual payment does not exceed $1,000, regardless of the amount of the total award. B-167253, July 15, 1969. If an award is to be paid in installments over a number of years, GAO\u2019s determination on the initial claim may be used as precedent for the duration of the payout, as long as the claim remains the same, the amount of payment does not exceed $1,000, and the probative evidence does not change. Id.", "The distribution of estates is ordinarily a matter of state rather than federal law. Therefore, in making determinations under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1626(c)(1), GAO will normally apply the laws of descent and distribution of the state of the deceased payee\u2019s domicile at the time of death. For example, in B-186611, November 9, 1976, GAO determined that a claim awarded by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission was to be divided equally among the awardee\u2019s widower and two surviving children. The awardee, a domiciliary of California, died intestate and no administrator was appointed. In determining the proper recipients for this award, GAO applied the California law governing intestate succession, under which the separate property of a decedent survived by a spouse and more than one child passes one-third to the spouse, and two-thirds equally among the children.", "Also, any priority state law may create in favor of the payment of funeral expenses should be given effect. In B-172238-O.M., April 9, 1971, an award under the International Claims Settlement Act was claimed by both the awardee\u2019s widow and his daughter, the named executrix. The awardee was a New York resident who died testate, although the value of the estate did not justify probate costs. In support of her claim, the widow filed an itemized receipt, signed by the funeral home manager, for funeral expenses she had paid. Citing the New York law requiring that reasonable funeral expenses be preferred to all debts and claims against a decedent\u2019s estate, GAO determined that the widow was the proper recipient of the full award, which amounted to less than half of the total funeral expenses. See also B-169969-O.M., September 30, 1970.", "A will is often a useful source of evidence of the testator\u2019s intent. E.g., B-167740-O.M., September 17, 1969. However, as B-172238-O.M. illustrates, an unprobated will cannot be given precedence over the provisions of the applicable state law.", "The second situation in which GAO makes entitlement determinations under 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 1626 is where a recipient partnership or corporation has been terminated. In B-143052, February 1, 1965, a corporate recipient had been dissolved under New York law for nonpayment of taxes. The Comptroller General considered a number of claims for the award, and determined that the proper recipients were the named president and treasurer of the corporation, who in their official capacities were authorized to endorse all checks payable to the corporation. Accordingly, GAO advised the Treasury Department to make the award check payable to both parties jointly, and suggested further that Treasury consider notifying federal and state tax offices. B-143052, September 15, 1961, and B-143052, June 14, 1960, are earlier considerations of this same matter and include discussion of the applicable standards and necessary documentation.", "A simpler determination is B-160559, June 12, 1967, in which an award was found payable to two individuals and a corporation to whom the assets of the dissolved corporation had been transferred. See also B-188312-O.M., April 18, 1977 (payment to terminated partnership determined payable in equal shares to former partners as individuals). More recently, B-202723, July 22, 1981, involved an award to a corporation which had terminated by operation of law in 1959. Since none of the corporation\u2019s directors was still living, the award was held payable to the heirs of the deceased sole shareholder of the corporation. The approach of B-202723 was followed in B-223618, October 10, 1986, advising that Treasury could either seek to have a former receiver reappointed, or make payment to the shareholders of the defunct corporation in proportion to the interest they held at the time of dissolution.", "Claims involving International Claims Settlement Act awards often present evidentiary problems. This is because the events giving rise to the awards may have occurred many years ago, under unusual circumstances, and the claimants are often heirs or descendants of the original property owners with little \u201chard evidence\u201d to support their claims. GAO\u2019s approach, as with other types of claims, is to require the \u201cbest evidence obtainable.\u201d Exactly what this will be depends on the circumstances of the particular case. The mere uncorroborated statement of a claimant will not be sufficient to support a claim. When \u201cprimary\u201d evidence is unobtainable, GAO has accepted \u201csecondary\u201d evidence in the form of pertinent data from which the necessary information can reasonably be constructed. This is really nothing more than an application of the eminently sensible axiom of life that \u201cyou do the best you can with what you\u2019ve got.\u201d For the application of these principles to a group of related claims under the China Claims Program, see B-201150, July 11, 1983; B-201150, January 18, 1983; B-201150, December 1, 1981; and B-201150, May 13, 1981."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "b.

S. Rep. No. 738, 75th Cong., lst Sess. 5 6 (1937). Although the self-insurance rule discussed in Chapter 4 was in full bloom in 1937, agencies often purchased commercial insurance when shipping valuables because the amounts involved tended to be too large to be absorbed immediately by existing appropriations, and the appropriation process was considered inadequate to meet the need for prompt duplication or reimbursement. Id. The Act is administered by the Treasury Department, which has issued implementing regulations at 31 C.F.R.

In the event of a loss (loss, damage, or destruction) of valuables shipped in accordance with the regulations, the agency must file a claim for replacement in writing with the Secretary of the Treasury. If the Secretary allows the claim, replacement is made out of a revolving fund established by 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 722. The money in the fund comes from congressional appropriations and recoveries and repayments under the Act. The Secretary\u2019s determination that a loss occurred or that a given shipment was in accordance with regulations is final and conclusive. If the Secretary determines that replacement can be effected in whole or in part without loss to the United States by a credit to the account of the department or agency which made the claim, the revolving fund is not used to the extent the credit is deemed sufficient.", "There is one situation in which GLISA applies to a loss other than a loss in shipment. In the event of loss, damage, or destruction to certain categories of Treasury paper (for example, Documentary Internal Revenue Stamps) while in the custody or possession of the Postal Service acting as sales agent for or on behalf of the Treasury Department, the loss is to be replaced from the GLISA revolving fund. 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 724; B-171400, August 4, 1971.", "Although GAO will not review the Treasury Department\u2019s decisions on GLISA claims, it has considered a number of issues relating to GLISA. They tend to fall generally into three categories. The first group deals with threshold issues of applicability. Thus, a \u201cshipment\u201d for purposes of GLISA includes the local transportation of valuables in the custody of government employees (messengers). 19 Comp. Gen. 369 (1939), modifying 18 Comp. Gen. 782 (1939). It also includes contract armored car service. 19 Comp. Gen. 490 (1939). However, it does not include the transportation of valuables in the privately-owned automobile of an employee in travel status. 17 Comp. Gen. 419 (1937). Also, the Act applies only with respect to those items declared by the Secretary of the Treasury to be \u201cvaluables.\u201d 32 Comp. Gen. 153 (1952); 21 Comp. Gen. 928 (1942).", "The second group of cases involves requests for the relief of accountable officers and the relationship between GLISA and accountable officer liability.

The Secretary may authorize such insurance upon finding that the risk cannot be adequately guarded against by the facilities of the United States or that adequate replacement cannot be provided under GLISA and other relevant statutory authorities.", "Where transportation charges are regularly fixed at a rate which includes the cost to the carrier of indemnity insurance, and the carrier will not accept a government shipment at a rate exclusive of such cost, the total sum paid to the carrier for the shipment may be considered as a transportation cost and payment does not violate 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 726. 17 Comp. Gen. 139 (1937). Similarly, payment of a transportation rate based on the real worth of \u201cvaluables,\u201d higher than the minimum or \u201crelease\u201d value provided by tariff rates, does not violate GLISA. Payment of such higher rate places a greater measure of responsibility on the carrier and is thus calculated to minimize the risk of loss. 17 Comp. Gen. 741 (1938).", "These two decisions were followed in 34 Comp. Gen. 175 (1954), in which the Comptroller General concluded that the payment of charges for armored car service for the shipment of coins by the Treasury Department, under contracts requiring the contractor to carry designated insurance and where the charges included the cost to the carrier of the indemnity insurance, would not violate GLISA where the carrier would not accept the shipments at a rate exclusive of the additional costs. The decision pointed out that GLISA would provide an inadequate alternative in that the loss of one individual armored car shipment could conceivably exhaust the revolving fund. If the value of a shipment exceeds the carrier\u2019s commercial insurance coverage, the GLISA revolving fund is available for the amount of a loss in excess of that coverage.

The decision concluded that GLISA prohibits the use of insured mail by the government since it offers no special or additional service apart from the indemnity feature. Registered mail, on the other hand, affords additional protection as well as insurance. Thus, since the insurance is only incidental to the protective features, GLISA does not prohibit the use of registered mail where administratively determined to be necessary. Registered mail should not be used, however, for the sole or primary purpose of obtaining indemnity.", "The General Services Administration suggested that the Postal Service should provide a separate fee schedule for federal agencies which would eliminate the charge for indemnity insurance from registered mail.

After a drought destroyed most of the crop, he learned that, under regulations published in the Federal Register, over 80 percent of the crop was not covered. Cautioning that courts must \u201cobserve the conditions defined by Congress for charging the public treasury\u201d (id. at 385), the Court held that the government was not bound by the unauthorized representations of its agents. In other words, telling the farmer that his entire crop would be insured did not \u201cestop\u201d the government from later denying coverage with respect to the legally ineligible portion. Although Merrill nowhere uses the word \u201cestoppel,\u201d it cites to Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, 243 U.S. 389, 409 (1917), which contains the often-quoted statement that \u201cthe United States is neither bound nor estopped by acts of its officers or agents in entering into an arrangement or agreement to do or cause to be done what the law does not sanction or permit.\u201d", "In subsequent Supreme Court decisions, the camel managed to poke its nose into the tent in the guise of \u201cdicta\u201d suggesting that some forms of \u201caffirmative misconduct\u201d might be sufficient to support an estoppel against the government, although the Court refused to find estoppels in each instance. See Montana v. Kennedy, 366 U.S. 308, 314 15 (1961); Immigration and Naturalization Service v. Hibi, 414 U.S. 5, 8 (1973).", "Given this \u201cencouragement,\u201d the lower courts and the Comptroller General became more inclined to find estoppels against the government where the traditional elements of equitable estoppel were met. Those elements, repeated verbatim in numerous cases, are: 1. The party to be estopped must know the facts. 2. He must intend that his conduct shall be acted on or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it is so intended. 3. The latter (the party asserting the estoppel) must be ignorant of the true facts. 4. He must rely on the former\u2019s conduct to his injury.", "E.g., United States v. Georgia-Pacific Co., 421 F.2d 92, 96 (9th Cir. 1970); Emeco Industries, Inc. v. United States, 485 F.2d 652, 657 (Ct. Cl. 1973); 55 Comp. Gen. 911, 931 (1976); 53 Comp. Gen. 502, 506 (1974); B-183799, September 23, 1975. Restated, one who does not know the facts must rely on the conduct or representations of one who does know the facts, the reliance must be reasonable under the circumstances, and it must produce injury.", "Georgia-Pacific is one of the more frequently cited examples of government estoppel. The government sought to enforce a 30-year old agreement under which a lumber company had agreed to convey certain land to the government for national forest purposes. The government had let the contract lie dormant for most of that time, and successive owners had spent a considerable amount of money on forest management. Applying the four elements cited above, and finding further that the government was acting in its proprietary rather than sovereign capacity, and that the government officials involved were acting within the scope of their authority, the court found that \u201cthe dictates of both morals and justice\u201d warranted a finding of equitable estoppel. 421 F.2d at 103. The Emeco case, as well as a number of GAO decisions such as 53 Comp. Gen. 502 and B-188607, July 19, 1977, applied the four-part test and concluded that the government was estopped from denying the existence of a contract in various contexts.", "A 1973 case, United States v. Lazy FC Ranch, 481 F.2d 985 (9th Cir. 1973), represents perhaps the outer limits of the trend started by cases like Georgia-Pacific and Emeco. Without so much as mentioning the four traditional elements of estoppel, the court held simply that the United States, even when acting in its sovereign capacity, can be estopped \u201cwhere justice and fair play require it.\u201d Id. at 988.", "The Supreme Court revisited estoppel in Heckler v. Community Health Services of Crawford County, 467 U.S. 51 (1984), a challenge to the government\u2019s right to recoup erroneous payments made to a Medicare health care provider. The government urged the Court to rule that there can be no estoppel against the United States. The Court was unwilling to go that far, but emphasized once again that the rules for private litigants and the government are different. Id. at 60. Exactly how they differ is an issue the Court was not forced to address. At an absolute minimum, the traditional elements of estoppel must be present. Id. at 61. Since the Court found the facts insufficient to support an estoppel even against a private litigant, it was not necessary to address what further elements would be necessary to make a case against the government. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the government is spending the taxpayers\u2019 money. \u201cProtection of the public fisc requires that those who seek public funds act with scrupulous regard for the requirements of law . . . .\u201d Id. at 63.", "Heckler confirmed that estoppel will not be found if any of the four traditional elements are missing. Apart from this, it resolved nothing, and left the lower courts free to continue forging their own paths. In Phelps v. Federal Emergency Management Agency, 785 F.2d 13 (1st Cir. 1986), the plaintiff, a claimant under a flood insurance policy, had been told by a FEMA official that he did not have to file a written report required by the policy. FEMA subsequently raised the failure to file a written report as one reason for denying the claim. The traditional elements of equitable estoppel were all present, but the court found the case very similar to Federal Crop Insurance Corp. v. Merrill and, feeling constrained to follow the Supreme Court, denied the estoppel. In a pre-Heckler case also involving a FEMA claimant who did not file a formal proof of loss, the court held FEMA estopped from denying coverage because it did not provide the claimant with the form and had the required information from other sources. Meister Bros., Inc. v. Macy, 674 F.2d 1174 (7th Cir. 1982). The Meister court noted that \u201cit is far from clear when the Government may be estopped.\u201d Id. at 1177. Heckler does not tell us which approach is right.", "In ATC Petroleum, Inc. v. Sanders, 860 F.2d 1104, 1111 (D.C. Cir. 1988), the District of Columbia Circuit also struggled with the estoppel concept, noting that it could apply to the government, but that its application \u201cmust be rigid and sparing\u201d and must include all of the traditional elements.", "The next landmark in this evolutionary process is Office of Personnel Management v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414 (1990). Richmond was a retired federal employee receiving a disability annuity. There are statutory limits on how much an annuitant can earn from wages or self-employment and still qualify for the annuity. Richmond sought advice on these limits from a federal employee, was given erroneous information, and as a result lost 6 months of benefits. Richmond first took his case to the Merit Systems Protection Board, which denied his estoppel argument. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed. Finding that the government could be estopped upon establishing the four traditional elements plus affirmative misconduct, the court held that the erroneous information was sufficient \u201cmisconduct\u201d and remanded the case to the MSPB with instructions to direct payment of the withheld benefits. Richmond v. Office of Personnel Management, 862 F.2d 294 (Fed. Cir. 1988). \u201ct remains true that we need not embrace a rule that no estoppel will lie against the Government in any case in order to decide this case. We leave for another day whether an estoppel claim could ever succeed against the Government.\u201d", "Id. at 423. Having once again refused to prescribe a treatment, the Court recognized its responsibility \u201cto state the law and to settle the matter of estoppel as a basis for money claims against the Government.\u201d Id. at 426. It did this by resorting to a fiscal rationale not previously used in estoppel cases. The rationale proceeds along these lines:", "By virtue of the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution, any payment of money from the United States Treasury must be authorized by an act of Congress.", "Richmond\u2019s award is not only not authorized by an act of Congress, it is in direct contravention of one.", "This being the case, there is no appropriation lawfully available for the payment, and payment would therefore violate the Appropriations Clause. \u201cWhether there are any extreme circumstances that might support estoppel in a case not involving payment from the Treasury is a matter we need not address. As for monetary claims, it is enough to say that this Court has never upheld an assertion of estoppel against the Government by a claimant seeking public funds. In this context there can be no estoppel, for courts cannot estop the Constitution.\u201d", "Id. at 434. \u201cThe precise holding of Richmond is that the Court will not uphold an estoppel claim against the government for money in violation of a statute.\u201d", "United States v. Alaska Public Utilities Commission, 800 F. Supp. 857, 862 (D. Alaska 1992). Thus, at an absolute minimum, equitable estoppel cannot be used if the result would be a payment contrary to statute (as opposed to one which is merely not expressly authorized by statute). Some examples are Koyen v. Office of Personnel Management, 973 F.2d 919 (Fed. Cir. 1992) (claim for survivor annuity where deceased spouse had not made timely election of benefit options); United States v. Fowler, 913 F.2d 1382 (9th Cir. 1990) (recovery of payment made under flood insurance policy which had been erroneously issued to someone not eligible for the program); Mullens v.

From this point on, however, the law remains murky.", "Under a broader application of Richmond, some courts have received what appear to be the Supreme Court\u2019s pretty clear signals that it is not particularly excited over using estoppel in any monetary claim against the public treasury, not just those that are explicitly prohibited by statute. E.g., United States v. Walcott, 972 F.2d 323, 327 (11th Cir. 1992) (\u201cSupreme Court has recently held that equitable estoppel cannot apply against the United States in a suit to recover \u2018public funds\u2019\u201d); Andrews v.

Cir. 1992) (government not estopped from asserting lack of authority to pay fees of court-appointed attorney in civil case because \u201chere was no express statutory basis for payment of fees\u201d). \u201cIn particular, the Claims Court erred in concluding that Richmond stands for the proposition that equitable estoppel will not lie against the government for any monetary claim. . . . Richmond is limited to \u2018claim for the payment of money from the Public Treasury contrary to a statutory appropriation.\u2019 . . .  holding must be limited to claims of entitlement contrary to statutory appropriations.\u201d \u201cThe precise effect of Richmond on contract cases is unclear, primarily because the awards sought by Government contractors are generally based on contract principles that do not contravene the eligibility requirements contained in federal statutes.\u201d", "Tri-O, Inc. v.

In sum, if the Supreme Court was looking for \u201canother day\u201d (496 U.S. at 423), the inevitability of that day seems assured.", "An interesting case which would appear to stand on its own regardless of whether Richmond is broadly or narrowly applied is United States v. Cox, 964 F.2d 1431 (4th Cir. 1992). A dispute arose as to whether the costs of a psychiatric examiner at a release hearing should be paid by the Department of Justice or from funds appropriated to the Federal Public Defender and administered by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts. The court held Justice estopped from declining payment because it had previously concurred in guidelines issued by the Administrative Office indicating Justice would pay in that type of situation and, to the extent Justice was in the process of changing its position, it had not adequately communicated that change to the Administrative Office. The fact that the case involved a payment of public funds did not bar the estoppel because \u201cthe disputed sum will, one way or the other, be paid by an agency of the federal government.\u201d Id. at 1435.

This may be a fixed date or a fixed period of time after the happening of some event. The standard government formula for computing a period of time between two events is to exclude the former and include the latter. Also, a statute takes effect on the date of its approval by the President unless some other date is fixed. Combining these two principles, where a commission was established by a statute approved on September 22, 1922, which provided that the commission would cease to exist \u201cone year after the taking effect of this act,\u201d the commission was in existence through September 22, 1923. 3 Comp.

On the 90th day after submitting its report, it was to cease to exist. The Commission submitted its report on July 31, 1972, and thus, according to statute, ceased to exist on October 29, 1972. After the Commission expired, one of its former officials placed several requisition orders with the Government Printing Office for the printing of several documents relating to the Commission\u2019s report. GPO did the printing and then sought reimbursement for its services. The Comptroller General concluded that the person who placed the orders had no authority to obligate funds after the Commission had expired, and that there were therefore no appropriations legally available to reimburse GPO.", "As noted, obligations validly incurred prior to expiration may be liquidated subsequently, at least until the expired account is closed. Under authority of the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1535, the General Services Administration may contract with another agency or commission to provide administrative support services, to include the certification for payment of valid claims against the agency or commission not presented until after its expiration. In such a situation, a GSA certifying officer can certify the expired agency\u2019s vouchers for payment. However, this authority is limited to instances where the authority is expressly included in a written Economy Act agreement, and only with respect to obligations validly incurred prior to the expiration of the agency or commission. 59 Comp.

This is perhaps the only remaining instance where direct settlement by GAO is required because there is simply no one else left to do it. Whether a claim is being settled by GSA under an Economy Act agreement or by GAO under direct settlement, an interesting problem arises if the account in question has been closed.

The term is not intended to have any connotation as to the person\u2019s motives. B-129004, October 25, 1956. \u201cNo individual can be made a debtor against his will. Voluntary benefits may be conferred on him, which may excite his gratitude, and which, in the exercise of his generosity, he may suitably reward. But this depends on his own volition. \u201c. . . To find an obligation in such a case, we must look into those writers on ethics who speak of imperfect obligations, which cannot be enforced.

The reason for the rule should be pretty obvious.

This is the real rule, to which there are no exceptions. A voluntary creditor has no right to be reimbursed. If the government does not find sufficient equitable or public policy reasons to make reimbursement, the voluntary creditor may not go to court, and has no other recourse but to seek private relief legislation.", "A point we noted earlier in this chapter is that the claims settlement jurisdiction of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a) extends only to claims based on legal liability and not to claims based on equity or moral obligations. Early decisions struggled with this principle in the voluntary creditor context, and some cited it as one of the reasons for prohibiting reimbursement. E.g., 8 Comp. Dec. 582, 586 (1902); 4 Comp. Dec. 409, 410 (1898).", "At the same time, however, it was clear that some voluntary creditors should be paid. For example, a 1901 case, 8 Comp. Dec. 43, approved reimbursement for an Army medical officer who had hired laundresses to wash bed and table linen in an Army hospital. Ten years later, the Comptroller of the Treasury approved reimbursement of a Justice Department employee who had used personal funds to pay the fees of witnesses summoned to testify in a court action where there was insufficient time to follow normal authorization and payment procedures. 18 Comp. Dec. 297 (1911). The decision states at page 299 that the voluntary creditor prohibition \u201cis a rule of accounting and should not be permitted to hinder the public business or prevent the payment of just and lawful claims against the Government.\u201d In any event, no case in recent decades has denied a voluntary creditor claim on the basis of perceived jurisdictional limitations under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(a). Voluntary creditor claims, therefore, may be viewed as an exception to the principle that claims may be allowed only on the basis of legal liability.", "Thus, by the time GAO took over the claims settlement function in 1921, it was already established that (a) a voluntary creditor has no legal claim against the government, (b) although there is no right to reimbursement, neither is there an absolute prohibition, and (c) there are cases in which voluntary creditors should be reimbursed as a matter of public policy. Once these fundamental tenets are accepted, the role of the decisions becomes to develop a set of guidelines so that claims can be resolved on the basis of rational principles and not extraneous factors such as the grade or position of the claimant.", "At one time, GAO wanted all voluntary creditor claims forwarded to it for direct settlement. 62 Comp. Gen. 419, 425 (1983). This is no longer the case. Agencies should treat voluntary creditor claims the same as any other claims, referring only \u201cdoubtful claims\u201d to GAO. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.4. (2) Underlying expenditure improper The cases under this heading are easy. If a given payment is improper\u2014either expressly prohibited or beyond the agency\u2019s authority\u2014a claim for reimbursement by a voluntary creditor must be denied because no basis for reimbursement can exist where the agency could not have made the payment directly. 64 Comp. Gen. 467 (1985); 62 Comp. Gen. 419, 423 (1983). \u201che voluntary intervention of claimant in the matter can not operate to authorize the making indirectly of a payment that could not legally be made directly.\u201d", "In 2 Comp. Gen. 581 (1923), a federal prohibition officer for the State of Indiana sought reimbursement for the cost of materials he had purchased in order to paint several signs. He had painted the signs for the Indiana Health Exposition after state officials asked him to maintain a prohibition booth at the fair. Concluding that appropriations for the enforcement of the National Prohibition Act were not available for the expenses of participation in fairs or expositions without further statutory authority, and also noting the voluntary creditor rule, the Comptroller General denied the claim.", "More recently, an employee of the Environmental Protection Agency had certain notices placed in newspapers in violation of 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702. He paid the newspapers from personal funds and filed a claim for reimbursement. Since the agency could not have paid the claim directly, GAO denied the claim for reimbursement, citing 3 Comp. Gen. 681 and the voluntary creditor rule. 60 Comp. Gen. 379 (1981).", "Several cases have involved the prohibition against paying from appropriated funds the cost of food furnished to government employees at their normal duty station without specific authority. In a case which predated the Postal Reorganization Act of 1971, a Post Office official brought in carry-out restaurant food, purchased from personal funds, for a group of employees who were presiding as election officials at a union election which lasted well past the normal dinner hour. The lives of the employees were not a stake and they were not there for the purpose of protecting government property. In view of the prohibition on furnishing free food to civilian employees, and further noting the voluntary creditor rule, the Comptroller General denied reimbursement. 42 Comp. Gen. 149 (1962). See also B-185159, December 10, 1975, and B-129004, September 6, 1956.", "Another case involving food, 53 Comp. Gen. 71 (1973), recognized an exception. In that case, the unauthorized occupation of a building in which the Bureau of Indian Affairs was located necessitated the assembling of a cadre of General Services Administration special police, who spent the whole night there. Agency officials purchased and brought in sandwiches and coffee for the cadre. GAO concluded that it would not question the agency\u2019s determination that the expenditure was incidental to the protection of government property during an extreme emergency, and approved reimbursement. The decision cautioned against getting carried away, however\u2014emergency means emergency. A similar exception occurred in B-189003, July 5, 1977 (FBI agents stranded in office during severe blizzard). (3) Voluntary vs. involuntary creditors The cases under this heading involve items the government provides for its employees at government expense. If an employee uses personal funds to purchase an item which is authorized, but not required, to be furnished at government expense, and the item is primarily for the employee\u2019s personal use even though used in the performance of official duties, the employee is nothing more than a voluntary creditor and reimbursement will usually be denied.", "For example, employees at an Air Force hospital who bought their own uniforms were voluntary creditors and could not be reimbursed. 46 Comp. Gen. 170 (1966). Similarly, an Army employee who purchased safety orthopedic shoes for use in his work as an automotive mechanic could not by his own voluntary action obligate the government to pay. B-162606, November 22, 1967. The fact that the government could have furnished the items but failed to do so (the uniforms under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5901 and the safety shoes as special equipment under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903) did not give the employees the right to, in effect, make the determinations on their own and circumvent the failure by buying the items themselves and then expecting the government to pay.", "On the other hand, if the item is something the government is required to furnish at government expense and fails to do so, the employee who uses personal funds is more of an \u201cinvoluntary creditor\u201d and may be reimbursed. E.g., 8 Comp. Dec. 377 (1901); A-24089, October 8, 1928. Both of these cases involved transportation allowances to which the employee was entitled by law. Of course, in order to become an \u201cinvoluntary creditor,\u201d the employee must attempt to obtain payment from the government before resorting to personal funds. 8 Comp. Dec. at 379; 8 Comp. Gen. 627 (1929).", "One early formulation of the voluntary creditor principle is that \u201ca person can not make himself the creditor of another without that other\u2019s consent.\u201d 4 Comp. Dec. 409, 411 (1898). The essence of the rule is unilateral action by the voluntary creditor.", "Consent was the dispositive factor in 61 Comp. Gen. 575 (1982). It is frequently necessary for the Internal Revenue Service to file tax liens with state or local recording offices, which customarily charge a filing fee. Many states and localities have worked out periodic billing arrangements with the IRS. Others, however, require payment at the time the lien is filed. The amounts are small and getting a government check in advance for each individual filing would be an enormous nuisance. In the cited decision, a certifying officer of the IRS questioned whether the voluntary creditor rule was a bar to an arrangement under which an agent paid the filing fees from his own pocket and submitted vouchers periodically for reimbursement. While there would have been a problem if the agent had acted entirely on his own, he had acted in accordance with formal IRS policy which sanctioned the arrangement in question. Therefore, the agent was not a \u201cvoluntary creditor\u201d for purposes of the prohibition. He did, however, have to pay his own check printing charges. (5) Procurement of goods or services The unauthorized procurement of goods or services generates the bulk of the voluntary creditor cases, and some of the more difficult ones. The guidelines in this area stem from 62 Comp. Gen. 419 (1983). In brief, the commanding officer of a National Guard unit spent over $300 of his own money to buy food for his troops on a weekend training exercise when the paperwork required to obtain the necessary purchasing authority was not completed in time. He then sought reimbursement. The resulting decision is GAO\u2019s most extensive discussion of the voluntary creditor rule.", "The decision first reviewed the early cases and the foundations of the rule. Does it continue to serve a useful purpose? Yes it does, GAO concluded. The system the federal government uses to obligate and disburse public funds is not some haphazard concoction. It exists for a reason\u2014more precisely, several reasons\u2014and permitting reimbursement for payments made from personal funds allows the individual, at least to some extent, to usurp the government\u2019s prerogative. \u201cThere are well-established procedures for making purchases, submitting and adjudicating claims, and making disbursements. Keeping in mind that we are spending the taxpayers\u2019 money, the interests of the Government are best served when these procedures are followed. It is, we think, clearly undesirable for individual employees to presume to make these decisions on their own and beyond their authority based on what they believe should happen.\u201d", "Id. at 422. This had been a concern, and one of the foundations of the voluntary creditor rule, from the earliest days. E.g., 12 Comp. Dec. 308 (1905); 8 Comp. Dec. 582, 585 (1902). Disregard of established procedures \u201cwould produce endless confusion and lead to double payment and serious embarrassments.\u201d 8 Comp. Dec. at 585. However, since the time of the Treasury decisions which had sought to achieve a balance, the rule somehow tightened up. The \u201c\u2018rule of accounting\u2019 . . . became treated, in effect, as a rule of law and acquired a rigidity it was never intended to have,\u201d 62 Comp. Gen. at 422 23. The decision then set out to formulate guidelines for the evaluation of voluntary creditor claims involving the acquisition of goods or services. \u201cOf course, when an employee expends his own funds in what he judges to be the interest of the Government, he does so at his own risk; no legal liability of the Government is created unless the Government ratifies his action as falling within the exception . . . and agrees to reimburse him. However, it would be shortsighted indeed not to recognize that this kind of initiative by the employee in an emergency is very valuable and, when it results in preserving a Government property interest, the employee should not be penalized through denial of reimbursement.\u201d", "Other cases which passed the \u201cpublic necessity\u201d test are:", "Upon receipt of shipment of contaminated drinking water and in view of past problems in receiving timely shipments, Army officer used personal funds to buy bottled water for his troops in Saudi Arabia.

An employee is not expected to risk his or her job, even if the superior is clearly wrong. There must, however, be something.

Dec. 486 (1905); B-232686, December 7, 1988.", "Another case in which a lesser standard was acceptable is B-204073, September 7, 1982. An officer at the Naval War College was told that he could buy certain computer software with personal funds and file a claim for reimbursement. The software was needed for a research project, and there was an assertion that time was of the essence. This would have been sufficient if true, but there was nothing in the record to back it up. Be that as it may, the case was different in one important respect. The typical case involves either services already performed or property which cannot be returned to the claimant. Here, the War College could have returned the software to the claimant, but it would then have had to go out immediately and repurchase the same thing, a rather pointless course of events. The claim was allowed, the decision reiterating that unauthorized purchases create no legal liability on the part of the government.", "A 1984 case presented a \u201cmixed bag.\u201d A trial attorney for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission needed to get several indigent witnesses from San Diego to San Francisco to appear at a court hearing. When the witnesses arrived at the San Diego airport the night before the hearing, the airline refused to honor the Government Transportation requests. The attorney paid the fares from his own funds and also advanced money to the witnesses for their hotel and meal expenses. The air fares clearly qualified for reimbursement under the standard of 62 Comp. Gen. 419. Failure to act would have jeopardized the litigation. With respect to the funds advanced for lodging and subsistence, however, there was nothing in the record to support a need to act\u2014or a reasonable perception of such a need\u2014so this portion of the claim was denied.

Gen. at 424 25. The claimant in 62 Comp. Gen. 419 clearly met these standards and was reimbursed.

Gen. 20 (1953), a certifying officer paid a portion of a disputed travel voucher to another government employee from personal funds. It took GAO only half a page to deny reimbursement. The certifying officer\u2019s belief that the payment was correct was immaterial. In another case, a National Park Service employee used personal funds as a security deposit against a claim for rent due by the government for space in a privately-owned trailer park. The federal employee, under the impression, later found to be erroneous, that the rental claim was valid, used his own funds in order to secure the release of a government-owned trailer which the trailer park owner had originally threatened to hold as security. The Comptroller General held that, although time was a factor (the vehicle had to be winterized for use in another location), release of the trailer could have been accomplished through other means and therefore there was no basis for an exception to the rule. The claim for reimbursement was denied. B-184982, October 13, 1976.", "As with the other types of cases, there are exceptions here, too, although this category is expressly excluded from 62 Comp. Gen. 419 (id. at 423), and the standards have not been defined to the extent that 62 Comp. Gen. 419 defined them for the procurement cases. The answer will depend on the strength of the justification which must, of course, be more than mere convenience or an employee\u2019s belief that something is a good idea. Thus, reimbursement was authorized in B-177331, December 14, 1972, when an employee paid a claim resulting from an automobile accident in a foreign country in order to avoid detention by the local police and to obtain release of the impounded government vehicle. See also B-186474, June 15, 1976 (government driver paid tort claim from personal funds, claimant executed release protecting United States from any further claims).", "It must be emphasized that the voluntary creditor always acts at his or her own risk and never has a right to be reimbursed. GAO has cautioned in numerous cases that payments from personal funds are undesirable and should be discouraged. E.g., 62 Comp. Gen. at 424; 60 Comp. Gen. 379, 381 (1981); B-186474, June 15, 1976. Nevertheless, the voluntary creditor rule is nowhere near as harsh as it is sometimes perceived to be. Many claims are allowed, and this is as it should be. \u201cI do not wish . . . to be understood as countenancing indiscriminate payments of this character. Officers and employees in the field should, before using their own funds to pay legitimate expenses of the Government, ascertain whether there is a feasible means of making payments in the usual and prescribed manner, and the measure of such feasibility should not be their own convenience or desire.

The rule is sometimes referred to as the \u201cinterdepartmental waiver doctrine.\u201d The rule applies equally to components of a single agency funded under separate appropriations. See 65 Comp.

Gen. 74 (1923); B-35478, July 24, 1943.", "The rule is based in large measure on the premise that ownership of public property is in the United States as a single entity and not in the individual departments or agencies. 41 Comp.

Gen. 171, 172 (1926). The theory is that an agency which is authorized to acquire property is also authorized to maintain or repair that property to keep it suitable for its intended use; its appropriations, if not expressly available for repairs, are nevertheless available by necessary implication without regard to what caused the damage. See 6 Comp. Dec. at 75. If, as these cases indicate, payment by the agency causing the damage would be a payment for an unauthorized purpose, it follows that it would also improperly augment the appropriations of the claimant agency. 29 Comp.

For example, the General Services Administration is required by law to establish and maintain an interagency motor pool system. The law (40 U.S.C. \u00a7 491) authorizes GSA to recover all costs connected with operating the system from agency users. Since the expense of repairing damaged vehicles is clearly a cost of operating and maintaining a motor pool, GSA is authorized to charge the using agency with the cost of repair of GSA vehicles damaged through the negligence or misconduct of a driver employed by that agency. 59 Comp.

The question was whether the claim of the Bureau of Indian Affairs on behalf of the Pima Indians, the project beneficiaries, against the Air Force would represent a claim by one government agency against another. GAO found that, although the San Carlos Irrigation Project was an instrumentality of the United States, the project funds were moneys held in trust by the government for the Pima Indians. If the general rule were applied, the expense of repairing the damage would be borne not by the government but by the project beneficiaries. Thus, the BIA could present its claim. The decision cautioned, however, that Air Force claims regulations precluded claims by government instrumentalities, and GAO could not require the Air Force to treat the claim as cognizable.", "Applying similar reasoning, the Comptroller General found Navy appropriations available to pay a claim for damage to property of the Ryukyu Electric Power Corporation. B-159559, August 12, 1968. The Corporation, while an instrumentality of the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands, was not an instrumentality of the United States Government. Further, while funds available to the Civil Administration were government funds, they were in the nature of a trust account held for the sole benefit of the Ryukyuan people. Another case applying the trust reasoning is B-35478, July 24, 1943.", "The reverse situation was presented in 46 Comp. Gen. 586 (1966), when the Department of Agriculture sought to file a claim against the government of American Samoa for losses due to improper storage of donated agricultural commodities. Following the rationale of 41 Comp. Gen. 235, GAO found that the general rule would not have prevented a claim by the Interior Department on behalf of the Samoan people against a federal agency for damage to Samoan Government property. Therefore, a federal agency, in this case the Department of Agriculture, could present a claim against the Samoan Government. The decisive factor was that the Government of American Samoa was not an instrumentality of the United States Government, at least for purposes of this rule, and the fact that the funds of both parties were subject to audit by GAO was immaterial. The same result applied to a claim against the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. B-160506, August 15, 1967; B-160506, April 10, 1970. A claim for damage to donated agricultural commodities was held subject to the general rule, and therefore precluded, in B-136949, September 8, 1958, where both parties were government agencies.", "The \u201ctrust exception\u201d of cases like 41 Comp.

Gen. 464 (1986), in which a Navy plane crashed into and destroyed a Federal Aviation Administration instrument landing system. Although the FAA used funds from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund to repair its facility, this \u201ctrust fund\u201d is little more than an earmarked appropriation and does not involve the same kind of trust relationship as in the San Carlos and Ryukyu cases. Accordingly, the general rule controlled, and Navy appropriations were not available to reimburse the FAA.", "Another element of the rule, noted above, is that the agency sought to be charged must have been performing a governmental function. The absence of this element justified an exception in 14 Comp. Gen. 256 (1934), where a claim was allowed for damage to an Army dredge caused by a government-owned vessel employed solely as a merchant vessel.

Dec. 222 (1903) (no authority to reimburse lending agency for borrowed mule which drowned). An exception occurred in 10 Comp. Gen. 563 (1931) for property loaned for exhibit purposes only. The Architect of the Capitol loaned a model of the United States Capitol to a commission established to administer the government\u2019s participation in the 1927 International Exposition in Seville, Spain. At the close of the Exposition, the model was returned with its dome shattered. GAO construed the resolution establishing the commission as requiring by implication that property be returned in as good condition as when borrowed. An additional factor in that case may have been that there appeared to be no funds under the control of the Architect of the Capitol remaining available to make the repairs.", "Another application of the general rule, noted in the above quotation from 10 Comp.

The Court of Federal Claims has indicated that it will be inclined to look for factors like those the Supreme Court noted in Irwin, for example, where a plaintiff actively pursued his remedy but filed a defective pleading, or where a claimant is induced or tricked by his adversary\u2019s misconduct into missing the deadline.

The claims are adjudicated by the General Services Administration. An illustrative case is B-197661, May 22, 1980.

As a general proposition, a specific statute of limitations applicable to administrative settlement will take precedence over 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b), the more general provision. See 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.5(a) (all claims subject to Barring Act \u201cexcept as otherwise provided by law\u201d), 31.5(c).", "However, the Comptroller General has frequently held that time limitations applicable to the commencement of \u201cactions at law\u201d do not affect the authority to settle claims administratively under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3702(a) and (b). An early discussion of this point appears in B-15487, February 16, 1948, in which it was held that the expiration of the time limit for filing suit in the Court of Claims did not preclude administrative settlement by GAO. The principle was restated in 29 Comp. Gen. 54 (1949). To take a more recent illustration, the time limit for filing a claim under the Fair Labor Standards Act is the six years prescribed by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b), notwithstanding a two-year statute of limitations for commencing actions at law. Thus, a claim filed under the FLSA more than two years but less than six years after it accrues can still be considered administratively, although the claimant will have lost the right of recourse to the courts. 57 Comp.

As do most courts, we will refer to them collectively as the Assignment of Claims Act.", "Subsection (b) of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727 prohibits the assignment of claims against the United States except under fairly rigid conditions. It originated as section 1 of legislation enacted in 1853 entitled \u201cAn Act to prevent Frauds upon the Treasury of the United States\u201d (10 Stat. 170).

When the statute was first enacted, the payment process was very different than it is today. In brief, after a claim was examined and allowed, a warrant was issued, signed by an appropriate department official, countersigned by one of the Treasury comptrollers, and then presented to the Treasurer for payment.

With the development of the waiver doctrine, it is now more accurate to say that a noncomplying assignment is voidable at the option of the government. Apparently to reflect this judicial evolution, the 1982 recodification of Title 31 dropped the \u201cnull and void\u201d language. See Matter of Topgallant Lines, Inc., 125 B.R. 682, 690 91 (Bankr.

First is transfer by testamentary disposition (will), by analogy to intestate succession. Erwin, 97 U.S. at 397 (the reference to \u201cdevisees\u201d means those taking under a will); Shannon, 342 U.S. at 292. Second is the voluntary assignment by an insolvent debtor for the benefit of creditors, by analogy to assignments in bankruptcy. Goodman v. Niblack, 102 U.S. 556 (1880); Shannon, 342 U.S. at 292; 47 Comp. Gen. 522 (1968). With these two exceptions, voluntary assignments are subject to the Assignment of Claims Act and must meet the requirements of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727(b) in order to bind the government. (1) Attorney\u2019s liens A common application of the rule that voluntary assignments are subject to the Assignment of Claims Act is the attorney\u2019s lien. An early Supreme Court case, Nutt v. Knut (we do not make these up), 200 U.S. 12 (1906), dealt with a contingent fee agreement under which an attorney was to receive one-third of the amount allowed on a claim against the United States. By itself, no problem with that, said the Court. It does no more than establish the basis for determining the attorney\u2019s compensation. Id. at 21. See also Wright v. Tebbitts, 91 U.S. 252 (1875). However, the agreement also purported to give the attorney a lien on the claim. \u201cIn effect or by its operation it transferred or assigned to the attorney in advance of the allowance of the claim such an interest as would secure the payment of the fee stipulated to be paid,\u201d and this violated the Assignment of Claims Act. Knut, 200 U.S. at 20. This was followed some years later in Calhoun v. Massie, 253 U.S. 170, 175 (1920). \u201cstands for the broad principle that any attempt to impress a lien upon the proceeds of a claim against the United States as security for the payment of an attorney\u2019s fee is within the ends to which the prohibition of [31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727(b)] was aimed.\u201d", "Id. at 580. The fact that the attorney\u2019s lien is prescribed by state statute makes no difference. Tucker v. United States, 7 Cl. Ct. 374 (1985).", "A variation occurred in Schwartz v. United States, 16 Cl. Ct. 182 (1989). Plaintiff attorney had represented a client in prosecuting a claim with the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The plaintiff, pursuant to a contingent fee agreement with his client, asked the BIA to issue the check to the attorney and client jointly, which a BIA employee apparently agreed to do. Instead, however, the BIA deposited the money in the client\u2019s Individual Indian account, whereupon the client withdrew the money. The attorney then sued the government for his fee. The court held that the purported assignment was not binding on the government, and that the BIA employee\u2019s alleged promise was not enough to constitute a waiver of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727(b). (2) Tax refunds Tax refund claims are fully subject to the Assignment of Claims Act. E.g., In re Freeman, 489 F.2d 431 (9th Cir. 1973). An assignment to a \u201cdiscounter\u201d\u2014one who advances funds to a taxpayer and obtains in return an assignment of the refund\u2014is not enforceable against the government. The Internal Revenue Service cannot be required to transmit the refund to the discounter. Knight v. United States, 596 F. Supp. 540 (M.D. Ga. 1984), aff\u2019d mem., 762 F.2d 1022 (11th Cir. 1985); In re R & L Refunds, Inc., 96 B.R. 105 (Bankr. W.D. Ky. 1988). An assignment of a tax refund to the taxpayer\u2019s attorney is similarly unenforceable against the government, but may nevertheless be valid between the parties. Danning v. Mintz, 367 F.2d 304 (9th Cir. 1966); In re Lagerstrom, 300 F. Supp. 538 (S.D. Ill. 1969).", "Under one type of arrangement, the refund is paid into an account at a bank which has made a \u201crefund anticipation loan\u201d to the taxpayer. Noncompliance with the Assignment of Claims Act does not impede payment of the refund into the account since the account is in the name of the taxpayer. With the IRS thus out of the picture, the rights and liabilities of the nonfederal parties are determined under state law. E.g., In re Martin, 167 B.R. 609 (Bankr. D. Ore. 1994).", "In United States v. Sinton Dairy Foods Co., 775 F. Supp. 1417 (D. Colo. 1991), the IRS issued a refund check to a corporation and it was negotiated by a successor corporation which had acquired all of the payee corporation\u2019s assets, including potential tax refunds, by assignment. Finding that the assignment was voidable at the government\u2019s discretion, and that the government retained a property interest in the check until cashed by the payee, the court held the IRS entitled to recover the refund.", "A provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325(c), authorizes the court, upon confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan, to \u201corder any entity from whom the debtor receives income to pay all or any part of such income to the trustee.\u201d In In re I.C. Cochran, 141 B.R. 270 (M.D. Ga. 1992), the court found this provision in conflict with the Assignment of Claims Act and held that it impliedly modified the Act to permit the assignment of tax refunds to a trustee by means of income deduction orders. The court distinguished the type of assignment considered in cases like Knight. Id. at 273. (3) Just compensation claims The relationship of the Assignment of Claims Act to claims resulting from Fifth Amendment takings depends on the type of proceeding involved. It has been held that the Assignment of Claims Act does not apply to the distribution phase in a Declaration of Taking Act condemnation. United States v. 717.42 Acres of Land, 955 F.2d 376 (5th Cir. 1992). In this type of proceeding, the government files a declaration of taking and deposits the estimated just compensation into the registry fund of the court. Title passes by operation of law upon filing the declaration, and the United States becomes irrevocably committed to pay.", "In contrast, in a \u201ccomplaint only\u201d condemnation, the court\u2019s determination of just compensation is essentially an offer which the government is free to accept or reject, and a taking does not occur unless and until the government makes payment. In this type of condemnation, an assignment of the landowner\u2019s interest in the award is subject to the Assignment of Claims Act. United States v. Certain Lands in the Town of Highlands, 46 F. Supp. 386 (S.D.N.Y. 1942).", "The assignment of an inverse condemnation claim is also subject to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727(b). Cooper v. United States, 8 Cl. Ct. 253 (1985). Cooper was a suit by a person who had acquired land which had been flooded by actions of the Corps of Engineers. The court held that only the owner at the time of the taking is entitled to be compensated for the taking, and that an attempt by the owner to assign his claim to a subsequent owner was prohibited by the Assignment of Claims Act. (4) Federal salaries Early cases found the Assignment of Claims Act fully applicable to requests by a government employee to a disbursing officer to pay the employee\u2019s salary to some third person. 11 Comp. Dec. 790 (1905). Combining the Assignment of Claims Act with 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3322(a), which directs disbursing officers to draw checks only in favor of the person to whom payment is to be made, agencies could not, without statutory authority, issue composite salary checks (lump-sum check payable to a bank covering the salaries of several employees with accounts in that bank). 39 Comp. Gen. 372 (1959); 12 Comp. Dec. 227 (1905); B-141025, December 20, 1960. The cases drew an exception to permit employees to purchase United States Savings Bonds by payroll deduction and have them registered in the name of some other person. 21 Comp. Gen. 942 (1942).", "There is now statutory authority for direct deposit and for the issuance of composite checks for federal salaries. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3332. The background of the legislation is discussed in 48 Comp. Gen. 138 (1968). As amended in 1994 by Pub. L. No. 103-356, \u00a7 402(a), the statute no longer explicitly addresses composite checks, although the authority would still be included. There is also authority for a federal employee \u201cto make allotments and assignments of amounts out of his pay for such purpose as  considers appropriate.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5525. This statute permits, for example, the collection of union dues by payroll deduction. 42 Comp. Gen. 342 (1963). (5) Other voluntary assignments It is difficult to draw any further generalizations except to restate the rule that voluntary assignments do not bind the government unless made in compliance with 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727(b). Some illustrations reaching this result follow:", "Claim brought by a subsequent purchaser for damage to buildings caused by military personnel under a lease with the prior owner. United States v. Shannon, 342 U.S. 288 (1952). The difference between this case and the inverse condemnation case noted above is that the damage in Shannon was only temporary, thereby generating a tort, rather than an inverse condemnation, claim. The Assignment of Claims Act application, however, is the same.", "Assignment of claim under federal flood insurance policy. Diamond v.", "Federal Emergency Management Agency, 689 F. Supp. 163 (E.D.N.Y. 1988).", "Assignment of claim for compensation for oil spill cleanup expenses under Federal Water Pollution Control Act. Amoco Oil Co. v. United States, 3 Cl. Ct. 785 (1983).", "A final case is Kingsbury v. United States, 563 F.2d 1019 (Ct. Cl. 1977), which we are tempted to subtitle \u201cthe ballad of Bruce and Valerie.\u201d Bruce, an enterprising young man, was arrested in 1971 for importing marijuana, convicted, fined, and slapped in jail. Disappointed that the parole board would not consider parole after only 3 months of the sentence, he escaped, stole a prison vehicle, and went to meet his wife, Valerie, with whom he had planned the escape, at a prearranged location. Before they could get away in Valerie\u2019s car, however, they were caught and the FBI seized over $42,000 in cash, most of it from Valerie\u2019s purse. Of the seized funds, $15,000 went to the court for Bruce\u2019s fine and the IRS took the rest.", "Bruce and Valerie pleaded guilty to new charges stemming from the escape. Valerie, now pregnant, was placed on probation and Bruce was lodged temporarily in a local treatment center until the baby was born. Shortly after delivering the baby, Valerie executed an assignment to Bruce\u2019s father, ostensibly in repayment of a loan, of most of the money the FBI had seized. A week later, Bruce escaped again and Bruce, Valerie, and baby disappeared into the sunset.", "Bruce\u2019s father then hired a lawyer and filed suit to collect on the assignment he was left holding. The court found the claim barred by the Assignment of Claims Act. Whatever else the statute may or may not have been intended to cover, surely it reached \u201can assignment made by a convicted criminal on the eve of her flight from justice.\u201d Id. at 1024.

More specifically, from the government contracting perspective, 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a) was intended to ensure that the government would not enter into a contract with \u201cA\u201d only to have \u201cB\u201d show up on its doorstep to perform, or to learn that \u201cA\u201d is not a legitimate contractor but merely a speculator who intended all along to sell the contract to someone else.

Where goods are transported pursuant to a previously executed contract, the bills of lading are merely a receipt for the goods to be transported, and payment for the transportation is made under the previously executed master contract rather than under a particular bill of lading covering the service.

In any event, as long as the \u201cused or available\u201d test is met, the loan need not have been made to finance performance of the particular contract whose proceeds are being assigned; if the assignor has several government contracts, it is sufficient that the loan was made for the purpose of financing government contracts in general.

Thus, when the government pays an assignee under a valid assignment, it cannot get that money back to satisfy a debt of the contractor. Under a literal reading of this provision, it is possible to argue that the government cannot recover even if the payment was erroneously made. See United States v. Hadden, 192 F.2d 327 (6th Cir. 1951). Just how far this proposition may go is not clear, although it is not an absolute. One court has suggested, for example, that the assignee\u2019s protection might not extend to payments induced by fraud, although it is probably not possible to generalize. American Fidelity Co. v.

If the Government has the facilities for knowing that the collateral is worthless, and is unconscious of the fact only because of its carelessness in the handling of public money, we think it may not take advantage of its own negligence, and recoup its negligent overpayments by accepting supplies bought with money loaned by the assignee bank on the faith of the assignment.\u201d", "The court took note of this duty again several years later in Produce Factors Corp. v.

The same contractor had an outstanding judgment against it for the balance due on surplus property purchased from the government several years earlier. The supply contract included a no-setoff clause, and the contractor had made a valid assignment of its proceeds. Since the contractor\u2019s debt to the government arose independently of the contract whose proceeds had been assigned, it could not be collected by offset against payments due the assignee.", "The second category of prohibited offsets\u2014liabilities which do not arise independently of the contract\u2014is limited to the items specified in the statute. A liability arising under the contract which is not one of the enumerated items is not protected by the no-setoff clause and may be recovered by offset against the assignee. One example is liquidated damages provided for in the contract. B-110730, September 18, 1952. As B-110730 points out, the theory is that an assignment carries with it the right to receive only such amounts as are due and owing to the contractor under the contract; there is no right to payment in excess of those amounts. Another example is excess reprocurement costs resulting from a default termination. Modern Industrial Bank v. United States, 101 Ct. Cl. 808 (1944); 35 Comp.

GAO reviewed applicable principles and precedents in detail in 60 Comp. Gen. 510 (1981), as clarified by 62 Comp. Gen. 683 (1983), and made the following key points: (1) If the proceeds of a contract containing a no-setoff clause have been validly assigned, the government cannot offset a tax debt of the contractor against money to be paid to the assignee, except to the extent unpaid contract proceeds exceed the contractor\u2019s remaining indebtedness to the assignee. However, if a loan secured by an assignment was not used, or available for use, in performing the assigned contract\u2014and this includes situations in which performance was completed at the time of the loan, there is no valid assignment and offset is permissible even in the face of a no-setoff clause. See also B-216549, December 5, 1984. (2) A no-setoff clause protects the assignee even against tax claims which have matured prior to the effective date of the assignment. See also 65 Comp. Gen. 554 (1986); 37 Comp. Gen. 318 (1957). (3) If the contract does not contain a no-setoff clause, the assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor, and the government may offset a tax debt of the assignor that was in existence before the assignment became effective. The actual offset cannot be made until the tax debt has matured (i.e., liability assessed), but the fact that the IRS does not actually make the assessment before the assignment becomes effective will not defeat the offset. See also 56 Comp. Gen. 499, 503 (1977); 37 Comp. Gen. 808 (1958); B-152008, September 10, 1963. (4) An assignment becomes effective on the date the contracting agency receives notification of the assignment. Failure to record or perfect an assignment as a security interest under state law (such as the Uniform Commercial Code) does not affect the validity of the assignment with respect to the federal government.", "If the contract does not contain a no-setoff clause, then offset is governed by whatever common-law or statutory authorities are available. E.g., B-152008, September 10, 1963. Under common-law principles, the government may set off against the assignee any claims of the government against the assignor which matured prior to the effective date of the assignment, whether arising out of the contract or independently. South Side Bank & Trust Co. v. United States, 221 F.2d 813 (7th Cir. 1955); B-177648, December 14, 1973; FAR, 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.803(e).

Nevertheless, an incomplete or defective notice of assignment raises the question of the proper starting date for computing the discount period. Normally, the starting point is the date of the invoice (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3904). Yet if the contracting agency has received a defective or incomplete notice of assignment, it faces somewhat of a dilemma. It cannot pay the assignee until it receives the proper assignment documents. Nor should it pay the contractor since the government is on notice, however imperfectly, of the intent to make an assignment. Meanwhile, while the deficiency is being corrected, the clock on the discount period continues to tick.", "In these circumstances, GAO and the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals have taken the position that the government may take the discount if it makes payment within the specified number of days after receipt of the necessary assignment documents. For example, the contract in B-185846, May 11, 1977, included a 20-day prompt payment discount. The contractor submitted an invoice with an assignment notation on it, but the assignment documents themselves had not been filed. The agency (Navy) asked the assignee to furnish the necessary documents. By the time the documents showed up and the Navy made payment, more than 20 days had elapsed from receipt of the original invoice. GAO agreed with the Navy that it was entitled to take the discount as long as it paid within 20 days after receipt of the assignment documents. In reaching this result, GAO relied on the decision of the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals in Carolina Paper Mills, Inc., ASBCA Nos. 4488 and 4614, 58-2 BCA \u00b6 1832 (1958).", "GAO considered the same issue, and reached the same result, in B-194981, December 12, 1979, and B-192774, April 16, 1979, pointing out in B-194981 that, under the Assignment of Claims Act, it is the assignee\u2019s responsibility to provide appropriate documentation to the disbursing officer, and the government should not be penalized for the assignee\u2019s failure or delay in fulfilling this obligation.", "At the time these GAO and ASBCA decisions were rendered, the clock for taking a prompt payment discount was considered to start upon receipt of a \u201cproper invoice.\u201d In 1988, Congress specified the invoice date as the starting date and gave it a statutory basis.

The assignee in that case delayed notifying the government for 4 months, and could presumably have avoided, or at least minimized, liability but for that delay.

In contrast, the Gulf Apparel court found that \u201cfraud in the inducement, by its nature, is outside of the contract.\u201d 140 B.R. at 598.", "Another case, 50 Comp. Gen. 434 (1970), involved fraud by a contractor against its own assignee. The assignment involved an unusual arrangement under which the contractor would submit invoices to the assignee, presumably representing work done. The assignee paid the contractor a percentage of the invoice amount and then submitted the invoices to the government for reimbursement. Over a period of time, the contractor submitted false invoices, got paid by the assignee, and then visited the government disbursing office to retrieve the invoices before the government was able to process them, claiming various errors. The assignee caught on when it realized that, under a contract with an annual value of less than $14,000, it had paid out over $50,000 in just 3 months and had received very little reimbursement. Naturally, the contractor had dissipated its assets by then. The assignee first came to GAO to seek relief under a variety of theories, but GAO could find no legal basis to allow the claim, noting that the Assignment of Claims Act does not make the government \u201can insurer as to fraudulent schemes devised by an assignor as against an assignee.\u201d Id. at 441.

Although 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a) prohibits the transfer of contracts, GAO agreed that Navy could waive the statute and recognize the transfer.", "The \u201csoundest and most accepted\u201d method of waiving 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a)\u2014although not the exclusive method\u2014is a novation agreement.

There is some authority on the district court side for the proposition that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3727(b) cannot be waived until after the claim has been allowed. United States v. Shannon, 186 F.2d 430, 432 33 (4th Cir. 1951), rev\u2019d on other grounds , 342 U.S. 288; Knight v. United States, 596 F.

Most Assignment of Claims Act cases which end up in court tend to be litigated in the Court of Federal Claims, however, which does not follow this precedent. See Schwartz v. United States, 16 Cl.

Once it is established that the government can waive something voluntarily, it is perhaps inevitable that the courts will start finding that they can, in effect, waive it too, whether the government intended this result or not. The leading \u201cinvoluntary waiver\u201d case is Tuftco Corp. v. United States, 614 F.2d 740 (Ct. Cl. 1980). The Department of Housing and Urban Development had entered into contracts for the purchase of mobile homes. The contractor assigned the contracts\u2014the contracts themselves, not just the proceeds\u2014to another party. Before each assignment, the parties informed the contracting officer who agreed and said that HUD would make the payments to the assignee. Instead, HUD made several payments to the original contractor. When the assignee sued, the government raised 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 15 as a defense, arguing that the contracting officer had no authority to recognize the assignments. \u201ce conclude the contracting officer was fully aware of the assignments, recognized them, and communicated such recognition to plaintiff. In this case the action of defendant constituted a waiver of the Act\u2019s provisions, including the notice provision applicable to banks and financial institutions. Having chosen to recognize the assignments, defendant was bound to act in accordance with their terms.\u201d", "614 F.2d at 743 44. Therefore, the government was liable to the assignee for losses sustained as a result of HUD\u2019s payments to the original contractor. Of course the assignee wanted interest too, which the court denied. Id. at 747. \u201cIn all the cases in which the Government has been found to have recognized an assignment and waived the anti-assignment statutes, the notice of the transfer or assignment has been clear and unambiguous and the Government has either expressly agreed to the assignment . . . or has so conducted itself that the assignee was warranted in concluding that recognition of the assignment or transfer had occurred.\u201d", "Rodgers Construction, Inc., IBCA Nos. 2777 et al., 92-1 BCA \u00b6 24,503, at 122,307 (1991).", "The second group involves defective assignments to financing institutions (no notice, defective notice, no financial participation, etc.). Since the assignee is not a contractor, these do not come under the Contract Disputes Act but usually go directly to court. The Court of Federal Claims applies Tuftco\u2019s \u201ctotality of the circumstances test based on three factors: the government\u2019s knowledge of, assent to, and actions in accordance with the assignment.\u201d United California Discount Corp. v. United States, 19 Cl. Ct. 504, 509 (1990). As with the implied novation cases, the result turns on an analysis of the government\u2019s conduct. In addition to United California, some cases in which the court refused to find an involuntary waiver are Trust Co. Bank of Middle Georgia v. United States, 24 Cl. Ct. 710 (1992); American National Bank and Trust Co. v. United States, 23 Cl. Ct. 542 (1991); and American Financial Associates, Ltd. v. United States, 5 Cl.

Gen. 53 (1981) but not in B-225051, February 19, 1988.", "It should be apparent that the rationale of Tuftco and its progeny is basically an estoppel theory. What these cases teach is that the government can find itself bound by its own conduct. In the context of voluntary waiver, GAO has rejected the suggestion that waiver \u201cis permitted only where the government is otherwise estopped from disavowing the assignment.\u201d 68 Comp.

It does not apply, however, to contract obligations of the District of Columbia government, which is liable for interest on its contract obligations the same as a private corporation. 33 Comp.

However, consistent with the rule, such legislation may provide for interest in situations where it would not otherwise be payable. See, e.g., B-182574-O.M., July 19, 1979. In B-187866, April 12, 1977, the Comptroller General concluded that interest could be paid on a claim for which Congress had made a specific appropriation where the appropriation language did not specify interest but it was clear from the legislative history that the amount appropriated included interest. (The specific claim involved in B-187866 would now be covered by the Contract Disputes Act.)", "A statute originating in 1841 provides that amounts held in trust by the United States shall be invested in government obligations and shall bear interest at a minimum annual rate of 5 percent. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 9702.

The No-Interest Rule in the Contract Context", "paragraphs": ["At one time, GAO took the position that interest could be provided for in a contract only if supported by statutory authority. The rationale was that a contractual stipulation to pay interest for a delay in payment could end up obligating the government beyond the period of obligational availability of the appropriation, thereby violating the Antideficiency Act. This rule was expressed in 22 Comp. Gen. 772 (1943). However, Supreme Court formulations in cases like United States v. Thayer-West Point Hotel Co., 329 U.S. 585 (1947), made it clear that the two bases for interest liability\u2014statute or contract\u2014were indeed alternatives. Consequently, GAO changed its position in 51 Comp. Gen. 251 (1971), overruling 22 Comp. Gen. 772 and recognizing that the government could become liable for interest by contract even without express statutory authority. The potential Antideficiency Act problem could be averted by a reservation of funds. Thus, the United States can be liable for interest either (1) if it is expressly provided by statute, or (2) even in the absence of applicable statutory authority, if it is provided in the relevant contract. See, e.g., 56 Comp. Gen. 55 (1976) (military transportation contracts with air carriers). Absent authority from either source, interest may not be paid. E.g., B-187877, April 14, 1977.", "With this issue resolved, the federal procurement regulations began to require the inclusion of a \u201cPayment of Interest\u201d clause in procurement contracts, and the boards of contract appeals awarded interest to the extent permitted by that clause. E.g., Proserv, Inc., ASBCA No. 20768, 78-1 BCA \u00b6 13,066 (1978); General Research Corp., ASBCA No. 21005, 77-2 BCA \u00b6 12,767 (1977). Indeed, some boards applied the so-called \u201cChristian doctrine\u201d and incorporated the Payment of Interest clause into the contract in cases where it had been inadvertently omitted. E.g., MR\u2019s Landscaping and Nursery, HUD BCA No. 76-29, 76-30, 78-1 BCA \u00b6 13,077 (1978); Commonwealth Electric Co., IBCA No. 1048-11-74, 77-2 BCA \u00b6 12,649 (1977).", "Interest on payments to contractors is now governed by two statutes\u2014the Contract Disputes Act (interest on claims) and the Prompt Payment Act (interest on delayed payments). As we will see, the Federal Acquisition Regulation includes several implementing provisions, although there is no longer a separate \u201cPayment of Interest\u201d clause.", "While the Contract Disputes Act and Prompt Payment Act cover most contract-related payments, they do not cover all situations. Those that are not covered remain subject to the no-interest rule. Thus, as we have noted elsewhere in this chapter, payments to an assignee under the Assignment of Claims Act do not bear interest because the assignee is not a contractor, nor do payments under a contract implied-in-law (quantum meruit). In addition: Interest is not payable on a claim for bid protest costs. 69 Comp. Gen. 679, 684 (1990); B-226941.3, April 13, 1989.", "The Contract Disputes Act and Prompt Payment Act apply to contracts under which the government is acquiring goods or services. They do not apply when the government is providing goods or services. E.g., B-226231, October 23, 1987 (no interest on claim for refund of overcharges).", "Traditionally, interest on borrowings is not an allowable cost. E.g., Myerle v. United States, 31 Ct.

This is based on the policy of encouraging contractors \u201cto finance the performance of Government contracts with their working capital rather than with borrowed capital.\u201d B-185016, July 8, 1976. If interest on borrowings were reimbursable, the Myerle court noted, a contractor would never use its own money to finance performance. This principle is now reflected in the FAR at 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.205-20 with respect to commercial contractors. However, the cost of capital committed to facilities is treated as an imputed cost which may be allowable, whether derived from equity or borrowed capital, under 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 31.205-10 (\u201cCost of Money\u201d). In addition, there is authority for allowing the recovery of interest, under limited circumstances, on borrowings made necessary by a government-ordered change. E.g., Gulf Contracting, Inc. v.

First, the law directs the Office of Management and Budget to prescribe implementing regulations, and goes on to tell OMB in some detail what those regulations should say. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3903. These regulations are published as OMB Circular No. A-125, \u201cPrompt Payment\u201d (1989). They are entitled to the deference required by Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984), discussed in Chapter 3. International Business Investments, Inc. v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 79 (1990); Ocean Technology, Inc. v. United States, 19 Cl. Ct. 288 (1990); Technology for Communications International, ASBCA Nos. 36265, 36841, 93-3 BCA \u00b6 26,139 (1993). In addition, an uncodified provision of the 1988 amendments directs modification of the Federal Acquisition Regulation to include solicitation provisions and contract clauses to implement the statute and the OMB regulations. This provision, section 11 of Pub. L. No. 100-496, s 102 Stat. at 2463, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3903 note, also includes considerable detail on the content of the modifications. The FAR coverage is found at 48 C.F.R. Subpart 32.9. Thus, to fully understand or properly apply the Prompt Payment Act, one needs the statute, the OMB circular, and the FAR, as well as any individual agency regulations.", "The statute and regulations go into excruciating detail in some areas, most of which we do not reflect here. A well-documented and comprehensive reference to fill in the gaps is Michael J. Renner, \u201cPrompt Payment Act: An Interest(ing) Remedy for Government Late Payment,\u201d 21 Pub. Cont. L.J. 177 (1992). (2) Which government agencies are covered?", "To define the term \u201cagency,\u201d the Prompt Payment Act incorporates the definition in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551(1). 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(1). The APA broadly defines agency as \u201ceach authority of the Government of the United States, whether or not it is within or subject to review by another agency,\u201d but there are several exceptions, most notably the Congress, the courts of the United States, the governments of the territories or possessions of the United States, and the government of the District of Columbia. Further, the APA definition does not include the President. Franklin v. Massachusetts, 112 S. Ct. 2767, 2775 (1992).", "Thus, case law under the APA definition is directly relevant because an entity which is an agency for purposes of the APA is, by virtue of that fact, also an agency for purposes of the Prompt Payment Act. E.g., Ramer v. Saxbe, 522 F.2d 695 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (Bureau of Prisons); Buckeye Power, Inc. v. Environmental Protection Agency, 481 F.2d 162 (6th Cir. 1973) (EPA); Blackwell College of Business v. Attorney General, 454 F.2d 928 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (Immigration and Naturalization Service).", "Cases under the Freedom of Information Act also may be relevant, but must be applied with caution. Prior to 1974, FOIA simply used the APA definition, so pre-1974 cases are directly applicable. E.g., Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (agencies within the Executive Office of the President, as distinguished from the President himself, are within the APA definition). FOIA received its own definition of \u201cagency\u201d in 1974 (5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552(f)) which, as the court noted in Cotton v. Adams, 798 F. Supp. 22, 24 (D.D.C. 1992), was intended to expand upon the APA definition. Thus, an agency under FOIA is not necessarily an agency under APA/Prompt Payment Act, but an entity which is excluded under the FOIA definition would also be excluded under the APA/Prompt Payment Act definition. For example, the Library of Congress is not an agency under FOIA. Kissinger v. Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 145 (1980). Therefore, it is also not an agency under the APA definition. Ethnic Employees of the Library of Congress v. Boorstin, 751 F.2d 1405, 1416 n.15 (D.C. Cir. 1985).", "In addition, the Prompt Payment Act applies to the following:", "An entity being operated exclusively as an instrumentality of a federal agency to administer one or more programs of that agency, and identified as such by the agency head. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(1).", "The Tennessee Valley Authority, except that the TVA may issue its own implementing regulations. Id. \u00a7 3901(b).", "The United States Postal Service, except that the USPS may prescribe its own implementing procurement regulations, solicitation provisions, and contract clauses. Id. \u00a7 3901(c). This provision was added in the 1988 amendments and is not retroactive. See Brak-Hard Concrete Co., PSBCA No. 2762, 90-3 BCA \u00b6 23,067 (1990).", "An agency to which the Prompt Payment Act does not apply may nevertheless bind itself by contract to pay interest on a comparable basis. See, e.g., B-223857, February 27, 1987, in which GAO expressed the opinion that the Commodity Credit Corporation was clearly an \u201cagency\u201d under the Prompt Payment Act definition, but that, even if it were not, it would be bound by interest clauses it had included in meat purchase contracts. (The 1988 amendments, in what is now 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(h), specifically address certain Commodity Credit Corporation contracts.) (3) Who is entitled to receive interest?", "The Prompt Payment Act applies to payments made by a government agency to a \u201cbusiness concern.\u201d The term \u201cbusiness concern\u201d is defined in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(2) to include two elements. First is \u201ca person carrying on a trade or business.\u201d The term is not limited to any particular form of business entity (corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, etc.) as long as that entity is \u201ccarrying on a trade or business.\u201d E.g., 65 Comp. Gen. 842, 843 (1986).", "The second element of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(2) is \u201ca nonprofit entity operating as a contractor.\u201d This may include state and local governments, but not federal entities. OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 1.g. In an interagency agreement, however, a provision under which the ordering agency agrees to reimburse the performing agency for expenses incurred in the course of performance will, without further limitation, be construed as referring to ordinary business expenses, including Prompt Payment Act interest incurred by the performing agency. Thus, a federal agency dealing with a nonfederal business concern in the course of performing an interagency agreement is fully subject to the Prompt Payment Act vis-a-vis the business concern; which federal agency will ultimately bear the interest expense depends on the terms of the interagency agreement. 65 Comp. Gen. 795 (1986).", "A federal employee is not a \u201cbusiness concern\u201d for Prompt Payment Act purposes. B-231512, September 21, 1989; B-219526, May 25, 1988; B-224628, January 12, 1988. (4) To what transactions does the statute apply?", "The key to the Prompt Payment Act\u2019s applicability is the reference in the first sentence of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(a) to an agency \u201cacquiring property or service from a business concern.\u201d The Act applies to payments stemming from the acquisition of goods or services by the government. It does not apply when the government is providing goods or services. E.g., B-226231, October 23, 1987 (refund of overcharge).", "Next, the payment must arise under a contract. OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 2.a; New York Guardian Mortgagee Corp. v. United States, 916 F.2d 1558 (Fed. Cir. 1990); Consolidated Technologies, Inc., ASBCA No. 33560, 88-1 BCA \u00b6 20,470 (1987); B-217698, May 16, 1985. OMB defines \u201ccontract\u201d as \u201cany enforceable agreement, including rental and lease agreements, purchase orders, delivery orders (including obligations under Federal Supply Schedule contracts), requirements-type (open-ended) service contracts, and blanket purchase agreements,\u201d plus certain Commodity Credit Corporation agreements. OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 1.e. The statute mandates the inclusion of rental contracts (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(6)) and the Commodity Credit Corporation transactions (id. \u00a7 3902(h)).", "Combining these points, the black-letter rule is that the Prompt Payment Act applies when a covered agency is acquiring goods or services by contract from a business concern.", "Applying this standard, the Prompt Payment Act does not authorize interest on a quantum meruit payment (contract implied-in-law), even though the government ended up acquiring goods or services, because there is no legal contract. 70 Comp. Gen. 664, 666 67 (1991). Similarly, it does not include the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 statutory obligations under its home loan guarantee program (acquisition of property from lender upon borrower\u2019s default). New York Guardian Mortgagee Corp. v. United States, cited above. It does not apply to delayed payments under a grant. Rough Rock Community School Board, IBCA No. 3037, 93-2 BCA \u00b6 25,837 (1993). Nor does it authorize interest on an award of attorney\u2019s fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act, because the services were acquired by the opposing party, not the government. FDL Technologies, Inc. v. United States, 967 F.2d 1578 (Fed. Cir. 1992); D.E.W., Incorporated, ASBCA No. 42914, 92-1 BCA \u00b6 24,540 (1991).", "Unless prohibited by the contract, agencies are expected to make periodic (partial) payments to reflect partial delivery of goods or partial performance of services, and the Prompt Payment Act applies to these partial payments. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3903(a)(5); OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 4.o; FAR, 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.903.", "The Prompt Payment Act also applies to certain progress payments. For construction contracts, the statute mandates applicability to progress payments, \u201cincluding a monthly percentage-of-completion progress payment or milestone payments for completed phases, increments, or segments of any project\u201d which are approved as payable by the contracting agency. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3903(a)(6).", "For other than construction contracts, applicability depends on whether or not the progress payments amount to more than \u201ccontract financing payments.\u201d Under the implementing regulations, the Prompt Payment Act does not apply to the late payment of contract financing payments. OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 7.c(2); 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.907-2. Contract financing payments include advance payments, progress payments based on cost, progress payments based on a percentage or stage of completion (except, as noted above, for construction contracts), and interim payments on cost-type contracts. OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 1.f; 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.902. The exclusion of financing payments is a logical application of the statute. See, e.g., Northrop Worldwide Aircraft Services, Inc. v. Department of the Treasury, GSBCA Nos. 11162-TD, 11184-TD, 92-2 BCA \u00b6 24,765, at 123,561. Paying interest on an advance payment, for example, would be an unjustified windfall.", "For the most part, the Prompt Payment Act is concerned only with payments by the federal government to a prime contractor. There are two exceptions. First, a rather complicated provision of the Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3905, extends its protections to subcontractors at all tiers under federal construction contracts. The statute makes clear that a contractor\u2019s interest liability to a subcontractor under section 3905 is not an obligation of the United States and may not be reimbursed to the contractor. Id. \u00a7 3905(k).", "Second, a grantee under a federal grant may include \u201cinterest penalty\u201d provisions in its contracts for the acquisition of property or services from business concerns. However, federal grant funds may not be used to pay this interest, nor may expenditures of nonfederal funds by the grantee for interest penalties be counted as matching funds. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(g). A grantee\u2019s liability under section 3902(g), like a contractor\u2019s liability under section 3905, is not an obligation of the United States. (5) Public utilities Public utilities differ from most other providers of goods or services in one important respect. Most utilities are regulated by some state or local governmental authority, and have rate structures approved by the regulating body in the form of a published tariff. Federal agencies acquiring utility services may or may not do so under a formal contract. In cases where there is no formal contract, the agency acquires the services in much the same way an individual customer does\u2014the agency requests the services, the utility provides them and bills the agency periodically. Acceptance of the services with knowledge of the published rate schedule also constitutes a contract which, depending on the precise facts and circumstances, may be an express oral contract or a contract implied-in-fact. The distinction is immaterial to this discussion. The rate structure typically includes a late payment charge. As every reader of this page well knows, utilities tend not to give their customers an overabundance of time to pay their bills before the late payment charge kicks in.", "Even before the Prompt Payment Act, based essentially on the principle that the government can bind itself contractually to pay interest, the rule developed that the government was liable for late payment charges on overdue utility bills where the terms of the utility company\u2019s applicable published rate schedule so provided. B-189149, September 7, 1977; B-188616, May 12, 1977; B-184962, November 14, 1975; B-173725, September 16, 1971. As stated in B-173725, \u201csince the Government accepted this utility service with the understanding that its obligation for payment would be governed by the published rate schedule, it is also bound by the late payment clause contained within that schedule.\u201d", "The Prompt Payment Act does not explicitly address utilities. Nevertheless, GAO has noted that nothing in the statute or its legislative history provides a basis for removing utilities from the statute\u2019s coverage. 65 Comp. Gen. 842, 843 44 (1986). Since the Prompt Payment Act defers to specific terms in a contract, the statute and decisional rules are viewed as complementary rather than contradictory. 63 Comp. Gen. 517, 518 (1984).", "The rules for utility payments are as follows: If the utility services are being acquired under a formal contract, the agency must follow the interest/late payment charge terms specified in the contract. OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 2.b. If the contract is silent with respect to interest/late payment charges, or if there is no formal contract, and the utility has a published tariff, the agency must follow the interest/late payment charge provisions of the tariff. Id. This is so even though the payment period under the tariff may be (and often is) much shorter than what would be available under the Prompt Payment Act. 63 Comp. Gen. 517 (1984). If interest is payable under a tariff, it cannot also be claimed under the Prompt Payment Act; the utility cannot collect twice. Id. at 519. If the applicable tariff does not provide for interest/late payment charges and there is no governing clause of a formal contract, interest is payable on late payments in accordance with the Prompt Payment Act. 65 Comp. Gen. 842 (1986). If there is no formal contract and the utility is unregulated or otherwise not governed by an approved tariff, the government may nevertheless be bound by the company\u2019s customary late payment policy (rather than the Prompt Payment Act) if the relationship amounts to a contract implied-in-fact. 67 Comp. Gen. 24 (1987). In the cited decision, the utility\u2019s payment terms were printed on the back of each invoice and became part of the \u201ccontract.\u201d", "Although the decisions tend to use the terms \u201clate payment charge\u201d and \u201cinterest charge\u201d interchangeably, courts in some jurisdictions have held that a late payment charge by a utility is not really \u201cinterest\u201d but is a device to permit the utility to recoup its costs which are directly attributable to payment delays and thereby avoid indiscriminately charging all users for the delays of some. In two cases predating the Prompt Payment Act, GAO accepted this rationale and held that the government may be liable for late payment charges contained in a utility\u2019s published rate schedule under the general terms of a contract, even in the face of a specific contract clause prohibiting the payment of any \u201cpenalty or interest.\u201d B-194905, July 6, 1979; B-186494, July 22, 1976. The effect of the Prompt Payment Act on these cases, if any, has yet to be addressed.", "When an agency acquires a utility service such as electric power from another federal entity rather than a business concern, the Prompt Payment Act does not apply and the question of late payment charges depends on the \u201cvendor\u201d entity\u2019s authority under the governing legislation. For example, the Western Area Power Administration, part of the Department of Energy, may assess late payment fees incident to power supplied to other federal agencies under the Reclamation Project Act. 67 Comp. Gen. 426 (1988). See also 44 Comp. Gen. 683 (1965) (similar analysis for Tennessee Valley Authority). (6) Accrual of the interest penalty An agency acquiring goods or services from a business concern by contract becomes liable for interest under the Prompt Payment Act if it fails to pay \u201cfor each complete delivered item of property or service by the required payment date.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(a). To determine the \u201crequired payment date,\u201d the Prompt Payment Act first defers to the contract. A payment date specified in the contract controls, however strict or lenient it may be. If the contract does not establish a payment date, the statute fills the gap. The law specifies payment dates for a number of specialized situations such as Commodity Credit Corporation payments (\u00a7 3902(h)(2)); meat, fish, dairy products, and perishable agricultural commodities (\u00a7\u00a7 3903(a)(2) (4)); and construction contract progress payments (\u00a7 3903(a)(6)). For all other situations, the required payment date where not otherwise specified in the contract is \u201c30 days after a proper invoice for the amount due is received.\u201d Id. \u00a7 3903(a)(1).", "Thus, the first step is for the contractor to submit a \u201cproper invoice,\u201d defined as an invoice containing or accompanied by the information required by OMB Cir. No. A-125, the regulations of the contracting agency, and the contract. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(3). The required information is spelled out in OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 5.b, and FAR, 48 C.F.R \u00a7 32.905(e), and includes such things as the contractor\u2019s name and address, invoice date, and description and price of the goods delivered or services rendered.", "A contractor\u2019s \u201cinformal calculations\u201d are not a \u201cproper invoice.\u201d Radcliffe Construction Co., ASBCA Nos. 39252, 39253, 90-2 BCA \u00b6 22,651 (1990). Nor is an Economic Price Adjustment request. Onan Corp., ASBCA No. 41925, 93-1 BCA \u00b6 25,261 (1992). An invoice for change order work is not a \u201cproper invoice\u201d until the value of that work has been recognized in a contract modification. Columbia Engineering Corp., IBCA No. 2322, 98-2 BCA \u00b6 21,762 (1989); Ricway, Inc., ASBCA No. 30205, 86-1 BCA \u00b6 18,539 (1985).", "In determining when an invoice is \u201creceived,\u201d the law recognizes that the government is entitled to a reasonable interest-free period to inspect and either accept or reject the performance for which payment is being sought. Therefore, an invoice is considered \u201creceived\u201d for interest accrual purposes on the later of (1) the date it is actually received, or (2) the 7th day after delivery or the completion of performance, unless actual acceptance has already occurred or the contract specifies a longer acceptance period. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(4).", "It is important to emphasize that the 7-day limit is no more than part of the formula for determining interest accrual. It \u201cdoes not require the Government to pay for goods or services (including construction) that it has not had the opportunity to inspect and actually accept.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 784, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 16 (1988), reprinted in 1988 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 3036, 3044. It recognizes the need for government acceptance while simultaneously precluding excessive uncompensated payment delays.", "The contract should tell the contractor where to submit invoices\u2014that is, it should specify a \u201cdesignated billing office.\u201d An invoice is \u201cactually received\u201d for interest accrual purposes when it is received by this designated office. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(4)(A)(i); 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.907-1(a)(1). What counts is receipt or acceptance as provided in the statute, not when the contractor submitted the invoice. Rhondalyn Teel, AGBCA No. 91-224-1, 93-1 BCA \u00b6 25,265 (1992).", "Also, the agency should note the date of receipt on the invoice. If it fails to do so, the date of the invoice will be considered the date of receipt. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(4)(B).", "The next step is for the agency to review the invoice to determine whether it is a \u201cproper invoice.\u201d If it is not, the agency must return it within 7 days of receipt along with an explanation. Id. \u00a7 3903(a)(7). If the agency acts within the prescribed 7 days, notification time and response time do not count for interest purposes, and the corrected invoice is treated as the proper invoice. 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.907-1(b). If the agency delays its notification beyond seven days, the payment due date is adjusted by subtracting the number of days over seven. Id.; 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3903(a)(7)(C). The deferral of interest accrual pending invoice correction does not contemplate frivolous rejections. Tyger-Sayler, A Joint Venture, ASBCA Nos. 33922 et al., 91-2 BCA \u00b6 23,726 (1991) (interest payable from date of initial receipt where agency had rejected submission because of essentially harmless typographical errors).", "Summing up, then, you determine the required payment date by counting days after receipt of a proper invoice (original or corrected, as the case may be) by the designated billing office. If the government has not paid by the required payment date, interest will start to accrue on the following day. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(b). If the due date falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday on which federal offices are closed, the next business day is treated as the due date. OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 4.n; 68 Comp. Gen. 355 (1989).", "Interest under the Prompt Payment Act continues to accrue until (1) the delayed payment is made, (2) the business concern files a claim for the unpaid interest under the Contract Disputes Act, or (3) one year from the initial accrual of interest, whichever occurs first. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3902(b) and 3907(b)(1); OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7\u00a7 7.a(2) and (5); 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.907-1(e). The reason for this limitation is that Prompt Payment Act interest is not intended to serve as a substitute investment for the contractor. If the agency has dragged its heels for a full year, the contractor must at that time either initiate resolution through the Contract Disputes Act claims procedures or see the accrual of interest stop at that point.", "Interest does not accrue if there is a dispute between the agency and business concern over the amount of the payment or other issues concerning compliance with the contract. Rather, the contractor should pursue the dispute under the Contract Disputes Act. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3907(c); OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 7.c(1); 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.907-1(f).

United States, 20 Cl. Ct. 776 (1990). Also, a request by a certifying officer to GAO for a decision is regarded as an internal government matter and not a \u201cdispute\u201d for purposes of postponing interest accrual. 64 Comp. Gen. 835 (1985).", "If the dispute is over some minor matter, there is authority for the proposition that the government should pay the undisputed amount or incur Prompt Payment Act penalties for failing to do so. N & P Construction Co., VABCA Nos. 3283, 3286, 93-1 BCA \u00b6 25,251 (1992).", "It is important to know exactly what constitutes \u201cpayment\u201d for Prompt Payment Act purposes and when it is deemed to occur (a) to determine whether or not there has been a \u201cfailure to pay\u201d which will begin the accrual of interest, and (b) to know when to terminate the accrual of interest.", "The statute specifies that the date of payment is \u201cthe date a check for payment is dated or an electronic transfer is made.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(5). The reason for selecting this date was to make the law \u201cas easy to administer as possible.\u201d S. Rep. No. 302, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 11 (1981) (report of Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs on original Prompt Payment Act). Using the date of receipt by the payee would have created an administrative nightmare in that claims would have to be filed and processed in every case, often for very small amounts.", "Of course, when a check is dated and when it is mailed can be two very different things. OMB Circular A-125, \u00a7 4.n, addresses this by telling agencies to mail or transmit checks on the same day they are dated. (The FAR says \u201con or about\u201d the same day. 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.903.) Payment may be made up to 7 days prior to the required payment date. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3903(a)(8). However, OMB cautions that, in the interest of effective cash management, agencies should strive to release their payments \u201cso as to pay proper invoices as close as possible to the due date without exceeding it,\u201d and should experiment with the timing of release with this objective in mind.

News at 3059.", "The concern here is to minimize early payment which, just as late payment does, costs the government in a very real sense. This was a concern of the original legislation as well as the 1988 amendments, as noted in the report of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs on the original Prompt Payment Act. See S. Rep. No. 302, 97th Cong., 1st Sess. 4 (1981), referring to premature payment as another form of \u201csloppy cash management.\u201d GAO has also been critical. See GAO report, Prompt Payment Act: Agencies Have Not Fully Achieved Available Benefits, GAO/AFMD-86-69 (August 1986), at 25 26. In addition,  OMB Circular No. A-125, \u00a7 4.q, directs agencies to make payment consistent with the Treasury Financial Manual, which in turn states that payments should be \u201cneither early nor late.\u201d I TFM \u00a7 6-8040.20.", "Thus, payment is determined by the date on the check, at least in most cases, provided the check is mailed on or extremely close to that date. If all of this occurs on the required payment date, the agency has complied with the letter of the law and will not incur an interest penalty, although an agency should not make this its general practice as it is inconsistent with the intent of both the statute and the OMB regulations.", "Failure to pay generally means any action or inaction by the contracting agency which results in payment not being made by the due date. For example, Prompt Payment Act interest has been awarded on the refund of liquidated damages improperly withheld from an invoice request. Youngdale & Sons Construction Co. v. United States, 27 Fed. Cl. 516 (1993). The determination that the withholding was improper meant that the invoice should have been paid by its due date, and failure to do so violated the Prompt Payment Act.", "An interesting variation occurred in 64 Comp. Gen. 32 (1984). A contractor submitted a proper invoice to the Forest Service, which issued a check for payment in full well before the required payment date (in fact, 4 days after receipt of the invoice). The contractor apparently never received the check and asked Forest Service for a replacement. Forest Service notified the Treasury Department which, after a delay of several weeks, issued the replacement check. Since by now the required payment date had been exceeded, the contractor claimed interest. The Comptroller General found that the Prompt Payment Act did not require interest in that situation. The Forest Service had done everything it was required to do, and had done it promptly. While there may have been a delay in receipt of payment by the contractor, there had been no \u201cfailure to pay\u201d on the part of the contracting agency.", "Noting the penalty aspect of the Prompt Payment Act, the decision also pointed out that \u201chere is no indication that Congress intended to insure contractors against all eventualities, especially where there is no fault on the part of the contracting agency in effectuating the original payment.\u201d Id. at 34. A few years later, GAO explained that this language should not be pulled out of context to suggest that the Prompt Payment Act would never apply to delays beyond the contracting agency\u2019s control. B-223857, February 27, 1987 (Act applicable to delay in payment due to exhaustion of funding). The Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals distinguished 64 Comp. Gen. 32 in a 1993 case and awarded interest where a check was stolen by an employee of a courier service before being placed in the mail system. Sun Eagle Corp., ASBCA Nos. 45985, 45986, 94-1 BCA \u00b6 26,425 (1993). (8) Rate and computation The applicable interest rate under the Prompt Payment Act is the rate prescribed by 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 611 for the Contract Disputes Act. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(a). There is one significant difference in the method of application, however. Interest under the Prompt Payment Act is computed on a fixed-rate basis. The statute provides that \u201cinterest shall be computed at the rate . . . which is in effect at the time the agency accrues the obligation to pay a late payment interest penalty.\u201d Id. The implementing regulatory provisions are OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 1.d, and FAR, 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.907-1(d).", "Another significant difference is that, while Contract Disputes Act interest is simple interest, Prompt Payment Act interest is compounded monthly. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(e).", "An agency which fails to pay a required interest penalty may be subject to an additional penalty. If an agency\u2019s failure to pay interest required by the Prompt Payment Act continues for 10 days after the underlying payment is made, and if the business concern makes a written demand not later than 40 days after that payment date, the agency will owe an additional penalty based on a percentage of the basic interest penalty determined under the OMB regulations. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(c)(3); 48 C.F.R. \u00a7 32.907-1(g). \u201cA business concern shall be entitled to an interest penalty of $1.00 or more which is owed . . . under this section, and such penalty shall be paid without regard to whether the business concern has requested payment of such penalty.\u201d", "31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(c)(1).

Thus, the agency has the primary responsibility to keep track of its payments and to add interest where required. Payment should be accompanied by a notice which specifies how much of the payment represents interest and identifies the rate and accrual period upon which the agency based its computation. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(c)(2). OMB Circular A-125, \u00a7 6.a, reminds agencies of the common-sense point to also include the contract and invoice numbers.", "For interest amounts of under $1.00, GAO\u2019s position in other contexts has been to pay it only if specifically claimed. E.g., 58 Comp. Gen. 372, 375 (1979). Whether this should apply as well to the Prompt Payment Act or whether an agency can refuse to waste the money to process a claim for pennies has yet to be addressed, although we are sure it is just a matter of time until someone with nothing better to do raises the issue.", "Prompt Payment Act interest is to be absorbed by applicable program appropriations. The law emphasizes that it does not authorize additional appropriations for the penalties, which are to be paid \u201cout of amounts made available to carry out the program for which the penalty is incurred.\u201d 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(f). This includes amounts which an agency may be authorized by law to transfer to the program account from other accounts. H.R. Rep. No. 461, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 9 (1982), 1982 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 119. Thus, for example, the \u201cGeneral Expenses\u201d appropriation of the Army Corps of Engineers is not available to pay Prompt Payment Act penalties incurred by civil works projects which receive their own line-item appropriations. B-248150, August 17, 1993. Payments are chargeable to the fiscal year or years in which the interest liability accrued. See 63 Comp. Gen. 517, 519 (1984).", "The law also emphasizes that the temporary unavailability of funds does not affect the accrual of interest. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3902(d). See also B-223857, February 27, 1987 (temporary depletion of borrowing authority did not diminish obligation to pay interest on Commodity Credit Corporation contracts), the case which prompted section 3902(d).", "Even though Prompt Payment Act interest is cast in terms of a statutory entitlement, a contractor can waive its right to receive the interest. The waiver may be express, or it may be implied from conduct as long as the conduct shows a clear intent. 62 Comp. Gen. 673 (1983). There is a practical underpinning to this decision in that the government cannot force a contractor to accept the interest payment. The law might as well permit waiver because a contractor wishing for whatever reason to waive the interest is always free to take the payment and give it right back to the government. Id. at 674.", "Although interest payments are supposed to be automatic, they often have not been. See H.R. Rep. No. 784, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 18 (1988), 1988 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News at 3046. Accordingly, the law provides a collection mechanism by authorizing the contractor to file a claim for unpaid Prompt Payment Act interest under the Contract Disputes Act. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3907(a). This means a written claim submitted to the contracting officer, whose decision may be appealed to the appropriate board of contract appeals or directly to court. The Contract Disputes Act procedures are a \u201cjurisdictional prerequisite to adjudicating a claim\u201d under the Prompt Payment Act. CPT Corp. v. United States, 25 Cl. Ct. 451, 456 (1992). While GAO has addressed a number of Prompt Payment Act issues, it will not, in view of this explicit statutory procedure, adjudicate or review individual Prompt Payment Act claims. B-213383, November 7, 1983; B-212103, September 22, 1983.", "As noted earlier, Prompt Payment Act interest ceases to accrue upon filing the Contract Disputes Act claim or after one year, whichever is sooner. If the claim is allowed, interest on it is payable under the Contract Disputes Act. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3907(b)(2). Thus, as long as the CDA claim is filed within one year, there is no gap in interest accrual. An award illustrating these principles is Batteast Construction Co., ASBCA No. 34420, 87-3 BCA \u00b6 20,044 (1987). The computational aspects can be summarized in the following steps: If the government fails to pay for goods or services acquired by contract by the required payment date, interest at the Contract Disputes Act rate begins to accrue on the following day. Interest is applied on a fixed-rate basis, and is compounded monthly. Interest is payable until the underlying payment is made, the claimant files a claim under the CDA, or one year elapses, whichever is sooner. If the claimant files a CDA claim, the amount of unpaid interest, \u201cfrozen\u201d as of that point, becomes part of the claim along with any unpaid principal. CDA interest will then accrue on the amount of the claim in accordance with 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 611, on a variable-rate basis but not compounded. \u201cThe head of an agency offered a discount by a business concern from an amount due under a contract for property or service in exchange for payment within a specified time may pay the discounted amount only if payment is made within the specified time. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the specified time shall be determined from the date of the invoice. The head of the agency shall pay an interest penalty on an amount remaining unpaid in violation of this section. The penalty accrues as provided under sections 3902 and 3903 of this title, except that the required payment date for the unpaid amount is the last day specified in the contract that the discounted amount may be paid.\u201d", "The implementing regulations are OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7\u00a7 4.i and 4.m; FAR, 48 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 32.905(g) and 52.232-8 (contract clause); and the Treasury Financial Manual, I TFM \u00a7 6-8040.30.", "Section 3904 does several things. First, it codifies the obvious point that an agency is not authorized to take a prompt payment discount beyond the terms under which it is offered. This is nothing new. See, e.g., 6 Comp. Gen. 545 (1927); B-130542, February 15, 1957 (circular letter discouraging the taking of unearned discounts).", "Second, it establishes the rule that the period for taking the discount begins on the date of the invoice. This sentence was added to the Prompt Payment Act as part of the 1988 amendments. Prior to 1988, the rule had been that the period starts when the designated government office receives a correct or proper invoice. E.g., B-169682(2), February 2, 1971. While it is clear that the pertinent date is now the date of the invoice rather than the date of receipt, it is certainly reasonable to continue to interpret \u201cinvoice\u201d as meaning \u201cproper invoice,\u201d as OMB and the Treasury Department have done. OMB Cir. No. A-125, \u00a7 4.i; I TFM \u00a7 6-8040.30. Both specify that the discount period \u201cis calculated from the date placed on the proper invoice by the contractor.\u201d", "If there is no date on the invoice, the prior rule continues to apply and the discount period will start on the date the designated billing office receives a proper invoice and (on the same day) annotates it with the date of receipt. Id.", "Third, it establishes the date of the government\u2019s check as the date of payment, the same as for the rest of the Prompt Payment Act. Section 3904 does not say this directly, but since it is part of the Prompt Payment Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3901(a)(5) applies to it as well. Thus, the determination of \u201cpayment\u201d in the context of late payments, previously discussed, applies equally to prompt payment discounts.", "Finally, it requires the government to pay interest if it improperly takes a prompt payment discount. The required payment date is the last day specified for taking the discount. As with late payments in general, if this day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday on which federal offices are closed, the next business day becomes the due date. 68 Comp. Gen. 355 (1989).

For the most part, the traditional answer was a simple application of the no-interest rule\u2014there was no authority for it. Starting in 1987, two pieces of legislation have interrupted the unbroken line of disallowances, and the answer now is more of a \u201cmixed bag.\u201d", "First is the Back Pay Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596. Prior to 1987, claims for interest under the Back Pay Act were consistently denied for the simple reason that neither the Back Pay Act nor any other statute provided for interest. E.g., 63 Comp. Gen. 170 (1984); 63 Comp. Gen. 156 (1984); 61 Comp. Gen. 578 (1982). The law was amended in 1987 to require the payment of interest on back pay payable under section 5596. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596(b)(2). Implementing regulations by the Office of Personnel Management are found at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.806.", "Interest is payable from the effective date of the withdrawal or reduction of pay to a date not more than 30 days prior to the date of payment, at the rate for tax overpayments determined under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6621(a)(1), and is compounded daily. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596(b)(2)(B). The accrual date will usually represent one or more pay dates on which the claimant would have received the pay or allowances in question. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.806(a). Subject to the 30-day limitation, agencies have discretion to fix the termination date. 70 Comp. Gen. 711, 713 (1991).", "Under this authority, interest is payable on awards, administrative or judicial, made under the Back Pay Act and OPM regulations. For example, the delayed payment of an incentive award normally does not create an entitlement to interest. B-202039, May 7, 1982. However, failure to pay an incentive award by a deadline established in a collective bargaining agreement does trigger the interest provision of the Back Pay Act. 70 Comp. Gen. 711 (1991). Other examples are 70 Comp. Gen. 560 (1991) (award of overtime compensation by grievance arbitrator);B-242277, September 12, 1991 (refund of amounts erroneously withheld from salary and credited to retirement fund).", "For interest to be payable under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596(b)(2), the underlying award must be made under the authority of the Back Pay Act, not some other statute. E.g., Markey v. United States, 27 Fed. Cl. 615 (1993) (interest not authorized on back pay award under Rehabilitation Act). Similarly, travel and transportation expenses have not been regarded as \u201callowances\u201d for Back Pay Act purposes. Hurley v. United States, 624 F.2d 93 (10th Cir. 1980); Morris v. United States, 595 F.2d 591 (Ct. Cl. 1979). As long as this interpretation stands, delayed reimbursement of these expenses would not trigger interest under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5596(b)(2).

For awards payable from agency appropriations, interest is chargeable to the same fiscal year or years as the underlying back pay to which it relates, and in the same proportions. 69 Comp. Gen. 40 (1989); B-242277, September 12, 1991.", "The second relevant piece of legislation is Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As with the Back Pay Act, there was no authority for the payment of interest on monetary awards under Title VII prior to 1987. E.g., 58 Comp. Gen. 5 (1978); B-207176, January 6, 1983. Responding to the suggestion that Title VII might ride the coattails of the 1987 amendment to the Back Pay Act, the Justice Department determined that the 1987 amendment did not apply to Title VII awards.

The effect of this was to leave the contractor to his remedy in the courts which would have the power to try the issue of fraud and declare a forfeiture if appropriate. Cf. B-154628, May 31, 1966. Although 44 Comp.

The most common form of relief legislation has been a simple direction to pay a sum of money to a named individual or other entity. Since the device may be used for debt claims as well as payment claims, another form is a bill relieving someone of indebtedness to the government. A third form permits someone to have a claim adjudicated by removing a jurisdictional bar or waiving some other legal defense. The latter type is discussed in United States v.

By its terms it applies only in cases not payable under existing appropriations; it does not apply to claims which, if otherwise allowable, could be paid from existing appropriations. For example, in B-155149, October 21, 1964, the Comptroller General advised that the Meritorious Claims Act was not the appropriate vehicle to consider the claim of an accountable officer who had restored a loss of public funds from personal funds and was later found to be free from fault or negligence. Upon the granting of relief under the pertinent accountable officer relief statute, the officer could be reimbursed from agency operating appropriations.

Of course this means all claims except those for which settlement authority has been expressly granted to some other agency. Numerous decisions state this position, and several of the earlier cases (e.g., B-121302, October 6, 1954) point out that it is supported by the Act\u2019s legislative history. The rationale here is that the Act should not be construed to permit GAO to circumvent a determination that has been expressly committed by statute to another agency. \u201ccould consider with a view of making an allowance thereon but for the lack of any authority in previously enacted statutory law, or appropriation made in pursuance of law authorizing the payment of such claims.\u201d", "A-18647, October 25, 1928.

The third condition introduces the element of discretion.", "One commenter noted in 1966 that the Meritorious Claims Act \u201cwas rarely used until recently.\u201d Note, Private Bills in Congress, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 1684, 1688 (1966). While the source of this may have been interviews with GAO employees (Id. at 1684, note), in fact the opposite is true. The Act was used quite often in its early years\u201417 claims were submitted to Congress in 1928, 16 in 1929, and 20 in 1930. Usage dropped sharply and there were few submissions in the 1940s and 1950s. Usage increased somewhat since then, but the decades since the 1950s have seen on the average only a very few claims submitted each year (for example, 22 for the period 1977 1987). Perhaps the major reason for this overall decline is that the statutory framework for the settlement and payment of claims against the government is vastly more sophisticated than it was in 1928. The trend in favor of the government\u2019s waiver of its sovereign immunity was still in its infancy in 1928 and there are now many more types of claims for which administrative or judicial recourse is available.", "In any event, GAO has not considered it appropriate to flood the Congress with Meritorious Claims Act recommendations, and it may certainly be said that GAO has used the Act sparingly. Perhaps in part because of this, most of the Comptroller General\u2019s recommendations under the Act have been enacted. Thus, of the 53 claims reported in 1928 through 1930, 51 were enacted. Out of 31 submitted between 1948 and 1976, 28 were enacted.", "GAO views the Meritorious Claims Act as \u201can extraordinary  limited to extraordinary circumstances.\u201d E.g., 53 Comp.

As demonstrated by B-155149, October 21, 1964, summarized above, the subsequent enactment of the accountable officer relief statutes reinforces this conclusion.", "Also, read literally, the Act applies only to claims against the United States and not to claims by the United States. A-5249, June 18, 1928. Thus, the Act would not be available in general debt cases, especially since the Federal Claims Collection Act provides standards for compromise and termination. However, it has been applied in cases involving overpayments to government employees where termination of collection action was viewed as inapplicable. These have generally been cases involving \u201cmixed\u201d claims, that is, claims including both the cancellation of remaining indebtedness and the refunding of amounts already repaid (B-177097, January 19, 1973; B-160178, January 27, 1969; B-165384, November 13, 1968), although some more recent cases involve only the cancellation of indebtedness (B-195167, February 21, 1980, an \u201cerroneous advice\u201d case). Also, these are cases either (a) which at the time were not covered by applicable waiver statutes (B-195167 and B-186218), or (b) for which waiver would not provide adequate relief (B-160178). In any event, the nonapplicability of the Act to debt cases is no longer rigidly followed.", "Some of the earlier documents suggest that a Meritorious Claims Act request may be considered only if submitted directly by the claimant. However, the statute does not require this, and as a practical matter it is necessary only if the statute of limitations is likely to be a problem. Thus, GAO will consider a request submitted by the cognizant agency or a Member of Congress. In addition, GAO will self-initiate a report in appropriate circumstances. \u201cThe propriety of affording relief under the  is a matter of discretion to be exercised according to the circumstances of each particular case. However, this discretion is not an arbitrary one, but is required to be exercised in accordance with fixed principles and precedents.\u201d", "There are no formal standards for judging if a specific claim is one which GAO is likely to endorse under the Act. Rather, each claim is considered on its own merit and in light of available precedent to determine if it contains the necessary elements of legal liability or equity. B-137604, February 13, 1959.", "It must be emphasized that there have been literally hundreds of requests for relief under the Meritorious Claims Act. Many of the older cases have become obsolete by virtue of changes in legislation. Many others are simply not susceptible of generalization. With this in mind, the remainder of this section attempts to draw some guidelines for the presentation and consideration of these claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "b. Categories of Claims Generally Not Reported", "paragraphs": ["(1) Statute of limitations A claim which is time-barred, either by the Barring Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(b)) or by some other more specific statutory or regulatory limitation, will not be submitted under the Meritorious Claims Act.", "When the Meritorious Claims Act was enacted in 1928, there was no general statute of limitations applicable to the administrative adjudication of claims within GAO\u2019s settlement jurisdiction. The Barring Act, as originally enacted in 1940, applied expressly to the Meritorious Claims Act as well as to GAO\u2019s general claims settlement statute. Prior to the 1982 recodification of Title 31, the identical barring provision was carried in both locations. The recodification eliminated the duplication by adding the language \u201ctimely presented under this section\u201d to the Meritorious Claims Act. Therefore, the \u201ctimely presented\u201d language of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(d) clearly incorporates the limitation and tolling provisions of section 3702(b). Thus, if a claim is not filed within 6 years after it accrues (or longer for certain wartime claims or if the period is extended by the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief Act of 1940), GAO is precluded as a matter of law from submitting it under the Meritorious Claims Act, regardless of the equities.", "For example, B-153568, March 16, 1964, involved the claim of a veteran for the redemption of certain military payment certificates he had received during his service in World War II. The claim was not filed until 1964. Because the claim was not filed within the period prescribed by the Barring Act nor within 5 years after the establishment of peace, the Comptroller General had no authority to report the claim to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act. Similarly, there was no authority to invoke the Act on behalf of a contractor who filed a claim in 1981 for sums withheld by a contracting officer in 1971. B-208290, September 7, 1982. In both cases, any considerations of equity had become irrelevant. There are numerous other decisions illustrating the effect of the Barring Act on GAO\u2019s authority under the Meritorious Claims Act. See, e.g., B-189816, August 29, 1977; B-171732, March 24, 1971; B-106890, August 11, 1970; B-150129, November 15, 1962; B-144246, November 10, 1960.", "A claim may be presented which is still within the period of the Barring Act, but which is barred by some other more specific limitation period provided by statute or regulation. Early decisions established the proposition that a claim which is time-barred by any statutory or regulatory limitation period will not be reported to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act. As stated in 14 Comp. Gen. 324 (1934), the Act \u201cwas not intended for employment as a means to revive claims barred by a statutory or regulatory limitation.\u201d See also A-74206, August 4, 1936; A-44115, December 12, 1932. \u201cIt is a principle of long standing, governing the exercise of equitable jurisdiction, that when there is a complete and adequate remedy at law, and the party aggrieved fails to take advantage of such remedy, such party will not be permitted to assert it in equity unless he was prevented by fraud or mistake or by circumstances beyond his control. [Citation omitted.] Where an adequate remedy at law has been lost through either positive negligence or mere failure to seek it at the proper time, equity will not interpose to grant relief.\u201d", "These early decisions predated the Barring Act\u2014that is, the limitation period involved in the pre-1940 cases was the only available time limitation. However, since a specific provision governs over a more general one, the principle continues to be applicable and has been followed after the enactment of the Barring Act. For example, GAO denied Meritorious Claims Act relief to a claimant seeking a customs refund who had failed to pursue available administrative remedies within the time periods prescribed by the customs laws (B-115724, August 7, 1953), and to a person who missed the time limit on claiming statutory relocation benefits with respect to land acquired by the Interior Department (B-172189, September 22, 1972). Other post-Barring Act cases involving various shorter limitation periods are B-230421, December 22, 1988; B-126162, March 16, 1956; B-124678, August 31, 1955; and B-40645, April 21, 1944. (2) Tort claims GAO does not view the Meritorious Claims Act as applicable to tort claims. This result follows from the application of two somewhat related principles, not always stated in the decisions. First, the Meritorious Claims Act applies only to claims which are within GAO\u2019s settlement jurisdiction, and second, where Congress has enacted legislation providing relief for a certain type of claim, it must be presumed that Congress intended for that legislation to prescribe the limits of available relief.", "The first wave of cases involved mostly allegations of negligence by some government employee and arose before the 1946 enactment of the Federal Tort Claims Act, at a time when only limited relief was available under the Small Claims Act and a few other miscellaneous statutory provisions. Although the equities clearly favored the claimant in most cases, GAO consistently refused to submit Meritorious Claims Act recommendations. E.g., 16 Comp. Gen. 642 (1937); 15 Comp. Gen. 1114 (1936); 14 Comp. Gen. 429 (1934); 13 Comp. Gen. 406 (1934); 10 Comp. Gen. 175 (1930). An additional factor mentioned in some of the cases was that numerous tort claim bills had been introduced in Congress but had never passed, presumably indicating the congressional attitude towards them. 16 Comp. Gen. at 643.", "The expanded relief available under the Federal Tort Claims Act has greatly reduced the number of Meritorious Claims Act requests arising from tort claims. If anything, the comprehensive nature of the Federal Tort Claims Act makes the rationale of GAO\u2019s pre-1946 Meritorious Claims Act cases even stronger, and GAO has reiterated that position in a number of post-FTCA cases. For example, the Comptroller General declined to invoke the Meritorious Claims Act on behalf of an individual who alleged that his truck had been damaged by government negligence (B-204766, March 2, 1982); and a claimant who sought reimbursement for the loss of a rutabaga crop which was destroyed by the application of a pesticide recommended by a Department of Agriculture official (B-160780, February 8, 1967). See also B-147909, January 22, 1962; B-141810, February 10, 1960; B-120853, October 4, 1954.", "The rationale applies equally to claims under the various FTCA exemptions in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680. The concept that the FTCA prescribes the limits of available relief is just as true for the exemptions as for the allowable claims. Thus, GAO has declined to report tort claims arising in foreign countries, regardless of the availability of some other avenue of administrative relief. E.g., B-120691, July 28, 1954 (possible relief under Foreign Claims Act).", "In a related group of cases, the Comptroller General has declined to proceed under the Meritorious Claims Act on behalf of government employees who paid tort claims from personal funds. 34 Comp. Gen. 490 (1955) (employee sued in individual capacity claimed amount paid in out-of-court settlement plus attorney\u2019s fees incurred in defending suit); B-145191, April 7, 1961 (employee paid damages to avoid being sued). These cases were based in part on the traditional nonapplicability of the Meritorious Claims Act to tort claims and in part on the absence of government liability where the employee is sued in his individual capacity. Another case in this group, B-152070, October 3, 1963, offered another reason\u2014the employee\u2019s negligence \u201cnegates any element of equity in the claim.\u201d Since the Federal Tort Claims Act is now the exclusive remedy for scope-of-employment torts and the option of suing the negligent employee individually no longer exists, these cases should presumably no longer arise.", "Relief was recommended in a 1957 case in a claim resulting from the wrongdoing of a government employee. The Western Union Telegraph Company had installed equipment on an Army installation and by agreement permitted the equipment to be used for unofficial messages by military personnel. Army personnel collected the charges for the Company\u2019s credit. An Army employee embezzled several thousand dollars of these receipts. The employee was prosecuted but recoupment was not possible. Since there was no way to pay the Company\u2019s claim from appropriated funds, the Comptroller General reported it to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act, stating that \u201cthe Government\u2019s responsibility for the funds attached immediately upon their receipt, and is not merely that of an employer for an employee\u2019s tort.\u201d B-131464, September 4, 1957.", "There is an additional reason why it would be inappropriate for GAO to use the Meritorious Claims Act on behalf of a claimant whose claim is cognizable under the Federal Tort Claims Act. A statute enacted in 1946 along with the Federal Tort Claims Act provides that no private bill authorizing or directing \u201cthe payment of money for property damages, for personal injuries or death for which suit may be instituted under the Federal Tort Claims Act . . . shall be received or considered\u201d in the Congress. 2 U.S.C. \u00a7 190g. The statute also applies to private bills for a pension, the construction of a bridge across a navigable stream, and the correction of military or naval records. Section 190g has been repealed insofar as it relates to the Senate (S. Res. 274, 96th Congress, November 14, 1979), but now appears as Rule XIV, para. 10, Standing Rules of the Senate. It remains in statutory force for the House of Representatives. Thus, it would be inappropriate for GAO to recommend private relief legislation of a type that both Houses of Congress have clearly said they do not want to receive. See B-180597, May 10, 1974; B-162545, October 10, 1967. (3) Res judicata The Meritorious Claims Act is targeted at claims for which existing law does not make provision. It was not designed to give a second shot to claimants who have already adjudicated their claims and lost. Thus, a claim which has been unsuccessfully pursued in court will not be submitted under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(d). A-55736, June 25, 1934 (no basis for GAO to \u201cin effect, reverse the orders and judgments of courts\u201d by applying Meritorious Claims Act); A-28480, September 19, 1929. The same result would apply to a claimant who won in court but later comes back for more money. B-215494, September 4, 1984.", "While there is certainly some logic to this position, it does not justify an unyielding application in that a judicial determination of no legal liability does not preclude the existence of strong equities. The preferable approach is to look at the merits and there has in fact been at least one exception, B-145318, December 16, 1969, in which GAO supported relief for a contractor who had lost in the Court of Claims.", "As discussed earlier in this chapter, interest is not recoverable on claims against the United States unless expressly authorized in the relevant statute or contract. Where interest is not otherwise authorized, a claim for interest will not be submitted under the Meritorious Claims Act. A-28455, March 1, 1930; A-27042, September 10, 1929; A-22423, February 1, 1929; A-14295, September 10, 1928. At the time of the cited decisions, there were few situations in which interest was recoverable against the government. The rationale now for GAO\u2019s position would be somewhat different and perhaps even stronger. As evidenced by laws such as the Contract Disputes Act, the Back Pay Act, and the Internal Revenue Code, Congress has made a conscious decision as to the types of claims which bear interest and, for the most part, the applicable rate and method of computation. (5) Voluntary creditors Another topic previously covered in this chapter is the so-called voluntary creditor. The rule is that one who attempts to make him(her)self a \u201cvoluntary creditor\u201d of the United States by making a payment of a government obligation from personal funds may not be reimbursed, although a considerably body of exceptions has evolved. The claim of a voluntary creditor which cannot be paid under the principles previously discussed will not be reported to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act. B-157057(2), July 12, 1965; B-127799, August 24, 1956; B-87319, May 16, 1950.", "One reason for this, although not stated in the decisions, is that a voluntary creditor claim is not a claim which could be allowed but for the lack of an available appropriation. If the claim were otherwise allowable, existing appropriations would be available for its payment. Also, while this was not true at the time of the cases cited above, existing precedent should be adequate to pay most voluntary creditor claims with compelling equities. (6) Personal expenses GAO will not recommend relief under the Meritorious Claims Act to reimburse a claimant for expenditures which are essentially personal in nature and for which there is no basis for government liability. E.g., B-147628, December 28, 1961 (occupancy tax levied on military member by French municipality). Cases under this heading have most commonly involved attorney\u2019s fees in situations where government payment was not authorized. B-185734, June 14, 1977; B-185612, August 12, 1976; B-136707, December 14, 1962. The answer was \u201cno\u201d in all three cases.", "A claim for attorney\u2019s fees was submitted under the Meritorious Claims Act in B-181660, September 30, 1974. The claimant, a General Services Administration employee, had separated a GSA supervisor and another GSA employee who were fighting and, as a result, was named a co-defendant in a civil suit brought by the employee. When GSA denied the claimant\u2019s request for government representation, he retained private counsel. Claimant renewed his request for representation and this time GSA referred it to the local United States Attorney who provided the necessary legal representation. GAO felt that the claim for the cost of retaining private counsel prior to being represented by the U.S. Attorney had sufficient equity to merit congressional consideration. (7) Cost or eligibility limitations A statute or regulation may impose various limitations and the party affected is charged with knowledge of these restrictions. A cost limitation may be a ceiling on the amount of funds that can be spent on a project or may be a limit on the amount payable on a certain type of claim, for example, the $40,000 limit in the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees\u2019 Claims Act of 1964. An eligibility limitation for purposes of this discussion refers to a time limit on some entitlement, for example, an allowance payable for a specified number of days.", "As a general proposition, a claim for an amount in excess of a cost or eligibility limitation set by statute or valid regulation will not be reported to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act. Illustrations are the time limitations on storage of household goods (B-210170, July 6, 1983; B-201277, February 20, 1981; B-98615, November 2, 1950); the weight limitations on shipment of household goods (B-210113, March 2, 1983; B-134650, May 14, 1959); and the time limitation on incurring expenses incident to a permanent change of station (B-232057, February 9, 1989). See also B-147496-O.M., January 4, 1962 (monetary cap on reward for return of military deserter); B-142433-O.M., May 4, 1960 (time limit on temporary lodging allowance).", "Another relevant limitation is the cost limitation in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2805 on \u201cminor construction\u201d projects for the military departments. In B-147086, September 20, 1961, GAO found it inappropriate to report to Congress a contractor\u2019s claim in an amount which would have caused the minor construction limitation to be exceeded. However, a claim for an amount in excess of the minor construction limitation was reported in B-154061, February 15, 1965. In that case, the contractor (claimant) was only one of several on the project and had no way of knowing that the limit might be exceeded. Therefore, adherence to the cost limitation was not a matter within the contractor\u2019s control.", "The Comptroller General also recommended relief in B-145318, December 16, 1969. A construction contractor on a housing project offered to perform certain additional work and the contracting officer accepted.", "However, a change order could not be issued because the maximum insurable mortgage amount was subsequently obligated for other work on the project. Relief was deemed appropriate because the contractor had acted in good faith, the government retained the benefit of the work, and the work could have been paid for at the time the additional cost was agreed to without exceeding the statutory limitation. (8) Contributing fault by claimant Older court decisions on equity jurisdiction frequently state that a party seeking equitable relief must have \u201cclean hands.\u201d Although not in those terms, the Comptroller General applies this concept in considering requests for relief under the Meritorious Claims Act. Simply stated, GAO does not view the Meritorious Claims Act as an appropriate means to rescue someone who has contributed to his or her own predicament.", "In A-27639, February 25, 1930, a civilian clerk at an Army installation prepared fraudulent vouchers and had checks drawn to fictitious payees. He then indorsed the names of the fictitious payees and cashed the checks. The crook was caught and put in jail. The government recovered its money from the bank to which Treasury had paid the proceeds, with the loss ultimately falling on the bank which had cashed the checks. GAO denied the bank\u2019s request for Meritorious Claims Act relief because the bank, as required by negotiable instruments law, had guaranteed all prior endorsements. \u201cAs between the bank and the Government, it would seem that the bank should bear the loss.\u201d Id.", "The following cases in which Meritorious Claims Act relief was denied will further illustrate:", "B-186000, September 22, 1976: Claim by Air Force officer for tuition payments to a foreign university. Even after counseling, claimant did not follow applicable regulations for having payments approved.", "B-177437, March 9, 1973: Claim for lost equity in real property sold at foreclosure sale as result of nonpayment of mortgage. Claimant alleged that default resulted from Army\u2019s erroneous discontinuance of his allotment. Army records revealed that claimant had signed a form requesting discontinuance of the allotment.", "B-165901, January 28, 1969: Air Force member shipped household goods knowing that applicable regulations did not authorize shipment at government expense in his particular situation.", "B-154149, June 5, 1964: Government employee induced claimant\u2019s husband to endorse benefit check and leave it with him for later delivery. Employee then cashed the check and pocketed the proceeds. Claimant argued that the dishonest employee had obtained the check under false pretenses, which was obviously true, but claimant had been present when her husband turned over the check and had acquiesced in the transaction.", "8 Comp. Gen. 239, 243 (1928): Lapse of insurance because of nonpayment of premiums by claimant.", "The claimant\u2019s own negligence was also one of the grounds for denying relief in some of the previously discussed cases involving the payment of tort claims from personal funds. E.g., B-152070, October 3, 1963. (9) Statutory prohibition It should come as no surprise that claims for items expressly prohibited (as opposed to merely not authorized) by statute or regulation are generally not reported to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act. The premise is that one who works for or deals with the government must be charged with knowledge of pertinent restrictions.", "An example is 32 Comp. Gen. 337 (1953). Under Interior Department regulations then in existence, a qualified person could request that certain public lands be sold at auction. If the request was approved, the applicant was required to publish notice of the sale at his own expense. The regulations expressly provided that the lands could be withdrawn from sale even after publication of the notice and that such withdrawal would create no liability on the part of the United States. GAO advised that the Department could amend its regulations to permit reimbursement of the notice expenses in withdrawal cases. Absent such an amendment, however, the claimant must be held to have assumed the risk that the lands might be withdrawn. Since the claimant must be charged with notice of the regulations, neither legal nor equitable basis would exist to justify a Meritorious Claims Act recommendation. See also 17 Comp. Gen. 720 (1938).", "The statutory prohibition rule is not an absolute. Exceptions have been recognized where the equities are particularly strong and especially where the government has received clear benefit from work or services performed. See, for example, the published advertisement cases discussed later in this section. See also B-154061, February 15, 1965, discussed above under \u201ccost or eligibility limitations.\u201d The statutory prohibition rule, therefore, presents a strong presumption against Meritorious Claims Act relief but can be overcome by sufficiently strong equities. (10) Availability of other administrative settlement procedures As a general proposition, the Comptroller General will not report to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act claims for which other administrative settlement procedures are available by law, particularly where those procedures produce determinations which are \u201cfinal and conclusive.\u201d For the most part, this is merely an application of the previously noted principle that GAO views the Act as applicable only to claims within its settlement jurisdiction. Also, the existence of another administrative settlement procedure suggests that appropriations are available to pay the claim if otherwise allowable and that, therefore, the claim is not one which could be allowed but for the lack of an available appropriation. The most frequently recurring cases in this category have been tort claims, treated separately earlier. \u201cnsofar as the claim might be considered a claim against the United States under the Contract of Guaranty . . . Congress has specifically conferred jurisdiction to make final settlements of claims arising under such guaranty operations upon the President, and pursuant to delegations of authority that jurisdiction has been vested in the Agency for International Development.\u201d", "This principle has also been applied in the following contexts:", "Claims cognizable under the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees\u2019 Claims Act of 1964, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3721, and its predecessors.

However, it is also used as independent grounds for denial in many cases which do not fall within any of the other categories. See, e.g., B-197982, February 26, 1981; B-171483, March 19, 1971; B-165886, March 24, 1969. B-171483 illustrates a fairly common situation, a loss incurred by a government employee incident to a permanent change-of-station assignment which was subsequently canceled.", "A 1975 case involved claims by several employees of a government contractor for reimbursement for loss and damage to personal property resulting from a fire in government-owned quarters on a United States island possession in the Pacific. Contractor employees are not covered by the Military Personnel and Civilian Employees\u2019 Claims Act of 1964, and relief was unavailable under the Federal Tort Claims Act because there was no evidence of negligence by government personnel. Based on a straight application of the preferential treatment concept, GAO declined to invoke the Meritorious Claims Act. B-183208, June 30, 1975.", "It is important to note that the denial of a claim under the Meritorious Claims Act because it reflects a common or recurring situation refers to the nature of the claim and not to the particular fact pattern. Two cases in which Meritorious Claims Act requests were denied will illustrate. In both cases the fact patterns were certainly unusual but the nature of the claim was viewed as not particularly unusual and therefore within the preferential treatment rule.", "In B-201284, April 21, 1981, the claimant corporation had expended a substantial sum to develop an exhibition of works from the Hermitage Museum of Leningrad. The exhibit was scheduled to tour the United States as part of a government-sanctioned effort to promote trade and cultural relations with the USSR. However, when the administration declined to issue a certification necessary to protect the art objects from judicial process in this country, the exhibition was canceled. Alleging unique circumstances, the claimant requested reimbursement of its costs. \u201cany individuals and businesses were affected to their detriment in this particular shift of policy. It is also true that we can expect that others may in the future suffer from changes in United States Government relations with foreign governments. Economic damages may well be wide spread when significant deterioration occurs in the relations between governments. We have specifically declined to recommend relief to the Congress under similar circumstances. See 53 Comp. Gen. 157 (1973). To recommend relief for some parties and not others would be unfair.\u201d", "In B-199071, July 16, 1980, the claims of two U.S. servicemen who participated in a failed mission to rescue American hostages held in Iran were considered for possible submission under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702(d). Both men had accrued annual leave in excess of 60 days, by statute the reimbursable maximum. One of the soldiers was killed during the raid and the other received serious injuries resulting in his retirement. Despite the unusual factual circumstances, the claims for reimbursement for accrued annual leave in excess of the 60-day limit were not submitted under the Meritorious Claims Act because forfeitures of excess annual leave are not uncommon.", "From a philosophical perspective, the preferential treatment rule is discomforting in that it amounts to saying, \u201cWe aren\u2019t going to help you because the government has done the same thing to others.\u201d Therefore, it should be applied with scrutiny and should not be taken to extremes. On the one hand, anything that happens once may happen again and this alone should not be enough to eliminate a case from consideration. Yet on the other hand, the failure of Congress to deal in more general terms with a demonstrably recurring situation may indicate a congressional view that the situation should not be compensable from public funds. At the very least it suggests that remedial legislation might be desirable as an alternative to the piecemeal approach of individual relief bills. Also, there are situations where the preferential treatment rule is subordinated by compelling equities, such as the published advertising cases discussed later."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "c. Categories of Claims Which Have Been Reported", "paragraphs": ["Because GAO has viewed the Meritorious Claims Act as an extraordinary remedy to be used only in unusual circumstances, it is much more difficult to generalize with respect to the claims which have been reported to Congress. Nevertheless, some categorization is possible. As with several of the denial categories, placement of a case within a particular category does not guarantee that it will be reported. Each case must be examined on its own merit. (1) Act of God or the public enemy GAO will generally recommend relief for claims resulting from a so-called \u201cact of God\u201d (natural disaster) or of the \u201cpublic enemy.\u201d In B-177096, December 22, 1972, relief was recommended where a transferred government employee was unable to sell his house within the statutory period required for reimbursement of real estate expenses because damage caused by Hurricane Agnes necessitated extensive repairs to the property. In B-69985, June 10, 1948, relief was recommended where the claimant had purchased government property located at a U.S. Marine detachment in China, but was unable to take possession due to the Japanese occupation of the base on December 8, 1941. More recently, private funds temporarily in the custody of the State Department were lost during the seizure of the American Embassy in Tehran, Iran, in 1979. Although the incident produced no legal liability on the part of the United States, GAO found sufficient equitable considerations to warrant a recommendation of relief under the Meritorious Claims Act. B-205984, June 15, 1982.", "One older and seemingly inconsistent case exists. Meritorious Claims Act relief was denied in B-44825, October 17, 1944, where a contractor incurred increased costs when performance was delayed by a tornado.", "The natural disaster or hostile act must be the direct cause of the loss for which relief is sought. In 17 Comp. Gen. 1012 (1938), the claimant had imported and paid the customs duties on 30,000 pounds of seed. The seed was released to the claimant pending final clearance by the Department of Agriculture. Shortly after release but before the claimant could be notified, the seed, while in storage in the claimant\u2019s plant, was destroyed in a flood. The claimant sought refund of the customs duties. Since the government\u2019s right to the duties accrued on importation and was not affected by the subsequent destruction of the goods, there was no legal basis for the refund, nor did GAO find sufficient equities to warrant a Meritorious Claims Act recommendation. (2) Congressional precedent GAO will generally recommend relief under the Meritorious Claims Act where Congress has enacted private relief legislation in similar circumstances. In B-165541, January 29, 1969, relief was recommended where the parents of a U.S. soldier incurred the expense of transporting their son\u2019s car from North Carolina (where it was stored prior to the son\u2019s departure and subsequent death in Vietnam) to California since the amount was considerably less than the government\u2019s cost of transportation would have been, and Congress had previously granted relief in similar circumstances. See also B-163823, April 29, 1968, for a nearly identical situation. Relief was also recommended in B-165384, November 13, 1968, involving the erroneous overpayment of special diving pay to a Navy diver. The claimant had acted in good faith and Congress had enacted relief legislation in the identical case of another member of the same diving team.", "Conversely, the Comptroller General has declined to recommend relief under the Meritorious Claims Act where private relief legislation has been introduced but not enacted (9 Comp. Gen. 175, 178 79 (1929); A-30375, February 12, 1930), or vetoed by the President (B-141780, March 28, 1966; B-141780, February 15, 1965). This may be viewed as analogous to the \u201cres judicata\u201d cases previously noted. Presumably the same result would apply if it were known that relief bills for different claimants with similar claims had been unsuccessful. (3) Unconsummated offer of employment On several occasions, the Comptroller General has recommended relief under the Meritorious Claims Act on behalf of a claimant who had received an offer of government employment and incurred a loss when, through no fault of his or her own, the offer could not be consummated.", "An illustrative case is 64 Comp. Gen. 617 (1985). The claimant was offered, and accepted, a job in a \u201cmanpower shortage\u201d position. She was given a travel authorization and incurred a variety of expenses incident to relocating to the new job site (rental expense, utility deposits, etc.). Due to budget constraints (that\u2019s what they all say), the agency rescinded the offer, leaving her with several items of expense which could not be reimbursed under existing law. Since the claimant had acted in good faith, was \u201cready, willing, and able to begin work on the job,\u201d and incurred the loss through absolutely no fault of her own, GAO submitted a Meritorious Claims Act recommendation for relief (B-215511(2), June 12, 1985).", "GAO also recommended relief in the following cases:", "Claimant, given an appointment by the Interior Department as a home economics teacher at an Indian school, traveled to her new job at her own expense. Upon arrival, she discovered that the school did not have a home economics department, whereupon she returned home. The claimant was unable to start the job for which she had been hired through no fault of her own. A-30416, February 17, 1930.", "Claimant was offered a Forest Service position in Wisconsin, accepted the offer and sold his home in Michigan. Upon reporting for work, he was informed of a delay in his formal appointment because of a question over his veteran\u2019s preference eligibility, whereupon he returned to Michigan and accepted private employment. Claimant had acted in good faith at all times. B-148149, May 16, 1962.", "Claimant accepted what he understood to be a firm offer of employment. It turned out to be merely an invitation to participate in a training session as part of a selection process. He was advised that he would not be considered for regular employment at a particular location, but he might be considered for placement elsewhere, and was told to return home to await a possible phone call. B-158406, March 23, 1966.", "In B-160747, August 2, 1967, a case somewhat similar to B-158406 but factually distinguishable in several respects, GAO declined to recommend relief. The claimant in B-160747 had not resigned his prior position and continued to receive pay during the period he was enrolled in the government training program. Also, upon being advised of his failure to qualify for the desired position, he was never asked to simply stand by to await a possible further assignment. This claimant was therefore not in the same equitable position as the claimant in B-158406. (4) Published advertisements As discussed earlier in this chapter, claims by newspapers for published advertisements procured in violation of 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702 must be disallowed. However, GAO has routinely reported these to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act. A few examples are B-208306, August 18, 1982; B-199453, October 2, 1980; B-196440, April 3, 1980; B-181337, November 25, 1974; and B-160052, January 22, 1969.", "The basis for submitting these is essentially an \u201cunjust enrichment\u201d theory\u2014the newspaper provided a service in good faith expecting to be compensated and the government received the benefits of that service. Also, although 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3702 is a prohibitory statute, it merely establishes a procedural requirement as a condition precedent to payment and does not prohibit the procurement of advertisements per se.", "However, in a case where the government had merely asked for a price quotation and the newspaper ran the advertisement based on that request, the newspaper did not stand in the same equitable position and GAO declined to make a Meritorious Claims Act recommendation. B-198568-O.M., October 21, 1980. Similarly, where an employee paid a newspaper from personal funds, GAO refused to submit the employee\u2019s claim for reimbursement to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act. B-1586, March 20, 1939. (5) Miscellaneous unjust enrichment and related cases If the government receives the benefit of work or services performed in good faith by someone\u2014a government employee or otherwise\u2014who justifiably expected to be paid, it is inequitable for the government not to pay. In some instances, however, as illustrated by the newspaper advertisement cases, there may be valid legal reasons why direct payment cannot be made. In such cases, and where the claimant is free from fault (for example, has not missed the statute of limitations), GAO will be inclined to favorably consider Meritorious Claims Act relief.", "In B-160178, January 27, 1969, the claimant took a GS-9 job with the Army after working only 12 days as a GS-6 with the Justice Department, a violation of the so-called Whitten Amendment which required at least one year in the next lower grade. Payment of his salary was therefore technically illegal. However, since the claimant had successfully performed his GS-9 duties for over a year, GAO recommended relief under the Meritorious Claims Act. The effect of requiring recoupment of the salary would have been that the government received the benefit of the claimant\u2019s work without having to pay him.", "Similarly, relief was recommended in B-153742, July 8, 1964, where a temporary civilian employee continued to work under the good faith impression that his temporary appointment had been extended for a second time although such an extension was prohibited.", "In an early case, a Treasury agent employed a Canadian attorney to help with the extradition of a fugitive who had violated the narcotics laws. Because of a statutory prohibition then in existence, there was no authority to pay the attorney. Since the services had been rendered in good faith and the government received the benefit, GAO submitted a Meritorious Claims Act recommendation. A-30342, February 12, 1930.", "The essence of these cases is that the government would be unjustly enriched at the claimant\u2019s expense by benefiting from uncompensated services performed in good faith. Note also that this rationale has been sufficient to overcome a statutory prohibition in several cases, as noted previously under the Statutory Prohibition heading.", "Relief has also been recommended in a few cases for services performed in good faith where it turned out that the government did not receive the contemplated benefit or the benefit was speculative. The claimant in A-26703, July 10, 1929, rendered undertaker\u2019s services at the request of the (then) Veterans Bureau, but it was later discovered that the deceased had never performed any military service. The claimant had no way of knowing and had acted in good faith. Undertaker\u2019s services were also involved in B-104517, February 9, 1953, in which the claimant had buried four unidentified individuals killed in an Air Force plane crash, but could not be paid because it could not be clearly established that the decedents were Air Force or Air National Guard members."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "d. Contract Claims", "paragraphs": ["Contract claims generated many requests to the Comptroller General for Meritorious Claims Act relief in the early years of the statute. There have been much fewer in recent years, largely because many claims are cognizable under modern contract claims authorities and procedures (e.g., government-caused delays). And, the removal of many contract claims from GAO\u2019s settlement jurisdiction by virtue of the Contract Disputes Act provides another reason for non-reporting.", "Because of their variety, contract claims are impossible to categorize as either reportable or not reportable although, as with most other claim types, Meritorious Claims Act recommendations have been made on only a small percentage. In addition to the principles already discussed in this section, some further guidelines may be noted for contract cases.", "One who contracts with the government is not automatically guaranteed a profit, and the mere fact that a contractor incurs a loss rather than a profit does not justify a Meritorious Claims Act recommendation. 37 Comp.

E.g., B-158239, March 11, 1966. Losses resulting from this situation will not justify a Meritorious Claims Act recommendation. 37 Comp. Gen. 688 (1958). However, relief has been recommended where the government did not correctly state its estimate. In an early case, a contracting officer erroneously put 4,000 sacks of flour instead of 4,000 pounds in the solicitation. Upon being notified that its bid was accepted, the contractor made commitments for 4,000 sacks, much more than the government needed. Since the contractor\u2019s loss was directly attributable to the government\u2019s error in stating the estimate, GAO recommended relief under the Meritorious Claims Act. A-26191, April 30, 1929.", "GAO has declined to recommend relief where a contractor\u2019s costs have increased due to inflation (54 Comp. Gen. 1031 (1975)) or to the devaluation of the dollar (53 Comp. Gen. 157 (1973)).", "A number of contract claims have been reported to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act. They tend to be cases where there is a direct connection between the government\u2019s actions and the claimant\u2019s loss, and frequently involve elements of unjust enrichment (benefit to the government from work for which the contractor justifiably contemplated payment). Two cases have been noted above in the discussion of cost or eligibility limitations (B-154061, February 15, 1965, and B-145318, December 16, 1969).

Erroneous Advice by Government Employee", "paragraphs": ["Elsewhere in this chapter we have discussed the well-established rule that, except as otherwise provided by statute, the government is not bound by erroneous acts done, or erroneous advice given, by its officers or employees. E.g., 53 Comp. Gen. 834 (1974). This rule has generated a large number of requests for Meritorious Claims Act relief. Typically, an erroneous payment is made as the result of administrative oversight, or expenses are incurred in reliance on representations by a government employee which turn out to be wrong. Having no legal recourse, the claimant seeks equitable relief. The \u201cerroneous advice\u201d cases cannot be categorically labeled as either reportable or not reportable. Although most have been denied, many have been reported. Our objective here, therefore, is merely to point out the various lines of cases and to emphasize that each case will turn on its own particular equities. \u201cIt has been our general policy not to report to Congress under the Meritorious Claims Act, claims which are based on erroneous official advice furnished to Government employees, even where the employee acted reasonably in reliance on the erroneous advice and incurred substantial costs. . . . \u201cWe now conclude that a change in this policy is warranted. While erroneous advice cases are not unusual, each such case deserves to be considered on its own merits. The fact that we are unable to seek relief in all cases should not prevent the submission of those worthy cases that do come before us. Therefore, we now will submit to Congress erroneous advice cases which, in our judgment, meet the standards for relief under the Meritorious Claims Act.\u201d", "A survey of the cases suggests that the policy change announced in 65 Comp.

That this was (and is) unfortunately true is evidenced by the large number of claims.", "However, GAO was never as stingy as 65 Comp.

Upon being billed, he found that the mover had more than doubled its rates under procedures which were apparently permissible at that time.

In terms of equity, GAO\u2019s position can be justified because, as a general proposition, it is not inequitable for individuals to have to bear expenses they would have incurred in any event, or to have to give back money they never should have received in the first place. As stated in B-236008, May 7, 1991, \u201cIt is not the purpose of the Meritorious Claims Act to provide for payment whenever expenses are incurred pursuant to erroneous authorization.\u201d Yet on the other hand, if fairness is to be the hallmark, there are many cases which should not go uncompensated.

In order to actually recover the funds, the state would have to seek an order from the United States district court. This is precisely what the state did in that case, and the state got the money.

Klein, 106 F.2d 213 (3d Cir. 1939), cert. denied, 308 U.S. 618.", "More recently, 23 states sued the Secretary of the Treasury and the Comptroller General to obtain custody of the money in the Unclaimed Moneys account attributable to citizens of their respective states. Of course, they had no idea how much of the account related to any given state, so they also sought information which would enable them to figure it out. Once the states had custody of the money, they would then presumably proceed to declare escheats. The district court described the operation of the Unclaimed Moneys account, discussed the Supreme Court\u2019s Klein decision, found Treasury\u2019s implementation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322 to be reasonable, and held that the states had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.

This may manifest itself in many ways\u2014higher taxes, reduced government services, increased budget deficit, increased national debt. Thus, in a very real sense, the government owes it to those who pay their debts and taxes to try to collect from those who do not.", "Before describing the magnitude of the government\u2019s debt collection activities, it is first necessary to distinguish between \u201creceivables\u201d and \u201cdelinquent debt.\u201d In making this distinction, it may also be helpful to divide the universe of government debt claims into two broad categories.", "The first category is debts resulting from programs involving the extension of credit in one form or another. If, for example, the government makes a loan of a million dollars, it has a \u201creceivable\u201d or \u201caccount receivable\u201d until the loan is repaid. If the borrower makes payments on the loan in accordance with the agreed-upon schedule,\u2014that is, if the account is kept \u201ccurrent\u201d\u2014the creditor agency\u2019s actions with respect to that account (billing, recordkeeping, receiving and depositing payments, etc.) are called \u201caccount servicing.\u201d At least for purposes of this chapter, however, this is not \u201cdebt collection.\u201d See 64 Comp. Gen. 366, 369 70 (1985). The concept of debt collection comes into play only if and when the borrower falls behind in payments and thereby becomes \u201cdelinquent.\u201d (Obviously, the debt collection phase will also include account servicing functions.) For this first category, the total amount of outstanding receivables will be much larger than the amount of delinquent debt.", "The second category is debt claims with respect to which the account servicing and debt collection phases are one and the same. Suppose, for example, an agency makes an overpayment to one of its employees. The debt comes into existence when the agency discovers the overpayment and notifies the employee. The debt is still a receivable, but debt collection commences immediately and there is no separate account servicing phase.", "Now for some numbers. As of the end of fiscal year 1991, total receivables owed the federal government amounted to approximately $300 billion. This amount consisted of $230 billion in loans receivable and other non-tax debts, and $70 billion in tax receivables. Much of this will be paid routinely but a sizeable portion will not, forcing the government to pursue claims against its debtors. Out of this $300 billion total, $112.5 billion was reported as delinquent. The largest single category of delinquent debt is tax debt, which accounted for $67 billion, leaving $45.5 billion of delinquent non-tax debt.", "The statistics tell you different things, depending on how you look at them. Most certainly, a delinquent debt total of over $112 billion is cause for serious concern at all levels of federal management. This, in anyone\u2019s vocabulary, is \u201creal money.\u201d This, however, does not necessarily translate into the same level of concern for every program. A useful measuring device is the \u201cdelinquency rate.\u201d If you divide the delinquent debt for a particular program by the total receivables for that program, you get the delinquency rate. Comparing the delinquency rate for the same program over a period of time will give you useful trend data for that program, which may be the same, better, or worse than the overall rate.", "Let us take a simple hypothetical to illustrate. Suppose this year you make ten $100 loans for a total of $1,000 in loans receivable. If one of those loans becomes delinquent, you have a delinquency rate of 10 percent. Next year, you make fifty similar loans, also of $100 each. Five of those become delinquent. You have a fivefold increase in the total amount of delinquent debt, but your delinquency rate is still 10 percent. Both figures tell you something important, but the increase in the dollar amount of delinquent debt in this particular example may be due to increased program size rather than poor debt collection.", "Delinquencies occur for a variety of reasons. We have all seen press accounts of some wealthy professional with a seriously delinquent student loan. However, it must also be kept in mind that many federal programs are intended to provide assistance in one form or another to some segment of society which the private market will not accommodate. If private credit markets were available, the federal programs would presumably not have been necessary. Delinquencies in such programs should not be surprising. In addition, changes in the economy or other factors beyond anyone\u2019s control have an impact. A severe drought will produce increased delinquencies in farm credit programs. This by itself obviously does not mean that the administering agencies are ignoring debt collection or that farmers are \u201cdeadbeats.\u201d", "The point of all this is to caution against over-generalization. While it is true that debt collection is a major task for the federal government, delinquent debt occurs for a variety of reasons, and federal agencies should formulate their debt collection approaches accordingly.", "GAO\u2019s debt collection philosophy stems from two key premises. First, each federal agency should have an aggressive debt collection program, taking advantage of all tools available under the law, tailored to the needs and circumstances of the particular program or case. Second, federal debt collection activities should never be unreasonable. It is frequently said that an agency\u2019s actions should always be based on the \u201cinterests of the government.\u201d While maximum recovery of amounts owed is surely one of these interests, it is not the only one.

See, e.g., 58 Comp. Gen. 501, 502 (1979). However, it does not mean what a literal reading might suggest, and it is clear that GAO does not view this provision as giving it any special authority in the actual litigation of debt claims in court. The Justice Department is the government\u2019s litigator (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 516), and GAO has never construed 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3526(a) as in any way pre-empting this. E.g., B-42663, July 26, 1944. What the statute essentially does is confirm or reinforce GAO\u2019s oversight role in the debt collection process. See B-117604-O.M., January 12, 1973.", "Next is the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, as amended. GAO has a special role under this statute and prescribes governmentwide implementing regulations jointly with the Department of Justice. The statute and regulations are discussed in detail in various places throughout this chapter.", "GAO\u2019s authority to render formal legal decisions also comes into play. On the payment side, decisions of the Comptroller General serve two functions: interpreting statutes and determining the merits of particular claims. On the debt side, there are still decisions interpreting statutes, but there are many fewer decisions adjudicating individual claims. There are several reasons for this. Uniform requirements under the Federal Claims Collection Act eliminate the need for many decisions. Also, the typical debt case tends to be fairly clear-cut at least in terms of its legal foundation, and problems are more likely to relate to collection procedures than to the existence of the debt itself. Finally, while most claimants are aggressive in pursuing payment claims at least through available administrative channels, the average debtor is much less likely to take an active role. As with the payment side, GAO will not intrude into areas committed by statute to the exclusive jurisdiction of another agency. E.g., B-164031(3).125, November 7, 1977 (reasonable cost determinations under Medicare Program).", "Finally, GAO\u2019s various audit authorities are relevant.

While GAO made some efforts by virtue of its audit and claims settlement functions, debt collection lacked a governmentwide statutory basis and procedures varied greatly from agency to agency. As a general proposition, debt collection received little emphasis during this time period.", "While some authority existed under the common law, lack of adequate statutory powers hampered debt collection. For example, as discussed in Chapter 12, the authority to \u201csettle and adjust\u201d claims had long been construed as not including the authority to compromise. Although a few agencies had specific compromise authority, most, GAO included, did not. To make things worse, to simply terminate collection action would have been viewed as giving away government property, which, as noted above, no government official has the right to do without statutory authority.", "Thus, the administrative agency\u2014if it did anything at all\u2014had to attempt to collect the full amount of the debt. If the agency was unsuccessful, it had to refer the claim to GAO, which again could do nothing more than attempt to collect the full amount. If GAO\u2019s efforts were similarly fruitless, the claim went to the Justice Department, and it was only there that compromise could be considered. Under this system, the Justice Department was burdened with referrals of worthless as well as collectible debts. Congress was also burdened with many requests for private relief legislation.", "In 1966, Congress took the first major step toward establishing a governmentwide system of debt collection, by enacting the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, Pub. L. No. 89-508, 80 Stat. 308. The legislation had been recommended by the Justice Department and was largely a joint GAO-Justice effort. Enactment stemmed from the congressional belief that giving agencies the authority to compromise claims would result in increased collections since agencies would be able to settle claims while they were fresh and while the debtors still had the ability to pay. Also, Congress considered it a better business practice for agencies to handle their own claims since agency staffs are more likely to be familiar with the facts and legalities of the claims. A further congressional objective was to reduce congestion in the courts. See generally S. Rep. No. 1331 (reprinted in 1966 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 2532) and H.R. Rep. No. 1533, 89th Cong., 2d Sess.

All of these concepts will be explored fully later in this chapter.", "While the 1966 legislation was a major development in federal debt collection, it did not do the job. A 1978 GAO report, The Government Needs to Do a Better Job of Collecting Amounts Owed by the Public, FGMSD-78-61 (October 20, 1978), called attention to serious deficiencies in federal debt collection programs. Continuing its emphasis on debt collection, GAO issued several further reports of governmentwide significance. The heightened awareness generated in part by this series of reports produced improvements in government debt collection through increased management focus. See GAO report entitled Significant Improvements Seen in Efforts to Collect Debts Owed the Federal Government, GAO/AFMD-83-57 (April 28, 1983).", "During the same time period, Congress had also once again turned its attention to debt collection, culminating in the next major piece of debt collection legislation, the Debt Collection Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 97 365, 96 Stat. 1749. The 1982 law provides a statutory basis for a number of specific collection tools such as interest, offset, and the use of private collection agencies.", "The Federal Claims Collection Act authorizes GAO and the Justice Department to jointly issue governmentwide implementing regulations. Individual agency regulations are to conform to these joint regulations. This provision, part of the 1966 legislation, is now found at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3711(e). The selection of GAO and the Justice Department was quite deliberate\u2014GAO because of its expertise in administrative debt collection, the Justice Department because of its expertise in litigation. The joint GAO-Justice Department regulations are known as the Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS). The original version of the FCCS was published on October 15, 1966 (31 Fed. Reg. 13381). The regulations have been amended several times, and were comprehensively revised and reissued in their entirety on March 9, 1984 (49 Fed. Reg. 8889). The regulations themselves are found in 4 C.F.R.

Several commenters suggested uniform and more detailed procedures either throughout the Standards or in some particular area. . . . However, since their inception in 1966, the Standards have never been intended to prescribe detailed procedures. Rather, they are designed primarily to address policies, and to provide general guidance on sound debt collection principles. It is our belief that detailed procedures are best developed in the context of individual agency regulations, where they can be tailored to meet the needs and experiences of particular programs and activities. Each Federal agency is required to develop its own implementing regulations, based on and consistent with these Standards, and it is there that we believe the detailed procedures belong. While uniformity of policy is desirable throughout the Federal Government, we have never been convinced that uniformity of operating procedures is either necessary or beneficial.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)", "49 Fed.

What Is a Debt?", "paragraphs": ["In its simplest terms, a debt, for purposes of the Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards, is something you owe the federal government. The Standards define \u201cdebt\u201d as \u201can amount of money or property which has been determined by an appropriate agency official to be owed to the United States from any person, organization, or entity, except another Federal agency.\u201d 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.2(a).", "When GAO and the Justice Department were preparing the 1984 version of the Standards, several commenters asked for clarification of the difference between a \u201cdebt\u201d and a \u201cclaim.\u201d In one sense, there is a logical distinction. Suppose, for example, you buy a house and take out a mortgage for $100,000 with your local bank. You have a \u201cdebt\u201d to the bank in the full amount of the note you signed. However, as long as you continue making your payments on time, the bank cannot take any collection action against you. In this sense, the bank does not have a \u201cclaim\u201d against you unless and until you fall behind in your payments. Be that as it may, as the 1984 preamble notes, the Debt Collection Act of 1982 appears to use the terms interchangeably. It was decided that creating a distinction in the Standards would not serve a useful purpose. \u201cIn the final analysis, following the substance of the regulations is more important than specific nomenclature.\u201d 49 Fed. Reg. at 8889. Thus, the Standards also use the terms interchangeably. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.2(a).", "It should be readily apparent that a \u201cdebt,\u201d for purposes of the Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards, requires two elements: there must be an amount of money or property which is owed to the United States, and the government must be entitled to receive it immediately. If it is not immediately payable (as, for example, in the case of loan payments which have not yet become due), then there is no \u201cdebt\u201d upon which collection action can be taken, regardless of the terminology used. Thus, the Standards opted for substance over semantics.", "One very important point emerges from the definition in section 101.2(a): a debt comes into existence when the government agency determines that there is a debt, unless some statute provides otherwise. The government does not have to go to court to establish the indebtedness. The existence and amount of the debt are determined in the first instance by the agency involved. At first glance, this may seem heavy-handed, but it is not. Obviously, the debtor retains the right to contest the debt through available administrative or judicial channels. Also, the government must follow any required procedures in connection with any particular form of collection action. But it is the agency\u2019s initial determination that triggers or sets in motion the debt collection process. See Bell v. New Jersey, 461 U.S. 773, 791 (1983), in which the Supreme Court applied the same concept to government claims under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. See also Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Federal Crop Ins. Corp., 947 F.2d 269, 276 (7th Cir. 1991) (argument that agency\u2019s overpayment determinations were not \u201cdebts\u201d subject to offset held to be without merit); DiSilvestro v. United States, 405 F.2d 150, 155 (2d Cir. 1968) (\u201cthe right of set-off arose when . . . the V.A. found that its prior decision granting DiSilvestro service-connected disability benefits was \u201d). \u201cFor purposes of this Act, the term \u2018claim\u2019 includes amounts owing on account of loans insured or guaranteed by the United States and all other amounts due the United States from fees, duties, leases, rents, royalties, services, sales of real or personal property, overpayments, fines, penalties, damages, interest, taxes, forfeitures, and other sources.\u201d", "While the flavor was thus diluted in the recodification, the substance is clearly the same since the specific items would all be included in the phrase \u201cother amounts due the Government\u201d and, more importantly, the recodification was not intended to make any substantive changes.", "It becomes rather clear from this definition that Congress intended that the Act and Standards have a very broad scope. The quoted language has been incorporated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Circular No. A-129, Appendix 1 at 2) and by the Treasury Department (Managing Government Credit: A Supplement to the Treasury Financial Manual, at 7 9).", "Note that the definition in 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.2(a) refers to claims for \u201cmoney or property.\u201d The Standards specifically include conversion claims. Where someone is holding property belonging to the government, the creditor agency can demand either return of the specific property or the payment of its value. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.5.", "Thus far, the only case we have found construing the definition in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701(b) is United States v. Excellair, Inc., 637 F. Supp. 1377 (D. Colo. 1986). In that case, the court held that, for purposes of enforcing the government\u2019s priority under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3713 against a preferential transfer by an insolvent debtor, the government had a \u201cclaim\u201d under a guaranteed loan even though at the time of the transfer the guarantee had not yet been honored. Id. at 1394 95. While the holding is relevant for purposes of the priority statute, it would seem to have limited application to other forms of collection action.", "As noted above, the debt collection process is triggered by the agency\u2019s initial determination of the existence and amount of the debt. While this is enough to start the process, several collection tools, as we will see later in the chapter, apply only to a debt which has become \u201cdelinquent.\u201d Thus, for collection purposes, there is a difference between a \u201cdebt\u201d and a \u201cdelinquent debt.\u201d The theory is that certain collection actions should be employed only after the debtor has been given a chance to pay voluntarily. For purposes of the Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards, a debt becomes \u201cdelinquent\u201d (1) if it has not been paid by the date specified in the agency\u2019s initial written notification (i.e., the agency\u2019s first demand letter), unless other payment arrangements have been made by that date, or (2) if at any time thereafter the debtor defaults on a repayment agreement. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.2(b).

Debt becomes delinquent on day 31.", "Example 2: Agency sends first demand letter demanding payment within 30 days.

Exemptions", "paragraphs": ["There are a number of situations in which the Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards do not apply, either in whole or in part. The exemptions vary in scope because they stem from different sources\u2014the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966, the Standards themselves, the Debt Collection Act of 1982, or some combination thereof. (1) Antitrust claims and claims tainted with fraud Two partial exemptions were specified in the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966. Section 3 of that legislation expressly made the authority to compromise, and to suspend or terminate collection action, inapplicable to (1) claims involving a violation of the antitrust laws, and (2) claims in which there is an indication of fraud, misrepresentation, or the presentation of a false claim. These exemptions are now found in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3711(c)(1). Note that these exemptions do not extend to the entire Act or Standards; they apply only to the compromise, suspension, and termination authority.", "The corresponding provision of the Federal Claims Collection Standards is 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(a). It clearly spells out agency responsibilities with respect to fraud and antitrust claims. Upon identifying a claim subject to one of these exemptions, the agency is to promptly refer the matter to the Justice Department. The Justice Department may retain the claim, or it may return it to the agency with instructions to proceed with administrative collection action. Thus, the scope of agency collection actions will depend on precisely what Justice tells the agency to do. (2) Tax claims Tax claims are excluded from the coverage of the Federal Claims Collection Standards. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(b). This exemption has been in the Standards since their inception. Tax claims \u201care a special, preferred type of debt and have been from time immemorial.\u201d B-156022-O.M., October 25, 1968. Collection of taxes is governed by the Internal Revenue Code, which has its own authorities and procedures. See, for example, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6321 26 (tax liens) and 6331 (tax levy). The exemption of section 101.3(b) now has a partial statutory basis. Section 8(e) of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701(d), provides that, with certain exceptions, the Debt Collection Act does not apply to debts arising under the Internal Revenue Code. The exemption in the Standards is broader because it is not limited to authorities contained in the Debt Collection Act.", "In B-229068.4, August 3, 1988, GAO considered the applicability of the Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards to reclamation fees assessed against coal mining companies under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The question arose because the court in United States v. River Coal Co., 748 F.2d 1103 (6th Cir. 1984), had held that the fees were involuntary exactions and therefore constituted a tax. GAO first noted that the Federal Claims Collection Act itself has no blanket exemption for tax claims. GAO then found it unnecessary to decide whether 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(b) applied to \u201ctax claims\u201d other than those arising under the Internal Revenue Code because the Interior Department was free to adopt similar provisions in its own regulations, and had in fact done so. Thus, Interior could compromise a claim for reclamation fees in accordance with 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3711. (B-156022-O.M., cited above, indicates that section 101.3(b) was viewed as addressing tax claims under the Internal Revenue Code.) (3) Section 8(e) exemptions Section 8(e) of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, noted above in connection with tax claims, also embraces debts arising under the Social Security Act or the tariff laws of the United States. This is not an exemption from the entire Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards, but only from those remedies and procedures prescribed by the Debt Collection Act itself. See 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701(d); 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.19(a). The Standards further point out that the exemption \u201cshould not be construed as prohibiting use of these authorities and requirements when collecting debts owed by persons employed by agencies administering the laws cited in the preceding paragraph unless the debt \u2018arose under\u2019 those laws.\u201d 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.19(b).", "In order for the section 8(e) exemption to apply, two conditions must exist: the collection action in question must derive from the Debt Collection Act of 1982, and the debt must be one \u201carising under\u201d the Internal Revenue Code, the Social Security Act, or the tariff laws. If either of these conditions is not met, the exemption does not apply. This gets somewhat complicated. A few examples may help:", "The Internal Revenue Service asserts a tax underpayment claim against an employee of the Social Security Administration. The claim cannot be referred to a private collection agency since the claim \u201carose under\u201d the Internal Revenue Code and the authority to hire private debt collectors was prescribed by the Debt Collection Act.", "The Social Security Administration wishes to compromise a benefit overpayment claim against a private individual. Although the debt \u201carose under\u201d the Social Security Act, the section 8(e) exemption does not apply because compromise authority was not one of the newly enacted provisions of the Debt Collection Act.", "SSA wants to assess a penalty against one of its employees for delinquent repayment of an unused travel advance. Although the penalty provision was one of the newly enacted Debt Collection Act provisions, SSA may assess the penalty because the debt did not \u201carise under\u201d the Social Security Act, Internal Revenue Code, or tariff laws. (4) Interagency claims Interagency claims\u2014claims by federal agencies against other federal agencies\u2014are also excluded from the coverage of the Federal Claims Collection Standards. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(c). In addition, the definition of \u201cdebt\u201d in 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.2(a), discussed above, excludes amounts owed by other federal agencies. The only statutory reference to interagency claims is 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701(c), under which interagency claims are not subject to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3716 (administrative offset) or 3717 (interest and penalties). These provisions were added by the Debt Collection Act of 1982. As with tax claims, the exemption in the Standards is broader. \u201cA claim against another federal agency is different from a claim against a private party. The tools available to collect a debt from the private party are not available when the debtor is another federal agency, either as a matter of law or as a practical matter. We cannot sue the other agency; we cannot hire a private debt collector; we cannot charge interest; we cannot offset the claim against the agency\u2019s present or future appropriations.\u201d", "The range of options in collecting a claim from another federal agency is extremely limited. The Standards instruct agencies to attempt to resolve interagency claims by negotiation. If this fails, the claim should be referred to GAO. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.3(c). The agency should not simply \u201cwrite off\u201d the claim. B-214972-O.M., April 26, 1985. GAO will review the claim and render its objective opinion as to the claim\u2019s validity, for whatever persuasive influence that may have. GAO cannot, however, enforce collection any more than the creditor agency itself could. (5) State and local governments Another limited exemption deriving from the Debt Collection Act is 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3701(c), which provides that sections 3716 (administrative offset) and 3717 (interest and penalties) do not apply to debts owed by state or local governments. The state and local government exemption will be discussed more fully later in this chapter. (6) Civil vs. criminal claims Nothing in either the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 or the Debt Collection Act of 1982 expressly limits the coverage of those statutes to civil claims. However, since their inception, the Federal Claims Collection Standards have included such a limitation. See 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.1.", "The collection of criminal fines and penalties is the responsibility of the Department of Justice. Authorities and procedures are found in various provisions of Title 18 of the United States Code. Many of the current provisions, including those cited below, stem from the Criminal Fine Improvements Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100 185, 101 Stat. 1279.", "A criminal fine is imposed by the court as part or all of the sentence. It is payable immediately unless the court provides for installment payments for a period not to exceed five years, excluding any time the defendant is in jail. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3572(d). The fine is \u201cdelinquent\u201d if payment is more than 30 days late, and is \u201cin default\u201d if delinquent for more than 90 days. A fine in default becomes due within 30 days after notification by the Attorney General, notwithstanding any installment schedule.

In addition, penalties are added to fines which become delinquent or in default. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 3612(f), (g). If the government petitions the court upon a showing that reasonable collection efforts are not likely to succeed, the court may remit or defer payment of the fine or may extend an installment schedule. Id. \u00a7 3573. The Attorney General may waive interest or penalties on the same grounds. Id. \u00a7 3612(h).", "In sum, criminal fines have their own detailed collection authorities and procedures prescribed by statute. Because of this, and because of the integral role of the sentencing court in criminal matters, criminal fines are excluded from the coverage of the Federal Claims Collection Standards.", "Where a criminal action and civil liability arise out of the same facts, the disposition of the criminal action does not affect the debtor\u2019s civil liability for any outstanding balance. B-136570, August 4, 1958; B-133647, October 30, 1957. (7) More specific agency authority Program legislation or agency organic authority may include provisions dealing with various aspects of debt collection. Where such provisions exist, they, and their implementing regulations, take precedence over the Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards. An example is 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505(c), specifying the due date, delinquency date, and interest accrual date for customs duties found to be due upon liquidation or reliquidation. Of course, an agency may incorporate part or all of the Standards in its own regulations to the extent consistent with the governing statute. To the extent the agency has not issued its own implementing regulations, the Federal Claims Collection Standards should be followed. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.4; 62 Comp. Gen. 489 (1983); B-170686-O.M., April 4, 1972. The same concept applies with respect to the section 8(e) exemption where the authority subject to the exemption can be found elsewhere. A decision discussing all of this in the context of debts arising under the Social Security Act is 62 Comp. Gen. 599 (1983)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "5.

If the agency does so, it must give the debtor a written explanation of the consequences. If the debtor refuses to execute the confess-judgment note or to provide other adequate security, the agency may or may not accept an installment plan, at its option.", "The requirement for an acceleration clause was added to the Standards in the 1984 revision. This refers to a \u201cdefault\u201d acceleration, under which, if the debtor fails to make an installment payment when it becomes due, or within any grace period provided in the agreement, all of the remaining installments become immediately due and payable, either automatically or at the creditor\u2019s option. The Standards do not authorize the \u201cat will\u201d or \u201cinsecurity\u201d type of acceleration under which payment may be accelerated in non-default situations if the creditor deems its position insecure. A case discussing the different types of acceleration is Brown v. Avemco Investment Corp., 603 F.2d 1367 (9th Cir. 1979). \u201chere is probably not an installment contract in force today that does not contain a clause granting the creditor the right to require immediate payment of all installments upon the happening of a specified event, usually a default in repayment of the loan. Exercise of that right by the creditor shortens, sometimes dramatically, the time period during which the borrower would normally be able to repay the loan. The purpose of such a provision is obvious. Without the right to accelerate payment, the creditor would be forced to sue each month as each installment payment became due and as the borrower defaulted on the installment, a course of action that is both commercially unreasonable and, in all probability, quite expensive to the borrower since he might be liable for 24 or 30 different sets of court costs.\u201d", "See also Quick v. American Steel and Pump Corp., 397 F.2d 561, 564 (2d Cir. 1968) (\u201ccontracts to pay money in instalments are breached one instalment at a time\u201d).", "It is important to include an acceleration clause in an installment agreement because, in simple debt repayment situations, acceleration is permissible only if provided for in the relevant contract.

There may be situations in which the agency chooses not to invoke its right of acceleration, but it should always make sure it has that right and the only way to do that is by including a clause in the agreement. \u201cBy the general commercial law, as well of England as of the United States, a promissory note does not discharge the debt for which it is given unless such be the express agreement of the parties; it only operates to extend until its maturity the period for the payment of the debt. The creditor may return the note when dishonored, and proceed upon the original debt.\u201d", "The Kimball, 70 U.S. (3 Wall.) 37, 45 (1865). The principle has found its most frequent application in the context of new notes given for previously held notes, with the courts holding that the renewal note does not extinguish the original liability unless the parties have clearly expressed that intention. E.g., Mid-Eastern Electronics, Inc. v. First National Bank of S. Md., 455 F.2d 141, 144 45 (4th Cir. 1970); In re Mid-Atlantic Piping Products of Charlotte, Inc., 24 B.R. 314, 324 (Bankr. W.D.N.C. 1982). Of course, the concept is most useful in cases in which the debt, prior to execution of the renewal note or agreement, was such that the creditor had the right to demand immediate payment in full (as opposed, for example, to the case of a simple loan agreement in which the original liability is defined in terms of installment payments). Also, it presupposes that action may still be taken on the original debt (e.g., applicable statutes of limitations have not expired). See B-226918.2-O.M., April 8, 1988.", "GAO applied the rule of The Kimball in a 1985 decision, 64 Comp. Gen. 493. The debt in that case arose from nonpayment of contractual obligations to the Soil and Conservation Service, Department of Agriculture, under the Great Plains Conservation Program. After several time extensions under the original contract, the agency, at the debtor\u2019s urging, accepted an installment workout agreement. Payments still were not made. GAO agreed with the agency that it could treat the workout agreement as void, and proceed to collect the full amount of the pre-existing debt, including offset against payments due the debtor under another program.", "Related concepts are rescheduling and refinancing. Rescheduling is not specifically mentioned in the Federal Claims Collection Standards, but is addressed in OMB Circular No. A-129 and the Treasury Department\u2019s Managing Government Credit: A Supplement to the Treasury Financial Manual. Rescheduling is a change in the existing terms of a debt, usually a loan. As both OMB and Treasury point out, the creditor agency should determine that recovery of all or a portion of the debt is reasonably assured before agreeing to a rescheduling. Also, a rescheduling agreement should be in legally enforceable form and should contain an acceleration clause. Managing Government Credit at 4 9.", "Refinancing usually involves executing a new note which then replaces the original obligation. Refinancing also is not addressed in the Federal Claims Collection Standards. Program legislation may contain applicable authorities or restrictions. An illustrative case is 43 Comp.

Even the most conscientious debtor paying by mail will not know exactly when payment is received. Also, many debtors may tend to compute interest up to the date of their check, not including any allowance for mailing time. In these situations, the agency has the right to assert a claim for additional interest up to the date of actual receipt. However, there may be a number of reasons for not doing so, not the least of which is cost effectiveness. E.g., B-134617, January 30, 1958.

In another case, GAO recommended acceptance of a debtor\u2019s offer of $125,000 to compromise a government claim for $301,833.51, in part because the debtor had some basis to question the forum in which the matter would be litigated, which could result in transfer of the case to a United States district court where the debtor could request a jury trial with its attendant uncertainties.

Since debtors are more likely to pay when first requested to do so if an agency has a policy of vigorous collection of all claims, the fact that the cost of collection of any one claim may exceed the amount of the claim does not necessarily mean that the claim should be compromised.

(3) Permissive waiver/review statute If there is an applicable statute providing for waiver or administrative review and the statute is \u201cpermissive\u201d in the sense that it does not prohibit collection action pending consideration of a request for waiver or review, the agency may nevertheless suspend collection action based on \u201cappropriate consideration,\u201d on a case-by-case basis, of three factors: (1) whether there is a reasonable possibility that the debtor\u2019s request will prevail; (2) whether there is reasonable assurance of recovery if the debtor does not prevail; and (3) whether collection would cause undue hardship. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.2(c)(2).

They establish the limits of agency authority. If the standards for compromise or termination cannot be met, and if the debt cannot be waived, the agency has no alternative but to pursue collection of the full amount of the debt. See, e.g., B-163495, February 23, 1968; B-160771, February 24, 1967; B-152680, October 28, 1966.

If a significant enforcement policy is involved in a particular case, or if recovery of a judgment is a prerequisite to desired administrative sanctions, the agency may refer the claim for litigation even though it may otherwise qualify for termination. Id.", "The Federal Claims Collection Standards provide five criteria for termination, the two specified in the statute plus three additional logical items added by the regulations: 1. Inability to collect any substantial amount. The agency may terminate collection action if the debtor is financially unable, both presently and prospectively, to pay any substantial amount on the claim. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(a). For example, termination was justified where the government had obtained a default judgment but could not find any assets on which to levy, and there were other substantial unsatisfied judgments on record. B-161248-O.M., November 9, 1967. Receipt of government benefits does not automatically preclude termination under this standard. 62 Comp. Gen. 599, 604 (1983). 2. Cost will exceed recovery. The agency may terminate when it is likely that the cost of further collection action will exceed the amount recoverable. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(c). This is the \u201cdiminishing returns\u201d standard. As with the corresponding standard for compromise, the costs of hearings or other administrative procedures required by law may be included if there is a substantial likelihood that they will actually be incurred in the particular case. 65 Comp. Gen. 893 (1986). 3. Inability to locate debtor. The agency may terminate when the debtor cannot be located and either (1) there is no remaining security to be liquidated, or (2) the applicable statute of limitations has run and prospects for offset are too remote to justify retention. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(b). E.g., B-180072-O.M., November 29, 1973. 4. Claim legally without merit. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(d). A claim is legally without merit if there is no legal basis for recovery by the United States. 68 Comp. Gen. 609 (1989); B-218989, January 27, 1986. This standard is the one exception to the requirement to refer all claims over $100,000 to the Justice Department. If an agency determines that its original assertion of a claim was plainly erroneous, it may terminate collection action without Justice Department approval regardless of the amount of the claim. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.1(b). If there is room for reasonable disagreement, Justice should be consulted.5. Claim cannot be substantiated by evidence. However good a claim may be in theory, if the agency has insufficient evidence to prove it (documentary evidence, witnesses, etc.) and the debtor refuses to pay or compromise, termination is appropriate. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(e). (2) Termination and federal employees A thorny and frequently recurring question is whether the termination authority applies to debtors currently employed by the federal government. On the one hand, the argument goes, federal employees are people too, and should be governed by the same standards as nonfederal employees. On the other hand, however,\u2014and wholly apart from any consideration of what should constitute appropriate conduct by a government employee\u2014a government employee has a steady paycheck and should always be able to repay a debt, at least in reasonable installments.", "The statute and its legislative history do not address this issue. GAO has issued several decisions over the years which, at first glance, may not appear entirely consistent. They do, however, when viewed in the aggregate, stand for the proposition that (a) as a matter of law, the termination authority applies to federal employees, but (b) the various criteria specified in the Federal Claims Collection Standards must be examined individually as it will generally be more difficult for a federal employee to meet some of them.", "Reviewing the criteria in the order listed in the preceding section, the first is inability to pay. GAO first considered the issue in B-159708,  September 23, 1966, a response to a Member of Congress on behalf of a civilian employee of the Navy. The Comptroller General pointed out that the law required collection of the full amount of the indebtedness unless there was a showing that the employee was financially unable to pay \u201cany significant sum\u201d on the debt, an event GAO viewed as \u201cunlikely\u201d since the debtor was employed by the government. Thus, while the Comptroller General stopped short of expressing a definitive position, he seemed to be saying that the \u201cinability to pay\u201d standard applies to federal employees just as to any other debtor, but that a federal employee would rarely, if ever, be able to qualify under that standard. See also 49 Comp. Gen. 359, 361 (1969); B-163495, February 23, 1968; B-160569, February 28, 1967.", "GAO concluded that termination was unauthorized in B-160633, January 19, 1967, a case involving an Air Force employee who had erroneously been paid overtime compensation. The decision held that there was no authority to discontinue collection action since the debtor \u201ccurrently is employed and there is no showing of his inability to repay the amount in question.\u201d Again, the implication was that the standard applies as a matter of law but that someone receiving a government paycheck is presumptively unable to meet it.", "In B-172122-O.M., May 21, 1971, GAO\u2019s General Counsel advised the GAO Claims Group that \u201cthe present debt should not be terminated or suspended . . . so long as the employee occupies his present position and has a take home pay of $980 a month after tax withholding in addition to his retired military pay.\u201d In B-175499, April 21, 1972, overruled on other grounds by 69 Comp. Gen. 72 (1989), GAO held that a particular overpayment could not be waived under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5584 but advised the agency to consider the various alternatives under the Federal Claims Collection Act, one of which is termination. In that particular case, however, the employee was in the process of resigning and was in a \u201cleave without pay\u201d status.", "The cases noted above all involved overpayments or erroneous payments made directly to the debtor. In one case, GAO considered whether termination was available on behalf of an accountable officer where GAO had previously denied relief. Reviewing several of the earlier cases, GAO expressed a general rule that termination is unauthorized where the debtor is currently employed by the government. However, in view of the history of that particular case and the financial hardship which had been demonstrated, GAO advised that no further collection action need be taken. The case was clearly viewed as an exception. B-180957-O.M., September 25, 1979.", "Thus, in the typical case, it will be difficult at best for a federal employee to qualify for termination under the \u201cinability to pay\u201d standard. The rationale is that the employee cannot legitimately be deemed unable to pay, at least in reasonable installments, where he or she is receiving a steady government paycheck. In many financial hardship cases, if a reasonable installment plan is not feasible, suspension will be the more appropriate course of action. There is, however, no rule of law which prohibits termination if the standard, fairly applied, is satisfied.", "The next standard is \u201cdiminishing returns.\u201d Prior to the Debt Collection Act of 1982, the decisions had consistently held that termination on this basis was unauthorized where salary offset under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5514 was an available remedy. B-195471, October 26, 1979; B-189701, September 23, 1977; B-180674, November 25, 1974; B-160483, December 9, 1966. See also B-195322, November 27, 1979. When these decisions were rendered, the cost of taking a salary offset was negligible. The process involved little more than contacting the payroll office. Thus, a \u201cdiminishing returns\u201d standard would have little application. However, the Debt Collection Act of 1982 changed the rules by requiring various procedural measures in connection with taking an offset. \u201chere may be cases in which sound countervailing Government policies dictate that collection be attempted, despite the costs. For example, it may be desirable for the agency to disregard the costs of collection when it wishes to \u2018set an example,\u2019 and thereby discourage or deter other persons from incurring similar debts or resisting payment of them.\u201d Id. at 897.", "The three remaining termination standards are easily addressed. It is difficult to see how \u201cinability to locate debtor\u201d could ever apply to a person on the federal payroll. As to the final two\u2014claim legally without merit and lack of evidence\u2014there is no reason why these should not apply fully to debts asserted against federal employees. (3) Categorical termination As we have seen, one of the standards for termination is the concept of \u201cdiminishing returns.\u201d When the cost of collection is likely to exceed the amount recoverable, collection action may be terminated. 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(c). Generally speaking, the termination authority contemplates situations where the agency has already started collection action. 58 Comp. Gen. 372, 374 (1979). There are situations, however, where GAO has construed the Federal Claims Collection Act as permitting an agency to simply forgo collection action before it was actually initiated. \u201cestablish guidelines with respect to points at which costs of further collection efforts are likely to exceed recoveries, . . . and establish minimum debt amounts below which collection efforts need not be taken.\u201d", "See also GAO\u2019s Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies (GAO-PPM), title 4, \u00a7 69.3.", "Note that we are dealing with two separate but nevertheless closely related concepts here: (1) minimum debt amounts, which are thresholds below which collection action need not be initiated, and (2) points of diminishing returns, which are thresholds at which the agency may discontinue collection efforts already started. See 65 Comp. Gen. 893, 896 (1986). For purposes of this discussion, we use the term \u201ccategorical termination\u201d to encompass both.", "Under the Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards, the rule has developed that an agency may establish reasonable minimum amounts for the pursuit of debt claims of particular types, and reasonable points of diminishing returns beyond which collection action need not be continued. The amounts cannot be arbitrary but must be supported by cost studies. The studies should analyze average recovery rates in relation to the size of the debt, the average cost of collection actions applicable to that type of claim, and the apparent possibilities of collection. 4 GAO-PPM \u00a7 69.3. There is no requirement for GAO approval. These amounts are, however, subject to review under GAO\u2019s regular audit authority. 55 Comp. Gen. 1438, 1439 (1976).", "For example, based on cost figures supplied by the General Services Administration, GAO approved a $25 minimum for the filing of loss and damage claims against carriers, including small domestic shipments on commercial forms. 55 Comp. Gen. 1438 (1976). The decision noted that an agency is authorized but not required to observe the minimum, and would retain the option to file a claim in a particular case. Similarly, the Agriculture Department could establish a $35 minimum for the collection of small claims. B-3338, January 11, 1972.", "In B-117604, March 6, 1972, based on cost studies conducted by various services, the Comptroller General approved a proposal by the Defense Department to set a $25 minimum on pursuing out-of-service indebtedness claims. A few years later, Defense sought to establish a \u201cfloating minimum\u201d or, in the alternative, raise the minimum to $150. While GAO approved the proposal in principle, differences in the findings and accounting concepts among the various services led GAO to conclude that the specific request was not adequately supported. Accordingly, until the cost studies by the various services showed a coordinated and reasonably consistent basis, GAO could not endorse the change. B-115800/B-117604, August 17, 1976.", "The authority recognized in this line of decisions applies to claims discovered after the fact. An agency may not \u201cwaive\u201d recovery in advance, that is, where the potential overpayment is known or can be readily determined before the payment is made. 49 Comp. Gen. 359 (1969). \u201cFor example, low collection rates and high collection costs may be symptoms of ineffective and inefficient collection techniques, which if improved, would require a reevaluation of minimums previously established. Also cost benefit analyses should not always be the sole determinant for the termination of claims. Other factors, which are not easily quantifiable, such as maintaining the integrity of a collection program, should also be considered.\u201d", "While, as we have already noted, the costs of administrative hearings and reviews may be considered when evaluating termination of individual claims under 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.3(c), they should not be used in establishing categorical minimum debt amounts or points of diminishing returns. 65 Comp. Gen. 893 (1986). The practical rationale behind this position should be apparent. If you announce up front that you will not pursue collection action on debts of a particular type under, say, $1,000, you virtually eliminate any incentive for voluntary payment.", "There are two exceptions to the requirement for cost studies. The first is for nominal amounts. In 58 Comp. Gen. 372 (1979), the Interior Department asked whether, under the Federal Claims Collection Act, it could forgo collection action on underpayments of $1 or less of reclamation fees paid by coal mine operators under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977. The Comptroller General noted that \u201cit may safely be presumed, without cost studies, that in cases of $1 or less collection action will always exceed the amount recoverable.\u201d Id. at 375. Therefore, construing the termination provision in the Federal Claims Collection Act in light of its purpose, the Comptroller General held that Interior could make a categorical determination to forgo collection action on underpayments of $1 or less, based on the diminishing returns concept, without the need for cost studies. See also 18 Comp. Gen. 838 (1939) ($1); B-134617, January 30, 1958 ($2). The rule applies equally to debts owed by federal civilian and military personnel. 65 Comp. Gen. 893 (1986).", "The second exception involves claims against a group or class of persons where the individual amounts are small, the administrative burden of identifying the debtors and computing the amounts would be disproportionately high, and the individual claims would be eligible for waiver consideration. The first case in point was B-181467, July 29, 1976. The Air Force discovered that it had been overpaying night differential and Sunday premium pay to local employees at Clark Air Base in the Philippines. Since (1) the amount of the individual debts was minor, (2) the administrative costs of identifying the overpayments would have been excessive, and (3) the individual debts would have been eligible for waiver anyway, GAO concluded that the Air Force could terminate collection action. This decision was followed in B-188000, October 12, 1977, and again in B-184947, March 21, 1978.", "The most recent decision on this point, B-206699.1/B-206699.2, September 15, 1988, jointly considered two separate problems. In the first case, the Air Force uncovered erroneous overpayments of compensation over a one-year period to nearly 5,000 National Guard technicians. In the second case, the Army undertook a project to reconcile personnel and pay records and discovered minor discrepancies that had resulted in small overpayments to approximately 10,000 persons. In both cases, it was established that the individual debts were small, administrative costs of identification and collection would be excessively disproportionate, and the individual cases would be subject to consideration for waiver. In both cases, GAO agreed with agency proposals to forgo collection action.", "Termination, write-off, and close-out are three different things. Termination, discussed above, refers to the creditor agency\u2019s decision to discontinue active collection efforts. Once the decision to terminate collection action has been made, the logical next step is to remove the debt from the agency\u2019s accounting records, i.e., to stop carrying it as a receivable. This step is called write-off. Thus, the proper terminology is: you terminate collection action, and then you write off the debt from your receivables.", "Termination and write-off occur either simultaneously or in very close time proximity. Since it is undesirable to carry an active receivable on which no further action is being taken or contemplated, there should be no significant delay between termination and write-off.", "The concept of write-off applies equally to a judgment debt which has, to the agency\u2019s reasonable satisfaction, become uncollectible. 34 Comp. Gen. 148 (1954). There is no need to first attempt execution on the judgment where the facts indicate it would not be warranted. B-120956, October 6, 1955. \u201cConcerning the legality of taking action to satisfy an indebtedness once it has been declared uncollectible, it appears that an administrative determination of uncollectibility is for accounting purposes only and, as such, does not preclude the subsequent satisfaction of the indebtedness should the opportunity to do so thereafter be presented to the administrative office.\u201d", "See also GAO Policy and Procedures Manual for Guidance of Federal Agencies, title 4, \u00a7 70.6; B-182512-O.M., August 6, 1975.", "Largely within their discretion, agencies may retain administrative records (as opposed to accounting records) of inactive debt accounts for possible future reactivation, and may do so indefinitely.", "At some point, the agency may determine that even retaining an inactive record is futile. At this point, the agency closes out the debt. Close-out is the agency\u2019s final disposition of the debt. Depending on the circumstances, write-off and close-out may occur at the same time, or write-off may precede close-out by a potentially substantial amount of time.", "Once the debt is closed out, it should be reported to the Internal Revenue Service on Form 1099-G under the authorities previously discussed in connection with compromise.", "Close-out precludes reactivation of the account. The agency may still accept voluntary payments, but may no longer take any further collection action. A written-off account is inactive; a closed-out account is dead.", "Further discussion and guidance on the concepts of write-off and close-out may be found in: OMB Circular No. A-129, Managing Federal Credit Programs; Managing Government Credit: A Supplement to the Treasury Financial Manual, chapter 5; and Treasury Financial Management Service, The Governmentwide Task Force Final Report on Write-Off (August 1988)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "10. Waiver", "paragraphs": ["If one private individual owes a debt to another, the creditor might decide, for any number of reasons, that it \u201cjust isn\u2019t right\u201d to enforce collection. A federal agency, as we have seen, is not free to do the same thing. The agency must attempt collection unless that duty is removed in some legally authorized manner. Yet, as we also noted earlier, increasing the ranks of the homeless is not one of the objectives of federal debt collection. We have already discussed some of the ways Congress has provided to relieve an agency of its duty to attempt collection in full in appropriate circumstances, specifically compromise and termination. One more should be noted\u2014waiver. \u201cWaiver\u201d of a debt is a forgiveness of the debt and relieves the debtor from having to repay it.

It differs from termination in that termination does not eliminate the debtor\u2019s liability whereas a debt which has been waived no longer exists and cannot be reopened.", "Since waiver amounts to the giving away of government rights or property, it requires statutory authority. Absent a statutory basis, no federal agency is authorized to waive a debt claim owing to the United States. For example, a 1971 decision concluded that the Labor Department was not authorized to waive the recovery of overpayments made under the Disaster Relief Act of 1970. B-171934, April 2, 1971. Similarly, the Federal Emergency Management Agency lacks authority to issue regulations providing for the forgiveness of debts owed to the government. B-201054, April 27, 1981. Along the same lines, the compromise, suspension, and termination authority of the Federal Claims Collection Act applies to overpayments by the Department of Labor under the Redwood Employee Protection Program although there would be no authority to \u201cwaive\u201d the claims. B-195188, June 17, 1981.", "Neither the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 nor the Debt Collection Act of 1982 authorizes anyone (the creditor agency, GAO, or the Justice Department) to waive debt claims. E.g., B-159708, September 23, 1966. Congress has, however, authorized waiver in a number of specific contexts. \u201cIn any case in which more than the correct amount of payment has been made, there shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recovery by the United States from, any person who is without fault if such adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of [the old-age, survivors, or disability insurance programs] or would be against equity and good conscience.\u201d", "The essence of a mandatory waiver statute is that the agency has a \u201cduty to decide\u201d (Yamasaki, 442 U.S. at 694 n.9) and recovery is prohibited until the decision has been made. The decision may be an actual decision on the merits, or it may take place by default. To illustrate, the Supreme Court in Yamasaki expressly approved the way the Social Security Administration administered 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404(b). In each overpayment case, SSA would send a notice to the recipient advising of his or her right to request waiver. If the recipient made a request, SSA would consider the merits and make a decision. Failure to submit a request within the time limit prescribed by regulation was tantamount to a denial. 442 U.S. at 694.", "Other mandatory waiver statutes will generally resemble the SSA provision. Several are cited in Yamasaki, 442 U.S. at 694 n.9. Sometimes it is not quite so clear. One example, described in 63 Comp. Gen. 10, 13 (1983), is found in the Black Lung Benefit Program legislation. Under 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 940, amendments made by the Black Lung Benefits Act of 1972 with respect to claims filed on or before December 31, 1973, also apply to claims filed after that date. The 1972 act had amended 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(b) to make section 204 of the Social Security Act applicable to the Black Lung Program. Section 204 is 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 404, the very provision the Supreme Court had considered in Yamasaki. Thus, post-1973 black lung benefit claims are subject to a mandatory waiver statute. \u201cAdjustment or recovery by the United States may not be made when incorrect payment has been made to an individual who is without fault and when adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.\u201d", "This looks very much like the SSA statute but the wording is not identical. Title 5 was recodified in 1966. The pre-1966 language was \u201cthere shall be no adjustment or recovery\u201d (63 Stat. 864), the same as the SSA provision. Since recodifications are not intended to make substantive changes, this too is clearly a mandatory waiver statute.", "Where a mandatory waiver statute applies, notice of the right to request waiver should be included in agency\u2019s first demand letter.", "Under a permissive or discretionary waiver statute, recovery is not prohibited pending the waiver determination. A common example is 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5584, under which erroneous payments to civilian employees of pay and allowances, including travel, transportation, and relocation payments, \u201cmay be waived in whole or in part\u201d by the agency for claims of $1,500 or less ($10,000 or less for the judicial branch), or by GAO for claims exceeding $1,500, when the recipient is without fault and when collection \u201cwould be against equity and good conscience and not in the best interests of the United States.\u201d GAO has issued implementing regulations, found at 4 C.F.R. Parts 91 and 92, most recently reissued on September 30, 1991 (56 Fed. Reg. 49582). The statute comes into play only when there has been an actual payment for which an employee is indebted to the government; it does not authorize the waiver of erroneous advice. 66 Comp.

E.g., B-190806, April 13, 1978 (Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation).", "The waiver statutes, at least those GAO helps administer, contemplate considering the circumstances of individual cases. Thus, GAO has been reluctant to grant \u201cblanket waivers.\u201d One exception is B-222776, June 16, 1986. Legislation enacted in 1986 retroactively changed the formula for computing the hourly rate of pay for federal employees. The result was a small overpayment for most civilian employees (e.g., 6 cents an hour for a GS-13). In response to a request from the Chairman of the House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, GAO concluded that this was an appropriate situation to grant a blanket waiver for all affected employees.", "In our preceding discussion of suspension of collection action, we noted that one of the relevant factors identified in the Federal Claims Collection Standards is whether refund would be authorized. Some waiver statutes provide for refund of amounts already collected if the waiver is granted. E.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5584(c). Others do not. See, e.g., 51 Comp. Gen. 419, 422 (1972), with respect to the waiver provision of the Government Employees Training Act. Under a waiver statute which does not authorize refund, waiver may be ineffective with respect to amounts already paid because waiver is the relinquishment of an existing right, and to the extent payment has already been made, there is no longer a debt and therefore nothing to waive. Id.", "In B-146111, July 6, 1961, an employee of the Federal Aviation Agency had received training under the Government Employees Training Act, had signed an agreement to continue working for the FAA for a specified time, and then resigned in violation of the agreement. The FAA recovered the training expenses from the individual and deposited the money in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Seven months later, the individual rejoined the agency. The agency wanted to waive the debt under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 4108(c) and refund the amount recovered. Since the collection and deposit had been entirely proper when made, the permanent appropriation for refunding money \u201cerroneously received and covered\u201d (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(b)(2)) could not be used, and there was no other authority to make the refund.", "GAO considered a similar fact pattern in B-208064, November 15, 1983. As in B-146111, the question was whether the agency could refund amounts previously collected upon the debtor\u2019s re-employment. Part of the debt had been collected by offset against salary and leave payments due at the time of resignation. Essentially following 51 Comp. Gen. 419, GAO concluded that this amount could not be refunded. With respect to the remaining portion of the debt, the agency had contacted the Office of Personnel Management to collect from the debtor\u2019s Civil Service Retirement Fund account. However, the agency did not actually receive the money from OPM until after the debtor had become re-employed. The decision held that this portion could be refunded since it had not been \u201ccollected\u201d at the time of waiver.", "The Supreme Court\u2019s Yamasaki decision, and those portions of the Federal Claims Collection Standards which apply it, have altered the rules of some of the earlier decisions. For example, one of the precedents cited in 51 Comp. Gen. 419 for the proposition that waiver is ineffective where the debt has already been extinguished is 8 Comp. Gen. 664 (1929). That case, however, involved what is clearly a mandatory waiver statute. If the question in 8 Comp. Gen. 664 arose today, the answer would be that recovery should not have been made prior to the waiver decision. If the debt had been collected prior to the waiver decision and the money deposited as miscellaneous receipts, the collection would be erroneous and could be refunded using the \u201cerroneously received and covered\u201d appropriation. E.g., 71 Comp. Gen. 464 (1992). Thus, for the most part, if the waiver statute is mandatory, it no longer makes a difference whether the statute itself authorizes refund in view of Yamasaki and the mandatory suspension provision of 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.2(c).", "If the waiver statute is permissive, lack of refund authority can still present a problem, as in 51 Comp. Gen. 419, although careful application of the suspension standards will eliminate the problem in most cases. We say \u201cmost cases\u201d because, for example, in B-146111, July 6, 1961, suspension could not have been justified at the time the debt was collected. A possible solution, at least in offset cases, may be a bit of sleight-of-hand suggested in A-27376, March 12, 1930, and noted in B-146111, cited above\u2014a \u201ctentative withholding\u201d pending the waiver decision, as opposed to an \u201coffset tantamount to recovery.\u201d An agency following this approach should not credit any of the \u201ctentative withholding\u201d to miscellaneous receipts prior to the waiver decision."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "11.

A-51645, October 19, 1937, at 7.", "The rare situation may occur in which cash payment turns out to be no payment at all. To illustrate, we turn to \u201cthe strange case of Dr. Alm.\u201d In 1972, Dr. Donald J. Alm was a dentist in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, presumably with no particular involvement with the federal government. In March of that year, his minor son was kidnapped. Dr. Alm paid a ransom of $50,000 in $5, $10, and $20 bills, and his son was fortunately returned unharmed.", "The day after the ransom payment, someone named Diffie drove his truck to the offices of the Farmers Home Administration in Alma, Wisconsin, carried in a suitcase filled with stacks of $10 and $20 bills, and used the money to repay a $20,000 loan. Two days later, Diffie was arrested and charged with the kidnapping. He pleaded guilty and, along with two accomplices, was sent to jail. The cash used to pay the Farmers Home loan was confirmed to be part of the ransom money. Dr. Alm, naturally, asked the FmHA to return his money.", "Of course, life is not that simple. There is a rule that a party who accepts cash in the normal course of business, without actual or constructive knowledge that it was illegally obtained, is not required to return it. The rule is premised on the need for certainty in business dealings. E.g., Holly v. Missionary Society, 180 U.S. 284, 293 (1901). Or, put another way, where the equities are equal, the law will not transfer a loss from one innocent party to another, but will leave it where it falls. Id. at 295.", "This was little comfort to Dr. Alm, who had done absolutely nothing wrong. GAO reviewed the case at the request of the House Judiciary Committee, and suggested that there might be a way out.

B-177344, April 20, 1973. FmHA apparently agreed and returned the money. The Court of Claims subsequently confirmed what all had conceded\u2014that Dr. Alm did not have a legal claim against the government. Whether he had an equitable claim was mooted by the return of the money. Alm v. United States, 204 Ct. Cl. 791 (1974).", "There is no general prohibition on the acceptance of personal checks. If payment is tendered in the form of a personal check, it should be made clear that the check is being accepted subject to collection only. This protects the collecting officer from liability if the check should \u201cbounce.\u201d See 3 Comp. Gen. 403 (1924); B-201673 et al., September 23, 1982.

(3) Credit cards Except where expressly prohibited, a federal agency may accept commercial credit card transactions in payment for goods and services provided by the government or in payment of debts, subject to certain safeguards. Acceptance of payment by credit card: should not result in any significant increase in cost to the government; should facilitate and enhance the agency\u2019s collection activities; and should protect the government by means of credit card company guarantees to reimburse the government for all properly conducted transactions. 67 Comp.

The exception would be where a credit card is being used to pay a delinquent debt, in which case the credit card company\u2019s commission may be treated as an administrative cost to be assessed against the debtor under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3717(e)(1). 67 Comp. Gen. at 49 n.1.", "There is one potential drawback to the use of credit cards. In the typical commercial arrangement, the credit card company deducts its fee from the amount to be paid over to the vendor. However, federal agencies are required by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3302(b) to deposit collections in the Treasury without deduction.

(4) Payment in kind The Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards generally contemplate payment in money. One provision of the Federal Claims Collection Standards, 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.9, prohibits accepting a percentage of a debtor\u2019s profits or stock in a debtor corporation in compromise of a claim. Apart from this, however, there is no blanket prohibition on accepting payment in kind, at least under a compromise. See generally 37 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 298 (1933); B-229068.4, August 3, 1988. Of course, this assumes the absence of any other statutory restriction or prohibition applicable to the particular case.

It depends on whether the transaction constitutes what the lawyers call an \u201caccord and satisfaction.\u201d The term \u201caccord and satisfaction\u201d means, in essence, an agreement to accept in full payment an amount less than the amount claimed, coupled with the actual payment of the agreed-upon amount.

More precisely, our prior decisions indicate that identification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three distinct factors: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government\u2019s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.\u201d", "Id. at 334 35.

Unfortunately, there is no simple formula for determining the appropriate level of formality. For further discussion, see Mathews v.

Since enactment of the Debt Collection Act in 1982 and the 1984 revision of the Standards, the applicable procedures for most administrative offsets are provided by statute or governmentwide regulation. It is nevertheless important to understand constitutional due process, for several reasons: (1) The constitutional requirement, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, forms the basis against which statutory or regulatory procedures will be measured. (The constitutional standard is the minimum. Congress may\u2014and has done so in certain instances\u2014provide procedural protections by statute beyond what the Constitution would otherwise require.) (2) Although many offset statutes do not specify procedural protections, a fair reading of judicial precedent compels the conclusion that some will be required. As the Comptroller General has stated, \u201cthe question would seem to be not whether procedural protections are required, but what form they should take.\u201d 64 Comp. Gen. 142, 148 (1984).

Supp. 19 (D.D.C. 1989).

If the debt is delinquent and the debtor has not disputed its existence or amount, an agency should accept a repayment agreement in lieu of offset only if the debtor is able to establish that offset would result in undue financial hardship or would be against equity and good conscience.\u201d 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.3(b)(2)(i). \u201cAn agency,\u201d added the 1984 preamble, \u201cis not required to accept an unreasonable proposal.\u201d 49 Fed.

The Standards incorporate this point in 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.3(b)(5), which permits taking the offset prior to completion of the required procedures if necessary to protect the government\u2019s ability to collect the debt. The preamble emphasizes that this permits deviation from the time sequence, not elimination of the procedures. 49 Fed. Reg. at 8891. An agency availing itself of this deviation must provide the appropriate procedures promptly after the offset.

There is, as of the date of this publication, no centralized data bank of persons or organizations indebted to the government. Some favor such a concept because it would greatly facilitate collection. Others, invoking undesirable Orwellian imagery, oppose it. Whatever one\u2019s views on this question, the fact is that a centralized governmentwide data base for debt collection purposes does not exist.", "There is only a partial and limited solution, based on probabilities and common sense. It is clearly not feasible for an agency to check with every other federal agency before making a payment. A selective check, however, may be useful in appropriate cases. For example, an agency making payment to a group of individuals might check with the Department of Education for delinquent student loans. If farmers are involved, the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS), Department of Agriculture, may be able to help. The ASCS maintains a listing at the county level of persons indebted under ASCS programs. This is called the Federal Debt Register or Claims Control Record. In addition, the ASCS will cooperate in offsetting debts owed by ASCS program participants to other agencies. 7 C.F.R. \u00a7 13.6.

Therefore, the agency has discretionary authority to accept a repayment bond if it determines that offset is not feasible. B-167635, November 18, 1975. The factors noted in the 1948 decision are, of course, relevant in making this determination, keeping in mind that an officer of the United States is expected to protect the interests of the United States. The device should therefore be used sparingly. (3) Setoff against security deposit As a general proposition, a security deposit being held by the government should not be used to offset a debt which arose under a separate contract, unless authorized by the solicitation or contract under which the deposit was given.

The National Park Service held two separate sums of money against which it wanted to offset the debt owed under the permit\u2014a cash bond the contractor had deposited to insure compliance with the permit, and a cash bond submitted under a separate logging contract which had been completed. The Comptroller General concluded that the cash bond given in connection with the permit could be retained as an offset, but that the bond given under the separate contract should be returned to the contractor. \u201cThe general rule of law is that a pledge to secure a specific debt or obligation may not be held by the pledgee as security for any other obligation, and a refusal to return the pledge after the obligation it secures has been performed .\u201d Id. at 263.", "A few years later, the 1953 decision was overruled by 38 Comp.

In B-154380, June 24, 1964, the Forest Service incurred costs in suppressing a fire caused by the contractor\u2019s use of explosives in disregard of contract provisions. The contract provided that the purchaser would bear the costs of suppressing negligently caused fires, but was silent as to the disposition of deposit balances.

Another group of cases involves bid deposits by unsuccessful bidders. Two early decisions held that the deposits could be used to offset debts arising under other contracts.

Gen. 401 (1968).", "To sum up, a bid deposit by an unsuccessful bidder may not be retained to offset prior claims unless provided in the solicitation. Where there is an actual contract, whether completed or defaulted, a security deposit may be used to offset claims arising under the same contract unless otherwise restricted, but may not be used to offset debts under other contracts unless expressly provided. The terms of the contract or solicitation under which the deposit is provided will be the controlling factor. (4) The Army Holdup List A highly useful aid in offsetting contract debts is the \u201cList of Contractors Indebted to the United States,\u201d more commonly known as the \u201cArmy Holdup List,\u201d published by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS), Indianapolis Center.

The information will thus be available to other federal agencies for offset purposes. A case in which the Holdup List was successfully used is 4-J Sales & Service, DOT BCA No. 1904, 89-1 BCA \u00b6 21,209 (1988). It is the responsibility of the creditor agency to report any changes, corrections, or deletions.", "Any administrative procedures required in establishing the debt should be completed by the creditor agency prior to reporting the debt to DFAS, and the report should so state.", "While the Army Holdup List is designed primarily for contract debts, noncontractual debts may be reported as well. B-184506, October 29, 1975 (claim for return of refunded license fee). However, debts of individuals who have no contracts with the government should not be reported. (5) Debt Collection Act vs. Contract Disputes Act The preceding sections, for the most part, have discussed the government\u2019s basic right to use offset to collect contract debts. They have not addressed what procedures must be followed.", "Until the 1980s, it was fairly well settled that the Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards applied to government claims arising from procurement contracts. For example, in Commercial Building Maintenance Service, DOT CAB Nos. 72-14, 72-15, 72-2 BCA \u00b6 9527 (1972), the Federal Aviation Administration had asserted a claim for excess reprocurement costs against a defaulted contractor, and the only issue was the contractor\u2019s assertion of financial inability to pay. The board held that there was nothing for it to resolve, and remanded the case to the contracting officer for appropriate action under the Federal Claims Collection Act and Standards.", "The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 established new procedures for the adjudication of claims by and against the government relating to procurement contracts. The Contract Disputes Act does not address collection techniques and, by itself, had little impact on debt collection apart from designating the contracting officer and the boards of contract appeals as the appropriate tribunals for adjudicating contract claims.", "With the enactment of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, primarily 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716, what had been a simple matter became controversial. Questions soon arose over the extent to which the Debt Collection Act applied to procurement contracts. The heart of the issue seems to be the procedural requirements of section 3716 and whether they mandate another layer of procedures over and above the Contract Disputes Act. Nothing in the Debt Collection Act itself or its legislative history addresses the question. \u201cContrary to its allegations, 4-J has not been deprived of due process. The requirements of due process were satisfied by the Contract Disputes Act having afforded 4-J the opportunity to contest the two Army contracting officer decisions. Having failed to exercise the rights given by the Act, 4-J cannot now be heard to allege that it has been deprived of due process.\u201d", "Be that as it may, others did perceive a conflict, and a minor flood of litigation ensued. The first wave of cases generally found 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716 inapplicable where the amount due the government and the payment against which it is to be offset arise under the same contract.

Emphasizing that the Debt Collection Act did not abrogate the government\u2019s common-law right of offset, which applies to both inter-contractual and intra-contractual debts, the court not only held 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716 inapplicable to the offset under the same contract (the Avco result), but went a step further and held it inapplicable as well to the offsets under the separate contracts.", "It would thus appear settled that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716 will for the most part not apply to offsets under the same contract. The extent to which Cecile Industries may or may not mandate the same result for offsets under separate contracts is likely to engender further debate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "d. Other Specific Contexts", "paragraphs": ["(1) Transportation claims As a general proposition, the Federal Claims Collection Act and the government\u2019s right of setoff apply fully to transportation claims against carriers, augmented by a separate provision of law, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3726(b), which authorizes the government to use administrative offset to recoup overcharges not later than 3 years after payment of a carrier\u2019s bill.", "The Court of Claims has held that 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3726(b) does not extinguish the government\u2019s common-law right of offset. IML Freight, Inc. v. United States, 639 F.2d 676 (Ct. Cl. 1980); Burlington Northern Inc. v. United States, 462 F.2d 526 (Ct. Cl. 1972). Thus, administrative offset is not limited to the recovery of overcharges, but may be used to collect claims resulting from such things as freight loss damage (IML) and unauthorized use of government property (Burlington).", "The government becomes entitled to invoke setoff when it establishes a prima facie case of carrier liability which the carrier is unable to rebut. The government establishes a prima facie case of liability by showing that the shipment was delivered to the carrier at origin in good condition (evidenced, for example, by a bill of lading signed by the carrier without exception), that the shipment arrived at its destination in damaged condition, and by establishing the amount of damages. Decisions applying the government\u2019s right of setoff to transportation claims include 56 Comp. Gen. 264 (1977); B-193101, March 12, 1979; B-191889, October 2, 1978, aff\u2019d upon reconsideration, B-191889, May 16, 1979; B-181871, February 11, 1977.", "Other cases under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3726(b) involve issues of corporate identity resulting from mergers, corporate acquisitions, etc. The rules are discussed in 61 Comp. Gen. 526 (1982) and B-193966, April 12, 1979. (2) Trust funds As a general proposition, funds which the government is holding as trustee are not subject to setoff to liquidate government claims against the beneficiaries, at least where the funds cannot be regarded as government funds. For example, federal prisoners\u2019 trust funds are not subject to setoff to satisfy government claims against the inmates. 48 Comp. Gen. 249 (1968). The same result would presumably apply to the trust accounts of patients in Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals. Similarly, funds received from the Government of Poland awarded to a claimant by the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under the International Claims Settlement Act of 1949 could not be used to set off the claimant\u2019s indebtedness to the United States. B-180825-O.M., July 23, 1974. A similar situation would be funds withheld from a contractor and transferred to GAO under the Davis-Bacon Act in specific amounts for specified employees. See 46 Comp. Gen. 178 (1966).", "However, where the funds constitute government funds, they may be subject to setoff even though held in a trust capacity. 34 Comp. Gen. 152 (1954) (moneys held in trust for Indians available to set off indebtedness of Indian to government); B-121910, November 29, 1954 (same); B-121946, January 5, 1956 (claimant\u2019s debt to government may be set off against award by Foreign Claims Settlement Commission under War Claims Act of 1948). Thus, in determining whether setoff is available, it is necessary to examine the nature of the funds as well as their status as trust funds, plus, of course, any applicable statutory restrictions. (3) Setoff and bankruptcy This section will summarize the effect of a debtor\u2019s bankruptcy on the government\u2019s right of setoff. The debtor may be a corporation or other business entity or an individual, including a government employee. The bankruptcy laws are complicated, and our objective here is merely to point out some of the more important principles involved.", "The bankruptcy laws have traditionally recognized the right of setoff. Subject to certain refinements specified in the statute, the Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States Code) preserves \u201cany right of a creditor to offset a mutual debt owing by such creditor to the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title against a claim of such creditor against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case . . . .\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(a). These are called \u201cpre-petition\u201d debts.", "The administrative offset authority of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716 does not apply in Title 11 bankruptcy cases. Matter of Mehrhoff, 88 B.R. 922, 931 (Bankr. S.D. Iowa 1988); In re Britton, 83 B.R. 914, 917 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1988). This is because subsection 3716(c)(2) expressly makes section 3716 inapplicable \u201cwhen a statute explicitly provides for or prohibits using administrative offset to collect the claim or type of claim involved,\u201d and the Bankruptcy Code is such a statute. \u201c(6) any act to collect, assess, or recover a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title; \u201c(7) the setoff of any debt owing to the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title against any claim against the debtor; . . .\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 362(a)(6), (a)(7).", "Thus, in order to invoke setoff under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, even if the government has filed a proof of claim, it is first necessary to petition the court for relief from the automatic stay. E.g., United States v. Rinehart, 88 B.R. 1014, 1018 (D.S.D. 1988), aff\u2019d in part, rev\u2019d in part, 887 F.2d 165 (8th Cir. 1989); In re Britton, 83 B.R. at 919; 68 Comp. Gen. 215, 219 (1989). Whether or not to grant the motion for relief is within the \u201cequitable discretion\u201d of the bankruptcy court. Rinehart, 88 B.R. at 1018. An attempted offset without obtaining relief from the automatic stay is illegal. Further, an agency may be found to have \u201cwaived\u201d its right to setoff by failing to timely assert it in the bankruptcy proceeding. In re Apex Int\u2019l Management Services, Inc., 155 B.R. 591, 595 96 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1993).", "The automatic stay also applies to the commencement or continuation of any judicial or administrative proceeding against the debtor that was or could have been commenced prior to filing. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(1). Whether a proceeding is \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d is determined by reference to the posture of the initial proceeding. Thus, if a proceeding was initiated by the debtor, a subsequent bankruptcy filing does not require the stay of appellate proceedings. Freeman v. Commissioner, 799 F.2d 1091 (5th Cir. 1986).", "The non-applicability of the automatic stay to proceedings initiated by the debtor may operate to permit certain setoffs. One such case is 4-J Sales & Service, DOT BCA No. 1904, 89-1 BCA \u00b6 21,209 (1988). The Army had asserted a claim against a defaulted contractor for excess reprocurement costs. Unable to collect, the Army added the contractor to the Army Holdup List. The Coast Guard noticed the listing and notified the contractor of its intent to offset against a Coast Guard contract. It did so, and transmitted the funds to the Army. Subsequently, the contractor filed a claim with the Coast Guard for return of the money, which the contracting officer denied, and also filed a petition in bankruptcy. The board found the setoff proper and unaffected by the automatic stay provision of 11 U.S.C.  \u00a7 362.", "A debtor may be able to avoid a setoff made within 90 days prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition. Depending on the case law in the particular jurisdiction, the legal basis may be 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547(b) (preferential transfer) or 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553(b) (avoidable offset). Cases discussing each approach, respectively and in detail, are In re Hancock, 137 B.R. 835 (Bankr. N.D. Okla. 1992), and In re Hankerson, 133 B.R. 711 (Bankr. E.D. Penn. 1991). Both cases involved attempted offsets against tax refunds under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720A.", "Setoff under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 requires \u201cmutuality of parties.\u201d The debts must be \u201cin the same right and between the same parties, standing in the same capacity.\u201d 4 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b6 553.04 (15th ed. 1985). The question of whether the requisite mutuality exists between different federal agencies has engendered considerable litigation. The majority of courts have held that it does. For example, in United States v. Rinehart, 88 B.R. 1014 (D.S.D. 1988), the Small Business Administration wanted to set off a claim for defaulted loan repayments against program payments owed to the debtor by the Commodity Credit Corporation. Although the setoff was found to be improper because SBA had violated the automatic stay provision, the court held that SBA and CCC stood in mutual capacity for purposes of section 553. Other cases expressing the majority rule are In re Apex Int\u2019l Management Services, Inc., 155 B.R. 591, 594 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1993); Matter of Butz, 154 B.R. 541 (S.D. Iowa 1993); Waldron v. Farmers Home Administration, 75 B.R. 25 (N.D. Tex. 1987); In re Sound Emporium, Inc., 70 B.R. 22 (W.D. Tex. 1987), aff\u2019g 48 B.R. 1 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1984); In re Mohar, 140 B.R. 273 (Bankr. D. Mont. 1992); In re Fryar, 93 B.R. 101 (Bankr. W.D. Tex. 1988); In re Britton, 83 B.R. 914 (Bankr. E.D.N.C. 1988).", "Cases taking a contrary view and denying mutuality where different agencies are involved include In re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc., 164 B.R. 839 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1994); In re Hancock, 137 B.R. 835 (Bankr. N.D. Okla. 1992); Matter of Mehrhoff, 88 B.R. 922 (Bankr. S.D. Iowa 1988). Mehrhoff relied on the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision in In re Rinehart, 76 B.R. 746 (Bankr. D.S.D. 1987). However, that portion of the decision was subsequently repudiated by the district court in United States v. Rinehart, cited above.", "In addition, the mutuality for purposes of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 must exist \u201cbefore the commencement of the case.\u201d In other words, the debt owing to the government and the debtor\u2019s claim against the government must both be pre-petition. Thus, if both claims are in existence at the time the petition in bankruptcy is filed, setoff will generally be appropriate. 7 Comp. Gen. 186 (1927); 7 Comp. Gen. 576 (1928); 18 Comp. Gen. 301 (1938).", "For example, in two cases involving bankrupt carriers, setoff was proper where both the credit due the carrier for services rendered and the carrier\u2019s debt to the government arose prior to the filing of the petition in bankruptcy. B-150463-O.M., March 18, 1963; B-149191-O.M., August 3, 1962. Similarly, the Navy could set off a member\u2019s indebtedness stemming from various overpayments against unpaid leave rations where both obligations pre-dated the member\u2019s filing of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. B-195066, September 22, 1980. See also 56 Comp. Gen. 279 (1977); B-123016, April 11, 1955; B-129669-O.M., December 11, 1956; B-117500-O.M., November 4, 1953.", "Where one obligation arises prior to filing the petition and the other obligation arises after the filing, setoff is improper. For example, overcharges for transportation performed before the carrier filed its petition in bankruptcy could not be set off against post-petition bills payable to the carrier by the General Services Administration. B-192974, March 29, 1979. Reversing the sequence, overcharges for services rendered subsequent to the filing could not be collected by setoff against credits for pre-petition services. B-150294-O.M., March 27, 1963. See also B-129669-O.M., December 11, 1956.", "The fact that a debt is contingent and unliquidated does not necessarily preclude setoff under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553. The Bankruptcy Code defines \u201cdebt\u201d as \u201cliability on a claim,\u201d and \u201cclaim\u201d as including \u201cright to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 101(11), 101(4). The Britton and Fryar cases cited above include discussions of this issue.", "While setoff under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 usually involves pre-petition debts, there is some authority for allowing the setoff of mutual post-petition debts. In re Apex Int\u2019l Management Services, Inc., 155 B.R. 591, 594 95 (Bankr. M.D. Fla. 1993). Of course, if both obligations arise post-petition and the bankrupt\u2019s debt to the government is not included in the discharge in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy proceedings have no bearing and setoff is proper. 45 Comp. Gen. 342, 345 (1965).", "The concept of mutuality is also relevant to setoffs against an employee\u2019s retirement account. An employee is not entitled to the sums in his or her retirement account until the employee leaves federal service by retirement or resignation. Thus, where an employee files bankruptcy and continues in federal employment, the money in the employee\u2019s retirement account does not become part of the estate in bankruptcy and is not available for setoff since it does not constitute an obligation owed by the government at the time the bankruptcy petition is filed. See 22 Comp. Gen. 330 (1942); B-185731, March 3, 1976 (non-decision letter).", "The mutuality concept has also been applied by analogy in state court liquidation and insolvency proceedings. In B-167886/B-174985, June 1, 1978, the Comptroller General held setoff proper against a surety which was being liquidated in a state court proceeding, since the debts and credits being set off accrued before commencement of the liquidation proceeding. The government did not waive its right of setoff by filing proofs of claim in the proceeding.", "In a 1986 Claims Court case, the Government Printing Office was trying to collect a claim for excess reprocurement costs from a defaulted contractor by offset against the proceeds of other completed contracts. A state court had declared the contractor insolvent and had appointed an assignee for benefit of creditors. Since the assignee had been appointed prior to the default termination, the court found that mutuality of parties existed. Noting that federal bankruptcy law had no direct application in the case, the court affirmed a board of contract appeals decision sustaining the setoff. Tatelbaum v. United States, 10 Cl. Ct. 207 (1986).", "A completing surety has priority over a trustee in bankruptcy. 8 Comp. Gen. 58 (1928). Also, a completing performance bond surety is entitled to reimbursement of its actual completion costs free from setoff of the contractor\u2019s debts. Combining these two concepts, where a performance bond surety has undertaken to complete the remaining work left by a defaulted contractor which had filed a bankruptcy petition, contract funds in the hands of the government are payable first to the completing surety to reimburse its completion costs, without setoff for the contractor\u2019s tax indebtedness. 58 Comp. Gen. 295 (1979).", "A discharge in bankruptcy releases the bankrupt from legal liability on all debts included in the discharge. 45 Comp. Gen. 342 (1965); 22 Comp. Gen. 1119 (1943); 22 Comp. Gen. 330 (1942); B-194360, February 15, 1980; B-192974, March 29, 1979. A debt is included in the discharge if it was listed on the bankrupt\u2019s schedule of debts, even though the creditor was not served with notice of the proceedings or had no actual knowledge of them. A debt is discharged even if not listed on the schedule if the creditor has notice or actual knowledge of the proceedings. Failure by the creditor to file a proof of claim will not prevent operation of the discharge as a bar to a claim which is provable and which otherwise would be released. 22 Comp. Gen. 1119, 1120 (1943). \u201coperates as an injunction against the commencement or continuation of an action, the employment of process, or any act, to collect, recover or offset any such debt as a personal liability of the debtor, or from property of the debtor, whether or not discharge of such debt is waived.\u201d", "11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2). Thus, a debt discharged in bankruptcy cannot be set off against currently payable obligations (such as salary or a new claim) that arose subsequent to the discharge. 45 Comp. Gen. 342 (1965); B-194360, February 15, 1980. Nor may the debt be set off against retirement funds when they become payable. 22 Comp. Gen. 1119 (1943); 22 Comp. Gen. 330 (1942); B-185731, March 3, 1976. Similarly, the withholding of current social security benefit payments to recoup a discharged pre-petition benefit overpayment violates the injunction and may subject the government to sanctions. In re Cost, 161 B.R. 856 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 1993).", "However, a setoff allowable under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 may survive a discharge. For example, the Ninth Circuit has held that the right of setoff under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553 is not defeated by a discharge of pre-petition debts in a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In re De Laurentiis Entertainment Group, 963 F.2d 1269 (9th Cir. 1992). Similarly, the Internal Revenue Service can offset a tax claim against a refund, both pre-petition, notwithstanding the taxpayer\u2019s discharge in a Chapter 7 proceeding. Posey v. United States Department of the Treasury\u2014Internal Revenue Service, 156 B.R. 910 (W.D.N.Y. 1993). \u201ct would appear advisable in the interest of efficient and sound administration of Government affairs that officials of the department in which the person is currently employed be informed of the situation so as to enable them to decide whether it would be in the interest of the United States to permit that type of employee to continue in the service.\u201d 22 Comp.

The United States may also assert, by way of offset, a claim not arising out of the same transaction or occurrence, even if time-barred, but the claim is allowable only in an amount not in excess of the opposing party\u2019s recovery.", "What about administrative offsets? Does the running of a statute of limitations on bringing lawsuits preclude subsequent administrative offset? As a general proposition, the answer is no, unless the statute expressly provides that running of the time period will extinguish the liability as well as bar the remedy of a lawsuit. \u201cCourts have recognized and held that the fact that the statute of limitations bars a government suit to collect an amount due to it does not bar the government from invoking its administrative remedies to offset the indebtedness against other claims by the debtor.\u201d", "Similarly, setoff against a contractor for violations of the Walsh-Healey Act (41 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 35 45) is proper even after expiration of the applicable 2-year period for filing suit (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 255). 33 Comp. Gen. 66 (1953). See also Unexcelled Chemical Corp. v. United States, 149 F. Supp. 383 (Ct. Cl. 1957); Ready-Mix Concrete Co. v. United States, 130 F. Supp. 390 (Ct.

Gen. 633 (1975).", "When the issue began to arise in the context of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415, opinions split. GAO and one district court held that expiration of a period of limitations under section 2415 merely bars judicial enforcement but does not preclude subsequent administrative setoff. The Department of Justice and another district court concluded that offset was barred. \u201cThe provisions of this section shall not prevent the United States or an officer or agency thereof from collecting any claim of the United States by means of administrative offset, in accordance with section 3716 of title 31.\u201d", "However, Congress did not want to leave administrative offset open-ended. Therefore, it provided in section 10 of the Debt Collection Act that \u201cno claim under this Act  that has been outstanding for more than ten years may be collected by means of administrative offset.\u201d This provision is codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(c)(1), which renders section 3716 inapplicable \u201cto a claim under this subchapter that has been outstanding for more than 10 years.\u201d). Thus, administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716 is not affected by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415, but now has its own 10-year statute of limitations.", "The Federal Claims Collection Standards, in 4 C.F.R. \u00a7 102.3(b)(3), define \u201coutstanding\u201d in terms of when the government\u2019s right to collect the debt first accrued, and provide that the case law under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415 should be used to determine the date of accrual. The Standards also incorporate the \u201cknew or reasonably should have known\u201d tolling provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2416, noted previously. See, e.g., 64 Comp.

Plausible arguments can be made both ways. On the one hand, it was enacted as part of section 3716 and, at least on its face, does not purport to affect any other statute. Following this approach, GAO concluded in 63 Comp. Gen. 462 (1984) that the 10-year limitation did not apply to offsets under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5705 and 5724(f).", "Yet on the other hand, if all non-judicial offsets are varieties of administrative offset, there is no logical reason why the 10-year period, like the due process procedures of section 3716, should not apply to administrative offset under other statutes which do not contain their own limitation periods. Following this approach, the Office of Personnel Management has applied the 10-year limitation to offsets under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5514. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.1106, added by 51 Fed. Reg. 21325, June 12, 1986. The Secretary of the Treasury has done the same thing under the Tax Refund Offset Program. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6402-6(c)(1). GAO has applied the OPM regulations without question. B-232454, September 1, 1989.", "The question of taking administrative offset after expiration of a statute of limitations on bringing a lawsuit raised its head with increased vigor under the Tax Refund Offset Program, this time with a new twist. Under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720A, \u201clegally enforceable\u201d debts may be reported to the IRS for potential offset. A number of student loan recipients have argued that once the 6-year period for filing suit has expired, the debt is no longer \u201clegally enforceable\u201d for purposes of the offset program. Thus far, the courts have uniformly rejected this argument, holding that expiration of the statute of limitations bars a lawsuit but does not preclude subsequent administrative offset. Grider v.

Suppose in our first example that John ran into another vehicle instead of the telephone pole and the owner of that vehicle, a private citizen, filed a claim under the Federal Tort Claims Act. If John\u2019s agency paid the tort claim, it could not recoup from John. However, there would still be the question of liability for the damage to the government car.

See 51 Comp. Gen. 226 (1971).", "However, as noted, most agencies have no similar statutory direction. Absent statutory direction one way or the other, the rule is this: There is no authority to assess pecuniary liability against a government employee for losses resulting from error in judgment or neglect of duty unless the agency has issued regulations specifically providing for such liability. Restating the rule from a different perspective, a government employee may be held liable for losses resulting from his or her error or neglect if and to the extent the agency has issued regulations to that effect. The regulations serve to put the employee on notice of the potential liability.", "The earliest published decision spelling out the rule is 25 Comp. Gen. 299 (1945). In that case, the Comptroller General held that since the (then) National Housing Agency had not promulgated administrative regulations, it could not set off against the retirement accounts of two employees a loss it suffered by virtue of the employees\u2019 failure to have certain property properly surveyed.", "The concept arose again in 26 Comp. Gen. 866 (1947), in which a Commerce Department employee ordered fuel in violation of established procurement procedures, as a result of which the vendor billed the government in excess of the amount authorized under the General Supply Schedule. Since the employee had exceeded his authority, the government was not liable for the excess amount. As to the potential liability of the employee, the Comptroller General said that this was a matter to be resolved between the employee and the vendor. If, under the rule of 25 Comp. Gen. 299, the employee could not be charged for losses to the government in the absence of regulations, it followed that the government could not force the employee to pay for a loss sustained by a third party.", "The rule has been applied to bar recovery from an employee for a loss due to the negligent failure to take advantage of a prompt payment discount. 45 Comp.

Since the liability in the context of government employees is imposed by regulation, however, the agency can, in its discretion, apply a lesser standard (e.g., gross negligence) or a stricter one. GAO has cautioned that too strict a standard would not be wise. Id. Most reasonable people can understand having to bear the consequences of their own negligence. A stricter standard, however, apart from basic fairness, could adversely affect both employee morale and work productivity, since employees may well refuse to accept items of equipment for which they may be held strictly liable.", "Assessing negligence in cases involving loss or damage to items of office equipment (calculators, personal computers, dictating equipment, etc.) often boils down to questions of physical security. An employee has an obligation to take reasonable precautions to safeguard government property entrusted to his or her custody. What is adequate, however, depends on the circumstances. You cannot, for example, be faulted for not locking your office if you work in a cubicle without a door. The rule, to the extent one can be said to exist, is \u201cyou do the best you can with what is available to you.\u201d In addition, common sense dictates that employees should bring security weaknesses to the attention of appropriate supervisory personnel. If, for example, you request some sort of anchoring device for a personal computer and the agency fails to provide it, it is not your fault.

The Army proposed a program under which a member who lost, damaged, or destroyed an item of government property issued to him or her would be permitted to purchase a replacement at an Army Self-Service Supply Center for a sum equivalent to the value of the depreciated item. The difference between the purchase price of the replacement item and the amount paid by the individual soldier would be charged to appropriated funds. The Comptroller General found the proposal legally unobjectionable, but cautioned that the Army should establish adequate fund control procedures to ensure that the \u201cautomatic obligation\u201d feature of the program would not violate the Antideficiency Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. The Comptroller General also found that the use of appropriated funds to pay the \u201cdepreciation allowance\u201d would not constitute an unauthorized diversion of the funds from their intended purpose in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1301(a), since the Army\u2019s appropriations were available to acquire replacement property. 60 Comp.

The Comptroller General upheld the validity of these regulations in 59 Comp. Gen. 515 (1980). If the damage is not the employee\u2019s fault and the responsible party can be reasonably identified, GSA will absorb the cost or try to recover from the responsible party. The regulations specify that each agency is responsible for disciplining its employees who are guilty of damaging GSA vehicles through negligence or misconduct. 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 101-39.406(c).

For example, the statute itself further provides that the redemption period for a tax lien shall be 120 days or the period allowed by state law, whichever is longer. Federal tax liens are governed by detailed provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. The statute also refers to two other exceptions found elsewhere in the U.S. Code. The right to redeem provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(c) does not apply where the government\u2019s lien derives from (1) the issuance of insurance under the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701k), or (2) a loan guaranteed or insured by the Department of Veterans Affairs (38 U.S.C. \u00a7 3720(d)).", "At one point, based on the statutory context, the Comptroller General had expressed the view that the right of redemption under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(c) relates only \u201cinsofar as foreclosure sales are concerned, to such sales made pursuant to judicial action in a judicial proceeding, and not to a foreclosure sale made under a power of sale in a deed of trust without a judicial proceeding.\u201d B-100584, April 6, 1951. A later judicial opinion, however, concluded that the United States (with a junior lien) also has a right to redeem under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(c) when the superior lien has been foreclosed by a nonjudicial sale. United States v. Boyd, 246 F.2d 477 (5th Cir. 1957), cert. denied, 355 U.S. 889. If the right to redeem applies to a foreclosure of a superior lien by nonjudicial sale, it would logically apply also to a foreclosure by judicial sale where the United States, as junior lienholder, was not made a party to the action. B-169602, June 30, 1970 (non-decision letter).", "In a number of cases, the purchaser at a foreclosure sale has asked GAO to release the government\u2019s right of redemption under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(e), discussed below.

The cases have all been decided on some other basis, usually that the applicant is the owner of the property rather than a senior lienholder. E.g., B-194391, July 16, 1979. From this perspective, the issue seems largely moot.", "In any event, there may be other ways for a purchaser to remove the government\u2019s right of redemption, depending on the program agency\u2019s statutory authority. For example, in B-194391, July 16, 1979, the Comptroller General noted that the Small Business Administration has discretionary authority by statute to sell or otherwise dispose of claims or security, and to collect or compromise obligations. Under this authority, SBA could accept a monetary payment in exchange for the release of its right of redemption. In effect, SBA could \u201csell\u201d its right of redemption to the owner of the property.

A statute which bars rights of redemption under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(c) does not bar similar rights arising under state law. Thus, in one case the Federal Housing Administration had a right of redemption under state law even though the application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(c) was expressly prohibited by 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701k. The Comptroller General held that FHA could expend Title I funds to redeem the property if redemption was determined to be in the best interests of the government and necessary to carry out the provisions of Title I. 36 Comp.

Those requirements are: (1) The applicant for the release must be a senior lienholder and must apply in writing to the officer responsible for the administration of the laws giving rise to the government\u2019s lien. (2) The applicant\u2019s lien must be duly recorded in the jurisdiction in which the property is located. (3) The government\u2019s lien must be junior to the applicant\u2019s lien, and must not be a tax lien.

The most common situation involves a request by the fee simple owner of the property, who usually bought it at a foreclosure sale. The owner of the property is not a lienholder and therefore does not qualify under the statute to obtain a certificate of release. For example, in 58 Comp. Gen. 732 (1979), the applicant was an individual who had purchased the property at a foreclosure sale and was concerned because the United States had an outstanding unsatisfied judgment against one of the former owners. Although it was doubtful whether, under state law, the United States actually had a lien, the release could not be granted in any event because the applicant was the owner of the property rather than a senior lienholder.", "Failure to serve notice of the foreclosure proceeding on the United States, as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2410(b), does not affect the owner\u2019s status as owner for purposes of entitlement to a certificate of release under subsection (e).

An intervening change in the conditions may operate to disqualify an applicant.

Some of the other conditions tend to be more procedural, for example, the requirement that the program agency report its findings. Be that as it may, all of the conditions, including the procedural ones, must be satisfied before the release may be issued. While it seems clear that the absence of any of the conditions would be sufficient for the Comptroller General to decline to issue the release, the cases that have arisen so far tend to combine a procedural deficiency with one or more substantive failures.

FHA found that there were two additional senior liens on the property, and that the sum of the three senior liens was approximately three times the fair market value of the property. Based on this, FHA found that sale of the property would not produce sufficient proceeds to wholly or partly satisfy the government\u2019s lien, reported its findings to the Comptroller General, and the Comptroller General issued the certificate of release.", "Certificates of release were also issued in B-158387, February 9, 1966, and B-146068, June 21, 1961.

We sue each other and everyone else in sight over just about everything these days, so it seems, and suits against the government are no exception.", "In the early years of the Republic, this was not the case, because our legal system adopted from the English common law the concept of \u201csovereign immunity\u201d\u2014the firmly imbedded rule that the United States, as sovereign, cannot be sued without its consent. Consent is given (or, in other words, sovereign immunity is \u201cwaived\u201d) by the enactment of a statute authorizing suits of a given type.

The 1960s and 1970s saw a variety of environmental and civil rights legislation, perhaps the most important of which was the 1972 amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which made its employment discrimination provisions applicable to the federal government.", "Sovereign immunity is still a rule of law in the United States, but it now applies to a much smaller universe. Why has the United States given up such a favorable position? One rather mundane reason is that the flood of private relief bills became too much of a drain on congressional time and resources.

More importantly, however, there has been increasing recognition of the philosophy expressed by a Comptroller of the Treasury many years ago in 8 Comp.

Be that as it may, both because the expenditure of appropriated funds is involved and because the scope and complexity of litigation involving the government are constantly increasing, the payment process gives rise to a number of problem areas.", "At the present time, neither GAO nor anyone else in the federal government knows how much the United States pays out in judgments every year.

This being the case, the Comptrollers of the Treasury began holding that agency operating appropriations were not available to pay those judgments. The Comptrollers saw an element of illogic, at least in some situations, in saying that an appropriation which would have been clearly available to pay something if the matter never went to court ceased being available because the agency failed or refused to pay and a court told the agency to pay it. E.g., 8 Comp. Dec. 261, 262 (1901); 8 Comp. Dec. 145, 149 (1901). Despite these misgivings, the result in most cases was that specific appropriations were required.", "The practice of specifically appropriating for judgments became further solidified in 1904 by a statute (33 Stat. 422) which required that estimates for the payment of judgments be transmitted to Congress the same as other requests for appropriations. Against this legislative background, the rule became firmly entrenched that agency operating appropriations were not available to pay judgments. Exceptions were (and continue to be) recognized only where Congress had made some other provision, or established some other mechanism, for payment. E.g., 15 Comp. Gen. 933 (1936); 5 Comp.

Therefore, the repeal did not produce any change in the way judgments were paid. This legislative development is outlined, and the rule restated, in 34 Comp. Gen. 221 (1954). Thus, prior to 1956, judgments against the United States could be paid, for the most part, only upon enactment of specific congressional appropriations. Under this system, it was possible for Congress to refuse to appropriate the funds for a given judgment, leaving the judgment creditor with a valid entitlement against the United States but no funds legally available to satisfy it. Although there were instances where this happened (see, e.g., 47 Stat. 28 and 33 Stat. 422), it was rare. In Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, 370 U.S. 530, 570 (1962), the Supreme Court noted a 1933 study which had found 15 instances in a 70-year period where Congress had refused to pay a judgment.", "In the early 1950s, GAO recommended the enactment of a permanent general appropriation for judgments. The recommendation was designed to expedite the payment of judgments by eliminating the need for specific congressional appropriations, and to save the government money both by eliminating the largely ministerial appropriations and by reducing interest costs. The executive branch supported the proposal. It was not immediately enacted, however, because the original proposal contained language which some felt would authorize the Comptroller General to review the merits of a judgment prior to payment. The Judiciary especially expressed concern over this possibility, fearing that it could destroy the finality of judgments and lead to a situation in which the Comptroller General might deny a claim administratively, with the claimant then suing successfully and the Comptroller General refusing to pay the judgment for the same reasons he had originally denied the claim.", "The proposal was refined and, on July 27, 1956, was enacted as section 1302 of the Supplemental Appropriation Act of 1957, 70 Stat. 678, 694, now codified at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. As originally enacted, section 1304 applied only to judgments rendered pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2414 and 2517, and then only to judgments not in excess of $100,000, which it was then estimated would cover 98 99 percent of all judgments against the United States.", "Thus, as of July 1956, judgments less than $100,000 could be paid promptly under section 1304. Until the $100,000 limit was removed in 1977, however, judgments in excess of $100,000 continued to require specific congressional appropriations, which were made in supplemental appropriation acts. Under this procedure, summarized in B-162076, August 7, 1967, the Justice Department reported all judgments in excess of $100,000 to the Treasury Department as soon as they became final. As the time for the next supplemental appropriation request approached, the Office of Management and Budget notified Treasury and Treasury forwarded its recommendations for inclusion in the request. Congress generally provided the funds in the form of a lump-sum appropriation, with the specific judgments to which it applied listed in Senate and House Documents.

In order to take advantage of the judgment appropriation in cases where agency funds were not otherwise available, it became common practice to submit the compromise agreement or stipulation to the court, whether required or not, and to have the court issue it as a consent judgment. It had long been the view of the \u201caccounting officers\u201d that a judgment based upon such a stipulation was nevertheless a judgment and payable as such. E.g., 21 Comp. Dec. 705 (1915). Thus, the device of converting a compromise settlement into a consent judgment enabled it to be paid under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. In view of this practice, the limitation of the 1956 legislation to judgments turned out to make little difference as a practical matter except to require an additional step which, where not otherwise required, served little useful purpose. The extension of the judgment appropriation to include compromise settlements was therefore a logical application of the concept.", "The amendment to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2414 provided a standard for determining when compromise settlements are payable from the judgment appropriation. It states that compromise settlements \u201cshall be settled and paid in a manner similar to judgments in like causes and appropriations or funds available for the payment of such judgments are hereby made available for the payment of such compromise settlements.\u201d Thus, the rule is that a compromise settlement is payable from the same source that would apply to a judgment in the same suit. If a given action could result in a money judgment payable from the judgment appropriation, a compromise settlement of that action will be payable from the judgment appropriation. E.g., B-212134, June 29, 1983. If the action would not result in a money judgment payable from the judgment appropriation\u2014either because a resulting judgment would be payable from agency funds or because it would not result in a money judgment at all, such as a suit for an injunction\u2014then the judgment appropriation will not be available for a compromise settlement. E.g., B-248313, April 10, 1992 (internal memorandum); B-246660, March 20, 1992 (internal memorandum). See also B-182219, October 23, 1974 (judgment against official in individual capacity). To restate, a compromise settlement has no effect on the source of funds. This is also the position of the Department of Justice. 13 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 118 (1989) (preliminary print). A contrary view, as Justice points out, might encourage settlements driven by source-of-funds considerations rather than the best interests of the United States. Id. at 125.", "The availability of the judgment appropriation for compromise settlements includes compromises of cases arising in foreign countries. B-167543-O.M., August 4, 1969. (2) Federal Tort Claims Act Public Law 89-506, 80 Stat. 306 (1966), made major changes to the Federal Tort Claims Act. Prior to 1966, the authority of agencies to settle tort claims administratively was limited to claims not in excess of $2,500. For claims over that amount, a lawsuit had to be filed. Under the pre-1966 version of the Federal Tort Claims Act, compromise settlements, even of the lawsuits, were payable solely from agency funds. The 1966 amendments eliminated the monetary ceiling on administrative settlement authority (although settlements over $25,000 require the Attorney General\u2019s approval), and changed the payment process.", "Section 6 of Public Law 89-506, 80 Stat. at 307, added to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 two categories of awards under the Federal Tort Claims Act\u2014administrative awards in excess of $2,500 (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2672) and compromise settlements entered into after commencement of suit (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2677). Administrative awards of less than $2,500 continue to be payable from agency funds. (3) Elimination of $100,000 ceiling By 1977, the $100,000 limitation on payments under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 had become unrealistically low, and Congress still found itself having to make routine appropriations for judgments, a task it had largely wanted to rid itself of in 1956. For example, Federal Tort Claims Act awards greater than $100,000 had become increasingly common. Pub. L. No. 95 26, 91 Stat. 61, 96 (1977), removed the $100,000 limitation. Thus, since 1977, judgments, awards, and compromise settlements payable under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 are payable without regard to amount. See Temoak Band of Western Shoshone Indians v. United States, 593 F.2d 994, 999 (Ct. Cl. 1979). (4) Certain administrative awards It turned out that the elimination of the $100,000 ceiling still did not totally eliminate the need for periodic specific \u201cjudgment appropriations\u201d because those appropriations had included, in addition to court judgments, a few administrative claim settlements under statutes which required specific congressional appropriations for payment. Public Law 95 240, \u00a7 201, 92 Stat. 107, 116 (1978), further expanded the judgment appropriation to pick up several of these, now specified in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1304(a)(3)(B) and (D): awards under the so-called Small Claims Act (31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3723) and awards in excess of amounts payable from agency funds under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2733 or 2734, 32 U.S.C. \u00a7 715, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2473(c)(13). These are all discussed further in Chapter 12. (5) Contract Disputes Act of 1978 Prior to 1978, while court judgments on contract disputes were payable from the judgment appropriation, awards by agency boards of contract appeals were payable directly by the contracting agency. The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 changed this by making monetary awards by boards of contract appeals payable from the judgment appropriation, and by requiring that the contracting agency reimburse the judgment appropriation for both court judgments and board awards. Contract Disputes Act payments are also discussed further in Chapter 12. (6) Brooks Act awards The Brooks Automatic Data Processing Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 759, generally establishes procedures for the procurement of automatic data processing (ADP) equipment. In 1984, the Competition in Contracting Act (Pub. L. No. 98 369, \u00a7 2713, 98 Stat. 494, 1182) amended the Brooks Act to authorize the General Services Administration Board of Contract Appeals to hear and decide protests against ADP contract awards. 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 759(f). If the GSBCA finds that the procuring agency has violated a statute or regulation, it may award (a) costs of filing and pursuing the protest, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and (b) costs of bid and proposal preparation. These awards are payable from the judgment appropriation initially, subject to reimbursement \u201cout of funds available for the procurement.\u201d Id. \u00a7 759(f) (5) (E), added by Pub. L. No. 103-355, \u00a7 1436 (1994).", "Prior to late 1994, the Brooks Act did not expressly require reimbursement of the judgment appropriation. The GSBCA initially took the position that it could direct reimbursement in particular cases. Federal Computer Corporation, GSBCA No. 10527-C, 92-1 BCA \u00b6 24,415 (1991).

As we have seen, prior to 1956 (and, for judgments over $100,000, prior to 1977), most judgments against the United States could not be paid without a specific congressional appropriation, regardless of the agency\u2019s willingness to pay or regardless of how much money the agency had available. These are the judgments section 1304 was intended to pick up. However, not all judgments required specific appropriations. There were, prior to enactment of the judgment appropriation, situations in which agency funds were available to pay judgments. The \u201cotherwise provided for\u201d exception in section 1304 preserved these situations and the concept generally.", "Thus, the judgment appropriation was intended to eliminate the need to seek specific appropriations from Congress to pay judgments when that need resulted from the legal unavailability of funds.

The most detailed discussion of the original 1956 legislation is a statement by the (then) Bureau of the Budget printed in the hearings of the House Appropriations Committee. The statement begins by noting that some types of judgments could be paid from existing funding sources, and that the rest of the discussion \u201crelates solely to the general types of cases for which specific appropriations are required.\u201d When compromise settlements were added in 1961, the reports of both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees quoted a Justice Department statement to the effect that settlements would be payable from the permanent appropriation only \u201cf agency funds or appropriations are not available for this purpose.\u201d And, when certain administrative awards were added by the 1978 Supplemental Appropriations Act, the reports of both the Senate and House Appropriations Committees emphasized that the new provision \u201cis not intended to affect claims which are payable from agency appropriations.\u201d", "There is no single test to determine if something is \u201cotherwise provided for.\u201d The determination may flow from the nature of the defendant agency, the type of judgment involved, or the statutory funding scheme applicable to the particular agency or program.

Most situations, as we will see, involve some degree of complexity.", "Before proceeding to specific situations, two key points need to be emphasized:", "The question of whether payment is \u201cotherwise provided for\u201d is a question of legal availability rather than actual funding status. As a general proposition, if payment of a particular judgment is \u201cotherwise provided for\u201d as a matter of law, the judgment appropriation is not available, and the fact that the defendant agency may have insufficient funds at that particular time does not operate to make the judgment appropriation available. 66 Comp.

The court went on to give examples of each type. For purposes of this discussion, we use the term \u201crefund\u201d to correspond roughly to the court\u2019s first category.", "Judgments directing refunds are materially different from judgments awarding damages. When a court orders a refund, it is directing the government to return money it received and which the court has determined it improperly received and/or retained. In this sense, it may be argued that a judgment directing a refund is not truly a \u201cmoney judgment\u201d within the scope of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304, but is more akin to injunctive relief. Cf. 70 Comp. Gen. 225, 228 (1991). In addition, if an agency has credited the receipt to its own appropriation or fund, charging the refund to the general fund of the Treasury by paying the judgment under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 would result in an augmentation of the receiving appropriation. A refund should be charged to the general fund only where the receipt was covered into the general fund. \u201cWhen the amount subject to refund can be traced as having been erroneously credited to an appropriation account the refund claim is chargeable to said appropriation whether it be lapsed or current, or reimbursable or nonreimbursable.\u201d", "GAO has applied the rule regardless of whether the refund is ordered administratively or judicially.", "Several more recent decisions will illustrate. In 55 Comp. Gen. 625 (1976), a court directed the refund of a fine paid to the Internal Revenue Service for violation of wagering tax provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Since the fine had been deposited in the Treasury as an internal revenue collection, the proper account to charge with the refund was the IRS account for refunding internal revenue collections. (Augmentation was not a concern in this case because the fine had not been credited to an operating appropriation or fund.) A very similar case is B-135312, March 13, 1958.", "In 61 Comp. Gen. 224 (1982), a court ordered the Department of the Interior to refund fees collected from 1975 through 1981 for right-of-way permits. For part of this time, the fees had been deposited in the general fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. For the remaining years, the fees were deposited in a special account which Congress had appropriated for use by Interior. For the years in which the fees had been deposited as miscellaneous receipts, the refund was held chargeable to the appropriation for \u201cRefund of Moneys Erroneously Received and Covered\u201d established by 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(b)(2). However, for the years in which the fees had been credited to the special account, the refund was held chargeable to that special account.", "Both of these decisions applied the rule set forth in 17 Comp. Gen. 859. Since there was an available source of funds in each case, there was no need to consider payment under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304.", "A somewhat different situation occurred in B-164766, June 1, 1979. There the Court of Claims had approved a contractor\u2019s motion to substitute a bond in lieu of money previously paid to the Department of the Army under the Renegotiation Act. The issue was the source of funds for the court-ordered refund of the money previously paid. Since the prior payment had been deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, there was no basis to charge the refund to Army appropriations. Also, the \u201cMoneys Erroneously Received and Covered\u201d account could not be charged since the deposit had been proper when made, and the court order directing the refund was not based on any suggestion that the original receipt was in any way erroneous. Since there was no other appropriation or fund that could properly be charged, the refund was held payable from the judgment appropriation. (The Renegotiation Board ceased operations as of March 31, 1979.)", "Thus, when a judgment or compromise settlement orders a refund, as opposed to the payment of money damages, the first question to ask is what the agency did with the money. If the agency retained the money for credit to its own appropriations, then the refund is chargeable to the agency\u2019s appropriations, and the fact that the agency may have spent the money is irrelevant. If the money was deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, a judicially-ordered refund may be charged to the \u201cErroneously Received and Covered\u201d appropriation if applicable, or if not, to the judgment appropriation. Other cases applying these principles are B-206443, June 25, 1984; B-150624-O.M., April 18, 1963; B-140180-O.M., January 27, 1960.", "A somewhat analogous situation is the action in rem in which a court directs return of the \u201cres.\u201d The \u201cres\u201d may be tangible property, money, or tangible property which has been sold and converted to cash.

The government sought forfeiture of a residence alleged to have been purchased with illegal drug money. The bank claimed a lien interest under a mortgage. Upon agreement of the parties and approval of the court, the property was sold and the proceeds held by the United States Marshal. The district court held in favor of the government and directed forfeiture of the proceeds. The bank filed a notice of appeal, but did not try to obtain a stay of execution of the judgment. The Marshal then deposited the proceeds in the Assets Forfeiture Fund (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(c)) in the Treasury, and the government moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing that deposit of the proceeds removed the matter from the court\u2019s jurisdiction.", "The main issue before the Supreme Court was whether deposit of the proceeds in the Treasury terminated the in rem jurisdiction. The answer was no, unless deposit of the funds in the Treasury would somehow render further judgments \u201cuseless.\u201d The government argued that judgment in this case would be useless because there was no authority to refund the deposited proceeds from the Treasury. In multiple opinions, the Court rejected this argument. While the Court split over the precise nature of the authority, it was unanimous in its belief that adequate authority existed to refund the proceeds from the Treasury in the event that the bank prevailed on its appeal from the underlying forfeiture action. Some of the Justices believed that there was no need for an appropriation to authorize the refund in a case like this, while others found the requisite appropriation in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304, together with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2465 which directs the return of seized property upon entry of judgment for the claimant.

A trailer owned by an independent contractor of the Postal Service had become separated from the tractor-trailer rig and struck the plaintiff\u2019s automobile. The trailer was clearly on Postal Service business, but it was also subject to the Department of Transportation\u2019s motor carrier safety regulations.

VA personnel also misdiagnosed the situation. Several days later, the employee died. The chest pains had resulted from a non-work related heart condition. In the ensuing wrongful death action under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the government negotiated a settlement. Even assuming that the USPS doctor was negligent, that negligence was not the proximate cause of death since the doctor sent the employee immediately to a hospital and death did not occur until more than a week later.

If OPM\u2019s action had been binding on the Postal Service as it was with other executive agencies, then the judgment would have arisen from the activities of OPM, not the Postal Service, and the USPS plaintiffs could have been paid from the judgment appropriation along with the other executive branch plaintiffs.

It is usually given considerable latitude in determining its expenditures; it is free from many of the restrictions on appropriated funds that apply to noncorporate agencies; and its statutory charter typically contains a \u201csue and be sued\u201d clause. Of particular relevance to the present context, a corporation may generally retain funds it receives in the course of its operations and is not required to deposit them in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. Also, unlike a regular government agency, a government corporation may procure liability insurance. This being the case, it is logical that losses incurred by a government corporation, whether by judgment or otherwise, should be treated as liabilities of the corporation and charged to corporate funds.", "In an early decision which predated both section 1304 and the Federal Tort Claims Act, the Virgin Islands Company, a wholly owned government corporation, sought to compromise a personal injury claim.

(1) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 In 1975, Congress enacted legislation to permit the garnishment of federal wages for alimony and child support.

Questions have arisen, however, where the agency fails to comply with garnishment process. One such case is 56 Comp. Gen. 592 (1977). The Environmental Protection Agency had negligently failed to withhold funds from an employee\u2019s salary under a District of Columbia writ of garnishment. The error was not discovered until after the employee had resigned and his retirement account had been paid over. Under D.C. law, an employer who fails to comply with a writ of garnishment is liable to the judgment creditor, and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 makes the United States subject to garnishment process the same as a private party. Here, a judgment entered by a D.C. court against EPA could not be paid from funds under the control of the agency since there were no longer any agency funds to which the garnishment could attach. Therefore, the decision concluded that the judgment could be paid from the judgment appropriation if the Attorney General certified that it was in the interest of the United States to pay, as provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2414.", "A similar issue was considered in Young v. Young, 547 F. Supp. 1 (W.D. Tenn. 1980). That case involved state law under which an employer who failed to comply with garnishment process could be held liable for the full amount of the debt or judgment underlying the garnishment. The court held that the limited waiver of sovereign immunity in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 made the United States liable only for the amounts it had failed to withhold, not for the entire amount of the underlying debt. The court also directed the government to take action to recover those amounts from the employee. The judgment itself was found payable under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. 547 F. Supp. at 5. \u201cThe judgment entered against the government officer was void. Mrs. Loftin had no remedy by which she could collect the judgment of $37,966 as a lump sum against the Navy. The federal statute involved here . . . does not waive federal immunity. It merely authorizes a federal disbursing officer to withhold funds from the future pay of a federal employee. The state court exceeded its authority in entering a judgment greater than that allowed by the statutes. The Department of Justice through the United States Attorney could have filed an original declaratory action in United States District Court to have the judgment declared void.\u201d 767 F.2d at 805.", "Then, essentially in agreement with the Young decision, the court concluded that 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 \u201cevinced no intention to make the government, as employer of a debtor, wholly liable for a debt it did not incur,\u201d i.e., the full amount of the underlying debt (767 F.2d at 809), and directed payment of the amounts the government had failed to withhold. \u201chere a governmental entity negligently fails to comply with legal process, the United States shall be liable for the amount that the governmental entity would have paid, if the legal process had been properly honored.\u201d", "5 C.F.R. \u00a7 581.305(e). In sum, if a federal agency fails to comply with garnishment process, the United States can, to the extent provided by state law, be held liable for the amounts the agency failed to withhold. If a state court judgment to this effect is obtained, the first question to ask is whether the agency has any other funds of the types described in the OPM regulations. If not, the judgment is payable from the judgment appropriation provided the Attorney General certifies that payment is \u201cin the interest of the United States\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2414.", "Our discussion thus far has concerned government liability for failing to honor a garnishment writ. What about when it does honor one? \u201cNeither the United States, any disbursing officer, nor governmental entity shall be liable with respect to any payment made from moneys due or payable from the United States to any individual pursuant to legal process regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this section and the regulations issued to carry out this section.\u201d", "The key phrase here is \u201cregular on its face.\u201d This means that the agency does not have to inquire beyond the writ itself. Employees have challenged agency compliance with garnishment process where the court which issued the writ did not have personal (as opposed to subject matter) jurisdiction over the employee-obligor. However, the Supreme Court has held that the government is not liable to the employee in this situation. United States v. Morton, 467 U.S. 822 (1984). If the writ is issued by a court with subject-matter jurisdiction and is otherwise \u201cregular on its face,\u201d the agency is bound to comply. The withholding does not become improper so as to make the government liable to its employee merely because the state court lacked personal jurisdiction. As the Court pointed out, the OPM regulations also mandate this result. Further, the fact that the employee may have raised the jurisdictional problem with the agency is irrelevant. Id. at 829.

Krakover, 377 F.2d 104 (10th Cir. 1967), cert. denied, 389 U.S. 845. For example, under the old Bankruptcy Code, an order of a bankruptcy court directing a federal agency to pay the unpaid compensation of a deceased employee to the employee\u2019s trustee under a Wage Earner\u2019s Plan could not be enforced in the face of a competing claim by the employee\u2019s children under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 5582. 58 Comp.

Id. at 1015. Apart from these situations, however, Nordic Village held that section 106 waived sovereign immunity only for declaratory or injunctive relief and not for monetary recoveries.

Even where setoff is permitted under other sections of the Code, such as 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 553, the creditor must nevertheless petition the court for relief from the automatic stay.

If it did, then awards under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(h) could be made against the federal government. If it did not, monetary awards were not authorized.

One line of cases distinguished Nordic Village and found no sovereign immunity bar to awarding monetary relief for violation of the discharage injunction. Other cases applied Nordic Village and declined to make monetary awards against the federal government.

Other Situations", "paragraphs": ["As the categories previously described make clear, there are few absolutes in making source-of-funds determinations. Most categories involve a \u201cmixed bag\u201d of payments from the judgment appropriation and payments from agency funds. The same holds true for the additional areas summarized below. (1) Tort-based judgments The vast majority of claims against the United States stemming from tortious government conduct are adjudicated under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), which provides for both administrative and judicial resolution. Administrative awards of $2,500 or less are paid from agency appropriations. Administrative awards in excess of $2,500 are paid from the judgment appropriation. Court judgments and compromise settlements by the Department of Justice are paid from the judgment appropriation regardless of amount. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2672, 2677; 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(a)(3)(A).", "Payments under the Federal Tort Claims Act represent the largest single source of payments under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304, whether measured by numbers of cases or aggregate dollar amount, at least in most years. There are several reasons for this: every agency is exposed to tort claims; tort claims may produce very large judgments; and the judgment appropriation is available for the larger administrative awards as well as judgments and compromise settlements.", "The availability of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 to pay FTCA awards is subject to the same basic requirements as other awards, including the requirement that payment be \u201cnot otherwise provided for.\u201d We have already noted a few \u201cotherwise provided for\u201d situations for FTCA payments (Postal Service, government corporations, nonappropriated fund instrumentalities). Although rare, exceptions may also exist even for \u201cregular\u201d federal agencies. For example, in 67 Comp. Gen. 142 (1987), GAO found the judgment appropriation available for judgments and awards under the FTCA in personal injury or physical property damage cases arising from the activities of the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board, the same as for other agencies. However, the decision drew a distinction between the so-called \u201cphysical torts,\u201d such as motor vehicle accidents, and \u201cprogram losses\u201d even where attributable to negligence on the part of an agency employee. The reason was that the Board\u2019s organic legislation (Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System Act of 1986) contained detailed provisions to address program losses.", "Maritime torts are adjudicated under the Suits in Admiralty Act, 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 741 752, or the Public Vessels Act, 46  U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 781 790. At one time, the Suits in Admiralty Act had its own permanent appropriation. Although it is still carried in the U.S. Code at 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 748 (which also expressly preserves the \u201cotherwise provided for\u201d concept), the corresponding Treasury account was repealed in 1934 and replaced by language requiring specific congressional appropriations (48 Stat. 1226). Now, judgments and compromise settlements under the Suits in Admiralty and Public Vessels Acts are paid the same as FTCA judgments\u2014from the judgment appropriation unless payment is otherwise provided for in a particular case. See B-199073, July 1, 1980 (non-decision letter).", "A final case meriting notice is 39 Comp. Gen. 650 (1960). That decision involved a judgment under the Suits in Admiralty Act against the United States for injuries resulting from negligent performance by a Maritime Administration contractor of work under an Economy Act agreement between the Maritime Administration and the Department of the Navy. Maritime Administration paid the judgment from an available revolving fund, and then sought partial reimbursement from Navy. The decision held that the judgment had to be paid as a judgment (that is, from the judgment appropriation unless some other fund was available, as had in fact been the case), and could not be treated as a reimbursable item of direct cost under the Economy Act agreement. While the rationale seems clear enough in the context of a tort judgment, it should not be automatically assumed that the same result would apply to other types of judgments such as contract judgments. (2) Pay, allowances, employment benefits Judgments awarding compensation or benefits to present or former federal civilian employees or military personnel comprise another major category of judgments, most of which are payable under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. Thus, judgments awarding back pay under the Back Pay Act (unjustified or unwarranted personnel action) or Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (employment discrimination) are generally paid from the judgment appropriation. 58 Comp. Gen. 311 (1979). See also 69 Comp. Gen. 40 (1989). The same rule applies to judgments under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (B-193509-O.M., April 19, 1979) and the Rehabilitation Act. It is irrelevant whether the judgment specifies an actual dollar amount as long as it directs the payment of back pay. 58 Comp. Gen. at 313.", "Where the judgment does not specify the dollar amount, payment for the period up to the date of the judgment will be made from the permanent appropriation, while payment for any periods after the date of the judgment must be made by the employing agency from its own funds. 55 Comp. Gen. 1447 (1976). A limited exception to this was recognized in 60 Comp. Gen. 375 (1981). There, a court in a discrimination suit had awarded back pay and also ordered the payment of \u201cfront pay\u201d until such time as a certain number of the plaintiffs were promoted. The \u201cfront pay\u201d was an increment above the employee\u2019s current salary and was more in the nature of damages than compensation. Since the agency\u2019s salaries appropriation is available only for the compensation prescribed for the employee\u2019s actual grade level, the \u201cfront pay\u201d was held payable from the judgment appropriation.", "As a general proposition, the same rules apply to other compensation-related judgments. E.g., B-246958, February 14, 1992 (internal memorandum) (judgment for severance pay payable from judgment appropriation).", "In a few instances, where a particular benefit is funded from a special fund rather than the employing agency\u2019s operating appropriations, GAO has found the payment \u201cotherwise provided for.\u201d Examples are:", "Judgments against the Civil Service Retirement Fund. 52 Comp. Gen. 175 (1972); B-115505, December 21, 1972.", "Judgments awarding benefits under the military Survivor Benefit Plan, funded from the Military Retirement Fund. B-236414, February 22, 1991. (3) Full faith and credit If an agency enters into an otherwise lawful contractual obligation which binds the full faith and credit of the United States under statutory contract authority which provides no other funding mechanism, and Congress fails or refuses to appropriate money to liquidate the obligation, a resulting final judgment would be payable from the judgment appropriation. B-197742, August 1, 1986; B-211190, April 5, 1983; B-168313, November 21, 1969.", "This does not mean that an agency can resort to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 as an alternative to using its own funds or seeking appropriate funding from the Congress. When Congress provides contract authority, it is normally assumed, at least where the governing legislation does not provide otherwise, that liquidating appropriations will be obtained through the normal appropriations process. For example, GAO and the Department of Justice have both reviewed the nature of obligations and funding under the Price-Anderson Act, and both agree that an agency must first use current funds to the extent available. If the agency has no appropriated funds available for that purpose, or if funds available to the agency are not sufficient, the agency must then seek additional funding from Congress. Only if Congress fails or refuses to provide the necessary funds does the potential availability of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 come into play. B-197742, August 1, 1986; Department of Energy Request to Use the Judgment Fund for Settlement of Fernald Litigation, Op. Off. Legal Counsel, December 18, 1989. \u201cThe availability of [31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304] assumes, of course, that there is a good faith dispute over the obligation of the United States to pay on the extant settlement obligation, and that DOE has earnestly attempted, but failed, to obtain the necessary funding from the Congress and monies remain otherwise unavailable. Payment from the judgment fund would not be authorized were the United States now, in order to permit payment from the judgment fund, purposely to default upon its settlement obligation, were DOE to refuse to seek a special appropriation or to reprogram funds, and the United States thereafter to settle the inevitable lawsuit to enforce the indemnification agreement.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)", "Such a settlement, as the opinion goes on to point out, would not be a bona fide compromise settlement by the Attorney General within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2414. (4) Punitive awards Punitive awards\u2014those intended to punish rather than compensate\u2014may not be made against the United States without specific statutory authority. Missouri Pacific R.R. Co. v. Ault, 256 U.S. 554 (1921); Barry v. Bowen, 884 F.2d 442 (9th Cir. 1989); Smith v. Russellville Production Credit Ass\u2019n, 777 F.2d 1544, 1549-50 (11th Cir. 1985); Painter v. TVA, 476 F.2d 943 (5th Cir. 1973); 55 Comp. Gen. 564 (1975). Punitive awards, as we use the term here, encompass two distinct things\u2014punitive damages (damages over and above those necessary to compensate the injured party) and certain fines or sanctions for contempt of court. Punitive awards, even though they may be viewed as \u201cmoney judgments\u201d in the sense of court directives to pay money, should not be paid from the judgment appropriation. \u201cwhile a fine imposed for a contempt of court is a judgment of the court, a fine in its nature, principle, and purpose is a very different thing from the judgments the payment of which the Congress had in view in enacting [31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304].\u201d Id. at 314.", "More precisely, the judgment appropriation is not available to pay criminal or civil contempt sanctions intended to punish or compel compliance; however, it may be used to pay civil contempt awards, usually in the form of costs and attorney\u2019s fees, intended to compensate the opposing party for losses arising from the government\u2019s noncompliance. The distinction is discussed in two internal memoranda, B-242786, January 31, 1991, and B-239556, October 12, 1990.", "Note that where a sanction is assessed against an individual, the availability of agency funds to pick up the tab is a question separate and distinct from the availability of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. The unavailability of the judgment appropriation has no bearing on the availability of agency funds, which may or may not be available depending on whether the test of 44 Comp. Gen. 312 is met. For further elaboration and case citations, see the Fines and Penalties heading in Chapter 4.", "Punitive damage awards against the United States are uncommon because they are mostly unauthorized. One exception is 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(h), which authorizes punitive damages for intentional violations of the automatic stay in bankruptcy proceedings. Although we have found no cases precisely on point, the unavailability of the judgment appropriation should follow logically from the contempt cases. \u201cWhere a person is able to insure himself against punishment he gains a freedom of misconduct inconsistent with the establishment of sanctions against such misconduct.\u201d", "Where the \u201cinsurer\u201d is in a position to pass the financial burden on to the public, society is, in effect, \u201cpunishing itself.\u201d Id. at 441. While Judge Wisdom was addressing coverage under a commercial insurance policy, the analogy to \u201cinsurance\u201d by virtue of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 should be readily apparent. See also Derechin v. State University of New York, 963 F.2d 513, 519 (2d Cir. 1992), and National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 698 F. Supp. 951, 972 (D.D.C. 1988), for similar policy expressions. (5) Miscellaneous statutory provisions There are a number of situations, not susceptible of further generalization, in which the judgment appropriation may not be used because some other statute explicitly provides for payment in a particular context. Some of them are:", "22 U.S.C. \u00a7 3776 (Panama Canal Act of 1979, as amended): judgments against Panama Canal Commission in actions for damage or injury to vessels, cargo, crew, or passengers. By statute, these are payable from funds made available for the maintenance and operation of the Panama Canal. See B-206860-O.M., June 7, 1982.", "33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1321(i) and (k), section 311 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act: judgments in suits to recover the cost of removal of oil or hazardous substances. These are payable by the Coast Guard from the revolving fund established by section 311. An example of such a case is Grundy Oil Co. v. United States, 14 Cl. Ct. 759 (1988).", "38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1920, 1955, and 1984 (Supp. IV 1992): United States Government Life Insurance Fund and National Service Life Insurance Fund.", "42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(i): Social Security benefits.", "Judgments of the Court of Federal Claims awarding compensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. With respect to vaccines administered prior to October 1, 1988, the judgments are payable from appropriations of the Department of Health and Human Services; with respect to vaccines administered on or after October 1, 1988, judgments are payable from the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 300aa-15(i); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 9510.", "Legislation may include payment provisions which expose the judgment appropriation in certain situations but not others. An example is 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136m, as amended by section 501 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act Amendments of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-532, 102 Stat. 2654, 2674 (1988). Under this law, certain classes of persons are entitled to indemnity payments when the Environmental Protection Agency cancels a pesticide registration. Indemnity payments to end users and, under certain circumstances, to purchasers other than end users, are to be paid under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 136m(b)(3). Indemnity payments to other claimants (e.g., manufacturers) require specific line-item appropriations, which EPA must request when it takes an action (cancels a registration) that will require payment of indemnification. Id. \u00a7 136m(a)(4). (6) No appropriation available It is still possible\u2014although remote\u2014that a court might issue a judgment with no appropriation legally available from which to pay it. For example, B-191208-O.M., June 2, 1978, concerned litigation under the Micronesian Claims Act, which established the Micronesian Claims Fund for the payment of claims. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had remanded the case to the district court with instructions to direct the Micronesian Claims Commission to grant appropriate relief. The Fund was virtually exhausted and Congress had authorized, but not yet appropriated, additional funds. While a definitive determination at the time was not possible, it appeared that the Micronesian Claims Fund was the proper source of payment, meaning that the judgment appropriation would not be available. Therefore, if the Fund were exhausted, there would be no appropriation from which to pay, and the court recognized this possibility. Mister Ralpho v. Bell, 569 F.2d 607, rehearing denied, 569 F.2d 636, 639 (D.C. Cir. 1977). As we noted at the outset of this chapter, the Appropriations Clause of the Constitution prohibits any payment from the Treasury, including one ordered by a court, unless there is an appropriation available for that purpose. Accordingly, if such a situation were to arise, it would be necessary to seek funds from Congress.", "Cases concluding that there is no available source of funds are\u2014as they should be\u2014rare. One example, which apparently resulted from legislative oversight and which was later cured legislatively, is 63 Comp. Gen. 470 (1984), discussed later in this chapter in connection with attorney\u2019s fees in tax cases."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "C. Requirement of Finality", "paragraphs": ["The three primary statutes that govern the payment of judgments against the United States\u201431 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2414 and 2517\u2014all refer to the payment of \u201cfinal\u201d judgments. The term \u201cfinal\u201d in connection with judgments may mean different things in different contexts. See McDonald v. Schweiker, 726 F.2d 311, 313 (7th Cir. 1983); B-58540, August 12, 1946. A final judgment for purposes of taking an appeal (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291) and a final judgment for payment purposes are two different things.", "In simple terms, a judgment against the United States is paid when the litigation is over. The basis for this position is that it is not in the government\u2019s interest to pay money out of the Treasury while the payee\u2019s entitlement to the money is still subject to change. In other words, the purpose of the finality requirement is to protect the government \u201cagainst loss by premature payment of a judgment which might later through appeal be amended or reversed.\u201d B-129227, December 22, 1960. As stated in B-129227, the term \u201cfinal judgment\u201d for payment purposes means \u201csuch judgments as have become conclusive by reason of loss of the right to appeal\u2014by expiration of time or otherwise\u2014or by determination of the appeal by the court of last resort.\u201d See also Campbell v. United States, 809 F.2d 563, 574 (9th Cir. 1987); McDonald v. Schweiker, 726 F.2d at 313; Keasler v. United States, 585 F. Supp. 825, 836 (E.D. Ark. 1984); Cedar Chemical Corp. v. United States, 18 Cl. Ct. 25, 31 (1989). Thus, a judgment against the United States is final for payment purposes when the appellate process is completed. Generally speaking and subject to the occasional exception, this can happen in one of three ways: determination by the court of last resort, determination by the parties not to seek further review, or expiration of the time limit for filing appeals. E.g., 73 Comp. Gen. 46 (1993).", "To better understand the meaning of \u201cfinal judgment\u201d as that term is used in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304, it is useful to examine the system section 1304 replaced. As we\u2019ve discussed earlier in this chapter, before the judgment appropriation was enacted, most judgments against the United States required specific congressional appropriations for payment. Traditionally, Congress included very precise finality language when making these appropriations. For example, a 1925 appropriation stated that \u201cone of the judgments contained herein shall be paid until the right of appeal shall have expired.\u201d Act of March 4, 1925, 43 Stat. 1347, quoted in 4 Comp. Gen. 834, 835 (1925). A 1904 appropriation act using almost identical language may be found at 33 Stat. 422. A 1912 appropriation with this language is quoted in 20 Comp. Dec. 562 (1914). More recently, the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-26, 91 Stat. 61, 96, provided that \u201cno judgment herein appropriated for shall be paid until it shall become final and conclusive against the United States by failure of the parties to appeal or otherwise.\u201d \u201cstems from the congressional determination, consistently expressed in legislation over many decades, that the United States should not be required to pay money out of the Treasury pursuant to a judgment or order of a court which is susceptible of being modified or reversed on appeal.\u201d", "B-208999, September 13, 1982 (non-decision letter). Similarly, when the Comptroller General interpreted the finality requirement in B-129227, quoted above, GAO was not treading any new ground. The interpretation in B-129227 was nothing more than the logical continuation of the situation under prior law. E.g., B-102508, April 18, 1951; B-58540, August 12, 1946.", "Section 2414, 28 U.S.C., provides that \u201chenever the Attorney General determines that no appeal shall be taken from a judgment or that no further review will be sought from a decision affirming the same, he shall so certify and the judgment shall be deemed final.\u201d The purpose of this provision is to permit a judgment to be paid before it has become final by operation of law, that is, before the time limit for taking an appeal has expired. Thus, strictly speaking, the Attorney General\u2019s certification is not necessary in cases where the time limit for taking an appeal has expired and a notice of appeal has in fact not been filed. B-129227, December 22, 1960. However, as a practical matter, GAO cannot track the status of all pending litigation, and therefore, the Attorney General\u2019s certification that no further review will be sought is required for all judgments. It is not required for consent judgments and compromise settlements, since no appeal can be taken from these actions. 4 Comp. Gen. 834 (1925). Once again, the concept embodied in the quoted portion of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2414 was nothing new; the statute in this respect was largely a codification of existing administrative interpretations. See 19 Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 281 (1889); B-58540, August 12, 1946. \u201che refund order may still be appealed to the Supreme Court and therefore cannot be considered \u2018final\u2019 at this stage of the litigation. Therefore, payment may not lawfully be made prior to such time as the Solicitor General has determined whether to petition for certiorari from the Court of Claims\u2019 order. If certiorari is sought, payment cannot be made prior to the time that the Supreme Court finally disposes of the issue, either by denying certiorari or, if granted, until it issues its decision. Thus, the order will become final for payment purposes when one of three things occurs\u2014the Department of Justice determines not to seek further review, the Supreme Court denies a petition for certiorari, or if the petition is granted, the Supreme Court issues its decision.\u201d", "It follows that GAO has no authority, nor is the permanent appropriation legally available, to make a partial or \u201cgood faith\u201d payment, even upon the stipulation of the parties, while the litigation is still in process. B-191208-O.M., June 2, 1978.", "On the surface, the preceding discussion would seem to suggest that payment can never be made until the litigation is over, that there can be only one \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in a given case, and that the entire case must be over before there can be finality for purposes of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. This, however, is often not the case. For example, in B-164766, June 1, 1979, the Court of Claims had ordered the United States to refund an amount previously paid by a contractor in return for the contractor\u2019s bond. GAO concluded that the issue of the refund was readily severable from the merits of the underlying litigation, and when the appellate process was complete with respect to it, the refund could be certified for payment without regard to the status of the balance of the litigation. In this case, different aspects of the case became final for payment purposes at different times, potentially resulting in more than one \u201cfinal judgment\u201d", "In Barnes v. United States, 678 F.2d 10 (3d Cir. 1982), an appeal from a judgment under the Federal Tort Claims Act, the court held that it could, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106, grant partial summary affirmance with respect to the undisputed portion of the district court\u2019s judgment. The judgment in that case consisted of ten distinct elements, one of which was being appealed; there was no appeal on the issue of liability. The partial summary affirmance would be treated as a separate judgment, which could be paid notwithstanding the continuing appeal on the disputed item. Some months earlier, the court in Parker v. Lewis, 670 F.2d 249 (D.C. Cir. 1981), had granted summary affirmance with respect to the uncontested portion of an award of attorney\u2019s fees which was being appealed in an employment discrimination action, noting that only the amount (not the liability) was in dispute and a large portion of that was uncontestable. It follows that, in appropriate cases, the government can consent to the motion for partial summary affirmance.", "The Contract Disputes Act of 1978 provides an additional situation in which there might be more than one \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in a given case. Under section 10(e), 41 U.S.C. \u00a7 609(e), \u201cwhere a portion of one such claim can be divided for purposes of decision or judgment, and in any such suit where multiple parties are involved, the court, whenever such action is appropriate, may enter a judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims, portions thereof, or parties.\u201d Since the Act authorizes agency boards of contract appeals to grant the same relief that would be available in the Court of Federal Claims, a board of contract appeals may make \u201cpartial awards\u201d to the same extent the court can under section 10(e). 60 Comp. Gen. 573 (1981).", "Judgments awarding back pay but not specifying the dollar amount to be paid present a somewhat different aspect of finality. On the one hand, the judgments (Back Pay Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, etc.) are money judgments and may be paid from the permanent appropriation. However, such a judgment, even though it may be \u201cfinal\u201d with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, is not in and of itself \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of GAO\u2019s certification for payment. The reason for this is that the government\u2019s computation would not be binding on the plaintiff and would itself be subject to judicial review. Therefore, before such a judgment may be certified for payment, GAO must be furnished an agreed-upon amount, that is, the employing agency\u2019s computation, including any required deductions, together with written indication that the plaintiff will accept the amount in satisfaction of the judgment. If the parties cannot agree, further litigation may be necessary, but this must be done before the judgment is submitted for payment. 58 Comp. Gen. 311 (1979).", "Awards of interim attorney\u2019s fees have also raised finality issues. Interim fee awards are becoming increasingly common in certain types of litigation which tend to be lengthy and complex, prime examples being employment discrimination suits under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and suits under the Freedom of Information Act.", "In B-190940, September 21, 1978, a district court awarded attorney\u2019s fees to the plaintiff in a Title VII suit. The plaintiff filed an appeal from the underlying order denying reinstatement, but neither party appealed the order awarding attorney\u2019s fees. Since the litigation had already lasted for several years, and since the order awarding the fees was itself final and was not a part of the order reflecting the court\u2019s determination on the merits which was on appeal, the award of attorney\u2019s fees could be viewed as a separate \u201cfinal judgment\u201d and therefore certified for payment. The decision followed the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in Bradley v. Richmond School Board, 416 U.S. 696, 721 23 (1974).", "Where, as in B-190940, the government does not intend to appeal an interim fee award, the Attorney General can so certify as provided in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2414, and there is no payment problem. However, where the government does plan to appeal an interim fee award but cannot do so because it is interlocutory and not appealable until the end of the litigation, it is difficult to see how the award can be deemed a final judgment. Be that as it may, several courts have directed the payment of interim fee awards in situations in which the award was not \u201cfinal\u201d in the traditional sense.", "In McKenzie v. Kennickell, 669 F. Supp. 529 (D.D.C. 1987), a Title VII case, the court directed immediate payment of what the parties had agreed was the \u201cirreducible minimum\u201d owed to the plaintiffs. The court emphasized that if the parties had not been able to agree on the \u201cirreducible minimum,\u201d fees could not be paid until the fee litigation was resolved. Id. at 533. The court went on to suggest that, in future cases, courts could satisfy the concerns of both parties by directing payment into an interest-bearing escrow account. This would preserve the value of the award while facilitating repayment if the government were successful on appeal. Id. at 535 n.7.", "The McKenzie court cited with approval the case of Jurgens v. EEOC, 660 F. Supp. 1097 (N.D. Tex. 1987), another Title VII case decided several months earlier. While Jurgens did not involve the \u201cirreducible minimum\u201d concept, the court appears to have viewed the possibility that the fee award might be modified on appeal as sufficiently remote in that case as to remove any real substance from the finality argument. E.g., id. at 1103 n.5. The McKenzie and Jurgens courts both concluded that, to the extent of any conflict, the specific provisions governing fee awards under Title VII (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k)) would prevail over the more general provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2414. The court in Brown v. Marsh, 707 F. Supp. 21 (D.D.C. 1989), reached the same result, citing both McKenzie and Jurgens. Still another Title VII case saying essentially the same thing is Trout v. Lehman, 702 F. Supp. 3 (D.D.C. 1988), appeal dismissed, Trout v. Garrett, 891 F.2d 332 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (district court followed \u201cirreducible minimum\u201d approach of McKenzie). See also Parker v. Lewis, noted above.", "In Rosenfeld v. United States, 859 F.2d 717 (9th Cir. 1988), the court reviewed Jurgens and McKenzie and applied their result to an interim fee award in Freedom of Information Act litigation. Cases following Rosenfeld are Allen v. FBI, 716 F. Supp. 667 (D.D.C. 1989), and Allen v. Department of Defense, 713 F. Supp. 7 (D.D.C. 1989).", "Before we leave the topic of finality, one related point deserves brief mention.

Upon receipt by GAO, the judgment is given a file number for reference and retrieval purposes.

If it is determined that the judgment is not payable from the judgment appropriation, it is returned to the submitter with a brief explanation and advice as to the correct source of payment. Where it is determined that the judgment is payable from the judgment appropriation, the process will then take into consideration, where and to the extent applicable, the offsetting of indebtedness, the making of other required deductions, the payment of costs and/or attorney\u2019s fees, and the computation and payment of interest. Once these things are done, the next step is the preparation of the Certificate of Settlement.", "The Certificate of Settlement is then sent to the Treasury Department, which prepares and issues the check(s) in accordance with the instructions on the Certificate. The check is mailed to the plaintiff in care of the cognizant U.S. Attorney or designated attorney at the Justice Department, depending on who litigated the case. This person will deliver the check to the judgment creditor in exchange for an appropriate release.

Thus, traditionally, GAO has certified payment to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which then holds the funds in a trust capacity for ultimate use and distribution.", "Initially, the Bureau made distribution from the trust funds without further congressional action. However, beginning in the early 1960s, the annual Interior Department appropriation acts began including provisions prohibiting the distribution of Indian judgment funds (including awards by the now-defunct Indian Claims Commission) until additional legislation was enacted specifying the purposes for which the funds could be used. See, for example, the Interior Department and Related Agencies Appropriation Act for 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-120, 87 Stat. 429, 432 (1973). Under this system, even after a judgment had become final and GAO had certified it for payment, the money could not be paid over to the successful plaintiff until Congress enacted further legislation dealing with that specific judgment.", "The prohibition in the 1974 appropriation act was the last such provision. In 1973, Congress enacted permanent legislation, since amended several times and now found at 25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1401 1407, to eliminate the need for specific distribution statutes in most cases. Under this legislation, the Bureau of Indian Affairs prepares a distribution plan and submits it to the Congress. The plan becomes effective automatically unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted within a specified time period. Specific distribution legislation is now necessary only if the Bureau determines that the circumstances of the particular case make it desirable, or if the Bureau\u2019s plan is disapproved. The Bureau has published implementing regulations, found at 25 C.F.R. Part 87.", "The typical nonstatutory distribution plan, which the Bureau publishes in the Federal Register as a notice, will allocate part of the funds to be used in programs for the social and economic benefit of the tribe, and part for per capita distribution to individual tribal members. The plan may also include procedures for the treatment of the shares of deceased or legally incompetent beneficiaries, and minors. For an example, see 45 Fed. Reg. 57546, August 28, 1980. Examples of statutory distribution plans are Pub. L. No. 100-139, 101 Stat. 822 (1987) (Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe), and Pub. L.

See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1505.", "Unlike other Court of Federal Claims judgments, the judgment in an Indian case is usually transmitted to GAO directly by the Clerk of the Court. Because payment is not made directly to the plaintiff, GAO will certify the judgment for payment upon receipt of a letter from the Justice Department stating that it has no objection to payment. There is no need for any further action by the plaintiff.", "Most Indian tribes remain under federal supervision (\u201cfederal trust\u201d). Termination of federal supervision is accomplished by statute. This has been done for several tribes, although the termination policy is no longer actively pursued. An example is 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 564q(a) (Klamath Indian Tribe). For tribes whose federal trust has been terminated, the judgment procedures set forth above will no longer apply if there is other legislation authorizing the distribution of judgment funds for that tribe. 25 C.F.R. \u00a7 87.2.", "There appears to be little case law involving the Indian judgment fund distribution legislation. In United States v.

The Supreme Court reversed, holding that payment occurred when the funds were transferred from the permanent judgment appropriation and deposited in the Bureau\u2019s trust account. 470 U.S. 39 (1985).

In a similar type of case involving a terminated tribe, the Comptroller General held that a per capita share was subject to a levy for delinquent federal taxes issued by the Internal Revenue Service under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6331. 63 Comp.

Under current procedures, unless otherwise required, it is not necessary for a compromise stipulation to be approved by the court in order to be paid. It will be certified for payment if it is properly executed, and if it expressly states that, in consideration of payment, the plaintiff agrees to dismiss the action and to accept the stated sum in full and final satisfaction of the claim.

The legislative history did not explain this omission, but there was no indication of any intent that the same concept should not apply to Court of Federal Claims cases.

GAO\u2019s view is that while the statute prescribes the procedure for the payment of judgments, it does not prohibit the payment of compromise settlements. Thus, if an otherwise sufficient compromise stipulation in a Court of Federal Claims case is submitted for payment, GAO will not decline certification merely because it has not been reduced to judgment.

Typical deductions are federal income tax, state income tax, retirement fund or social security contribution, Medicare tax, and Federal Employees\u2019 Group Life Insurance (FEGLI). Any deductions made will be specified on the Certificate of Settlement. If the judgment or agreement does not specify the dollar amount or applicable percentage rate for each deduction to be made, the information should be obtained from the employing agency and, together with an indication that the parties are in agreement, included with the payment request.", "Some deductions, such as Civil Service Retirement and Social Security, require a contribution by the government as well as by the employee. If a judgment directs the payment of the government\u2019s as well as the employee\u2019s share, it is considered part of the judgment and payable from the permanent appropriation. If a judgment directs a particular deduction but is silent with respect to the government\u2019s share, the employee\u2019s share is payable from the permanent appropriation and the government\u2019s share is payable by the employing agency from agency funds. 58 Comp. Gen. 115 (1978). This decision overruled an earlier case (B-124720, May 15, 1961) which had held that there was no appropriation legally available to pay the government\u2019s share and it therefore had to be absorbed by the appropriate fund.", "The question of deductions also arises in connection with judgments awarding back pay but not specifying the dollar amount to be paid. Under 58 Comp. Gen. 311 (1979), as noted earlier, these judgments may be paid from the permanent appropriation once GAO has been furnished an agreed-upon amount, determined either administratively or judicially as the specific case may require. If the parties cannot agree and the amount is determined in further litigation, the above principles will apply\u2014that is, deductions will be made or not made depending on the terms of the court\u2019s order. Where the amount is agreed upon administratively, the employing agency will normally include in its computation the same deductions it would have made had it paid the salary directly. In such a case, it follows from 58 Comp. Gen. 311, although the point was not specifically addressed in that decision, that GAO will follow the terms of the agreement provided the conditions specified in the decision are met, primarily that there be written indication that the designated payment will be accepted in full and final satisfaction of the judgment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "F.

In recognition of this, Rule 54(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure states that \u201ccosts against the United States, its officers, and agencies shall be imposed only to the extent permitted by law.\u201d Prior to 1966, there was no general authority to tax costs against the United States. Under the version of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 then in effect (see 62 Stat. 973), costs were prohibited except under express statutory authority, which existed only in limited situations. Thus, there were many cases in which the United States was not liable for costs when it lost even though it could recover costs when it was the prevailing party. \u201ccosts, as enumerated in section 1920 of this title, but not including the fees and expenses of attorneys, may be awarded to the prevailing party in any civil action brought by or against the United States or any agency or any official of the United States acting in his or her official capacity.\u201d", "The costs are to be \u201climited to reimbursing in whole or in part the prevailing party for the costs incurred by such party in the litigation.\u201d Id.

However, a Member of Congress or a congressional committee or subcommittee does not have automatic access to the courts on behalf of the United States.

(1) Fees of the clerk and marshal. The activities for which United States marshals may charge fees are specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1921. In addition, it has been held that the fees of a private process server are taxable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. E.g., Alflex Corp. v. Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., 914 F.2d 175 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 61.", "Storage charges assessed against the United States in connection with property seized by the Marshals Service pursuant to the execution of a warrant in rem are payable from appropriations of the Marshals Service and not the judgment appropriation. 62 Comp. Gen. 177 (1983). (2) Fees of the court reporter for necessary stenographic transcripts. (3) Fees and disbursements for printing and witnesses. Allowable fees and expenses of witnesses are specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821.", "Taxation of the fees and expenses of expert witnesses has been a controversial topic. The legislative history of the 1966 amendments to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412 indicates that Congress did not intend to include costs in excess of the statutory amounts authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821. E.g., Harrisburg Coalition Against Ruining the Environment v. Volpe, 65 F.R.D. 608 (M.D. Pa. 1974). See also 54 Comp. Gen. 22, 23 (1974). Be that as it may, the courts were not uniform. See discussion in Murphy v. International Union of Operating Engineers, 774 F.2d 114, 132 34 (6th Cir. 1985). The Supreme Court resolved the issue in 1987, holding that federal courts must observe the limits of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920 when taxing the expenses of litigants\u2019 expert witnesses (as distinguished from court-appointed expert witnesses, discussed below), absent explicit statutory or contractual authorization to the contrary. Crawford Fitting Co. v. J.T. Gibbons, Inc., 482 U.S. 437 (1987). Similarly, the nontestimonial services of experts are not taxable as costs under section 1920, although they may be recoverable if expressly authorized by a fee-shifting statute. West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83 (1991). See also 69 Comp. Gen. 160 (1990).", "In United States Marshals Service v. Means, 741 F.2d 1053 (8th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 910 (1989), the government sought to evict a group of individuals from federal property. The defendants were indigent and could not afford the fees and expenses of the witnesses they wanted to subpoena. The court held that it could call the witnesses, and that it had discretionary power to order the government to advance the fees and expenses, later to be taxed as costs. The court emphasized that \u201cthis discretionary power is to be exercised only under compelling circumstances.\u201d Id. at 1059. (In this type of situation, the agency would presumably pay in the first instance, and could later be reimbursed from the judgment appropriation if the expenses were ultimately taxed against the United States as costs.) (4) Necessary document reproduction fees. This includes photographic materials if necessarily obtained for use in the case. Maxwell v. Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaft, 862 F.2d 767, 770 (9th Cir. 1988). Also, although section 1920 does not specifically mention depositions, courts have generally construed subsections (2) and (4) as authorizing the taxation of the costs of depositions necessarily obtained for use in the case.(5) Docket fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923. These were traditionally viewed as a type of attorney\u2019s fee. E.g., North Atlantic & Gulf S.S. Co. v. United States, 209 F.2d 487, 489 90 (2d Cir. 1954). They are now taxable as costs under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a). 54 Comp. Gen. 22 (1974). (6) Compensation of interpreters and expenses of special interpretation services (28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1827, 1828), and compensation of court-appointed experts. The inclusion of interpretation costs and expenses was not intended to authorize taxation of these items against the United States in criminal cases or civil actions brought by the United States; payment in these instances is to be made by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts from judiciary appropriations. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1827(g), 1828(c); S. Rep. No. 569, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 13 14 (1977). The \u201cexperts\u201d referred to are expert witnesses appointed by the court under Rule 706 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. See National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Mullen, 828 F.2d 536, 545 n.7 (9th Cir. 1987). These are different from the expert witnesses referred to under subsection (3) above, which are the litigant\u2019s experts.", "A major issue in the area of costs has been whether, in taxing costs against the United States under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a), courts are limited to the items specified in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. Although not all agree, the answer appears to be yes. Many courts traditionally viewed their authority as limited by section 1920. E.g., Commissioners of Highways of Annawan v. United States, 653 F.2d 292, 298 (7th Cir. 1981) (cannot tax attorney\u2019s travel expenses or witness fees in excess of amounts authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1821); Photo Data, Inc. v. Sawyer, 533 F. Supp. 348, 353 (D.D.C. 1982) (disallowed overtime meals, car, local transportation); Norman v. United States, 74 F.R.D. 637 (D. Del. 1977) (disallowed attorney\u2019s air fare, meals, hotel accommodations). See also Harrisburg Coalition Against Ruining the Environment v. Volpe, 65 F.R.D. 608, 612 (M.D. Pa. 1974) (\u201cAs a general rule, expenses that are incident to the preparation of a case are not recoverable as costs\u201d).", "However, this view as to the relationship between 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2412(a) and 1920 was neither absolutely rigid nor universally held. Thus, for example, in Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Kenosha Unified School District No. 1, 620 F.2d 1220, 1227 28 (7th Cir. 1980), the court recognized the limitation of section 1920 but allowed costs of procuring statistical analyses and computer expenses based on a broad reading of subsection 1920(4), calling it an \u201cexceptional case.\u201d The case of Engels v. United States, 2 Cl. Ct. 166 (1983), expresses at least what was then the Claims Court\u2019s position that it could go beyond section 1920 but must exercise that discretion sparingly. The court relied on language in Farmer v. Arabian American Oil Co., 379 U.S. 227 (1964). Finally, the court in National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Mullen, 828 F.2d 536, 545 46 (9th Cir. 1987), effectively wrote the phrase \u201cas enumerated in section 1920\u201d out of the statute, at least within that circuit, by holding that the language is not \u201cexplicitly exclusive,\u201d and that a court may, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a), award against the United States any costs that it may award against a private party. \u201cIf Rule 54(d) grants courts discretion to tax whatever costs may seem appropriate, then  \u00a7 1920, which enumerates the costs that may be taxed, serves no role whatsoever. We think the better view is that \u00a7 1920 defines the term \u2018costs\u2019 as used in Rule 54(d).\u201d Id. at 441.", "The Court also, at pages 442 43, specifically disapproved the language in the Farmer case which the Claims Court had relied on in Engels. A few years later, the Court said with respect to Crawford, \u201cwe held that [28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1821 and 1920] define the full extent of a federal court\u2019s power to shift litigation costs absent express statutory authority to go further,\u201d and that Crawford held section 1920 \u201cto be an express limitation upon the types of costs which, absent other authority, may be shifted by federal courts.\u201d West Virginia University Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S. 83, 86 87 (1991). If this is true with respect to private litigants who do not have to overcome a sovereign immunity hurdle, the case is even stronger that section 1920 is exclusive when costs are being taxed against the United States.", "Thus far, it appears that the courts are adhering to the seemingly clear signals of Crawford and Casey. See, e.g., Maxwell v. Hapag-Lloyd Aktiengesellschaft, 862 F.2d 767, 770 (9th Cir. 1988), rejecting an argument that Crawford applies only to expert witness fees (Crawford \u201cstrictly limits reimbursable costs to those enumerated in \u00a7 1920\u201d); Miller v. Cudahy Co., 858 F.2d 1449, 1461 (10th Cir. 1988); Pershern v. Fiatallis North America, Inc., 834 F.2d 136, 140 (8th Cir. 1987); Corsair Asset Management, Inc. v. Moskovitz, 142 F.R.D. 347, 351 (N.D. Ga. 1992); Bee v. Greaves, 669 F. Supp. 372, 378 79 (D. Utah 1987).", "There are, however, ripples on the pond. Even after Crawford and Casey, one lower court has cited National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Mullen for the proposition that the enumeration in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 is not exclusive. Director, Office of Thrift Supervision v. Lopez, 141 F.R.D. 165, 167 (S.D. Fla. 1992). And another court has noted Crawford and then stated that it may award costs not specified in the statute, citing the language in Farmer that the Crawford court explicitly disapproved. Commercial Credit Equipment Corp. v. Stamps, 920 F.2d 1361, 1368 n.10 (7th Cir. 1990).", "An approach more likely to be followed is reflected in the statement that Crawford \u201climits judicial discretion with regard to the kind of expenses that may be recovered as costs; it does not, however, prevent courts from interpreting the meaning of the phrases used in \u00a7 1920.\u201d West Wind Africa Line, Ltd. v. Corpus Christi Marine Services Co., 834 F.2d 1232, 1238 (5th Cir. 1988). See also Northbrook Excess & Surplus Ins. Co. v. Procter & Gamble Co., 924 F.2d 633, 643 (7th Cir. 1991); Alflex Corp. v. Underwriters Laboratories, Inc., 914 F.2d 175, 177 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 112 S. Ct. 61. Continuing litigation in the area seems guaranteed.", "Also, it must be emphasized that the fact that an item is not specifically enumerated in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920 does not necessarily mean that it may not be recoverable on some other basis. As we will see, certain otherwise nontaxable items may be awarded as expenses under an attorney\u2019s fee statute. From GAO\u2019s perspective, if an item is taxed against the United States under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a), the award is final and payment is not otherwise provided for, it will be certified for payment under 31 U.S.C.  \u00a7 1304 regardless of GAO\u2019s views as to the propriety of the award. See 41 Comp. Gen. 583 (1962).", "The topic of special masters has also generated a measure of controversy. The Department of Justice has concluded that special masters\u2019 expenses are not taxable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a). Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Crawford, several courts had held that the expenses of special masters could be taxed as costs against the United States, notwithstanding their absence from 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920. National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws v. Mullen, 828 F.2d 536, 545 46 (9th Cir. 1987);  Young v. Pierce, 640 F. Supp. 1476 (E.D.

Crawford  and Casey would seem to support the Justice Department\u2019s position. However, a 1989 case followed Mullen, Pierce, and Turnage, without discussing the effect of Crawford. Trout v. Ball, 705 F. Supp. 705 (D.D.C. 1989). Stay tuned.", "Finally, note that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a) is limited to civil actions. There is no comparable statute authorizing the taxation of costs against the United States in criminal cases.

Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. v. Wilderness Society, 421 U.S. 240 (1975); Key Tronic Corp. v. United States, 114 S. Ct. 1960 (1994). Combining this with the explicit exclusion of attorney\u2019s fees from recoverable costs in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(a) and the concept of sovereign immunity, the starting point is the established principle that attorney\u2019s fees may not be awarded against the United States in the absence of express statutory authority. Statutory authority in this context means federal (not state) statutory authority. See, e.g., Knight v. United States, 982 F.2d 1573 (Fed. Cir. 1993).", "These days, fee-shifting in litigation involving the United States seems to have become more the rule than the exception.

Chesny, 473 U.S. 1, 43 51 (1985). Many of these statutes apply to the United States by their own specific terms; the majority do not. The latter group is now generally applicable to the United States by virtue of the Equal Access to Justice Act, discussed later in this section.", "Questions as to when fees are or are not allowable under a particular statute or how they should be calculated are beyond the scope of this work. In an often-quoted passage, the Supreme Court lamented that a \u201crequest for attorney\u2019s fees should not result in a second major litigation.\u201d Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437 (1983). Notwithstanding this admonition, the volume of case law has become staggering. As we said in our section on costs, our objective here is a limited one\u2014to present an overview from the payment perspective.", "In a few instances, attorney\u2019s fees are paid from the amount recovered in the underlying suit, and are allowable up to a specified maximum percentage of the recovery. Examples are the Federal Tort Claims Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2678) and the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406). Statutory restrictions of this type have been upheld, even against a pre-existing contingent fee agreement. Calhoun v. Massie, 253 U.S. 170 (1920); Capital Trust Co. v.

In the far more common situation, however, the statute authorizes the court to award reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party separate from and in addition to any monetary recovery in the underlying judgment.", "As with costs, an award of attorney\u2019s fees may be included in a judgment on the merits or (more commonly) may be made in a separate judgment or order. Like other money judgments against the United States, judgments awarding attorney\u2019s fees are generally payable from the permanent judgment appropriation as long as the award is final and payment is not otherwise provided for. If the fee award is separate from the judgment on the merits, then the order awarding the fees must itself be final. B-190940, September 21, 1978. As discussed earlier under the Finality heading, interim awards of attorney\u2019s fees have received slightly different treatment in the courts in a number of cases. \u201cAttorney\u2019s fees are meant to serve some purpose of deterring discrimination. They doubtless do in the private sector.  But when attorney\u2019s fees come straight out of the United States Treasury, as in the present case, they exert no deterrent effect whatsoever against the persons responsible for the discrimination. In the private sector there is a justifiable punitive element. Attorney\u2019s fees impact on the profit picture of the corporation; the same executive management which is responsible for tolerating or encouraging discrimination are the same executives who are responsible for the profit of the corporation, so they are penalized in the pocketbook. No such deterrence applies to the Government, i.e., the Labor Department budget was never touched, will never be touched, by the award . . . in this case. Both the back pay and the attorney\u2019s fee come out of the general taxpayer contributed funds of the U.S. Treasury. By their strict analogy to the private sector, the majority has validated deterrent or punitive action against the U.S. taxpayer.\u201d Id. at 912.", "In some instances, such as subsection (d) of the Equal Access to Justice Act, Congress has recognized this by requiring payment from agency funds. Of course, agency funds also come from the taxpayer\u2019s pocket, so either way the taxpayer foots the bill. To the extent an agency can simply request and receive additional funds to budget for fee awards, deterrence may be frustrated even under a system of agency payment. Real deterrence requires not only agency payment but a requirement that the agency absorb the fee awards in its existing budget. But even here, there is the risk of the agency\u2019s funding the awards not by trimming fat or waste but by cutting back on other needed programs, perhaps even programs designed to benefit those the fee awards were intended to help. In sum, while it may be true that use of the judgment appropriation defeats deterrence, a simple requirement to use agency funds, without a consideration of complex budgetary and social issues, does not guarantee it either."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "b.

They mostly predate the Equal Access to Justice Act and operate independent of it.

It does not, however, exclude section 505 which authorizes the fee awards.

As interest rates rose dramatically during the 1970s, the courts began to award higher rates, holding that the statutory 6 percent rate was a floor rather than a ceiling.

Cl. 1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1051, the court held that the 4 percent rate had become economically outmoded, and established a stepped percentage rate varying from 4 percent for the years 1947 1955 to 7.5 percent for the years 1971 1975. In Tektronix, Inc. v. United States , 552 F.2d 343, 352 53 (Ct. Cl. 1977), the court announced that it would apply the Pitcairn rates in future cases unless, for years after 1975, the claimant could affirmatively demonstrate that the rate should differ from the 7.5 percent rate set for 1971 1975.", "In subsequent cases, the Court of Claims and its successors have used the rates determined under section 6621 of the Internal Revenue Code for post-1975 periods.

Dynamics Corp., 5 Cl. Ct. at 619. However, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit has suggested that compound interest may be more appropriate in certain cases. Dynamics Corp., 766 F.2d 518 at 520. Following this suggestion, the Claims Court awarded compound interest in ITT Corp., cited above.", "GAO will not automatically add interest in a patent infringement case. It is viewed as a judicial function and must be expressly awarded in the judgment. 59 Comp.

Five years later, in a case often cited in tandem with Standard Oil, the Court distinguished Standard Oil and denied interest to the beneficiary of a soldier under a government-issued life and disability insurance policy.

Lynn, 503 F.2d 636 (6th Cir. 1974), the court awarded interest on a recovery under a reinsurance contract issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Citing the Standard Oil and Worley cases, the court noted the \u201cwell defined\u201d exception to the no-interest rule when a federal agency \u201cembarks on a business venture\u201d with the power to sue and be sued. Id. at 643. The court stated three grounds for the interest award: HUD\u2019s sue-and-be-sued clause, the \u201cself-supporting nature\u201d of the HUD program, and the fact that the transactions resembled those of private parties. Id. at 645.", "More recently, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit analyzed Standard Oil and Worley and denied interest in R&R Farm Enterprises, Inc. v. Federal Crop Insurance Corp., 788 F.2d 1148 (5th Cir. 1986) (rice crop insurance policy issued by FCIC), and in A.L.T. Corp. v. Small Business Administration, 823 F.2d 126 (5th Cir. 1987).

R&R, 788 F.2d at 1153; A.L.T., 823 F.2d at 128.", "Another group of cases involves the United States Postal Service. The court in Nagy v. United States Postal Service, 773 F.2d 1190 (11th Cir. 1985), awarded interest on back pay in a Title VII discrimination case. Similar holdings are Perez v. United States, 830 F.2d 54 (5th Cir. 1987) (Federal Tort Claims Act judgment); Hall v. Bolger, 768 F.2d 1148 (9th Cir. 1985) (interest on attorney\u2019s fees in handicap discrimination case); White v. Bloomberg, 501 F.2d 1379 (4th Cir. 1974) (interest on award under pre-1988 version of Back Pay Act). The rationale of these cases is that the Postal Service\u2019s sue-and-be-sued clause is a waiver of sovereign immunity which subjects it to liability for interest. The nature of the Postal Service\u2019s \u201cbusiness,\u201d its funding structure, and its self-sufficiency or lack thereof do not appear to have been significant factors apart from passing mention in Perez that the Postal Service \u201cis designed to be self-supporting and to operate very much like a commercial business.\u201d 830 F.2d at 60. \u201cBy launching \u2018the Postal Service into the commercial world,\u2019 and including a sue-and-be-sued clause in its charter, Congress has cast off the Service\u2019s \u2018cloak of sovereignty\u2019 and given it the \u2018status of a private commercial enterprise.\u2019 . . . It follows that Congress is presumed to have waived any otherwise existing immunity of the Postal Service from interest awards.\u201d", "Id. at 556. The Court further noted that the interest award would not be inconsistent with the Postal Service\u2019s enabling legislation (Postal Reorganization Act), would not threaten \u201cgrave interference\u201d with the Service\u2019s operations, and was not contrary to anything in the legislative history of the Service\u2019s sue-and-be-sued authority. Id. at 556 57. Thus, since prejudgment interest could be awarded against a private Title VII defendant, it could be awarded against the Postal Service. See also Maksymchuk v. Frank, 987 F.2d 1072 (4th Cir. 1993).", "Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s Loeffler formulation, it seems clear that the \u201ccommercial venture\u201d exception to the no-interest rule requires several things. First, there must be a sue-and-be-sued clause. Second, the agency or program involved must be one that Congress has \u201claunched into the commercial world.\u201d A sue-and-be-sued clause alone is not enough. Pender Peanut Corp. v. United States, 21 Cl. Ct. 95 (1990). Finally, liability for interest must not be inconsistent with the relevant enabling or program legislation.", "Applying the Loeffler criteria, courts have refused to apply the \u201ccommercial venture\u201d exception to federal agencies which do not have sue-and-be-sued clauses and which are engaged in primarily governmental, as opposed to commercial, functions. McGehee v. Panama Canal Commission, 872 F.2d 1213 (5th Cir. 1989) (unlike the Panama Canal Company which it replaced, the Commission is not a corporation and was not given sue-and-be-sued authority); Wilson v.

For nontax cases not subject to some other specific interest provision:If the United States does not appeal from a Court of Federal Claims judgment, there is no interest.If a Court of Federal Claims judgment is appealed to the Federal Circuit and affirmed, interest does not accrue during that appeal no matter who files what.

Historically, interest was not allowable during the period that determinations by trial commissioners were under review by the full Court of Claims. While some details have changed from time to time (for example, the shift in 1982 from a flat 4 percent rate to the Treasury bill rate), the basic concept has been followed ever since.", "To understand the effect of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, resort to the legislative history is very helpful. The substantive changes to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961 and 2516(b) stem from Unprinted Amendment No. 766, and the legislative history consists of comments by Senator Grassley and two letters from the Office of Management and Budget. This material, found at 127 Cong. Rec. 29865 67 (1981) and discussed in Ulmet v. United States, 19 Cl.

Thus, the \u201cdate of the mandate of affirmance\u201d in this context means the date the mandate is issued. 5 Comp. Gen. 832 (1926).

Delays of this sort are compensable only if and to the extent they are included within the permissible range of interest accrual specified in the governing statutes.", "What about compound interest, or interest on interest? When might prejudgment and postjudgment interest both be available on the same judgment? As noted earlier, if prejudgment interest is authorized and stops at the date of the judgment, it is considered part of the judgment and any authorized postjudgment interest would be computed on the sum of principal plus prejudgment interest. B-111945, November 13, 1952. However, the postjudgment interest statutes do not apply to a judgment, or portion thereof, which itself provides for interest beyond its entry. Cherokee Nation v. United States, 270 U.S. 476 (1926); 18 Comp. Gen. 873 (1939).

The very fact that judgments could now be paid promptly upon becoming final would also contribute to reducing the amount of interest the government would otherwise be required to pay.", "Since the original judgment appropriation applied only to judgments not in excess of $100,000, the larger judgments continued to be governed by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b). When the $100,000 ceiling was removed in 1977, once again a stated purpose was to reduce the amount of interest payable by the United States. This would be done by making judgments in excess of $100,000 subject to the restrictions of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(A).", "The rationale of subsection (b)(1)(A) is the same as the rationale of the old 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b)\u2014to compensate a successful plaintiff for substantial government-caused delay in receiving payment. Before 1956, the delay was inherent in all cases by virtue of the need to await specific appropriations.

At the same time, the 1982 legislation repealed 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b) and struck the specific reference to it in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(A). This made it possible to argue that Congress intended to withdraw its waiver of sovereign immunity for postjudgment interest on FTCA judgments. However, nowhere in the legislative history of the 1982 legislation is there the slightest hint of an intent to produce this result. Accordingly, although neither agency has formally addressed the point, GAO and the Justice Department continue to regard interest on FTCA judgments as payable if the conditions of subsection (b)(1)(A) are satisfied.", "The courts have also continued to apply subsection (b)(1)(A) to judgments under the Federal Tort Claims Act. See, e.g., Andrulonis v. United States, 26 F.3d 1224 (2d Cir. 1994); Transco Leasing Corp. v. United States, 992 F.2d 552 (5th Cir. 1993); Desart v. United States, 947 F.2d 871 (9th Cir. 1991); Starns v. United States, 923 F.2d 34 (4th Cir. 1991); Lucas v. United States, 807 F.2d 414 (5th Cir. 1986); Cardillo v. United States, 767 F.2d 33 (2d Cir. 1985); MacDonald v. United States, 825 F. Supp. 683 (M.D. Pa. 1993). See also Wilson v. United States, 756 F. Supp. 213 (D.N.J. 1991) (court refused to award interest under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961).", "As a final note, another phrase in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 has caused some confusion. The \u201cappropriating language\u201d found at 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(a) makes the appropriation available for \u201cinterest and costs specified in the judgments or otherwise authorized by law.\u201d On the surface, this appears to permit interest by the simple device of including it in the judgment. Such an interpretation would have the anomalous result of effectively abolishing the no-interest rule with respect to judgments through a statute intended to reduce interest costs. The only legislative history addressing this language is a brief discussion appearing on page 885 of the Hearings cited previously. It explains that the purpose of the \u201cinterest . . . specified in the judgment\u201d language was merely to permit the payment of prejudgment interest in cases where awarding it is discretionary with the court, and this has been GAO\u2019s consistent interpretation. B-236958, October 3, 1989 (non-decision letter); B-163682, March 18, 1968; B-141540, March 24, 1960. (2) The \u201cLittle Tucker Act\u201d", "As noted above, prior to 1982, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(A) was expressly limited to judgments covered by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b), which in turn applied to \u201cactions instituted under\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346. Section 1346 is the jurisdictional provision for three types of suits which can result in money judgments against the United States\u2014tax cases, Federal Tort Claims Act, and the district court portion of the Tucker Act (non-tort claims not exceeding $10,000, the so-called \u201cLittle Tucker Act\u201d). Since tax cases were governed by other specific interest provisions, the old 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b) applied essentially to the Federal Tort Claims Act and the \u201cLittle Tucker Act.\u201d Thus, prior to 1982, the rules for postjudgment interest on Federal Tort Claims Act judgments applied equally to \u201cLittle Tucker Act\u201d judgments. E.g., Eastern Service Mgmt. Co. v. United States, 363 F.2d 729 (4th Cir. 1966); United States v. Mississippi Valley Barge Line Co., 285 F.2d 381 (8th Cir. 1960); B-182346, February 4, 1975.", "Under the restructuring brought about by the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, Little Tucker Act judgments are now appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rather than to the numbered circuits. Thus, interest on Little Tucker Act judgments is now governed by the rules applicable to the Court of Federal Claims and Federal Circuit. Zumerling v. Marsh, 783 F.2d 1032 (Fed. Cir. 1986). See also Thompson v. Kennickell, 797 F.2d 1015, 1026 n.7 (D.C. Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 905. (3) Other situations Prior to 1982, there could be no \u201cother situations.\u201d The explicit statutory language of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(A) precluded its application beyond the situations noted above. For example, actions under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act are not brought under the jurisdictional authority of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346 but under separate jurisdictional provisions of the Civil Rights Act itself. Thus, subsection (b)(1)(A) was inapplicable by its terms, and interest was not payable on Title VII judgments regardless of appeals or filings. B-195809-O.M., March 30, 1981.", "By the repeal of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b) and the elimination of the reference to it in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(A), the Federal Courts Improvement Act at least changed the nature of the analysis. It is now necessary to address whether 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304 is a waiver of sovereign immunity. If it is, then it can be argued that subsection (b)(1)(A) applies across the board because the language that limited its application from 1956 to 1982 is no longer there. If it is not, then its application has not expanded from what it was before the 1982 amendments.", "In Thompson v. Kennickell, 797 F.2d 1015 (D.C. Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 905, the court considered this precise issue. Although the case involved interest on a Title VII judgment and its result has been presumably superseded by the Civil Rights Act of 1991, it remains important for its extensive discussion of postjudgment interest against the United States both before and after the Federal Courts Improvement Act. The plaintiff argued that, because of the repeal of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b), postjudgment interest is now payable on all district court judgments because the alternative\u2014the elimination of previously authorized interest on Federal Tort Claims Act and Little Tucker Act judgments\u2014could not have been intended. The court disagreed. While declining to address the possible curtailment of previously available interest, the court found no new waiver of sovereign immunity in the 1982 legislation. Section 1304, noted the court, \u201crefers to statutory provisions other than itself to determine when the United States must pay post-judgment interest.\u201d Id. at 1021 n.1.", "Similarly, Arvin v. United States, 742 F.2d 1301, 1305 (11th Cir. 1984), found no waiver of sovereign immunity in 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. In view of this, in conjunction with the previously cited line of cases holding that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961 does not waive sovereign immunity, and the legislative history of the Federal Courts Improvement Act amendments as detailed in Kennickell, it would appear that the scope of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b) has not expanded by virtue of the 1982 legislation.", "A case we should note although its impact should be minimal is United States v. Wilson, 926 F.2d 725 (8th Cir. 1991). The United States brought a quiet title action as trustee on behalf of an Indian tribe against non-Indian defendants. The tribe prevailed on its claim, but the United States was ordered to compensate the defendants for improvements they had made while in possession of the disputed land. The district court also ordered the United States to pay postjudgment interest in accordance with 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304. The defendants appealed, seeking interest from the date of judgment to the date of payment. The appellate court affirmed the district court\u2019s judgment, noting that the order to pay postjudgment interest had not been appealed and therefore was the \u201claw of the case.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "b. Implementation", "paragraphs": ["(1) Filing procedures Interest begins to accrue from the date a \u201ctranscript of the judgment\u201d is filed with GAO. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(A). The editors of this chapter confess that they have not the slightest idea what a \u201ctranscript\u201d of a judgment is. Generally speaking, a simple photocopy of the judgment will suffice, and this in fact is what is most commonly filed. Also, an \u201cabstract of judgment\u201d (a form obtained from the court) will be accepted.", "A judgment is considered \u201cfiled\u201d on the earliest day it is received by any GAO employee. For example, judgments are occasionally submitted to one of GAO\u2019s regional offices and then forwarded to Washington. The date of receipt in the regional office is the date of filing.", "The statute does not specify who is required to file the copy of the judgment with GAO, but it is clearly the plaintiff\u2019s responsibility. The first case to squarely address this issue was Lennon v. United States, E.D.N.Y., No. 76-C-396, mem. op. dated October 1, 1979. The plaintiff had argued that it should be the responsibility of the United States Attorney and that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s knowledge of the judgment should be \u201cimputed\u201d to GAO. The court disagreed and denied a motion for interest, concluding that  (a) since postjudgment interest is for the plaintiff\u2019s benefit, the responsibility of taking the protective measure of filing should also rest with the plaintiff, and (b) construing the statute to place the burden on the government would render it meaningless. Subsequent published decisions have removed all doubt, and have consistently refused to adopt a \u201cconstructive filing\u201d approach. Reminga v. United States, 695 F.2d 1000 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1086; Rooney v. United States, 694 F.2d 582 (9th Cir. 1982); Moyer v. United States, 612 F. Supp. 239 (D. Nev. 1985). As a practical matter, GAO will not disallow interest if the judgment is filed by someone other than the plaintiff, but it must nevertheless be viewed as the plaintiff\u2019s primary responsibility.", "In a class action or multiple-plaintiff suit, the statute does not require a filing by each individual plaintiff. A filing by any plaintiff or by class counsel will operate on behalf of the entire class and will satisfy the statutory requirement. See Larionoff v. United States, D.D.C., No. 626-73, mem. op., December 29, 1977, aff\u2019d per curiam, D.C. Cir., No. 78-1010, July 17, 1978.", "When filing a judgment with GAO for purposes of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b), it is desirable for evidentiary purposes to use Certified Mail, Return Receipt Requested. A simple transmittal letter stating that the judgment is being filed in accordance with 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b) also will not hurt. Normally, correspondence received by GAO is machine-stamped with the date of receipt. (2) Unsuccessful government appeal One of the essential prerequisites to interest under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b)(1)(A) is an unsuccessful appeal by the government. If there is no appeal, there is no entitlement to interest even though there may have been substantial delay in settlement of the claim. In B-182346, February 4, 1975, interest was denied where a judgment was not appealed but was nevertheless not submitted for payment until a year after it was issued. However, in a 1978 decision, interest was paid where the plaintiff had filed the judgment with GAO and the government had filed a notice of appeal but failed to prosecute the appeal and, after considerable delay, consented to dismiss the appeal. Even though there was technically no \u201cmandate of affirmance,\u201d the filing of the notice of appeal effectively prevented prompt payment. Thus, the case was viewed as falling within the scope of section 1304(b) when construed in light of its purpose\u2014to compensate a plaintiff for substantial delay in payment caused by the government\u2019s action in filing an appeal. 58 Comp. Gen. 67 (1978). In 59 Comp. Gen. 259 (1980), this principle was applied, and interest held payable, in a case where the appeal was unrelated to the merits of the underlying judgment, but rather was an appeal from the denial of a motion to reopen the judgment to direct the withholding of federal income tax. Thus, the appeal may be an appeal on a collateral issue, but there must be an appeal. Postjudgment motions will not suffice to trigger interest under section 1304(b). 62 Comp. Gen. 4 (1982).", "In another case, the government filed a notice of appeal with the district court and subsequently changed its mind. Normally, the district court would automatically transmit the notice to the court of appeals. Before that could happen in this case, however, the area suffered an earthquake which disrupted the operation of both the courts and the Postal Service. This allowed the government to retrieve its notice of appeal before it was transmitted to the appellate court. Based on the reasoning of 62 Comp. Gen. 4 and its predecessors, interest was nevertheless allowed. B-239559, May 22, 1990 (internal memorandum).", "A 1994 case found the requirement for a government appeal satisfied where the United States did not appeal directly but joined, and filed a brief in support of, an appeal filed by a co-defendant. Andrulonis v. United States, 26 F.3d 1224 (2d Cir. 1994). (3) Interest accrual period Interest under section 1304(b) runs \u201cthrough the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance.\u201d Prior to the 1982 recodification of Title 31, the statute read simply \u201cto the date of the mandate of affirmance.\u201d An early draft of the recodification changed this to \u201cthrough the date of the mandate of affirmance.\u201d GAO pointed out that, under the interest formula traditionally used by the accounting officers, the computation included the beginning date or the ending date, but not both. E.g., B-60952, July 2, 1953. Thus, the draft would have made a substantive change in the law, which is beyond the scope of a recodification. To avoid this and also remove the perceived ambiguity of the pre-1982 language, the recodifiers settled upon the \u201cthrough the day before\u201d language.", "Where the appeal is dismissed or withdrawn and there is no mandate of affirmance, interest will cease to accrue on the earlier of the date of dismissal or the date the Justice Department certifies to GAO that no further review will be sought. See 59 Comp. Gen. 259, 261 (1980); 58 Comp. Gen. 67, 73 (1978).", "Multiple appeals in the same case may produce more than one mandate of affirmance. This was the case in Transco Leasing Corp. v. United States, 992 F.2d 552 (5th Cir. 1993), in which the appellate court had affirmed the judgment on the first appeal but remanded it for recomputation of damages. The second appeal dealt with interest. The court held that the mandate issuing from the first appeal was the operative mandate for interest accrual purposes. Id. at 556. (4) Types of appellate action When the appellate chain in a given case produces more than one judgment, questions may arise as to which judgment should be regarded as the final judgment for interest purposes. Under current law, the question is relevant primarily for fixing the reference point for determining the proper rate of interest under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a). Although several of the cases noted below dealt with obsolete versions of the statutes and therefore the interest accrual dates are no longer applicable, the cases are nevertheless useful by analogy in answering this question and generally in illustrating how 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b) is applied.", "Obviously, a judgment which is affirmed on appeal \u201cqualifies\u201d under section 1304(b). In one case, the original district court judgment was reversed by the court of appeals. The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, and the court of appeals then affirmed the original judgment but reduced the amount. Interest was held payable (under the old 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2411(b)) on the reduced amount from the date of the original district court judgment. B-97757, October 24, 1950. In another case, the original judgment, affirmed on appeal, was lost from the court records during the appeal process, and a new judgment was signed with a later date. The first judgment was regarded as the final judgment for interest purposes. B-185455-O.M., February 9, 1976.", "Under one judicial formulation, the original judgment is the operative judgment for interest purposes when it is \u201csubstantially affirmed\u201d on appeal, including appellate modification or remand for recalculation of damages. Transco Leasing Corp. v. United States, cited above. Of course, if the recalculation produces a higher award, interest is applied to the original amount as that is the amount which was substantially affirmed. E.g., Desart v. United States, 947 F.2d 871 (9th Cir. 1991).", "Where a judgment is reversed and remanded, opinions are split. What appears to be the majority view is that portions of the judgment unaffected by the reversal should be treated as though affirmed (whether expressly affirmed or not), and that the original judgment remains the operative judgment for interest purposes, adjusted of course to reflect the results of the appeal. E.g., Brooks v. United States, 757 F.2d 734 (5th Cir. 1985); Perkins v. Standard Oil Co., 487 F.2d 672 (9th Cir. 1973). See also Mascuilli v. United States, 383 F. Supp. 50 (E.D. Pa. 1974), aff\u2019d mem., 519 F.2d 1398 (3d Cir. 1975). Cases reaching a contrary result are Merchants Matrix Cut Syndicate, Inc. v. United States, 284 F.2d 456 (7th Cir. 1960), and Mosby v. United States, 33 Ct. Cl. 58 (1897).", "Where a judgment is vacated rather than reversed, precedent is sparse. In United States v. Brooks, 176 F.2d 482 (4th Cir. 1949), a judgment was vacated and remanded with instructions to consider reducing damages. GAO concluded that the vacated judgment was not the final judgment for interest purposes. B-62830, August 31, 1950. In accord is the Mascuilli case cited above, in which the court refused to award interest on a Public Vessels Act judgment from the date of a prior judgment which had been vacated on appeal. After the vacated judgment, there were 3 subsequent judgments, 2 of which were reversed and remanded. The court awarded interest from the date of the first of the \u201creversed and remanded\u201d judgments on the theory that this was the judgment \u201cthat finally settled the issue of liability between the parties.\u201d 383 F. Supp. at 53. See also Turner v. Japan Lines, Ltd., 702 F.2d 752, 754 (9th Cir. 1983). (5) Interest calculation When interest is payable under 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b), the rate is the 52-week Treasury bill rate determined under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(a) with reference to the original judgment. It is applied on a fixed-rate basis and does not vary with respect to a particular judgment. Once the rate is determined for a given judgment, it remains the same throughout the accrual period. Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Corp. v. Bonjorno, 494 U.S. 827, 838 39 (1990); Campbell v. United States, 809 F.2d 563, 573 (9th Cir. 1987).", "Prior to the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, postjudgment interest under section 1304(b) was simple interest. However, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(b) now provides for annual compounding. The plain terms of the statutes would seem to indicate that compounding against the United States can apply only where the period between the date of filing with GAO and the mandate of affirmance exceeds one year, and this is how GAO in fact applies the statute. E.g., B-219881.4, October 20, 1987 (non-decision letter). (6) Addressing interest in the judgment When the conditions of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b) are satisfied, interest attaches by force and operation of law. There is no need for the judgment to expressly award interest. Campbell v. United States, 809 F.2d 563, 570 (9th Cir. 1987); United States v. Maryland ex rel. Meyer, 349 F.2d 693, 696 (D.C. Cir. 1965). If it is desired to say something about interest in the judgment, GAO\u2019s recommendation is that general language be used, such as \u201cinterest as provided by law,\u201d which GAO reads as meaning \u201cas and to the extent provided by law,\u201d in which event interest is added or not added, depending on compliance with the statute. Courts have viewed the phrase \u201cas provided by law\u201d similarly. See Black v. United States, 444 F.2d 1215, 1217 (10th Cir. 1971); Higginson v. Schoeneman, 190 F.2d 32, 34 (D.C. Cir. 1951); Economy Plumbing & Heating Co. v. United States, 470 F.2d 585, 593 94 (Ct. Cl. 1972).", "Occasionally, a court will include an interest provision in a judgment which is clearly inconsistent with 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 1304(b) or is otherwise improper. As the many cases cited throughout this section make clear, the inclusion of a contrary interest provision is grounds for the government to seek modification of the judgment. Thus, if a judgment is submitted for payment which contains an award of interest in non-discretionary language inconsistent with existing law, it will be returned with a recommendation to seek appropriate modification. Experience has shown that frequently plaintiff\u2019s counsel, upon being confronted with the governing statutes and case law, will agree not to pursue the interest claim, in which event there is no need to go back to court. In other cases, it may be necessary to seek judicial modification by motion or appeal. If attempts at judicial modification are unsuccessful and the Justice Department then determines that judicial modification is not possible, the award will be certified for payment in accordance with its terms. See 38 Comp. Gen. 12 (1958); B-183576, August 26, 1977. In no event, however, can interest be paid for any period beyond the date the judgment itself was paid. See B-200460, November 18, 1980. Payment in these cases merely recognizes the duty to comply with a court order which can no longer be modified through established channels, and is not given precedential value."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "7.
