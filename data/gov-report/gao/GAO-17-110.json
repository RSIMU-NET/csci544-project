The act  established both MSPB and OSC and placed OSC within MSPB. OSC  was tasked with investigating allegations of prohibited personnel practices  (PPP), obtaining corrective actions for employees subjected to PPPs, and  initiating disciplinary action against civilian government officials who  commit PPPs, among other things.", "Thereafter, Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 to  strengthen protections for those who claim whistleblower retaliation. This  act separated OSC from MSPB, making OSC an independent agency.  The Whistleblower Protection Act also created the individual right of  action (IRA), allowing whistleblowers to bring their appeals to MSPB after exhausting remedies at OSC. Congress further expanded whistleblower  protections in 1994 when it made additional personnel actions subject to  coverage and extending whistleblower protections to employees of  government corporations and to employees in the Veterans Health  Administration (VHA).", "On November 27, 2012, the President signed WPEA into law. WPEA  clarified the scope of protected whistleblowing under the  Whistleblower Protection Act; expanded the ability to bring IRA appeals for certain protected activity; provided the authority to award compensatory damages; afforded whistleblower protections to all Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) employees; and mandated broader outreach to inform federal employees of their  whistleblower rights.", "OSC and MSPB are the two primary agencies in the executive branch to  which federal employees, former employees, or applicants for  employment in the federal government go with whistleblower reprisal  claims. OSC investigates PPP complaints with respect to a broad range  of personnel actions, including appointments, promotions, details,  transfers, reassignments, and decisions concerning pay, benefits,  awards, and certain decisions concerning education or training. MSPB is  an independent, quasi-judicial agency that serves the interests of prompt,  procedurally simple dispute resolution. MSPB carries out its statutory  responsibilities and authorities primarily by adjudicating individual  employee appeals and by conducting merit systems studies.", "MSPB has jurisdiction over claims made by whistleblowers in two types of  appeals\u2014an Individual Right of Action (IRA) appeal and an Otherwise  Appealable Action (OAA) appeal. A significant difference between the  two types is in how they reach MSPB. In the first type of appeal\u2014an  IRA\u2014the individual is subject to a personnel action, such as a reassignment with no reduction in pay or grade, and claims that the action  was taken because of whistleblowing or other covered protected activity,  but the action need not be one that is directly appealable to MSPB.  Examples of the personnel actions that can be raised in an IRA appeal  include an appointment, a reassignment, and a performance appraisal. In  this kind of case, the individual can appeal to MSPB only if he or she files  a complaint with OSC first and OSC does not seek corrective action on  the individual\u2019s behalf. In the second kind of case\u2014an OAA\u2014the  individual is subject to a personnel action that is directly appealable to  MSPB, such as a removal, demotion, or suspension of more than 14  days, and the individual claims that the action was taken because of  whistleblowing. In this kind of case, the individual may file an appeal  directly with MSPB after the action has been taken. In such an appeal, if  the employee proves that MSPB has jurisdiction over the appeal, then  both the appealable matter and the claim of reprisal for whistleblowing will  be reviewed.", "IRAs and OAAs must be filed with one of MSPB\u2019s regional or field  offices. Once MSPB receives an appeal, it is then docketed in MSPB\u2019s  Case Management System and assigned to an administrative judge who  issues an acknowledgment that the appeal has been received, orders the  agency to file a response to the appeal, and determines whether or not  MSPB has jurisdiction over the appeal. If the administrative judge  determines that MSPB has jurisdiction, the administrative judge will then  conduct a hearing (if requested by the employee), consider the evidence,  and issue an initial decision. That decision may be appealed to the three- Member Board of MSPB on a petition for review. According to MSPB, the  Board members review initial decisions in much the same way that  appellate courts review the decisions of trial courts. Thus, petition for  review outcomes are the decisions of the Board and it may issue a  decision that affirms, reverses, modifies, or vacates, in whole or in part,  the initial decision. The Board may also send back the appeal to the  administrative judge for further review. An employee also may appeal  either the initial decision (which becomes the final decision if neither party  files a timely petition for review), or the petition for review decision, to a  U.S. Court of Appeals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MSPB\u2019s Data Show a Higher Annual Number of Whistleblower Appeals Post WPEA; but Weaknesses Exist in MSPB\u2019s Recording and Reporting Processes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "MSPB Data Show a Higher Annual Number of Post-WPEA IRA Appeals, but a Lower Annual Number of OAA Appeals", "paragraphs": ["MSPB data show the agency received a total of 1,213 IRA appeals for  whistleblower reprisal claims for fiscal years 2013 through 2015.

MSPB data show that it received 261 IRA  appeals in fiscal year 2011 and 268 IRA appeals in fiscal year 2012.

As described earlier, for an OAA, the employee alleges  whistleblowing as an affirmative defense to the adverse agency action,  but the action was one that could be appealed to MSPB even without  whistleblowing. Therefore, WPEA may not have necessarily impacted the  number of OAAs filed with MSPB.

Each of these may have  contributed to a higher number of appeals filed. For example, earlier court  decisions had determined that the following disclosures were not  protected: disclosures made to the alleged wrongdoer, disclosures made  as part of an employee\u2019s normal job duties, and disclosures of information  already known. WPEA clarified that each of these disclosures does not  lose whistleblower protection due to the nature of the disclosure. In  addition, WPEA extended whistleblower protections to the approximately  60,000 TSA employees who were not previously afforded whistleblower  protection. WPEA also expanded the IRA for reprisals for certain other  protected activities, including filing a whistleblower appeal, cooperating  with an inspector general or OSC investigation, or refusing to obey an  order that would require the employee to violate a law. Another possible  factor for the higher number of appeals may be that employees are more  knowledgeable post WPEA about the whistleblower protection process  because of the requirement under WPEA for each agency to designate a  whistleblower protection ombudsman to educate agency employees  about prohibitions on retaliation, and rights and remedies against  retaliation, for protected disclosures.", "According to MSPB officials, MSPB is not in a position to know why the  number of OAAs filed with MSPB decreased post WPEA; however they  provided a number of factors that could have contributed to the lower  numbers.  They told us that agencies that furloughed large numbers of  employees as a consequence of government sequestration in fiscal year  2013 were likely devoting significant resources to defending furlough  appeals before MSPB during fiscal year 2014. MSPB officials explained  that some agencies may have taken fewer adverse actions during fiscal  year 2014 in light of the resources devoted to furlough appeals. MSPB  officials indicated that the government-wide shutdown in October 2013,  and the resulting disruption to agencies\u2019 operations, may have also  caused some agencies to take fewer adverse actions during fiscal year  2014. The officials said that another possible explanation for the reduction  in OAAs is that employees with MSPB appeal rights might have elected to  challenge appealable actions in other ways, such as by filing a grievance  or an equal employment opportunity or OSC complaint.  According to  MSPB officials, such matters could still eventually come before MSPB.  For example, if the employee files a complaint with OSC, the employee  may file with MSPB once OSC has terminated its investigation or 120  days after the complaint was filed with OSC if OSC has not notified the  employee that it will seek corrective action."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ten Agencies Accounted for More than One-Third of the Total Number of IRA and OAA Appeals Filed from Fiscal Years 2013 through 2015", "paragraphs": ["Employees from 10 agencies accounted for more than one-third of the  IRA and OAA appeals filed with MSPB during fiscal years 2013 through  2015.

MAP  facilitates a discussion between the employee  and his or her respective agency to help  identify issues to resolve disputes. Such steps  may help settle the appeal quickly,  economically, and to the benefit of both  parties. However, both parties must agree to  its use before the appeal will be accepted for  MAP.

Summary judgment authority is a procedural  device used when there is no dispute as to  the material facts of the case, and a party is  entitled to judgment as a matter of law and the  responsibility of the court.   Who has summary judgment authority?  Other federal adjudicatory bodies, such as the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission  (EEOC) and the Federal Labor Relations  Authority, have summary judgment authority.  According to EEOC officials we met with,  summary judgment is frequently used at  EEOC as a vetting process to determine  whether or not a hearing will be held after the  record has been developed. They also stated  that summary judgment is used as a case  management tool and its advantages include  eliminating the need for a hearing.", "Focus group participants in favor of summary judgment for MSPB stated  that it would be advantageous for involved agencies and MSPB because  it would create greater efficiencies. They said that involved agencies  would not have to engage in an exhaustive, extensive process when the  facts do not warrant it if MSPB had summary judgment authority. One  participant stated that having summary judgment would separate valid  complaints from meritless complaints that may not have any facts in  dispute, such as employees who are shielding themselves from  misconduct they actually committed. Another participant said that  involved agencies would delay making settlement decisions until  summary judgment rulings were made instead of currently settling cases  agencies deemed meritless to save agency resources.", "Participants also told us that MSPB could gain greater efficiencies from  summary judgment because it could potentially decrease the number of  appeals for which administrative judges would conduct hearings, thus  allowing administrative judges to issue decisions on additional appeals,  reducing potential backlogs, and resolving cases sooner. As a result,  MSPB could conserve time and resources in the long term. One  participant proposed a 5-year pilot to determine and measure the  efficiency of summary judgment on affected parties.", "On the other hand, focus group participants opposing summary judgment  for MSPB said that a motion for summary judgment may not resolve  whistleblower cases any faster because it would require more discovery,  depositions, and documents to establish the disputed facts thereby  creating more prehearing litigation work. In addition, they said that while  MSPB\u2019s current caseload may decrease in the short term, MSPB may  spend more time dealing with appeals of unfavorable summary judgment  decisions. They explained that this could lead to prolonged litigation,  thereby eliminating any potential efficiency gained by MSPB. Participants  also discussed MSPB\u2019s ability to dismiss cases under its jurisdictional  test, noting that this process is like a summary judgment review.  However, one participant distinguished MSPB\u2019s current jurisdictional test  from summary judgment because the jurisdictional test only involves the  whistleblower, not the agency, and only reviews whether the  whistleblower has exhausted his or her administrative remedies and can  establish the jurisdictional requirements for MSPB review. Three  participants pointed out the small number of appeals that are currently  adjudicated on the merits as an example of MSPB\u2019s current efficiency in  using its jurisdictional test. Adding summary judgment authority to MSPB,  according to another participant, would not only be duplicative but would  also create two barriers for a whistleblower\u2019s case to move forward.", "Focus group participants not in favor of granting summary judgment to  MSPB also stated that doing so could unfairly erode employee  whistleblowers\u2019 right to a hearing. They explained that the procedural  nature of responding to a summary judgment motion may include legal  technicalities that employee whistleblowers, who choose to represent  themselves without legal counsel, may not understand. Specifically, they  stated that summary judgment may be too complicated a legal tactic to  master for the average employee whistleblower, who may be confused  about the burden needed to overcome a summary judgment motion. For  example, employee whistleblowers may lack legal expertise to properly  complete required paperwork to address the motion for summary  judgment. Conversely, agency attorneys who represent the involved  agencies\u2019 position in whistleblower appeals may be better positioned to  draft sophisticated briefs and well-prepared affidavits to which employee  whistleblowers would be unable to respond\u2014a scenario that focus group  participants believe favors involved agencies.", "One participant said that involved agencies already win a majority of the  appeals at MSPB, and if summary judgment were granted, the odds of  employee whistleblowers prevailing against an agency\u2019s motion would be nonexistent. The participant stated that the current process is already an  uneven playing field. Another participant explained that proving retaliatory  intent by the agency for whistleblowing may be too difficult to achieve  where the employee whistleblower must rely on submitting a brief and  documents to support the employee\u2019s allegations rather than a hearing. In  addition, focus group participants cited the additional costs of conducting  discovery as another potential disadvantage for employee whistleblowers.  Conducting discovery includes gathering documentation and conducting  depositions to establish disputed facts in order to draft motions required  for summary judgment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Subject Matter Specialists Said Granting U.S. District Courts Jurisdiction Would Increase Overall Caseload, but Would Also Aid Employee Whistleblowers", "paragraphs": ["Focus group participants generally agreed that it would be beneficial for  employee whistleblowers if U.S. District Courts were granted jurisdiction  for whistleblower cases. They said that this would give whistleblowers  access to a jury trial similar to nonfederal employee whistleblowers. One  participant pointed out that a double standard already exists because  corporate whistleblowers can go to district court while federal employee  whistleblowers are unable to do so. Another participant stated that it  would be a good idea to get federal employee whistleblower cases into  district court because the only option typically available to get into federal  court is on appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,  which this participant said overwhelmingly upholds the Board\u2019s  decisions. This participant also said that it would be more feasible for  federal employees to go to district court for a full review of their claims  rather than to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit,  which has a limited scope of review. Another participant explained that  adding additional procedural options for employee whistleblowers, such  as district court, could help strengthen the law.", "While it may be advantageous for employee whistleblowers, participants  also pointed out that allowing U.S. District Courts this jurisdiction could be  a disadvantage to those courts because of the increased overall workload  that would result from having jurisdiction for whistleblower cases.  However, views on the extent to which the court\u2019s workload might  increase were mixed. Participants in favor of district court jurisdiction  stated that there would be a negligible impact because not all employee  whistleblowers would exercise their right to court for a number of reasons.  For instance, they said the relatively high cost of filing and any kick out  provisions that may require employee whistleblowers to wait before filing  in district court may keep the burden on courts low. Two participants  said that the district court would most likely only be used for high-profile  or complex, in-depth proceedings involving scientific questions or  technical cases, and not for all types of whistleblower reprisals. Another  participant said that while district court is slower in resolving cases,  employee whistleblowers could get injunctive relief. Participants against  district court jurisdiction generally concurred that the current MSPB  process is sufficient and efficient and provides employee whistleblowers  with an opportunity for a hearing. They stated that adding the district court  as an option would undermine efficiency because it would create more  backlogs for an already overburdened court system.", "Another potential disadvantage cited by focus group participants against  granting jurisdiction to U.S. District Courts was that involved agencies  would have to relinquish control over their cases. Participants told us that  the responsibility for appeals cases would shift from the involved  agencies to the Department of Justice. As a result, the Assistant U.S.  Attorney would be responsible for litigating all whistleblower reprisal  appeals that went to district court while agency counsel would assist. This  could be a potential advantage or disadvantage because involved  agencies would no longer have responsibility for litigating such cases.  One participant said that Assistant U.S. Attorneys would push to settle  whistleblower cases because many of them are already overburdened.  Another participant echoed that Assistant U.S. Attorneys are so busy that  they may be unwilling to devote appropriate attention to whistleblower  cases, in contrast to counsel for involved agencies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Focus Group Participants Identified Two Potential Scenarios and Eligible Appeal Types for U.S. District Court Review", "paragraphs": ["While focus group participants generally agreed that the U.S. District  Courts should be granted jurisdiction for some whistleblower appeals,  they stated that not all cases should be eligible for U.S. District Courts.  However, they differed on which whistleblower appeal cases should be  eligible and at what stage of the process. For instance, participants were  divided on whether all or a subset of whistleblower appeals, such as only  terminations or demotions, should be eligible to be heard in U.S. District  Court.", "We asked focus group participants for their input on how the process  could work and what types of appeals should be considered if employee  whistleblowers had the right to file their whistleblower case at the U.S.  District Court. The current process requires employee whistleblowers to  file a claim with either OSC or MSPB, depending on the type of agency  action alleged. If whistleblowers are dissatisfied with the initial decision at  MSPB, they can appeal it to the U.S. Court of Appeals or to MSPB\u2019s  Board through a petition for review. In fiscal year 2015, employee  whistleblowers filed a total of 582 whistleblower reprisal appeals with  MSPB and 95 petitions for review with the Board.", "For scope of jurisdiction, the focus group participants primarily proposed  two options as shown in figures 6 and 7.", "As shown in figure 6, the first option proposed by focus group participants  would require employee whistleblowers to exhaust all administrative  remedies before permitting them to proceed to district court. In discussing  this option, participants also discussed whether to allow employee  whistleblowers to go to district court after a specified amount of time if no  action is taken by MSPB. One participant highlighted whistleblower  statutes that applied to his agency which included employees\u2019 right of  action to go to district court if a decision was not rendered after a certain  period. However, participants expressed concern that this process would  allow too many \u201cbites of the apple,\u201d or opportunities to appeal, resulting in  inefficiencies because employee whistleblowers could prolong the entire  process by filing claims at district court for a full, de novo review after  receiving adverse MSPB decisions. Using discrimination complaints as  an example, participants explained that complainants can go to district  court at many different points in the process if they choose to do so.", "Specifically, complainants have a right to file a civil action in district court  after final agency action or after 180 days of filing a complaint if the  agency has not taken final action, or, after the complainant appeals to  EEOC, after a final EEOC decision or after 180 days from the date of  filing an appeal with EEOC if no final decision has been issued. In  response to the EEOC example, one participant found that there was a  negligible increase of between 0.01 and 0.015 percent of EEOC cases  that went to district courts based on a study conducted by his  organization. Another participant stated that the option for employee  whistleblowers to elect to go to district court was previously proposed in  prior legislation, but with a specified time limit if no action was taken by  MSPB.", "As shown in figure 7, the second option proposed by focus group  participants would allow employee whistleblowers to have \u201cone bite of the  apple\u201d\u2014in other words, selecting either MSPB or district court to have  their appeal heard. Participants generally agreed that this would be the  preferred method if employee whistleblowers were permitted to go to  district court. Two participants proposed that the employee whistleblower  should choose between MSPB and district court following OSC\u2019s initial  review. Participants also said that the election of remedies may be more  suitable because employee whistleblowers may choose to go to MSPB  because it does not charge a filing fee and therefore is more affordable  than the court route. Meanwhile, attorney-represented employee  whistleblowers or those with high-profile and complex cases may choose  to bypass MSPB and go to district court.", "Finally, participants discussed what types of whistleblower retaliation  should be eligible for district court review. The two proposals discussed  were (1) all whistleblower reprisal appeals, including minor and major  offenses; and (2) only a subset of whistleblower reprisal appeals, such as  the more serious adverse actions. However, participants disagreed on  which whistleblower appeal types should be eligible. One participant  stated that it should not be limited to a subset and that all whistleblower  reprisal appeals should go to district court. On the other hand, those in  favor of having a subset of whistleblower reprisal appeals eligible for court  review stated that only the more severe adverse actions, such as  terminations or demotions, should be allowed. If whistleblower appeals  could go to district court, the statute would need to clearly define what is  eligible for court review. One participant pointed out that none of the  corporate whistleblower statutes have a breakdown of which serious  adverse actions can go to district court versus administrative adjudication.", "We solicited input from MSPB and the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts to obtain their opinions on how their respective organizations  might be impacted if Congress granted U.S. District Court jurisdiction for  whistleblower cases. MSPB officials declined to comment.  Officials at the  Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts told us that forecasting specific  impacts would be speculative. They also said that legislation that imposes  new workload requirements on the federal judiciary may necessitate  additional resources. They added that, should specific legislation be  proposed by Congress, the Judicial Conference and its committee(s) and  staff would then carefully review the legislation, and consider its effect to  determine if a Judicial Conference position on the legislation was  warranted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Lawmakers have recognized that whistleblowers are crucial in helping to  expose waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement, and threats to public  health and safety across the federal government; however, those who  come forward may face reprisal from their employers.

We also requested and reviewed MSPB whistleblower  reprisal appeals data for 2 fiscal years prior to WPEA\u2019s effective date,  specifically for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, in order to have 5 years of  consecutive data to identify changes in the number of whistleblower  reprisal appeals filed after WPEA\u2019s effective date. We reviewed relevant  MSPB documents, including data entry guidelines and annual  performance reports. To supplement the documentary evidence obtained,  we interviewed MSPB officials on whistleblower reprisal appeals and  WPEA\u2019s enactment.", "To assess the reliability of the data, we compared data on whistleblower  reprisal appeals reported in MSPB\u2019s annual performance reports with  data that MSPB provided us and we identified discrepancies.

Based on our analysis and our review of related documentation  and interviews with MSPB officials, we corrected the data and the  resulting data set that we used for analysis was sufficiently reliable to  provide a general indication of a change in the numbers of appeals  received and closed post WPEA. Although MSPB has jurisdiction for  other appeals, we evaluated only information related to the whistleblower  reprisal appeal process. We did a keyword search using Lexis Nexis to  determine if the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or any other  appeals court had concluded that a whistleblower reprisal appeal from  MSPB was \u201cmalicious\u201d or \u201cfrivolous\u201d post WPEA.", "To address the second and third objectives, we conducted six focus  groups in July 2016 with subject matter specialists knowledgeable about  WPEA.

To select the 28 participants for  the six focus groups, we solicited suggestions from MSPB and the Office  of Special Counsel based on their direct knowledge of whistleblower  cases, as well as the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, that  has summary judgment authority. We also conducted our own research to  identify additional participants in the whistleblower community and  reached out to the federal inspector general and Chief Human Capital  Officers communities.
