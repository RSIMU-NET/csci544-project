For example, CMS was able to use T-MSIS to replicate  the total number of Medicaid beneficiaries aged 20 and under eligible for  EPSDT from the CMS-416 within 5 percent of state-reported values for  eight of nine pilot states\u2014which CMS officials viewed as a positive  result. CMS officials noted some concerns with inaccurate state  Medicaid eligibility data; for example, multiple dates of birth reported  through T-MSIS for the same beneficiary. However, CMS officials believe  the accuracy and completeness of T-MSIS data has improved since the  pilot studies, which were conducted using data from 2015 and 2016.  Regarding the Child Core Set, CMS was able to use T-MSIS to replicate  some of the information, such as adolescent well-care visits, but not other  information, such as emergency department visits.", "While CMS found generally positive results from the pilots, the agency  has not developed a plan with time frames and interim milestones for  when it will use state-reported T-MSIS data to produce the CMS-416 and  Child Core Set data sets instead of states separately producing both T- MSIS data and the two data sets. In April 2019, CMS officials said that  they were planning additional pilots beginning in fiscal year 2019 to  replicate portions of the CMS-416 and the Child Core Set. However, CMS  officials were unable to provide planned next steps, including time frames  and interim milestones, for using T-MSIS data to replace the CMS-416  and Child Core Set. This is inconsistent with federal internal control  standards related to using and communicating quality information to  achieve objectives. Without a specific plan with time frames with interim  milestones, CMS may miss opportunities to use T-MSIS data to  streamline state reporting and better oversee states\u2019 provision of EPSDT  services. This limitation is similar to one we reported in December 2017  about the initial steps CMS had taken for using T-MSIS data. We found  CMS was limited in using T-MSIS for its broader oversight efforts of state  Medicaid programs, in part, due to the absence of an articulated plan and  time frames."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Under EPSDT, millions of Medicaid\u2019s youngest beneficiaries received  well-child screenings and dental services in fiscal year 2017; however,  nearly as many of them did not.

The EPSDT data collected\u2014whether via the CMS- 416, Child Core Set, or T-MSIS\u2014have the potential to improve CMS  oversight of beneficiaries\u2019 receipt of necessary services and screenings.

However, HHS stated that it would not be possible to obtain  complete data on blood lead screenings, because some screenings are  not paid for by Medicaid. In our report, we noted some state and CMS  efforts to improve available data on blood lead screenings. We continue  to believe CMS needs to take additional actions to collect accurate and  complete data to oversee whether eligible EPSDT beneficiaries are  receiving blood lead screenings in accordance with CMS policy.", "HHS did not concur with our second recommendation, which stated that  CMS should regularly assess the appropriateness of performance  measures and targets for the EPSDT benefit, and take any necessary  actions to ensure their relevance and use.", "HHS noted that it assesses the appropriateness of Child Core Set  measures annually and may update existing measures based on that  assessment, including measures on the CMS-416. We acknowledge  CMS\u2019s actions to assess the appropriateness of Child Core Set  measures annually and update those measures as appropriate, and  we found these actions generally consistent with federal internal  control standards regarding information and communication.  However, CMS has not taken action, as needed, related to any  assessments of the CMS-416 performance measures, even though  officials acknowledge limitations in these measures, such as the  participant and screening ratios.", "HHS also stated that it may set targets in key areas as appropriate,  and has done so as part of the Oral Health Initiative, but that HHS  does not believe it would be productive at this time to set targets for  every measure. We are encouraged that HHS agreed that it may set  targets in key areas as appropriate. This is consistent with our  recommendation for CMS to regularly assess the appropriateness of  its targets. Our recommendation does not assume that targets should  be set for every measure\u2014rather, that CMS needs to regularly assess  the appropriateness of performance measures and targets for the  EPSDT benefit and communicate them to states.", "HHS did not concur with our third recommendation, which stated that  CMS should conduct regular evaluations of state performance by  comparing states\u2019 performance measurement data with CMS\u2019s EPSDT  targets.", "HHS stated that it offers a wide range of technical assistance on  quality improvement to help states address performance goals. HHS  commented that it believes this is the most effective method of helping  states identify and address areas for potential improvement. We  acknowledge that CMS has provided states with technical assistance  and individual state snapshots of selected Child Core Set measures  over time. However, regular evaluations of states\u2019 performance  against appropriate EPSDT targets are necessary to help identify  gaps in states\u2019 performance and areas for improvement.", "HHS noted that states recently received snapshots about their  performance on publicly reported Child Core Set measures for the  past 5 years, through fiscal year 2017. According to HHS, the  snapshots include information about a state\u2019s performance on each  measure relative to other states\u2019 performance and highlights  significant changes in a state\u2019s performance for each measure.  However, these snapshots include descriptions of all states\u2019  performance\u2014using medians, and top and bottom quartiles\u2014which  are subject to change over time. Moreover, because the median is the  midpoint of all states\u2019 performance, this target ensures that half of  states will not meet it, regardless of their individual performance. A  fixed target\u2014or targeted improvement goal, such as the one  developed as part of the Oral Health Initiative\u2014would provide states  with the opportunity to measure performance over prior years\u2019 results,  which is a more meaningful measure that all states can strive to  achieve.", "HHS did not concur with our fourth recommendation, which stated that  that CMS should assist states with planning needed improvements to  resolve gaps in states\u2019 performance in meeting EPSDT targets.", "HHS stated that it has developed national and state-specific  improvement goals for children enrolled in Medicaid with respect to  receipt of at least one preventive dental service and provided targeted  technical assistance to the lowest performing states. In this report, we  noted states\u2019 progress in meeting targets once CMS developed a  performance measurement target for preventive dental services,  including actions to improve state performance. Developing additional  targets on performance measures critical to beneficiaries\u2019 health and  well-being could help improve oversight of EPSDT.", "HHS also described other examples of targeted technical assistance  to remedy gaps in states\u2019 performance, which included working with  states on improving their performance on certain Child Core Set  measures and improving access to EPSDT services by better  leveraging schools as settings for care. Such technical assistance  could be valuable for CMS to provide to states after identifying gaps in  states\u2019 performance relative to EPSDT targets. Doing so would allow  CMS to share additional strategies to help states plan and implement  needed improvements.", "HHS concurred with our fifth and sixth recommendations that CMS should  develop a plan with time frames and interim milestones for using T-MSIS  data to generate the necessary data from the CMS-416 and Child Core  Set to improve EPSDT oversight and streamline state reporting.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
