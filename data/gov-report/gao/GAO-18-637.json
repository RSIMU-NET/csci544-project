The syndicator-managed funds are limited partnerships in  which investors own the limited partner interest in the fund (upper-tier  partnership), with the fund in turn owning the limited partner interest in  various property partnerships (lower-tier partnership). The money  investors pay for a partnership interest in the fund is paid to associated  LIHTC projects as equity financing.

However, we were unable to obtain data on market-rate  developments from industry groups we contacted that represented  developers and lenders, or from researchers who had conducted similar  studies. Additionally, allocating agencies did not consistently maintain key  project data\u2014such as gross square footage, number of stories, or  construction wages\u2014needed to benchmark LIHTC project costs using a  construction cost estimation tool.

LIHTC project developers may have incentive to use more  durable (and potentially more expensive) construction components  than they might for market-rate developments. They may seek to limit  replacement costs before the end of the 15-year compliance period\u2014 after which they may seek additional LIHTCs for rehabilitation or  convert units to market-rate. As revenue from tenant rents is generally  lower for LIHTC projects than for market-rate projects, and because  investors prefer not to refinance during the 15-year compliance period  and lower their returns, LIHTC project owners are more limited in their  ability to recapitalize aging projects. On the other hand, market forces  may encourage market-rate developers to provide higher-grade  finishes and amenities than LIHTC developers in some markets.", "Agency and local requirements. Allocating agencies can use QAP  minimum standards and scoring incentives to influence the types of  projects developers propose and build. Although these preferences  can help achieve a variety of policy priorities, some can increase  costs. For example, QAPs may provide developers with incentives to  pursue historic preservation projects or require them to add on-site  commercial space or amenities such as community rooms. Green  building and energy-efficiency standards are also common QAP  incentives that can increase development costs, although they may  offset some future operating costs through lower utility expenses.  Some QAPs also may incentivize urban infill projects on sites that  require extensive demolition or environmental remediation, which add  to costs.", "Profit motive. LIHTC projects may be less attractive financially for  developers than market-rate projects because they yield lower profits  from rental income. Accordingly, allocating agencies allow a  developer fee, for which tax credit equity generally pays.

For example, projects in California used  about six funding sources in addition to LIHTC equity, on  average. These additional sources can increase legal,  accounting, and other fees due to the costs associated with  seeking additional sources, writing applications, and complying  with further appraisal, audit, and regulatory requirements.

We estimated that the per-unit cost of projects targeted to  seniors was about $7,000 lower than nonsenior projects (or about 3  percent of the median per-unit cost). Compared to nonsenior projects,  units in senior projects generally had less residential square footage (for  which we did not control), which may help explain their lower per-unit  costs.", "Target income level. We also estimated that the per-unit costs of  projects targeted to predominantly low-income tenants was about  $11,000 more than for mixed-income projects (or about 5 percent of the  median per-unit cost). Mixed-income projects might be expected to have  higher costs as they generate more rent revenue to support higher  development costs. But, because LIHTC allocations are calculated based  on the ratio of low-income units to total units, predominantly low-income  projects receive proportionally more LIHTC equity, which may allow them  to support higher development costs. For example, we estimated that  projects targeted towards predominantly low-income tenants generated  LIHTC equity equal to about 67 percent of development cost, whereas  mixed-income project generated LIHTC equity equal to about 50 percent  of development cost.", "Nonprofit participation. Section 42 requires a portion of each state\u2019s tax  credit allocation to be set aside for projects involving a qualified nonprofit  organization. We estimated that the per-unit cost of these projects was  about $15,000 more than projects not in the set-aside (or about 7 percent  of the median per-unit cost). Other studies of the LIHTC program have  suggested potential explanations for this result. For example, nonprofit  organizations may focus more on populations that are more costly to  serve, such as special-needs tenants who may require additional or  enhanced facilities. Additionally, nonprofit developers may have higher  costs because they are often smaller, produce fewer projects, and may  need to spend more time and resources on activities such as fundraising  and market research, compared to their for-profit counterparts.", "Third, controlling for other characteristics, we found that a number of  geographic and economic variables were associated with cost  differences.", "Location. We estimated that urban locations were associated with a per- unit cost about $13,000 higher than for suburban locations (or about 6  percent of the median per-unit cost), and that per-unit costs in rural areas  were not statistically different from suburban areas. Consistent with this  estimate, the data in our sample show that per-unit land and construction  costs were greater in urban areas than in nonurban areas.", "In addition, urban projects were more likely to include parking structures,  which we found were associated with a per-unit cost increase of about  $56,000 in California and Arizona (or about 27 percent of the median per- unit cost), where parking structure data were available. Among these  projects, about 98 percent of projects with parking structures were in  urban areas.", "Urban projects were also located in closer proximity to transit, which we  found increased per-unit construction costs. In an alternative specification  of our model limited to projects near fixed-guideway transit stations, we  estimated that the per-unit construction costs of projects that were 0.5  miles or less from a transit station\u2014known as transit-oriented  developments\u2014were about $17,000 more than projects that were  between 0.5 miles and 1.0 miles from a transit station.", "Local housing market and economy. As discussed previously, difficult  development areas are those with high construction, land, and utility costs  relative to area median gross income; qualified census tracts are areas  with higher rates of low-income households or poverty rates. We did not  find that projects in these areas were associated with cost differences  compared to projects outside these areas.", "However, we found cost differences among projects in difficult  development areas and qualified census tracts when we estimated  alternative specifications of our model that excluded some geographic,  economic, and local housing market variables that may be associated  with the areas and tracts. For example, using a model specification that excluded local property values, we estimated that difficult development  areas were associated with about a $9,000 increase in per-unit costs. In a  separate estimation that excluded poverty rates and some other  economic and geographic variables, we estimated that projects in  qualified census tracts were associated with a per-unit cost increase of  about $18,000 (or about 9 percent of the median per-unit cost). In both  cases, the project characteristics of interest (difficult development area or  qualified census tract) are likely associated with the excluded variables  mentioned, as difficult development areas are characterized by high land  costs and qualified census tracts are characterized by high poverty rates,  among other factors. In the absence of the excluded geographic or local  housing market variables, the estimated influence of these project  characteristics is more pronounced.", "Finally, we found that the presence of federal funding sources in addition  to LIHTC were associated with cost differences, after controlling for other  characteristics.", "American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funding. We estimated that  projects that received funding through either of two LIHTC programs (Tax  Credit Assistance Program or Section 1602 Program) under the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) were associated with a  decrease of about $13,000 in per-unit costs (or about 6 percent of the  median per-unit cost). Projects received ARRA funds during a period of  economic recovery, and the relative scarcity of private funds may have  motivated developers to pursue less costly projects. Because about 91  percent of projects that received ARRA funds were completed in 2011\u2013 2012, we restricted our ARRA estimate to projects completed in that  period.", "We estimated that soft costs were about $4,000 per unit lower for ARRA  projects than for non-ARRA projects. Soft costs, which we previously  mentioned were about one-third of total development costs, may have  been lower for ARRA projects because proportionately fewer of these  projects used tax credit equity to fund development costs. For example,  about 30 percent of these projects received ARRA funds entirely in lieu of  tax credits. As a result, ARRA projects may have had lower or no tax  credit partnership and syndication costs. However, we did not estimate a  significant difference in construction costs between ARRA and non-ARRA  projects.", "Rural Development funding. Projects that received at least one Rural  Development loan or grant, from the Department of Agriculture, were  associated with about a $32,000 decrease in per-unit cost (or about 16  percent of the median per-unit cost). However, projects that received  these loans or grants may have had unique characteristics that affected  cost. According to an allocating agency official from California\u2014where  about 19 percent of the projects we reviewed used at least one Rural  Development loan or grant\u2014projects that received these funds may have  had lower total development costs because high-cost projects were not  financially feasible in some rural areas due to lower rents and less local  public funding. In addition, projects to house seasonal farm workers that  receive funding from Rural Development\u2019s Section 514/516 Farm Labor  Housing programs may lack some amenities\u2014such as in-unit kitchens  and bathrooms\u2014that increase costs and are more common in other  LIHTC projects. Furthermore, private loans guaranteed through Rural  Development\u2019s Section 538 Guaranteed Rural Rental Housing Program  are subject to per-unit limits, which may have hindered the feasibility of  higher-cost projects.", "Other federal funding. We also estimated that projects that received  HOPE VI funds were associated with about an $18,000 increase in per- unit costs (or about 9 percent of the median per-unit cost).", "However, the cost increase that we estimated may not have fully captured  all additional costs associated with these projects. Several of the 23  HOPE VI projects included in our sample were phases of larger HOPE VI  Revitalization Grant projects and may have included only the project  costs associated with a smaller portion of a multibuilding development. In  addition, some predevelopment expenses associated with the overall  grant project, such as the demolition of existing structures and tenant  relocation, may not have been included in the cost certifications we  reviewed.", "In contrast to the HOPE VI projects we reviewed, we did not find that  projects that received Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) or  HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME) funds had statistically  different per-unit total development costs. However, like HOPE VI  projects, CDBG and HOME projects were associated with increases in  per-unit construction costs (about $15,000 or $6,000, respectively). The  presence of HOME funds also was associated with an increase in per-unit  soft costs (about $2,000), while CDBG or HOPE VI funds were not  strongly associated with differences in per-unit soft costs.", "While these sources were associated with cost differences, controlling for  other characteristics, the association may not be entirely causal. The use  of CDBG, HOME, and HOPE VI funds may have directly increased  construction costs, as fund usage can trigger federal prevailing wage  requirements. On the other hand, CDBG and HOME funding (for  example) may have been used in addition to LIHTC equity to fill funding  gaps for projects with particularly high costs.", "Finally, to examine the relationship our model characteristics had on the  per-unit cost of low- and high-cost projects, we compared the  characteristics of new construction projects below the 25th percentile for  per-unit cost against those above the 75th percentile.", "As shown in table 1, projects below the 25th percentile generally had a  higher proportion of characteristics that were associated with decreases  in per-unit cost. These projects were larger, had smaller units, were more  often targeted toward seniors, and were located in rural areas. In  comparison, projects above the 75th percentile generally had a higher  proportion of characteristics associated with increases in per-unit cost (or  less of a decrease). These projects were smaller, had larger units, were  more often located in urban areas, and were built in more expensive real  estate markets, as the following examples illustrate.", "About 70 percent of the projects below the 25th percentile had either  51\u2013100 units or more than 100 units\u2014which we found were  associated with lower per-unit cost\u2014compared to just 46 percent of  the projects above the 75th percentile.", "About 40 percent of the projects below the 25th percentile were senior  projects\u2014which we also found were associated with lower per-unit  costs\u2014compared to 18 percent for projects above the 75th percentile.", "About 88 percent of the projects above the 75th percentile were in  urban areas\u2014which we found were associated with higher per-unit  costs\u2014compared to 71 percent of the projects below the 25th  percentile."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Allocating Agencies Took Steps to Manage and Verify Development Costs, but LIHTC Policies Do Not Require Detailed Cost Information", "paragraphs": ["Allocating agencies used approaches that include cost and fee limits and  cost-based scoring criteria to manage project-development costs.

The number of approaches used by an agency is not  necessarily indicative of the effectiveness of its cost management.", "Additionally, the way that agencies implemented each type of approach  varied.", "The cost-management approaches agencies identified in their QAPs and  related documents were as follows.", "Cost limits. More than two-thirds of the allocating agencies (39 of 57) set  limits on the total development cost for each project or set limits on the  total eligible basis (or both). Total development cost is the overall cost to  develop a project, whereas eligible basis typically includes costs  associated with acquisition, construction and rehabilitation, and most soft  costs, but excludes costs associated with land, permanent financing, and  tax credit syndication. For information on cost limits for each of the 57  agencies, see appendix VI, table 32.", "Thirty-three agencies set limits on the total development cost for each  project. For example, Illinois limited total costs by bedroom type,  number of units, and location, based on the agency\u2019s analysis of  historical cost data.", "Ten agencies set cost limits on a project\u2019s eligible basis, and their  approaches to these limits varied. For example, two agencies adopted  universal eligible basis limits of $250,000 per unit (Pennsylvania) and  $300,000 per unit (New York City), whereas most others had multiple  limits based on project characteristics such as type (new construction  or rehabilitation), number of bedrooms, and location.", "Six agencies, including Georgia, applied cost limits from a HUD  program that insures mortgages for rental housing for moderate- income families. According to Georgia officials, adopting the HUD  limits was more cost-effective than developing cost limits based on a  market analysis.", "Credit allocation limits. About two-thirds (34) of the allocating agencies  had limits on the amount of LIHTCs available, generally per project or per  developer, and the limits varied by type and amount. For information on  credit allocation limits for each of the 57 agencies, see appendix VI, table  33.", "Twenty-nine agencies had allocation limits per project, which included  dollar limits (from $500,000 to $2.5 million) and percentage limits  (from 10 percent to 60 percent of an agency\u2019s total available credits  per project), and two of these agencies also had a per-unit limit. For  example, Illinois limited credits per project to the lesser of $1.5 million  or 28,500 credits per unit. California limited credits per project to $2.5  million, and Washington limited credits to 10 percent of the agency\u2019s  total available credits.", "Fourteen agencies had credit limits per developer or for the number of  projects a developer can sponsor in a given year.

Four of the 12 selected allocating agencies  independently determined, or provided us with information we could use  to calculate, the gross square footage of projects. Construction cost per  gross square foot is a commonly used measure in the construction  industry and useful for comparing LIHTC project costs to construction  industry benchmarks. Additionally, because it encompasses the entire  size of the structure, this measure relates project cost to project scale  more precisely than other common measures, such as cost per unit and  cost per residential square foot.", "Building type. The selected allocating agencies varied in how they  defined and classified building types\u2014such as single-family, multifamily,  high-rise, mid-rise, or low-rise.

As with gross square footage, this information  would allow cost assessments based on a project\u2019s entire physical  footprint. Additionally, this information would allow agencies to refine per- unit cost measures by subtracting the cost of nonresidential spaces (for  example, community or other common areas) from per-unit cost totals.", "Primary construction materials.

IRS said it was not clear whether  the recommendation would uncover and deter misrepresentation of  contractor costs. We maintain that requiring general contractor cost  certifications would help address this fraud risk by providing greater cost  transparency to allocating agencies and auditors. Our report notes that a  number of allocating agencies already have similar controls and that the  Florida agency began requiring general contractor cost certifications in  response to fraudulent contract-inflation schemes that were the subject of  federal legal actions. Furthermore, NCSHA\u2019s recommended practices  advise allocating agencies to implement additional cost certification due  diligence for all LIHTC projects. We believe that general contractor cost  certifications should be required to help ensure the efficient and effective  use of federal resources programwide.", "IRS disagreed with the recommendation in our draft report to collaborate  with LIHTC stakeholders to develop a framework for the collection of cost- related data. The purpose of this recommendation was to promote  creation of more standardized data to help allocating agencies analyze  cost trends and drivers and make comparisons to other agencies. IRS  said that in the absence of specific authorization, it collects data only to  the extent necessary for tax administration, and that collecting LIHTC cost  data is not necessary for that purpose. IRS added that without statutory  authorization or a tax administration need, any data collection would be a  misuse of IRS resources. In response, we modified the recommendation  in our final report to give IRS greater flexibility in promoting  standardization of LIHTC cost data in ways consistent with its authority.  For example, IRS could encourage development of more standardized  data in its communications with LIHTC allocating agencies and  stakeholders at industry meetings and conferences. Our report  recognizes that IRS has not had a role in assessing the performance of  tax expenditures. For this reason, our report also states Congress should  consider designating an agency to regularly collect and maintain specified  cost-related data from allocating agencies and assess and report on  LIHTC project-development costs.", "Finally, IRS disagreed with our recommendation to communicate to  allocating agencies how to collect and review information on LIHTC  syndication expenses, including upper-tier partnership expenses. IRS  said that existing regulations require agencies to collect and evaluate all  sources and uses of project funds and that this covers syndication  expenses, including upper-tier partnership expenses. IRS said to the  extent that we were recommending that it revise regulations, the agency  did not necessarily have the authority to mandate how allocating agencies  collect syndication expense data. IRS\u2019s response suggests the reporting  requirements are clear. However, as stated in our report, the 12 allocating  agencies we reviewed and other LIHTC stakeholders did not share IRS\u2019s  understanding of the requirement. Consequently, the allocating agencies  did not require developers to report upper-tier syndication expenses and  generally did not have data on the expenses. In its comments on our  report, NCSHA also expressed surprise at IRS\u2019s explanation (see  discussion below and app. VII). Finally, our report does not state that IRS  should revise its regulations. Rather, it recommends that IRS  communicate its requirement to allocating agencies. The wording of our  recommendation provides IRS the flexibility to communicate the  requirement in whatever way it deems appropriate. As a result, we made  no changes to the recommendation.", "In its comments, NCSHA expressed concerns about our recommendation  and matter for congressional consideration about collecting and analyzing  LIHTC cost data. NCSHA questioned the cost-effectiveness of requiring  consistent data across states and did not believe that cross-state  comparisons were critical for evaluating LIHTC. For example, NCSHA  said the utility of comparing Hawaii costs to Arkansas costs was not clear.  NCSHA also noted LIHTC was designed to give allocating agencies  flexibility, including in program design and data collection. We maintain  consistent data are important for program management and oversight.  While cost drivers in states differ, our report notes that at least one  allocating agency has funded a study to compare development costs with  neighboring states. While we understand the LIHTC program gives states  flexibilities, a more standardized approach to data collection would not  restrict allocating agency funding decisions or prevent agencies from  collecting data they consider important. Furthermore, consistent data  collection would facilitate state and federal evaluations of the cost- effectiveness of a multibillion dollar tax expenditure. NCSHA also  expressed concern that Congress might require the data collection but  not appropriate funds to implement the mandate. Our report  acknowledges that if Congress were to grant an agency the authority to  collect and report on LIHTC cost data, that agency likely would need  additional budgetary resources to carry out this function.", "Regarding our recommendation on general contractor cost certifications,  NCSHA noted that more allocating agencies were likely to adopt  NCSHA\u2019s recommended practices and require or encourage such  certifications. However, allocating agencies voluntarily adopt  recommended practices, and some agencies may view a general  contractor cost certification as unnecessary. NCSHA added that  instances of fraud were rare in the 30-year history of LIHTC, and affected  agencies had responded in each known instance. We noted in our report  that under the existing federal cost certification requirement\u2014which stops  at the developer level\u2014the vulnerability of the LIHTC program to  misrepresentation of general contractor costs is heightened. And while  known instances of fraud schemes (such as the Florida examples cited in  our report) may be limited, the true extent of fraud in the program is  unknown. Federal internal control standards state that management  should consider the potential for fraud when identifying, analyzing, and  responding to risks. Requiring general contractor cost certifications for all  LIHTC projects could help address this known fraud risk and further  strengthen the integrity of the program.", "Regarding our recommendation on syndication expenses, NCSHA was  surprised IRS officials told us LIHTC regulations require reporting of all  syndication expenses (including upper-tier expenses) on the project cost  certification. NCSHA said it long understood that the cost certification  must include only costs paid by the project partnership for the individual  property (the developer) and that IRS never communicated otherwise.  NCSHA also identified some potential difficulties with collecting and  reporting information on upper-tier syndication fees. While our report  discusses some similar concerns, it also provides examples of at least  two allocating agencies that collect such information. NCSHA\u2019s response  further supports our finding of a gap between IRS expectations and  allocating agency practices for reporting syndication expenses and  underscores the need for IRS to more clearly communicate its  expectations on how to collect and review this information.", "Finally, NCSHA said findings from its recently commissioned study of  LIHTC development costs, which had not been released as of August  2018, were generally consistent with cost analyses in our report. NCSHA  said its study and other information suggest LIHTC development costs  generally were consistent with overall apartment development costs and  grew at a similar or slower rate. We believe broad comparisons between  LIHTC and non-LIHTC development costs should be viewed with caution.

In New York City, it appears that  separate tax credit allocations were made to single-building projects in  close proximity to other tax credit projects awarded to the same  developers at the same time or in consecutive years. For example, three  buildings being renovated by the same developer in the same relatively  small area could be considered as three separate one-building projects or  one three-building project.
