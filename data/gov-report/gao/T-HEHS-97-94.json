My comments are based on work that we have in progress at the request of the Chairmen of the Senate and House Budget Committees. Their request was prompted by an interest in what contributed to the precipitous drop in the annual growth rate of Medicaid spending from over 20 percent in the early 1990s to 3.3 percent in fiscal year 1996. In addition, you have asked us to comment on aspects of the administration\u2019s fiscal year 1998 proposal for the Medicaid program.", "My remarks today focus on two broad issues: (1) key factors that explain the 3.3-percent growth rate in fiscal year 1996 and their implications for future Medicaid spending and (2) the administration\u2019s proposal to contain Medicaid cost growth through decreases in disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments and per capita caps, and to increase state flexibility. Our findings are based on our analysis of Medicaid expenditure data published by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Health Care Financing Administration and our review of federal outlays as reported by the Department of the Treasury. We also contacted Medicaid officials in 18 states that represent a cross-section of state spending patterns over the past 2 years and that account for almost 70 percent of Medicaid expenditures.

Between 1984 and 1987, the annual growth rates remained relatively stable, ranging between roughly 8 and 11 percent. Over the next 4 years, beginning in 1988, annual growth rates increased substantially, reaching 29 percent in 1992\u2014an increase of over $26 billion for that year. From this peak, Medicaid\u2019s growth rates declined between 1993 and 1995 to approximately the levels of the mid-1980s.

However, 80 percent of 1996 federal Medicaid outlays were in states that either experienced moderate decreases or minimal changes in their fiscal year 1996 growth.

After new limits were enacted, DSH payments nationally declined in 1993, stabilized in 1994, and began to grow again in 1995. An exception to this pattern, however, was Louisiana\u2014a state that has had one of the largest DSH programs in the nation. It experienced a substantial decrease in its 1996 growth rate as its DSH payments continued to decline. The state\u2019s federal outlays decreased by 16 percent in 1996 because of a dramatic drop in DSH payments.", "Recent slowdowns in state-initiated eligibility expansions also helped to effect substantial decreases in the growth rates in selected states. Over the past several years, some states implemented statewide managed care demonstration waiver programs to extend health care coverage to uninsured populations not previously eligible for Medicaid. Three states that experienced substantial decreases in their 1996 growth rates\u2014Hawaii, Oregon, and Tennessee\u2014undertook the bulk of their expansions in 1994. The expenditure increases related to these expansions continued into 1995 and began to level off in 1996. Tennessee actually experienced a drop in the number of eligible beneficiaries in 1996, as formerly uninsured individuals covered by the program lost their eligibility because they did not pay the required premiums. aggregate Medicaid spending limits, which would be calculated using a base year. Officials from a few states told us that, in response to the anticipated block grant, they accelerated their Medicaid payments to increase their expenditures for fiscal year 1995\u2014the year the Congress was considering for use as the base. For example, one state, with federal approval, made a DSH payment at the end of fiscal year 1995 rather than at the beginning of fiscal year 1996. An official from another state, which had a moderate decrease in growth, told us that the state expedited decisions on audits of hospitals and nursing homes to speed payments due these providers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strong Economic Conditions", "paragraphs": ["Improved economic conditions, reflected in lower unemployment rates and slower increases in the cost of medical services, also have contributed to a moderation in the growth of Medicaid expenditures. Between 1993 and 1995, most states experienced a drop in their unemployment rates\u2014some by roughly 2 percentage points. As we reported earlier, every percentage-point drop in the unemployment rate is typically associated with a 6-percent drop in Medicaid spending. States told us that low unemployment rates had lowered the number of people on welfare and, therefore, in Medicaid.", "In addition, growth in medical service prices has steadily been declining since the late 1980s. In 1990, the growth in the price of medical services was 9.0 percent; by 1995, it was cut in half to 4.5 percent. In 1996, it declined further to 3.5 percent. Declines in price inflation have an indirect effect on the Medicaid rates that states set for providers. Officials of several of the states we spoke with reported freezing provider payment rates in recent years, including rates for nursing facilities and hospitals. Such a freeze might not have been possible in periods with higher inflation because institutional providers might challenge state payment rates in court, arguing they had not kept pace with inflation. With inflation down, states can restrain payment rates with less concern about such challenges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Managed Care Programs and Long-Term Care Policies", "paragraphs": ["uncertain because of state variations in program scope and objectives. States also mentioned initiatives to use alternative service delivery methods for long-term care. While these initiatives may have helped to bring Medicaid costs down, measuring their effect is difficult.", "Although some states have been using managed care to serve portions of their Medicaid population for over 20 years, many of the states\u2019 programs have been voluntary and limited to certain geographic areas. In addition, these programs tend to target women and children rather than populations that may need more care and are more expensive to serve\u2014such as people with disabilities and the elderly. Only a few states have mandated enrollment statewide\u2014fewer still have enrolled more expensive populations\u2014and these programs are relatively new. Arizona, which has the most mature statewide mandatory program, has perhaps best proven the ability to realize cost savings in managed care, cost savings it achieved by devoting significant resources to its competitive bidding process.However, other states have emphasized objectives besides cost control in moving to managed care. In recently expanding its managed care program, Oregon chose to increase per capita payments to promote improved quality and access and to look to the future for any cost savings. Officials from Minnesota, which has a mature managed care program, and California, which is in the midst of a large expansion, told us that managed care has had no significant effect on the moderate decreases they experienced. Given the varying objectives, the ability of managed care to help control state Medicaid costs and moderate spending growth over time is unclear. options as alternatives to nursing facilities.

However, there are indications that some of these components may contribute to higher\u2014not lower\u2014growth rates, while the effect of others is more uncertain.", "Without new limits, DSH payments can be expected to add to the growth of the overall program. While Louisiana\u2019s adjustments to its DSH payments resulted in a substantial reduction in its 1996 spending, other states\u2019 DSH spending began to grow moderately in 1995 as freezes imposed on additional DSH spending no longer applied. Although DSH payments are not increasing as fast as they were in the early 1990s, these payments did grow 12.4 percent in 1995.", "Even though the economy has been in a prolonged expansion, history indicates that the current robust economy will not last indefinitely. The unemployment rate cannot be expected to stay as low as it currently is, especially in states with rates below 4 percent. Furthermore, any increases in medical care price inflation will undoubtedly influence Medicaid reimbursement rates, especially to institutional providers.", "While states have experienced some success in dealing with long-term care costs, the continued increase in the number of elderly people will inevitably lead to an increase in program costs. Alternative service delivery systems can moderate that growth but not eliminate it. services\u2014may decrease, since some Medicaid-eligible people may be discouraged from seeking eligibility and enrollment apart from the new welfare process. However, states may need to restructure their eligibility and enrollment systems to ensure that people who are eligible for Medicaid continue to participate in the program. Restructuring their systems will undoubtedly increase states\u2019 administrative costs. The net effect of these changes remains to be seen.", "The potential for cost savings through managed care also remains unclear, as experience is limited and state objectives in switching to managed care have not always emphasized immediate cost-containment. Yet it is hoped that managed care will, over time, help constrain costs. While Arizona\u2019s Medicaid managed care program has been effective, cost savings were due primarily to considerable effort to promote competition among health plans. The challenge is whether the state can sustain this competition in the future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Administration\u2019s Proposal for Medicaid Controls Spending While Increasing Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["To help control Medicaid spending and increase state flexibility, the administration\u2019s 1998 budget proposal includes three initiatives: (1) imposing additional controls over DSH payments, (2) implementing a per capita cap policy, and (3) eliminating waiver requirements and the Boren Amendment.

The Congressional Budget Office\u2019s Medicaid baseline estimates the federal share of DSH payments over the next 5 years will increase from $10.3 billion in 1998 to $13.6 billion in 2002. The administration\u2019s proposal would cap federal spending on DSH at $10 billion in 1998, $9 billion in 1999, and $8 billion in 2000 and thereafter. To achieve the projected savings, the administration\u2019s proposal would limit federal DSH payments for 1998 in each state to the state\u2019s 1995 level. In subsequent years, the national limit is lowered, and the reduction is distributed across states by taking an equal percentage reduction of all or some of each state\u2019s 1995 DSH payments. In states where DSH payments in 1995 exceeded 12 percent of total Medicaid expenditures, the percentage reduction would only apply to the amounts at or under the 12-percent limit. This limit on reductions would affect 16 states that in 1995 had DSH payments in excess of 12 percent of their total Medicaid expenditures.", "In the past we reported on states using creative mechanisms to increase their federal Medicaid dollars, specifically through DSH, provider-specific taxes and voluntary contributions, and intergovernmental transfers.Legislation in 1991 and 1993 went a long way toward controlling DSH payments and provider taxes and voluntary contributions. In particular, the 1991 legislation froze DSH payments for \u201chigh-DSH\u201d states\u2014those whose DSH expenditures exceeded 12 percent of Medicaid expenditures\u2014because of concerns that these high levels included inappropriate efforts to increase federal matching funds. The administration\u2019s proposal would provide some protection for high-DSH states at the expense of low-DSH states that have kept their share of program spending on DSH below the congressionally specified target level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Per Capita Caps to Limit Federal Spending", "paragraphs": ["The administration\u2019s proposed per capita cap aims at more certain control over federal Medicaid spending but does not address concerns about the distribution of federal funding resulting from the current matching formula. The administration\u2019s proposal defines a per capita cap policy that would limit federal Medicaid spending on a per beneficiary basis. As Medicaid enrollment increases in a particular state, so would the federal dollars available to the state. The per capita cap would be set using 1996 as the base year\u2014including both medical and administrative expenditures. The proposal would use an index based on nominal gross domestic product (GDP) per capita plus an adjustment factor to account for Medicaid\u2019s high utilization and intensity of services provided. This index and the number of people eligible for Medicaid in a particular year would be applied to the total 1996 expenditures to determine a state\u2019s per capita limit of federal dollars. Savings expected from this proposal will depend on restraining the growth in spending per beneficiary to about 5 percent a year over the 5-year period. capacity. In addition, current law guarantees that no state will have to pay more than half of the total costs of its Medicaid program, meaning states with higher income receive a higher federal share than they otherwise would. This has contributed to disparities among states in coverage of population groups and services as well as in federal funding.", "The administration\u2019s proposal would not address these disparities. To the extent there is congressional interest in lessening them, we have previously indicated that any distribution formula should include (1) better and more direct measures than per capita income for both the incidence of poverty and states\u2019 ability to finance program benefits, (2) adjustors for geographic differences in the cost of health care, and (3) a reduced guaranteed federal minimum match."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased State Flexibility", "paragraphs": ["In regard to state flexibility, the administration has proposed changes in three areas: managed care programs, long-term care programs, and the Boren Amendment. Currently, states must obtain waivers of certain federal statutory requirements in order to implement large-scale managed care programs and to provide home- and community-based services as alternatives to nursing facility care. The administration has proposed eliminating the need for a waiver for such programs. In addition, the Boren Amendment, which places certain requirements on how states can set reimbursement rates for hospitals and nursing facilities, would be repealed.", "Medicaid\u2019s restrictions on states\u2019 use of managed care reflect historical concerns over access and quality. For example, the so-called 75/25 rule that stipulates that, to serve Medicaid beneficiaries, at least 25 percent of a health plan\u2019s total enrollment must consist of private paying patients, was intended as a proxy for quality because private patients presumably have a choice of health plans and can vote with their feet. A second provision, allowing Medicaid beneficiaries to terminate enrollment in a health plan at almost any time, aims to provide them with a similar capacity to express dissatisfaction over the provision of care. The administration\u2019s proposal would replace these requirements with enhanced quality monitoring systems. states\u2019 cost-containment efforts. However, the experience of states with Medicaid managed care programs underscores the importance of adequate planning and appropriate quality assurance systems. If states are granted more direct control to aggressively pursue managed care strategies, the importance of continuous oversight of managed care systems to protect both Medicaid beneficiaries from inappropriate denial of care and federal dollars from payment abuses should not be overlooked.", "We have also reported on the successful use by states of home- and community-based care services as an alternative to nursing facilities. States we contacted in the course of this work have expanded the use of such services as part of a strategy to help control rapidly increasing Medicaid expenditures for institutional care. States have told us that when implementing these programs, they value the control they have under a waiver but not under the regular program over the amount of home- and community-based services provided. They indicated this control allows them to serve the population in need within budgetary constraints. Despite the limitations in program size, these programs have allowed states to serve more people with the dollars available.", "Originally, the Boren Amendment was intended to provide states with greater latitude in setting hospital and nursing facility reimbursement rates while ensuring rates were adequate to provide needed services. Over time, however, states believe court decisions have made the Boren Amendment burdensome to states and affected their ability to set reimbursement rates. The uncertainty created by the language of the Boren Amendment is potentially preventing states from controlling rates of payment to institutional providers in ways that compromise neither access nor quality. While some clarification of the Boren Amendment to address state concerns is needed, its original goals are still valid.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
