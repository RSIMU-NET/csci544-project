The Privacy Act places limitations on  agencies\u2019 collection, disclosure, and use of personal information  maintained in systems of records. The act describes a record as any item,  collection, or grouping of information about an individual that is  maintained by an agency and contains his or her name or another  personal identifier. The act defines a \u201csystem of records\u201d as a group of  records under the control of any agency from which information is  retrieved by the name of the individual or by an individual identifier. The  Privacy Act requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a  system of records, they must notify the public through a system-of- records notice in the Federal Register that identifies, among other things,  the categories of data collected, the categories of individuals about whom  information is collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d uses of data, and  procedures that individuals can use to review and correct personally  identifiable information.", "Several provisions of the act require agencies to define and limit  collection and use of personal information to predefined purposes. For  example, it requires that, to the greatest extent practicable, personal  information should be collected directly from the individual when it may  affect that person\u2019s rights or benefits under a federal program. It also  requires agencies to indicate whether the individual\u2019s disclosure of the  information is mandatory or voluntary; the principal purposes for which  the information is intended to be used; the routine uses that may be made  of the information; and the effects on the individual, if any, of not providing  the information. Further, in handling information they have collected,  agencies are generally required to allow individuals to review their  records, request a copy of their record, and request corrections to their  information, among other things.", "The E-Government Act of 2002 was passed, among other reasons, to  enhance the protection for personal information in government  information systems or information collections by requiring that agencies  conduct privacy impact assessments (PIA). PIAs are analyses of how  personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed in a  federal system.", "Title III of the E-Government Act, known as the Federal Information  Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), established a framework  designed to ensure the effectiveness of security controls over information  resources that support federal operations and assets. According to  FISMA, each agency is responsible for, among other things, providing  information security protections commensurate with the risk and  magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use,  disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information collected  or maintained by or on behalf of the agency and information systems  used or operated by an agency or by a contractor of an agency or other  organization on behalf of an agency. These protections are to provide  federal information and systems with integrity\u2014preventing improper  modification or destruction of information, confidentiality\u2014preserving  authorized restrictions on access and disclosure, and availability\u2014 ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information.", "The privacy protections incorporated in the Privacy Act are based  primarily on the Fair Information Practices\u2014a set of widely recognized  principles for protecting the privacy of personal information first developed  by an advisory committee convened by the Secretary of Health,  Education and Welfare in 1972 and revised by the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 1980. These  practices underlie the major provisions of the Privacy Act and privacy  laws and related policies in many countries, including Germany, Sweden,  Australia, and New Zealand, as well as the European Union. They are  also reflected in a variety of federal agency policy statements, beginning  with an endorsement of the OECD principles by the Department of  Commerce in 1981. The OECD version of the principles is shown in table  1.", "The Privacy Act gives the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  responsibility for developing guidelines and providing assistance to and  oversight of agencies\u2019 implementation of the act. OMB also has  responsibility under the E-Government Act for developing PIA guidance  and ensuring agency implementation of the PIA requirement. In July  1975, OMB issued guidance for implementing the provisions of the  Privacy Act and has periodically issued additional guidance since then.  OMB has also issued guidance on other data security and privacy-related  issues including federal agency website privacy policies, interagency  sharing of personal information, designation of senior staff responsible for  privacy, data breach notification, and safeguarding personally identifiable  information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technological Changes Have Made Key Elements of Privacy Laws Outdated", "paragraphs": ["Technological developments since the Privacy Act became law in 1974  have radically changed the way information is organized and shared  among organizations and individuals.

Data mining involves locating and retrieving information, including  personally identifiable information, in complex ways.", "In September 2011, we reported that the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) needed to improve executive oversight of systems  supporting counterterrorism. We noted that DHS and three of its  component agencies\u2014U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Citizenship and  Immigration Services\u2014had established policies that largely addressed  the key elements and attributes needed to ensure that their data mining  systems were effective and provided necessary privacy protections.  However, we also noted, among other things, that DHS faced challenges  in ensuring that all of its privacy-sensitive systems had timely and up-to- date PIAs. We recommended that that DHS develop requirements for  providing additional scrutiny of privacy protections for sensitive  information systems that are not transparent to the public through PIAs  and investigate whether the information-sharing component of a certain  data-mining system, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement  Pattern Analysis and Information Collection program, should be  deactivated until a PIA is approved that includes the component. DHS  has taken action to address both of these recommendations.", "Given the challenges in applying privacy laws and overseeing systems  that contain personally identifiable information, the role of executives in  federal departments and agencies charged with oversight of privacy  issues is of critical importance.

We identified issues in three major areas:  Applying privacy protections consistently to all federal collection  and use of personal information. The Privacy Act\u2019s definition of a  system of records, which sets the scope of the act\u2019s protections, does not  always apply whenever personal information is obtained and processed  by federal agencies. For example, if agencies do not retrieve personal  information by identifier, as may occur in data-mining systems, the act\u2019s  protections do not apply. We previously reported that among the 25  agencies surveyed, the most frequently cited reason for collections of  records not being considered Privacy Act systems of records was that the  agency did not use a personal identifier to retrieve the information. Factors such as these have led experts to agree that the Privacy Act\u2019s  system-of-records construct is too narrowly defined. An alternative for  addressing these issues could include revising the system-of-records  definition to cover all personally identifiable information collected, used,  and maintained systematically by the federal government.", "GAO, Privacy Act: OMB Leadership Needed to Improve Agency Compliance, GAO-03- 304 (Washington, D.C.: June 30, 2003). specified purpose. Yet current laws and guidance impose only modest  requirements for describing the purposes for personal information and  limiting how it is used. For example, agencies are not required to be  specific in formulating purpose descriptions in their public notices. While  purpose statements for certain law enforcement and antiterrorism  systems might need to be phrased broadly enough so as not to reveal  investigative techniques or the details of ongoing cases, very broadly  defined purposes could allow for unnecessarily broad ranges of uses,  thus calling into question whether meaningful limitations had been  imposed. Examples for alternatives for addressing these issues include  setting specific limits on the use of information within agencies and  requiring agencies to establish formal agreements with external  government entities before sharing personally identifiable information.", "Establishing effective mechanisms for informing the public about  privacy protections. According to the openness principle, the public  should be informed about privacy policies and practices, and the  accountability principle calls for those who control the collection or use of  personal information to be held accountable for taking steps to ensure  privacy protection. Public notices are a primary means for establishing  accountability for privacy protections and giving individuals a measure of  control over the use of their personal information. Yet concerns have  been raised that Privacy Act notices may not serve this function well.  Although the Federal Register is the government\u2019s official vehicle for  issuing public notices, an expert panel convened for GAO questioned  whether system-of-records notices published in the Federal Register  effectively inform the public about government uses of personal  information. Among others, options for addressing concerns about public  notices could include setting requirements to ensure that purpose,  collection, and use limitations are better addressed in the content of  privacy notices and revising the Privacy Act to require that all notices be  published on a standard website."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Updating the Privacy Act Can Provide Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Addressing these three areas could provide a number of benefits. First,  ensuring that privacy protections are applied consistently to all federal  collection and use of information could help ensure that information not  retrieved by identifier (such as may occur in data-mining applications, for  example) is protected in the same way as information retrieved by  identifier. Further, limiting the use of personally identifiable information to  a stated purpose could help ensure a proper balance between allowing  government agencies to collect and use such information and limiting that  collection and use to what is necessary and relevant. Lastly, a clear and  effective notice can provide individuals with critical information about what  personal data are to be collected, how they are to be used, and the  circumstances under which they may be shared. An effective notice can  also provide individuals with information they need to determine whether  to provide their personal information (if voluntary), or who to contact to  correct any errors that could result in an adverse determination about  them.", "We noted that some of these issues\u2014such as those dealing with  limitations on use and mechanisms for informing the public\u2014could be  addressed by OMB through revisions of or supplements to existing  guidance. However, we further stressed that unilateral action by OMB  would not have the benefit of public deliberations regarding how best to  strike an appropriate balance between the government\u2019s need to collect,  process, and share personally identifiable information and the rights of  individuals to know about such collections and be assured that they are  only for limited purposes and uses.", "Accordingly, we suggested that Congress consider amending applicable  laws, such as the Privacy Act and E-Government Act, according to the  alternatives we outlined, including  revising the scope of the laws to cover all personally identifiable  information collected, used, and maintained by the federal  government;  setting requirements to ensure that the collection and use of  personally identifiable information is limited to a stated purpose; and establishing additional mechanisms for informing the public about  privacy protections by revising requirements for the structure and  publication of public notices.", "In commenting on a draft of our report, OMB officials noted that they  shared our concerns about privacy and listed guidance that the agency  has issued in the areas of privacy and information security.

In 2006, in the wake of a security  breach at the Department of Veterans Affairs resulting in the compromise  of personal data on millions of U.S. veterans, we testified on preventing  and responding to improper disclosures of personal information in the  federal government.

Accordingly, we made  recommendations to selected agencies to strengthen practices for  planning and implementing the use of encryption. The agencies generally  agreed with the recommendations and we have assessed that 6 of the 18  recommendations have been addressed.", "Despite preventive measures, data breaches can still occur, and when  they do it is critical that proper response policies and procedures be in  place. We testified in 2006  that notification to individuals affected by  data breaches and/or the public has clear benefits, such as allowing  people to take steps to protect themselves from identity theft.

In addition, another 350,000 people listed in the  eligibility inquiries may have had other sensitive data stolen, including  names, birth dates, and addresses.   In March 2012, a news wire service reported that the senior  commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had  been the target of repeated cyber attacks using Facebook that were  believed to have originated in China. According to the article, hackers  repeatedly tried to dupe those close to the commander by setting up  fake Facebook accounts in his name in the hope that his  acquaintances would make contact and answer private messages,  potentially divulging sensitive information about the commander or  themselves.   In March 2012, it was reported that Blue Cross Blue Shield of  Tennessee paid out a settlement of $1.5 million to the U.S.  Department of Health and Human Services arising from potential  violations stemming from the theft of 57 unencrypted computer hard  drives that contained protected health information of over 1 million  individuals.", "Incidents such as these illustrate that sensitive personally identifiable  information remains at risk and that improved protections are needed to  ensure the privacy of information collected by the government.
