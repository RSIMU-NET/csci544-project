The waste is to be permanently stored in the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a planned geologic repository near Carlsbad, New Mexico. However, DOE must first obtain from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) a certificate of compliance with its disposal regulations for radioactive waste and meet the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (RCRA), for handling and disposing of hazardous waste.", "Interested in the feasibility of opening WIPP on DOE\u2019s schedule and the Department\u2019s readiness to begin disposal operations, the requesters asked GAO to assess the prospects for opening WIPP in 1998 and determine how well DOE is positioned to begin filling the repository in its first few years of operation as well as over the longer term."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The production and maintenance of nuclear weapons produces a variety of waste by-products, including transuranic waste. DOE is storing almost 100,000 cubic meters of transuranic waste, primarily at six sites, and expects to generate another 78,000 cubic meters of the waste over the next several decades as it cleans up its nuclear facilities. About 97 percent of the existing volume of transuranic waste is stored in standard 55-gallon steel drums and other types of containers. This waste, which typically consists of contaminated equipment, tools, protective clothing, and scrap materials, is called \u201ccontact-handled\u201d waste because it can be handled with limited precautions to protect workers from radiation. The remaining volume of waste is called \u201cremote-handled\u201d waste because it emits higher levels of penetrating radiation that requires special shielding, handling, and disposal procedures.", "In 1979, the Congress authorized DOE to develop WIPP expressly to demonstrate the safe disposal of radioactive wastes resulting from U.S. defense activities and programs. By the end of 1988, DOE had constructed all surface facilities, shafts leading to the underground disposal area, and 7 of 56 planned disposal rooms. DOE had not, however, established a clear link between its scientific program to conduct underground tests at WIPP with transuranic waste and its plans to demonstrate compliance with EPA\u2019s disposal regulations.", "In October 1992, the Congress passed the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Land Withdrawal Act. Among other things, the act authorized DOE to conduct testing at WIPP with limited quantities of contact-handled waste after EPA had (1) approved DOE\u2019s testing and waste retrieval plans, (2) issued final disposal regulations for radioactive wastes, (3) determined DOE\u2019s compliance with the terms of EPA\u2019s \u201cno migration\u201d determination, and (4) found that the planned tests would provide data \u201cdirectly relevant\u201d to a certification of compliance with the disposal regulations or with RCRA. Also, before DOE may dispose of transuranic waste in WIPP, DOE must apply for and obtain from EPA a certification of WIPP\u2019s compliance with the agency\u2019s disposal regulations. In conjunction, EPA was required to establish the criteria for issuing a certificate of compliance to DOE. Finally, DOE may not begin disposing of waste in WIPP until 180 days after it has received a compliance certificate from EPA.", "DOE must also meet the requirements for disposing of hazardous wastes as defined under RCRA because, the Department estimates, over 60 percent of its stored transuranic waste also contains hazardous waste. The land disposal restrictions in EPA\u2019s regulations implementing RCRA generally prohibit the disposal of untreated hazardous waste unless the agency makes a \u201cno migration\u201d determination. To receive such a determination for WIPP, DOE must demonstrate that there will be essentially no migration of hazardous waste from the repository\u2019s boundary for as long as the waste remains hazardous. Also, because New Mexico is authorized by EPA to carry out a state RCRA program, DOE must obtain a permit from New Mexico for the design, maintenance, operation, and closure of WIPP. If DOE meets New Mexico\u2019s requirements, the state expects to issue a draft permit for public comment by late summer 1996 and a final permit by June 1997. In addition to these key requirements, DOE must comply with other applicable federal environmental laws, such as the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992, which pertains to the treatment and disposal of waste at the sites where the waste is stored and/or generated.", "In 1993, DOE and EPA concentrated on the details of the planned waste disposal tests at WIPP and the relevance of the tests to a future compliance determination. At that time, DOE expected to complete the tests, apply for and receive a compliance certificate, and begin disposing of waste in the repository in 2000. In October 1993, however, DOE announced that by substituting waste tests conducted in laboratories for the planned tests in WIPP, it could open the repository 2 years earlier. The accelerated schedule has created a more dynamic, higher-risk environment for completing preparations for both the compliance application and disposal operations because more interdependent activities had to be conducted in parallel, rather than in sequence, with little time available to make adjustments on the basis of the results of individual activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prospects for Opening WIPP in Mid-1998 Are Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["It is unclear whether DOE can accomplish all of the work needed to comply with EPA\u2019s regulations for disposing of transuranic waste at WIPP on a schedule that would enable the Department to open the repository in April 1998. (See fig. 1 for DOE\u2019s most recent schedule.) One reason is the disparity between the contents of DOE\u2019s draft application for a certificate of compliance and EPA\u2019s disposal regulations and the related criteria for deciding whether to issue the certificate. In addition, DOE was in the process of analyzing the results of the completed and ongoing scientific research that is to feed into the compliance application before it can submit a complete application."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Disparity Between Draft Application and Regulatory Requirements", "paragraphs": ["DOE, in its 1995 draft application, did not address many of EPA\u2019s compliance criteria. This situation occurred, in part, because DOE submitted the draft application to EPA shortly after the agency had issued its proposed criteria for public comment in January 1995, well before EPA issued the final criteria in February 1996. Although the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act required EPA to issue the final criteria within 2 years of its enactment, or by October 30, 1994, the delay in issuing the criteria occurred, in part, because of the agency\u2019s emphasis in 1993 on reviewing DOE\u2019s plans for the tests with waste at WIPP and on issuing the agency\u2019s disposal regulations. In addition, according to the director of EPA\u2019s WIPP program, the agency took some additional time to complete the criteria so that it could ensure that the public had an adequate opportunity to participate in developing the criteria. When DOE eliminated the proposed tests in the WIPP underground, however, timely issuance of the compliance criteria became important to achieving DOE\u2019s accelerated timetable for opening WIPP.", "In April 1994, when DOE announced that it planned to begin operating WIPP in mid-1998, it assumed that EPA would issue the final compliance criteria in January 1995 and that DOE would submit a draft compliance application to EPA 2 months later. EPA, however, did not issue the proposed criteria for public comment until January 1995 and, at that time, estimated that it would take at least 1 year to issue the final criteria. Nevertheless, DOE submitted part of its draft compliance application to EPA in March 1995 and the remaining part of the application 4 months later.", "DOE recognized and informed EPA, the state of New Mexico, and other parties that its draft application was incomplete but sought these parties\u2019 comments to help it prepare to submit its final compliance application in December 1996 and receive a certificate of compliance 1 year later. (In October 1995, DOE amended its schedule, including moving the planned date for submitting its final application to October 1996.) In remarks prefacing the draft application, DOE noted that because EPA had issued the proposed compliance criteria a few months earlier, the Department was not able to follow all of the criteria in preparing the draft application. DOE also noted that the draft application did not include details on many of the subjects addressed in the draft criteria. Among other things, these subjects included the results of experiments in progress to support the final calculations on WIPP\u2019s performance as a repository, information on the potential barriers to the release of the waste materials from the repository, seals for the shafts leading from the surface to the underground area, and the active institutional controls planned for the site after the repository is closed. Finally, DOE stated that its draft application did not contain analyses demonstrating that WIPP could meet the requirements of EPA\u2019s disposal regulations for protecting groundwater from radioactive materials.", "In January 1996, after reviewing the draft application, EPA advised DOE that the application lacked the necessary detail for an appropriate and thorough review for technical adequacy. Although the agency refrained from commenting on the draft application\u2019s completeness, it provided DOE with over 370 detailed comments on apparent deficiencies in the application. For example, the agency said the application lacked the necessary detail on the characteristics of the WIPP site, the waste to be disposed of in the repository, and barriers to the release of radioactive materials from the repository that DOE might engineer to enhance the repository\u2019s performance. (See app. I for examples of the deficiencies in DOE\u2019s draft application that were observed by EPA and New Mexico\u2019s Environmental Evaluation Group.)", "Other parties that are likely to provide comments to EPA on DOE\u2019s application for a certificate of compliance also expressed concern that DOE\u2019s draft application was incomplete. The 1992 WIPP Land Withdrawal Act provided special status to New Mexico, the Environmental Evaluation Group, and the National Academy of Sciences. The act required DOE to provide these parties with free and timely access to the data on health, safety, or environmental protection issues at WIPP and authorized the parties to evaluate and publish analyses of DOE\u2019s regulatory compliance activities. In a March 1996 report, the Environmental Evaluation Group stated that the draft application could not be considered an adequate draft document for demonstrating compliance with EPA\u2019s disposal regulations because the application lacked substantial features that would be expected in the final application. According to the Group, the document resembled the framework rather than a draft of an application because it lacked a logical presentation of the proofs of compliance with EPA\u2019s disposal regulations. Even the most basic information, the Group said, is absent from the draft application.", "Among other deficiencies, the Environmental Evaluation Group stated, the application did not adequately describe the waste that DOE would dispose of in WIPP or discuss the problems that the Department had been encountering in documenting the physical, chemical, and radiological characteristics of this waste. Thus, the Group pointed out, the assessments of the repository\u2019s performance described in the application were based on \u201cassumed\u201d rather than actual characteristics of the waste.", "In October 1995, New Mexico also commented to EPA on DOE\u2019s draft application. In many cases, the state said, information was either lacking or so preliminary that the state could not meaningfully comment on DOE\u2019s treatment of various issues.", "Moreover, EPA\u2019s final criteria contained provisions that DOE, in commenting on the draft criteria, had objected to and other provisions that were not in the agency\u2019s draft criteria. DOE will have to address these provisions in its final application. One example concerns the assumptions that DOE must use in addressing the likelihood and possible types of human intrusion at WIPP, such as mining and drilling. EPA\u2019s final criteria established assumptions about the types and frequency of mining and drilling that DOE will have to use in its final application. What the appropriate assumptions are had been an area of contention among DOE, EPA, and others, including the Environmental Evaluation Group. For this reason and because DOE has not yet addressed the issue of human intrusion in accordance with EPA\u2019s final criteria, the Department\u2019s analyses of the mining and drilling issues in its final application are likely to receive close review by EPA and other parties who may be commenting on the application."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scientific Work Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["DOE will have to resolve many issues over the next several months if it is to submit, by October 1996, an application for a certificate of compliance that will withstand the scrutiny of EPA, which will review, and other parties, which may comment on, the completeness and quality of the application. According to the Assistant Manager for Regulatory Compliance at DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Area Office, the Department was making substantial progress toward completing an application for a certificate of compliance on schedule. In addition, the director of EPA\u2019s Radiation Protection Division said that DOE is giving priority to issues the agency raised in its review of the draft application.", "Whether DOE can successfully resolve the outstanding issues in the next few months is uncertain because DOE\u2019s final technical positions on WIPP have been evolving since the submission to EPA of the draft compliance certification application. According to the assistant manager for regulatory compliance in DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Area Office, the Department intends to send EPA sections of its final application for early review and comment over the next several months to facilitate EPA\u2019s review of the completeness of the application when DOE submits the application to EPA in October 1996. The assistant manager also stated that the application will document DOE\u2019s current technical positions on WIPP. As of early May 1996, the Director of EPA\u2019s WIPP Center told us that the EPA staff had received one section of the application dealing with the site\u2019s characteristics and geological features.", "However, for sections of the final application that document DOE\u2019s compliance with the disposal regulations, DOE was making the final decisions about the details of the conceptual and computational models that it will use to simulate and assess the performance of the repository over the required 10,000-year period. The performance assessment is critical to demonstrating that neither radioactive nor hazardous materials will migrate from the repository\u2019s boundary. At the same time, DOE was feeding the current results from completed and ongoing research projects into the performance assessment calculations, parts of which have already begun.", "In addition, to satisfy EPA\u2019s compliance criteria, DOE is implementing a program to ensure that its key scientific and regulatory compliance programs and activities meet generally accepted standards of quality in the nuclear industry. Some of the data DOE has collected predate the Department\u2019s adoption of the quality standards that EPA has prescribed in its final compliance criteria. Therefore, DOE is now attempting to demonstrate, using the procedures permitted by the criteria, that the data to be used in the compliance application, which the Department collected before it implemented the required quality assurance program, meet the quality assurance standards for existing data. According to DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Area Office, about 10 percent of the data that the Department collected in prior years would, to the extent that the data are used to support the final WIPP compliance analysis, have to be qualified by either of two approaches. The first approach is to demonstrate that the data were collected under standards that were equivalent to DOE\u2019s current quality assurance program. The second approach is to use alternative means of qualification, such as peer review, that are permitted by EPA. These officials added that the qualification work is currently on schedule to support the submission of the final application to EPA.", "Finally, in February 1995, DOE asked the National Academy of Sciences\u2019 Committee on WIPP to evaluate the key scientific studies and modeling supporting DOE\u2019s ongoing assessments of the repository\u2019s performance. The Committee\u2019s study would provide DOE with feedback on several important aspects of the assessment program, such as the hydrology of the rock formations where the repository is situated, the use of peer review and expert judgment in DOE\u2019s scientific program, and studies of the potential effects on the repository\u2019s performance of gases that might be generated from waste materials. As of May 1996, the Committee anticipated issuing its report late in July of 1996. Officials at DOE\u2019s Carlsbad office stated that until they have received and reviewed the Committee\u2019s report, they do not know what actions they might have to take if the Committee finds deficiencies in DOE\u2019s research program or recommends that DOE perform additional research. Moreover, DOE has already cut back the scope of its research program, and by the time the Committee releases its report, DOE expects to be nearly finished with its calculations of WIPP\u2019s compliance with EPA\u2019s disposal regulations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOE Will Have Limited Disposal Capability in the First Years of WIPP\u2019s Operations", "paragraphs": ["For the first several years of WIPP\u2019s operations, DOE expects to dispose of contact-handled waste at less than one quarter of the design disposal rate of the repository. The disposal operations in these years will be constrained by the number of transportation containers that are available and the lack of facilities and equipment at the storage sites for preparing waste for shipment and disposal. DOE does not expect to begin disposing of remote-handled waste until 2002.", "DOE estimates that it has about 97,000 cubic meters of contact-handled transuranic waste in storage and projects that it will generate almost 56,000 cubic meters more of this waste. (See table 1.) More than 98 percent of the total anticipated volume of contact-handled waste is stored or will be generated at six facilities.", "DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Area Office plans to ship contact-handled waste to WIPP from the Idaho, Rocky Flats, and Los Alamos sites in 1998 and from the Savannah River site in 1999. Thereafter, the office may also make shipments from other storage sites. The office expects to make almost 1,300 shipments to WIPP at an accelerating rate over the approximately 5-year period ending December 31, 2002. (See table 2.) During that same period, the repository is expected to be operationally capable of receiving and disposing of over 1,900 shipments of waste. Thus, the planned disposal rate is about two-thirds of the expected capability to dispose of waste in WIPP through 2002.", "One constraint on DOE\u2019s initial disposal capability is the number of available transportation containers. Several years ago, when DOE expected to begin operating WIPP earlier as a test facility, the Department procured 15 containers for transporting contact-handled waste. Since then, DOE has concentrated its budget for WIPP on the scientific and technical issues that need to be resolved to demonstrate compliance with EPA\u2019s disposal regulations and has not procured additional containers. DOE expects to acquire more containers in 2000\u2014enough to make 10 shipments per week to WIPP by the end of that year\u2014and to have a total of 60 containers by 2002\u2014enough to make 17 shipments per week.", "A second operational constraint is the extent to which DOE\u2019s storage sites are limited in their ability to prepare contact-handled waste for shipment and disposal. Waste managers at each site must be able to (1) retrieve the waste and put it in temporary storage areas; (2) characterize, or identify the constituents of, the waste; (3) identify the waste that meets the criteria for shipping and disposal; (4) treat the waste, as necessary, to make it suitable for shipment and disposal; and (5) package the waste for shipment and load the transportation containers onto transport vehicles. At present, according to DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Area Office, only the Idaho and Rocky Flats sites are capable of completing these steps for a limited amount\u2014about 4,500 cubic meters\u2014of the existing 97,000 cubic meters of contact-handled waste.", "Each of DOE\u2019s major storage sites needs facilities for characterizing, repackaging, treating, and/or loading waste for transportation. At some sites, waste managers are taking interim measures, such as identifying the waste that does not require treatment, to prepare enough waste for shipment and disposal to meet the Department\u2019s obligations for managing wastes under the Federal Facility Compliance Act and its schedule for opening WIPP. At Los Alamos, for example, waste managers expect to have mobile characterization and transportation loading equipment in place by 1998; therefore, DOE\u2019s Carlsbad office estimates that the site may have about 600 cubic meters of waste ready to ship in 1998. If funds are made available for the necessary equipment at the Rocky Flats site, the site\u2019s waste managers expect to have about 1,000 cubic meters of waste ready for shipment and disposal in 1998. (See app. II for a discussion of each of the six major storage sites.)", "In connection with the Idaho site, DOE recently agreed, in a settlement of litigation with Idaho, to ship 3,100 cubic meters\u2014about 15,000 drums\u2014of contact-handled waste from Idaho by the end of 2002. Making two shipments a week from this facility\u2014up to about 4,370 drums of waste per year\u2014could enable DOE to meet its agreement with the state. It is uncertain, however, if DOE will be able to prepare the waste for shipment at that rate. As recently as September 1995, site officials estimated that they would have only about 700 drums of waste ready by June 1998. Since then, however, these officials have reinterpreted DOE\u2019s criteria covering the requirements that waste must meet to qualify for shipment to and disposal in WIPP. As a result, they now expect that by mid-1998 they will be able to certify that at least 2,000 drums of waste meet all of the criteria for shipment and disposal and that subsequently they will be able to certify another 3,500 drums per year.", "For remote-handled waste, DOE does not expect to have the essential facilities and equipment in place for preparing and shipping the waste to WIPP until at least 2002. Most of the stored waste is at Oak Ridge, but DOE expects to generate much more of this waste at its Hanford site (see table 3).", "DOE\u2019s schedule for disposing of remote-handled waste may present an operational problem at WIPP, particularly if DOE is unable to begin disposing of the waste at Hanford for many years. By 2002, at the earliest, DOE may have a new facility at its Oak Ridge site that is ready to begin retrieving and preparing almost 800 cubic meters of remote-handled sludge for disposal in WIPP. The Department has no firm plans, however, for when and how it will prepare to recover, treat, and dispose of the remaining remote-handled waste at Oak Ridge. At Hanford, moreover, site officials do not have plans for preparing remote-handled waste for disposal; however, they expect to begin disposing of this waste within 20 years. The latter waste will largely consist of equipment that is now part of the system of underground tanks that store high-level radioactive waste from the earlier production of plutonium at the site. Currently, site officials expect that most of the remote-handled waste may eventually be decontaminated and disposed of at the site and that only about 3,470 cubic meters of this waste will be shipped to and disposed of in WIPP. DOE is negotiating milestones that will affect the shipment of transuranic waste with the state of Washington and EPA.", "DOE designed WIPP so that remote-handled waste would be disposed of in the walls of storage rooms before contact-handled waste is placed in these rooms. Because of the delay in disposing of remote-handled waste, less of the repository\u2019s storage area will be available when DOE is ready to dispose of this waste. According to DOE\u2019s manager of remote-handled waste, the Department is reviewing alternatives that would make up for the loss of disposal space for remote-handled waste in the initial years of WIPP\u2019s operations. He added that an alternative would not be ready in time for inclusion in DOE\u2019s compliance application to EPA; therefore, if DOE wants to pursue an alternative disposal approach, it would seek an amendment to the compliance certificate after WIPP opens. Moreover, if DOE is not able to dispose of all of the remote-handled waste within the walls of the waste-storage rooms for contact-handled waste, it may have to mine new storage areas in the repository specifically for disposing of remote-handled waste. This effort would increase the cost of operating the repository."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE Needs New Facilities and Equipment to Achieve Anticipated Disposal Rate", "paragraphs": ["Looking beyond the first few years of WIPP\u2019s operations to the 25- to 35-year period over which DOE expects to ship waste to WIPP and emplace the waste in the repository for permanent disposal, DOE will not be able to significantly increase the rate at which it emplaces transuranic waste in WIPP until it has (1) developed the facilities and equipment at each site for retrieving, processing, and packaging the waste for shipment and (2) procured more numbers and varieties of transportation containers. In a 1995 report projecting the potential costs of cleaning up its nuclear sites, DOE estimated that the required investment in facilities and containers for transuranic waste and related operations over several decades will cost more than $11 billion. In addition, DOE estimated that the waste transportation and disposal operations at WIPP could cost almost $8 billion, for a total cost of about $19 billion to manage and dispose of transuranic waste. According to DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Area Office, a 1996 updated version of the baseline cost report now being prepared will increase the estimated cost to about $29 billion.", "The Idaho site illustrates the need for DOE to develop the ability to characterize, treat as necessary, and prepare larger quantities of waste for shipment before it can begin to make significant headway in disposing of the contact-handled waste stored at the site. Officials at that site estimate that about 58 percent of the waste is stored in boxes that are incompatible with existing waste characterization facilities. Other major storage sites, except for Los Alamos, are in similar situations.", "DOE will also need to develop other types of transportation containers for much of its contact-handled waste. DOE estimates that about 26 percent of the waste can be efficiently transported in the existing type of container. About 41 percent of the waste is expected to be too heavy for efficient transport in the existing type of container. DOE plans to develop and procure new containers for this waste. DOE has not yet decided how it will transport the remaining amount of contact-handled waste.", "How soon DOE can bring these essential facilities and equipment on line and operate them depends upon the availability of funds at a time when DOE faces significant competing priorities for limited funds. For fiscal years 1996 through 2000, DOE expects to reduce its overall budget by more than $14 billion when compared with earlier budget projections. This reduction includes $4.4 billion in its environmental management programs.", "It is unclear what the precise implications of DOE\u2019s planned or other budget reduction proposals are for the timing and extent of WIPP\u2019s operation and for DOE\u2019s ability to prepare the existing and projected inventories of waste for shipment to and disposal at WIPP. Tighter future budgets could further restrain DOE\u2019s ability to prepare, ship, and dispose of transuranic waste at the planned rates. In these circumstances, WIPP is likely to remain open, at a less-than-optimal operating level, for many years beyond the currently planned operating life of 35 years. According to DOE\u2019s estimate of the annual cost to operate WIPP, each additional year that DOE must operate the repository could cost about $130 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of our report to DOE and EPA for their review and comment.

DOE is optimistic, it said, because all work is known, planned, and on schedule; the success rate in accomplishing scheduled activities and milestones is 100 percent. Specifically, DOE pointed to its filing of a draft compliance application with EPA as evidence of the success of its strategy to achieve the maximum amount of input to the final application.", "We recognized in our report that DOE had met its past milestones, such as submitting a draft compliance application to EPA, for opening WIPP. In our view, however, the effectiveness of the Department\u2019s efforts to open WIPP depends on its ability to submit an application for a compliance certificate to EPA that is of sufficient completeness and quality to enable the agency to issue a certificate to DOE within the 1-year period specified in the WIPP Land Withdrawal Act. Whether DOE will meet this requirement remains to be seen.", "DOE also said our draft report failed to recognize that its plans to bring WIPP to full operation meet the resource needs of the Department and exceed all requirements at the storage sites that stem from agreements between DOE and the states. If, over the first 5 years of WIPP\u2019s operation, DOE is successful in shipping and disposing of the quantities of waste currently planned, then it should meet the short-term requirements of the sites where the waste is stored. As our report discusses, however, there is some uncertainty about the Department\u2019s ability to meet its short-term disposal objectives and even greater uncertainty over the long term. For example, tight budgets in future years could restrain DOE\u2019s ability to dispose of transuranic waste at currently planned rates.", "Finally, DOE provided other specific clarifying comments that we incorporated as appropriate.", "The EPA officials agreed with our report and suggested changes intended to clarify the agency\u2019s role and authority in regulating WIPP.

The disposal regulations specify the requirements for containing the waste, protecting individuals and groundwater from radiation, and providing additional assurances to reduce the likelihood of a release of radiation from the repository. As mandated by the Land Withdrawal Act of 1992, EPA developed the compliance criteria to clarify the requirements of the disposal regulations and required DOE to provide the agency with specific types of information in the Department\u2019s compliance application. The compliance criteria implement the containment, individual protection, groundwater protection, and assurance requirements of the disposal regulations. In addition, the criteria contain public participation requirements describing how the agency will involve the public in the certification rulemaking process and general requirements covering subjects such as the extent to which the waste needs to be characterized (analyzed to determine its contents) before it is disposed of, guidance on the computer models and codes that simulate the repository\u2019s performance, and demonstrations that the data and assumptions developed by DOE have been adequately peer reviewed.", "According to EPA and others, DOE\u2019s mid-1995 draft application for a certificate of compliance did not include sufficient detail to address the elements of the agency\u2019s disposal regulations and proposed criteria of January 1995.

EPA also raised questions about the hydrology of the site. The agency said, for example, that it appeared that the hydrologic properties of the Dewey Lake rock formation\u2014a layer of rock between the surface of the site and the underground repository\u2014are not well documented and that additional study of that formation may be warranted before it can be ruled out as a potential pathway for contaminants to escape the repository area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Engineered Barriers", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on DOE\u2019s draft application, EPA stated that the application contained only a limited discussion of how DOE might use engineered barriers to develop adequate confidence that WIPP would comply with the agency\u2019s disposal regulations.

New Mexico\u2019s Environmental Evaluation Group has sided with EPA because, in the Group\u2019s view, DOE has not adequately considered the advantages of engineered barriers in the repository. Subsequently, DOE decided that it will use additional engineered barriers at WIPP to comply with EPA\u2019s disposal regulations. The effectiveness of the planned engineered barriers will be addressed by DOE in its final compliance application and by EPA and others in their reviews of the application.", "EPA\u2019s proposed and final compliance criteria include provisions that implement its assurance requirement on engineered barriers. EPA is requiring DOE to study the available options for engineered barriers at WIPP and submit this study as part of its compliance application. Consistent with this requirement and the containment requirements in the agency\u2019s disposal regulations, DOE must analyze the performance of the complete disposal system, including any planned engineered barriers, and EPA must consider this analysis when evaluating compliance with both the containment and assurance requirements. EPA stipulated that DOE must evaluate the benefits and detriments of engineered barrier alternatives and consider specific factors, such as the effectiveness of the barriers in preventing or substantially delaying the movement of radioactive contaminants to the accessible environment and the effect of the barriers on the total costs of disposal. Also, EPA is requiring DOE to study and describe any engineered barrier(s) for existing waste that is already packaged, not yet packaged, or in need of re-packaging and, to the extent practicable, waste to be generated in the future.", "During EPA\u2019s rulemaking on its proposed compliance criteria, DOE objected to the proposed requirements related to engineered barriers because, in the Department\u2019s view, the requirements have no basis within the agency\u2019s disposal regulations. DOE was concerned that the engineered barrier requirements would make the agency\u2019s regulations more stringent than the agency had intended when it developed the regulations and could be interpreted as requiring barriers beyond those necessary to demonstrate a \u201creasonable expectation\u201d of compliance with the regulations.", "Before EPA issued the proposed compliance criteria in January 1995, DOE had informally agreed with EPA to study engineered barriers. After EPA included the requirement for the study of engineered barriers in its proposed criteria, DOE questioned why the agency needed to prescribe the study in its regulations when the Department had already begun to perform the study. DOE also questioned the role the study would have in EPA\u2019s process for considering DOE\u2019s application for a certificate of compliance, because the performance of such a study was not a part of the basis for developing the regulations. DOE added that it intended to use this study to make decisions about the need for additional engineered barriers to meet EPA\u2019s assurance requirements. The study would not, DOE said, aid in the selection of the engineered barriers needed to comply with EPA\u2019s containment requirements. Finally, although the Department generally agreed with EPA\u2019s approach of assessing the benefits and detriments of engineered barriers, it expressed concern that the proposed criteria provided no meaningful basis for selecting engineered barriers other than the outcome of the benefit/detriment analysis.", "In September 1995, DOE released its engineered barrier study. The study, according to officials of DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Area Office, evaluated the types, applicability, cost, and benefit of using engineered barriers at WIPP. DOE concluded from the study that engineered barriers, other than planned shaft seals, would be of little benefit in demonstrating that WIPP complies with EPA\u2019s disposal regulations. Therefore, the Carlsbad office decided to use only those engineered barriers that it believed were necessary to appreciably add to the assurance of compliance with EPA\u2019s disposal regulations and/or to meet other specific regulatory requirements.", "According to officials of EPA\u2019s WIPP Center, the agency expects to complete its review of DOE\u2019s study in June 1996. EPA, however, noted that it will not be evaluating the merits of DOE\u2019s engineered barrier study as a \u201cstand alone\u201d effort but, rather, in the context of DOE\u2019s total compliance application submission. Because DOE has not finished its final compliance calculations and associated sensitivity analyses, it is too early to tell what the relative contribution of the barriers studied by DOE will have on EPA\u2019s compliance determination or if the contribution would appreciably enhance confidence in DOE\u2019s final results.", "New Mexico\u2019s Environmental Evaluation Group has been critical of DOE\u2019s consideration of engineered barriers at WIPP. The Group disagrees with DOE\u2019s position that EPA\u2019s compliance criteria impose additional requirements on DOE. In the Group\u2019s view, the criteria provide a basis for DOE to select or reject various engineered barrier alternatives. The Group also maintains that DOE\u2019s definition of an \u201cengineered barrier,\u201d as stated in the Department\u2019s draft compliance application, is inconsistent with the definitions used by other agencies, such as the definition the Nuclear Regulatory Commission uses in connection with DOE\u2019s proposed repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada. According to the Group, although DOE repeatedly stated in its draft application that it will use \u201cmultiple barriers\u201d at WIPP, the only barriers that DOE is known to be planning are seals for the shafts leading to the underground repository. The Group called DOE\u2019s effort a \u201cminimal\u201d approach and pointed out that on the Yucca Mountain repository project, the Commission does not consider shaft seals to be an engineered barrier. The Group also believes that DOE\u2019s essentially sole reliance on the calculations for the repository\u2019s performance to decide whether or not to implement engineered barriers at WIPP is contrary to the well-established principle within the nuclear industry of multiple and redundant barriers to isolate nuclear materials.", "Finally, the Group has urged DOE to backfill the waste-filled storage rooms and tunnels with crushed salt that was mined from the underground repository and is now stored on the surface. The Group believes that backfilling the repository can serve useful purposes, such as reducing the generation of gases and minimizing settlement and fracturing in the rock formations overlying the repository.", "In April 1996, an assistant manager of DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Area Office told us that the Department has decided to follow the Group\u2019s recommendation. DOE will, he said, place bags of magnesium oxide around the sides and over the top of the containers of waste in underground storage rooms at WIPP. This approach, he added, will control gas formation in the repository and reduce the possibility that harmful transuranic materials might become dissolved in brine that could seep into and then out of the repository and find its way into the groundwater. According to the Group\u2019s deputy director, in May 1996 the Group was in the process of discussing the backfill issue with DOE\u2019s Carlsbad office but had not yet decided whether to fully support DOE\u2019s choice of backfill material."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Waste Characterization", "paragraphs": ["EPA criticized DOE\u2019s draft compliance application for its lack of detail on the expected characteristics and components of the transuranic waste that would be disposed of at WIPP.

In commenting on DOE\u2019s draft application, the agency noted that DOE had made assumptions\u2014rather than provide actual data\u2014about the characteristics and components of the waste, such as the types and quantities of radioactivity, amounts of moisture in waste containers, and quantities of other materials contained in the waste containers, that could affect the repository\u2019s long-term performance. EPA also stated that DOE had not (1) identified the waste characteristics that are important to the long-term performance of the repository; (2) discussed the relationships that the characteristics of the waste may have to important processes, such as the generation of gases over time in the storage rooms; and (3) identified the uncertainties associated with these relationships. According to EPA, however, the inclusion of such information is essential to an assessment of WIPP\u2019s performance as a repository. Furthermore, EPA stated, DOE had not explained how it would control and track the types of waste disposed of in the repository from the time the waste is characterized to the time it is emplaced in WIPP to ensure that only waste with the characteristics and components that have been found acceptable for disposal are actually emplaced in the repository.", "EPA\u2019s final criteria require DOE to identify and assess, in its compliance application, the effects on the repository\u2019s performance of only those waste characteristics and components that might actually influence the containment of waste in the disposal system. Under this requirement, DOE is to ensure that all of the characteristics and components of the waste that could influence its containment in the repository have been systematically identified and evaluated. Once DOE has identified (1) by physical samples, knowledge of the waste streams from the operations of DOE\u2019s nuclear facilities or (2) by other means, the waste\u2019s significant characteristics and components, EPA\u2019s criteria require that DOE limit, control, and quantify these characteristics and components.", "Until recently, DOE had not stated how it intends to implement these criteria. In 1993, DOE proposed using assessments of the repository\u2019s performance as a tool for identifying the waste\u2019s characteristics and components having the greatest influence on performance. This is a concept in which DOE would, using performance assessments as a starting point, \u201cscreen\u201d waste streams at storage sites to establish an envelope of, or boundaries on, the characteristics and components that are acceptable for disposal. By comparing the data on the characteristics and components of the waste in storage or expected to be generated in the future with the envelope, DOE could identify those wastes that are acceptable for disposal at WIPP. However, in late 1995, DOE canceled this activity because, according to officials of DOE\u2019s Carlsbad office and Sandia National Laboratories (DOE\u2019s principal scientific contractor for WIPP), the Department now anticipates that all the waste that it has planned to dispose of in WIPP will be acceptable for disposal.", "In April 1996, DOE took a first step toward addressing EPA\u2019s concerns by identifying the criteria that DOE will use to identify the waste that is acceptable for disposal in WIPP. Furthermore, according to officials in DOE\u2019s Carlsbad Area Office, in May 1996 the Department revised its baseline inventory report for transuranic waste across the DOE complex to include information on the waste characteristics and components that will be included in the performance assessment for WIPP.

In the application, DOE stated that for the purpose of assessing the repository\u2019s performance, it assumed that contact-handled and remote-handled waste would be distributed equally among all storage rooms. EPA noted, however, that it did not appear that DOE would have much, if any, remote-handled waste ready to ship to WIPP in 1998. Therefore, according to EPA, the actual distribution of both types of waste within the repository may differ from the distribution of waste that DOE had assumed in its draft application.

The Group said that the WIPP site fails all three of these resource disincentive criteria because there is a significant concentration of potash, oil, and gas reserves in the vicinity of WIPP. Accordingly, the Group said, DOE should have provided documentation of the favorable compensating characteristics of the site. In the compliance application, the Group recommended, DOE should recognize the existing characteristics of the site and consider all plausible human intrusion scenarios instead of debating the favorable site characteristics and the degree to which these characteristics compensate for the presence of resources.

Although EPA had stated in its proposed criteria that it was not requiring consideration of mining in its compliance criteria, it included mining in the final criteria because, it said, mining could alter the properties of certain rock formations above the underground repository. These requirements address the potential changes in the hydrogeology of the rock formations\u2014specifically, groundwater travel time\u2014the size and shape of mines, and when mining might occur.", "EPA is also requiring DOE to consider the effects of two types of drilling for resources: \u201cshallow drilling,\u201d which is drilling to depths above the level at which waste would be disposed of in the repository, and \u201cdeep drilling,\u201d which is drilling to depths below the disposal level. EPA established criteria that require DOE to use past human activities to predict future activities. The agency requires that the rate of drilling over the last 100 years be calculated in the Delaware Basin, which is the geographical area within which WIPP is located. Included in the basis for calculating the drilling rates are any existing leases of drilling rights that can reasonably be expected to be developed in the near future. Once DOE calculates the rate of drilling, it is required to use this rate to predict the rate of drilling that may occur over the 10,000-year period of analysis which the disposal regulations require. The fixed rate is to be based on both exploratory boreholes drilled and developmental (production) boreholes and is to be held constant as the types of resources change over time. Furthermore, EPA required DOE to assume that after WIPP is closed, boreholes drilled nearby would affect the properties of the disposal system for the remainder of the regulatory period. Thus, DOE\u2019s assessments of the repository\u2019s performance must take into account the hydrologic effects of drilling on the disposal system and on the creation of any new pathways for the release of radioactive materials from the repository.", "Finally, EPA is requiring that DOE consider the consequences of events and processes associated with all types of resource extraction activities, including solution mining and fluid injection for secondary recovery of depleted oil reserves. EPA limited consideration of these activities to the resource exploitation that has actually occurred in the vicinity of WIPP and the existing plans and leases for future drilling in the area for these purposes.", "In commenting on the proposed compliance criteria, DOE stated that it should only have to consider human intrusion from exploratory drilling, and not production- or development-related drilling, in its compliance application.

The drums of waste that do not meet the acceptance criteria for either transportation or disposal will eventually have to be treated and/or repackaged to make the waste acceptable. In all, DOE will have to identify about 15,000 acceptable drums of contact-handled waste and ship these drums to WIPP to remove 3,100 cubic meters of transuranic waste from Idaho by the end of 2002.", "On the bases of our discussions with site officials and our review of the documents we obtained from these officials, it is uncertain whether DOE will be able to prepare and ship enough contact-handled waste to meet its agreement with the state. As of March 1995, DOE had characterized about 640 drums of contact-handled waste at the site. About 420 of these drums, however, did not meet the waste acceptance criteria that were then in effect but which have been superseded by new criteria.

Also, the site now expects to have the capability of characterizing and certifying waste at the rate of about 3,200 drums per year once WIPP opens. In large part, he said, the increase in the projected rates of characterization and certification is due to (1) an ongoing effort to develop scientific evidence to convince the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which must approve transportation containers, that the types of waste that can be safely shipped in the containers can be expanded, (2) a relaxation of waste acceptance criteria for particulates in the waste, and (3) a less conservative view of the amount of waste that can be certified. In connection with the latter reason, for example, the latest changes in the waste acceptance criteria allowed DOE to take a less restrictive interpretation of the amount of free liquids allowed in each drum.", "According to this official, if the new approach is successful, the site should be able to sustain this rate of waste characterization and certification and reach the short-term goal of shipping about 15,000 drums to WIPP by the end of 2002."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outlook for the Longer Term", "paragraphs": ["Because most of the contact-handled waste and much of the commingled low-level waste are expected to require treatment before these wastes can be shipped to and disposed of in WIPP, the site needs a treatment facility to meet the stipulation that, beginning in 2003, it must ship an average of 2,000 cubic meters of transuranic waste per year from Idaho.
