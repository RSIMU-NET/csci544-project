This growth is expected to continue as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act potentially extends Medicaid eligibility in 2014 to millions of uninsured individuals.

To examine the first three objectives, GAO administered a nationwide web-based survey to Medicaid officials on states' experiences from 2008 through 2011 and obtained a response rate of 98 percent. To examine the last objective, GAO analyzed data from the 2008 and 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the most current available at the time of our analysis, to assess Medicaid beneficiaries' reported difficulties obtaining care, and the 2009 National Health Interview Survey to assess their reasons for delaying care. To provide context, we compared their experiences to those of individuals with private insurance or who were uninsured."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From 2008 to 2011, more than half of states reported maintaining or decreasing their average Medicaid application processing times--the average number of calendar days between the receipt of a new application and the final determination of eligibility. The average processing times reported by 39 states ranged from 11 to 45 calendar days. For the same time period, however, GAO was unable to assess whether states processed applications at a rate that kept pace with the number of new applications received each month, because most states provided incomplete or inconsistent data.", "States reported making numerous changes to provider payments, provider taxes, and beneficiary services since 2008. While more states reported provider-rate and supplemental payment increases each year from 2008 through 2011, the number reporting payment reductions and increased provider taxes also grew. More states reported increasing services than limiting them.", "Over two-thirds of states reported challenges to ensuring enough Medicaid providers to serve beneficiaries--including dental and specialty care providers. States cited Medicaid payment rates and a general shortage of providers as adding to the challenge. To attract new providers, over half the states reported simplifying administrative requirements or increasing payment rates.", "In calendar years 2008 and 2009, less than 4 percent of beneficiaries who had Medicaid coverage for a full year reported difficulty obtaining medical care, which was similar to individuals with full-year private insurance; however, more Medicaid beneficiaries reported difficulty obtaining dental care than those with private insurance. Beneficiaries with less than a full year of Medicaid coverage were almost twice as likely to report difficulties obtaining medical care as those with full-year coverage. Medicaid beneficiaries reported delaying care for reasons such as long wait times and lack of transportation.", "The Department of Health and Human Services reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Enrollment and expenditures in Medicaid, a federal-state health financing  program for certain categories of low-income individuals, have grown  significantly in recent years. During the nation\u2019s recent economic crisis,  Medicaid enrollment grew 14.2 percent from October 2007 through  February 2010. During this time, total Medicaid expenditures grew nearly  21 percent, from $332.2 billion in 2007 to $401.5 billion in 2010. Since  then, enrollment growth has slowed\u2014averaging around 4 percent  nationally\u2014yet the growth in Medicaid spending continues to be a source  of concern. Economic downturns can create challenges for states  because tax revenues can decrease, while unemployment\u2014and  enrollment in Medicaid\u2014can increase. To reduce program spending,  states generally may make certain changes to their Medicaid programs,  such as altering payments to providers, limiting eligibility, eliminating  optional services, or reducing the amount, duration, or scope of services.", "While recent laws have provided some fiscal relief to states through the  provision of additional federal funding for Medicaid, they have also limited  the ability of states to alter their programs. For example, the American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) provided a  temporary increase in the rate at which the federal government matched  state expenditures, but required states to maintain Medicaid program  eligibility in order to receive the additional funding. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) requires states to expand  their Medicaid programs to cover additional individuals and provides an  enhanced federal match for this coverage. PPACA also makes other  changes to Medicaid eligibility and payment, such as requiring states to  maintain their current levels of eligibility for Medicaid beneficiaries and  increasing payment rates for Medicaid primary care services in 2013 and  2014.result in enrollment of about 7 million additional individuals in 2014   Potential Medicaid expansions under PPACA are estimated to  growing to 11 million in 2022.which states will expand Medicaid coverage to this newly eligible  population, any growth in Medicaid is likely to place additional pressure  on states to manage their programs, maintain or increase their pool of  providers, and ensure access to needed health care services for Medicaid  beneficiaries.", "While it is too early to assess the extent to  In October 2010, we reported on changes states were making to sustain  their Medicaid programs after certain federal funding increases from the  Recovery Act lapsed.

Additionally, states  reported changes to certain services and payments to providers that  could affect beneficiary access. Such changes raise questions about  whether Medicaid is meeting the health care needs of the current  beneficiaries and whether the expansion of Medicaid may further  exacerbate issues of access for beneficiaries. To assess factors that can  affect access and beneficiaries\u2019 experiences obtaining care, this report  examines (1) states\u2019 experiences processing Medicaid applications,   (2) changes that states have made to beneficiary services and provider  payment rates, (3) the challenges states report with regard to ensuring  sufficient provider participation, and (4) the extent to which Medicaid  beneficiaries\u2019 reported difficulties obtaining medical care.", "Over half of the states reported making administrative  To address the first three objectives, we administered a web-based  survey from February 2012 to May 2012 to Medicaid officials in the   50 states, the District of Columbia, and the 5 largest U.S. territories, and  obtained a response rate of 98 percent. In this survey, we generally  asked about states\u2019 experiences from 2008 through 2011. For the web- based survey, we relied on the survey response reported by the primary  contact for the state\u2019s Medicaid program. When we asked states about  implementing various efforts, such as application processing  improvements, we generally gave a time frame for implementation, and  state efforts implemented prior to that time frame are not included in the  report. We did not independently verify the accuracy of the data reported  by states, but we reviewed all survey responses for internal consistency.  In addition, we completed our state survey field work prior to the June 28,  2012, decision by the Supreme Court on certain aspects of PPACA,  including the Medicaid expansion provision. Accordingly, state responses  were provided to us before they had analyzed any potential effect of the  decision on their own state. To address the fourth objective, we analyzed  two national surveys, the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and  the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), to examine the extent to  which Medicaid beneficiaries reported difficulties obtaining care. Our  MEPS analysis was based on national survey data from 2008 and 2009,  the most recent data available at the time of our analysis. Our NHIS  analysis was based on the 2009 survey. Both of these national surveys  rely on information reported by individuals. To provide context for  difficulties obtaining care reported by Medicaid beneficiaries, we  examined the extent to which individuals with private insurance or those  who are uninsured reported such difficulties. We also conducted the  analysis across different age groups, including children, working-age  adults, and those 65 and older, but small sample sizes limited the  reliability of some analyses, and therefore we did not report them. For the  MEPS analysis, children with Medicaid also included those with coverage  under the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP). We  examined differences in reported difficulty obtaining care between  beneficiaries reporting fair or poor health and those reporting better health  and between those with full-year coverage and less than full-year  coverage. For the NHIS and MEPS surveys, we reviewed relevant  documentation describing how these data are collected and processed,  and examined other research that has used these data to report on  potential delays in obtaining health care services to check our results  against similar analyses. We determined that the data we used in this  report were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our engagement.

Under broad federal requirements, states administer the  day-to-day operations of their Medicaid programs; activities that include  determining whether applicants are eligible for Medicaid, setting the  scope of covered services, paying providers, and ensuring access to  covered services. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),  a federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), oversees state Medicaid programs at the federal level. States are  required to ensure that all individuals who want to apply for Medicaid  coverage have the opportunity to do so and must, with reasonable  promptness, provide coverage to applicants who are determined  eligible. In general, states are required to determine eligibility for  individuals who apply for Medicaid within 45 days from the date of  application, and within 90 days for those who apply on the basis of  disability. In some states, Medicaid applications are reviewed and  eligibility is determined at the county level, while other states have  centralized their eligibility determination processes.", "States\u2019 Medicaid programs must cover a set of mandatory services,  including those provided by primary and specialty care physicians, as well  as services provided in hospitals, clinics, and other settings. States may  elect to cover additional optional benefits and services, such as home and  community-based services, personal care, and rehabilitative services,  under their Medicaid programs. In some cases, not all beneficiaries are  eligible for all services. For example, Medicaid requires states to cover  necessary dental care for children, but dental coverage for adults is  optional. Subject to federal requirements, states may establish the  amount, duration, and scope of the mandatory and optional services  covered in their Medicaid programs. For example, states may limit the  number of visits or the days of care that are provided.", "States are responsible for setting Medicaid provider payment rates within  certain federal requirements. Specifically, federal law requires that state  Medicaid payments to providers are consistent with efficiency, economy,  and quality of care and are sufficient to enroll enough providers so that  services are available to beneficiaries at least to the extent that they are  available to the general population in the same geographic area. In  addition, states must identify the methodologies for making provider  payments in their state plans, and such methodologies must be approved  by CMS.", "In addition to payments made directly to providers for services to  beneficiaries, most states also make supplemental payments that are  separate from and in addition to regular Medicaid payments.  Supplemental payments include Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH)  payments, which states are required by federal law to make to hospitals  that treat large numbers of Medicaid and low-income individuals; DSH  payments cannot exceed the unreimbursed cost of furnishing inpatient  and outpatient services to Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured.  Many states also make other optional supplemental payments that are  above the standard Medicaid payment rates but within the Upper   We refer to these payments as non-DSH  Payment Limit (UPL). supplemental payments.

CMS is  responsible for overseeing these payment arrangements, including  whether states are appropriately financing their share.", "States may also use provider taxes and certain other sources of revenue  to finance their Medicaid programs. Provider taxes are taxes, fees,  assessments, or other mandatory payments that states may impose on  the provision of or payment for certain types of health care items or  services, such as inpatient hospital and nursing facility services. States  may use revenue from provider taxes for their state share of Medicaid  expenditures only if the taxes meet certain criteria. Many states use  revenue from a provider tax on a certain type of provider to increase  Medicaid payment rates for the same type of provider, and a state could  effectively increase a payment rate for a provider without using additional  state funds to finance the increase if the revenue from the provider tax  and the federal share of the payment rates account for the total  increase.", "See Pub.

Respondents were initially given 3 weeks to respond, and extensions  were granted to encourage survey participation. The survey was available  online through May 22, 2012.

The U.S. Virgin Islands did not complete the survey."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Development and Analysis of GAO Survey of States", "paragraphs": ["To examine states\u2019 experiences processing Medicaid applications, states  were asked to report their current average processing time for new  regular Medicaid applications\u2014those not based on disability\u2014and how  those times changed since 2008.about the factors states attributed to any reported changes in the average  processing time for Medicaid applications. In addition, to assess the  extent to which states were keeping pace with processing new  applications, the survey asked for monthly data on the number of new  regular applications received and processed from January 2008 through  December 2011.", "The survey also included questions  The survey also asked states about changes to benefits, provider  payment rates, provider taxes, and supplemental payments in each year  from 2008 through 2011. The questions in this section asked about  changes by provider and benefit type, including both those benefits that  are mandatory and optional. The survey asked, generally, about any changes by provider type (i.e., increased, decreased, eliminated, etc.)  and did not ask states to report the details of these changes. States could  report more than one type of change for a provider type in a year. For  example, a state could report both an increase and a decrease in a  provider payment rate for a given provider type in a year. The survey  asked whether the state made a particular change for a provider type in a  year and did not ask for the actual number of those changes it made in a  year or the magnitude of those changes. The survey also asked about the  purpose of any new or increased provider taxes, including avoiding cuts  in benefits, expanding benefits, avoiding cuts in payment rates, increasing  payment rates, or other purposes. Finally, states were asked to report any  changes to supplemental payments by provider type and the role of  provider taxes or county and local government funds in any changes to  the supplemental payments.", "To examine any challenges to ensuring sufficient provider participation,  the survey included questions asking how states monitor whether they  have sufficient providers, which provider types are challenging for states  to ensure sufficient participation, and any steps the states have taken  since January 2008 to maintain their existing pools of providers. The  survey asked how the states monitor the sufficiency of providers across  three service delivery arrangements\u2014fee-for-service, primary care case  management, and risk-based managed care organizations. The survey  included questions about any planned efforts to meet potential increases  in demand for primary care providers due to the Medicaid expansion  under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the  Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (PPACA), and  whether the increase in payment rates for primary care providers under  PPACA would likely assist in increasing provider participation in Medicaid.  The survey also asked states about plans to measure access to care for  Medicaid beneficiaries in response to recently proposed federal  regulations that, if finalized, would provide a framework under which  states can demonstrate Medicaid payments are adequate for access to  providers.", "We took steps in developing the survey and collecting and analyzing the  data to minimize nonsampling errors. However, any survey may  introduce nonsampling errors, such as difficulties in interpreting a  particular question or limited sources of information available to  respondents. We pretested the draft survey with Medicaid officials in  three states in January 2012 to ensure that the questions were relevant,  clearly stated, and easy to understand. The states selected for a pretest  were diverse with respect to the population size, geography, and total  Medicaid spending in 2009. We modified the survey as appropriate as a  result of the pretests. Finally, since this was a web-based survey,  respondents entered their answers directly into the electronic survey,  eliminating the need to key data into a database, which helps to minimize  error. We did not independently verify the data reported by states in the  survey; however, we reviewed published data submitted by state  Medicaid programs to us for another engagement and to outside  researchers to assess the reasonableness of the data reported. We also  assessed the internal consistency of answers to certain questions. We  determined that the data from the survey included in this report were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We used data provided in response to our 2010 survey of Medicaid directors to  determine any changes in states\u2019 application processing volumes and rates between  October 2007 and February 2010. See GAO, Recovery Act: Increased Medicaid Funds  Aided Enrollment Growth, and Most States Reported Taking Steps to Sustain Their  Programs, GAO-11-58 (Washington, D.C.: Oct. 8, 2010).", "One state official was not certain why the data would be reported  differently in the prior survey and suggested that it could be related to  interpretation of the prior survey question because the state does not  collect information in the way we requested it.", "Officials from two states noted that there were changes in the staff  that responded to the survey and could not be certain why the data  reported were different.", "An official from a third state indicated that the data provided to us in  2010 appeared to have included a broader array of applications (such  as those for disability, long-term care, and food stamps), noting that  the same application process is used for multiple programs in the  state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Other Federal Health Care Consumer Survey Data", "paragraphs": ["To examine the extent to which Medicaid beneficiaries reported difficulties  obtaining care, we analyzed data from the Medical Expenditure Panel  Survey (MEPS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS). MEPS  is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS)  Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and collects data on the use  of specific health services; NHIS is conducted by the National Center for  Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. We  analyzed results from the MEPS household component, which collects  data from a sample of families and individuals in selected communities  across the United States. These families and individuals are drawn from a  nationally representative subsample of households that participated in the  prior year\u2019s NHIS.", "Our MEPS analysis was based on data from surveys conducted in 2008  and 2009, the most recent data available at the time of our analysis.  MEPS includes insurance status for respondents for each month of the  year and NHIS includes respondent information on insurance status at a  point in time. Analyzing MEPS allowed us to use information on insurance  status for each month to create variables for full-year and partial-year  coverage. As a result, we determined that the MEPS insurance status  data provided more options to report on the extent to which Medicaid  beneficiaries reported difficulties obtaining medical care. In addition to  determining the extent to which full-year Medicaid beneficiaries had  difficulty accessing care, we also compared Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019  reported experiences to the experience of respondents with private  insurance and respondents who were uninsured, in order to provide  context.Medicaid for a full year reported greater difficulty accessing medical care  than children in Medicaid or full-year Medicaid beneficiaries 65 and older.  We also compared full-year and partial-year Medicaid beneficiaries, to  determine if the extent of reported difficulties obtaining care varied by  length of coverage. Finally, we compared responses from full-year and  partial-year privately insured individuals, and full-year and partial-year  uninsured individuals to provide additional context for the Medicaid  beneficiaries\u2019 reported difficulties.", "Further, we examined whether working-age adults 18 to 64 in  The MEPS household interviews feature several rounds of interviewing  covering 2 full calendar years. MEPS is continuously fielded; each year a  new sample of households is introduced into the study. MEPS collects  information for each person in the household based on information  provided by one adult member of the household. This information  includes demographic characteristics, use of medical services, reasons  for medical visits, and health insurance coverage. We analyzed  responses to MEPS questions about individuals\u2019 reported delays and  inability to obtain necessary medical care, dental care, and prescription  medicine, the reasons for those delays, and the perceived health status of  those individuals who delay or are unable to obtain care.", "For the delays and inability to obtain care measures we used responses  to the following questions:  In the last 12 months, was anyone in the family delayed in getting  medical care, tests, or treatments they or a doctor believed  necessary?", "Which of these best describes the main reason (PERSON)  (were/was) delayed in getting medical care, tests, or treatments  (he/she) or a doctor believed necessary?", "In the last 12 months, was anyone in the family unable to obtain in  getting medical care, tests, or treatments they or a doctor believed  necessary?", "Which of these best describes the main reason (PERSON)  (were/was) unable to obtain medical care, tests, or treatments  (he/she) or a doctor believed necessary?", "We also analyzed responses to similar questions related to delays or the  inability to obtain needed dental care and prescription medicines. To  address sample size concerns and obtain frequencies above 100  responses, we combined data from 2008 and 2009 and the responses  from the questions on both the delays and inability to obtain needed  health care.", "We examined the insurance status of respondents who answered that  they delayed or were unable to obtain needed health care. To  understand the differences in responses by insurance status we identified  the percentage of respondents who delayed or were unable to obtain care  with a variety of insurance statuses as well as those who were uninsured.  We looked at those respondents who indicated they had Medicaid and  private insurance for each month of the year, as well as looking at the  responses for those with Medicaid or private insurance for a partial year  (1-11 months). We also examined the percentage of respondents who  were uninsured for a full and partial year as well as those with mixed  insurance statuses, such as Medicaid part year and uninsured for part of  the year. In addition, we examined demographic variables\u2014such as age,  sex, education, and perceived health status\u2014for those respondents who  indicated they delayed or were unable to obtain care as well as those that  did not delay care. We also looked at responses to the questions by age  group and insurance status to identify potential differences. Small sample  sizes for some analyses limited the reliability of the results, and in those  cases, we did not report the analyses. In this report, we used a   95 percent confidence level and compared upper and lower confidence  intervals to determine whether any differences we found were statistically  significant. Statistical significance indicates that the difference between  observations is unlikely due to chance alone.", "We supplemented our MEPS analysis with analysis of data from the 2009  NHIS survey. NHIS data are collected continuously throughout the year  for the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention, by interviewers from the U.S. Bureau of the Census.  NHIS collects information about the health and health care of the civilian,  noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Interviews are conducted in  respondents\u2019 homes, but follow-ups to complete interviews may be  conducted over the telephone. We analyzed NHIS data to obtain  information on reasons Medicaid beneficiaries reported delays obtaining  needed medical care, and compared those to privately insured individuals  and the uninsured, for context. We analyzed NHIS data for these  questions because the sample size for those questions in NHIS was  larger than for similar questions on delays or the inability to obtain care in  MEPS. Because NHIS asks about insurance coverage at a point in time,  individuals identified as Medicaid beneficiaries would include those with  full-year and partial-year coverage. Data from the 2010 NHIS survey were  available, but we chose to analyze the 2009 survey so the time period  would be compatible with the MEPS analysis.", "NHIS collects information from the civilian, noninstitutionalized population  about demographic characteristics, use of medical services, and health  insurance coverage and organizes the data into several data files. NHIS  collects information on each family member. More information is collected  on a randomly selected adult (the Sample Adult component) and a  randomly selected child (the Sample Child component) within each family  if a child is present. More information is collected on a sample of adults  and children within each family and household. To match the insurance  status variables with the answers to the selected questions, we merged  data from the Person file, which has information on each family member,  with the Sample Adult file, which has more information on sampled  adults. We analyzed responses to the following NHIS question from the  Person file of the survey: During the past 12 months, [have you delayed  seeking medical care/has medical care been delayed for anyone in the  family] because of worry about the cost?", "From the Sample Adult component of the survey, we looked at the  following questions:", "Have you delayed getting care for any of the following reasons in the  past 12 months?", "You couldn\u2019t get through on the telephone", "You couldn\u2019t get an appointment soon enough", "Once you get there, you have to wait too long to see the doctor", "The (clinic/doctor\u2019s) office wasn\u2019t open when you could get there", "You didn\u2019t have transportation.", "We examined the insurance status of respondents to those questions  using the suggested variables for Medicaid, private insurance, and  uninsurance.", "For all estimated percentages for both MEPS and NHIS, we calculated a  lower and upper bound at the 95 percent confidence level using the  appropriate sampling weights and survey design variables provided for  each survey."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Reliability for MEPS and NHIS", "paragraphs": ["To determine the reliability of the MEPS and NHIS data, we reviewed  related documentation, and identified other studies that used MEPS to  address similar research questions to compare the published data with  our findings.

PPACA required states to  begin to accept electronic signatures by 2014, as part of a coordinated  enrollment process that includes using a federally defined uniform  application and verifying income electronically through a federally  managed data hub.", "We found states varied in the extent to which new Medicaid applications  were currently available and processed electronically. (See table 2.) For  example, fewer states reported that the application is submitted  electronically with an electronic signature than those reporting that the  application is available electronically. Twenty-six states reported the  percentage of their new Medicaid applications that were accessed,  signed, and submitted electronically. In these 26 states, the median  proportion of applications accessed, signed, and submitted electronically  was 25 percent. Only 11 states reported that the applications were  approved or denied electronically.", "We also asked all states about their efforts to streamline processing  through improved renewal procedures, and a number of states reported  implementing procedures to streamline the renewal application process  for adults and children since 2008. (See table 3.) Such efforts can help  limit interruptions in Medicaid coverage for beneficiaries. For children, the  streamlined procedures states most frequently reported using were   12-month renewal periods, as opposed to shorter renewal periods;  telephone or electronic renewals, or both, instead of in-person interviews;  and prepopulated renewal forms.most commonly reported efforts were 12-month renewal periods and  telephone or electronic renewal, or both, instead of in-person interviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Sheila K.
