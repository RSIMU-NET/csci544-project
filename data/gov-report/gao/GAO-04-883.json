State has not consistently recruited candidates suited for the leadership position of the MFO's civilian observer unit, which monitors and verifies the parties' compliance with the treaty. State also has not evaluated MFO's financial practices as required by State's guidelines because they lacked staff with expertise in this area. However, State recently formed an MFO management advisory board to improve its oversight of MFO operations. MFO has taken actions in recent years to improve its personnel system, financial accountability, and internal controls. For example, it has provided incentives to retain experienced staff and taken steps to standardize its performance appraisal system. It has received clean opinions on its annual financial statements and on special reviews of its internal controls. MFO has also controlled costs, reduced its military and civilian personnel levels, and kept its budget at $51 million since 1995, while meeting mission objectives and Treaty party expectations. MFO faces a number of personnel, management, and budgetary challenges. For example, leading practices suggest its employees' access to alternative dispute resolution mechanisms for discrimination complaints, and the gender imbalance in its workforce, could be issues of concern. Moreover, MFO lacks oversight from an audit committee or senior management review committee to ensure the independence of its external auditors. Finally, MFO's budget is likely to increase because of costs associated with replacing its antiquated helicopter fleet. U.S. and MFO efforts to obtain support from other contributors generally have not succeeded. Army, State, and MFO officials have yet to agree who should pay the increased costs associated with changes in the composition and pay scales of U.S. troops deployed at MFO."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following years of violent confrontation, Egypt and Israel signed a treaty  on March 26, 1979, that ended the existing state of war and agreed to the  withdrawal of all Israeli forces from the Sinai.

When the U.N. Security Council failed to  reach an agreement, the governments of Egypt and Israel signed a protocol  to the treaty in 1981 that established the Multinational Force and  Observers (MFO). The treaty can be terminated by the consent of the  parties; it does not contain a specific end date or establish specific  conditions that, if met, would allow MFO to withdraw troops. MFO  currently has 1,685 troops and a civilian workforce of about 108  international and local national staff who manage the organization and its  annual budget of $51 million. To manage its operations, the MFO has  developed personnel, financial management, budget, and internal control  systems.

We also estimated  the MFO\u2019s budget in constant international dollars because MFO  purchases goods and services in countries such as Egypt, Israel, and the  United States, where the U.S. dollar has different purchasing power.  Because similar goods are inexpensive in dollar terms when purchased in  Israel and Egypt as compared to the United States, the purchasing power  of MFO\u2019s budget was significantly greater when measured in constant 1995  international dollars. This figure was $72 million in fiscal year 1995 and  $69 million in fiscal year 2002.

This decline was partially offset  because MFO was able to reduce the economic impact of U.S. dollar  inflation by shifting more of its purchases to Egypt and Israel during this  period. MFO increased its purchases in Egypt and Israel from 43 percent  of its budget in 1995 to 54 percent in 2002 as measured in nominal U.S.  dollars.

The cost of supplying U.S.  troops to MFO has risen since fiscal year 1999, even though the number of  U.S. troops has declined (see figs. 6 and 7).

For example,  salaries have increased because beginning in 2002, National Guard troops  have been deployed instead of active duty soldiers. National Guard troops  tend to have been in grade longer than active duty soldiers and are  consequently paid more. The U.S. Army pays for the increases in troop  salaries.

Moreover, for each of the eight critical success factors, the model  describes three levels of progress in an agency\u2019s approach to strategic  human capital planning:    Level 1: The approach to human capital is largely compliance-based; the  agency has yet to realize the value of managing human capital strategically  to achieve results; existing human capital approaches have yet to be  assessed in light of current and emerging agency needs.", "Level 2: The agency recognizes that people are a critical asset that must be  managed strategically; new human capital policies, programs, and  practices are being designed and implemented to support mission  accomplishment.", "Level 3: The agency\u2019s human capital approaches contribute to improved  agency performance; human capital considerations are fully integrated  into strategic planning and day-to-day operations; the agency is  continuously seeking ways to further improve its \u201cpeople management\u201d to  achieve results.", "Figure 8 illustrates the critical success factors an organization in the  second level of progress must address as it develops a strategic approach  to managing its human capital."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data-Driven Human", "paragraphs": ["Individual performance  management integrated  with organizational goals;  and management held  accountable for achieving  these goals through use of  clearly defined,  transparent, and  consistently communicated  performance expectations 1.

The MFO\u2019s budget has remained flat at 51  million in nominal dollars between fiscal years 1995 and 2002, although it  has declined about 12 percent over the same period when adjusted for U.S.  inflation. However, MFO officials stated that they increased the  purchasing power of its budget by shifting its purchases of goods and  services away from the United States and other countries to relatively  lower cost Egyptian and Israeli markets. As figure 9 demonstrates, MFO  spending in Egypt and Israel rose from 43 to 54 percent of the budget  between fiscal years 1995 and 2002. On average, the MFO spent 26 percent  of its budget in Egypt and 23 percent in Israel in this period. By converting  the MFO\u2019s budget into international dollars, we are able to better assess  the impact of these shifts to the lower cost Egyptian and Israeli markets  on the overall purchasing power of the MFO budget.", "As table 2 demonstrates, expressing the MFO budget in international  dollars reveals that: (1) the purchasing power of the budget\u2014ranging  between $72.3 million in fiscal year 1995 and $69 million in fiscal year  2002\u2013was significantly higher than its nominal level of $51 million  suggests; and (2) the real decline in the budget between fiscal years 1995  and 2002 was about 5 percent rather than 12 percent.", "Moreover, figure 10 demonstrates that MFO purchased a larger proportion  of its goods and services in Egypt and Israel when calculated in  international dollars than the nominal-dollar budget expenditures  suggest\u201470 percent versus 54 percent for fiscal year 2002, for example.  Also, it purchased a significantly greater percentage of its budget in Egypt  than in Israel on average when calculated in international dollars during  this period\u201446 percent versus 18 percent on average.", "An international dollar is equivalent to the amount of goods and services  that 1 U.S. dollar can purchase in the United States. Two steps are required  to convert an amount valued in local currency into international dollars:    First, convert the local currency figure into U.S. dollars using the official    Second, divide this dollar amount by the country-specific purchasing  power parity (PPP) conversion factor to official exchange rate ratio.", "The PPP conversion factor converts into international dollars the cost of a  basket of tradable and nontradable goods and services valued in local  currency units (pounds in the case of Egypt and shekels in the case of  Israel). The PPP conversion factor is the number of local currency units  required to buy the same amount of goods and services in the domestic  market that a U.S. dollar would buy in the United States. For example, a  basket of goods that could be purchased in the United States for $1, equal  by definition to 1 international dollar, could be bought in Egypt for 1.259  Egyptian pounds in 1995. Therefore, the PPP conversion factor is 1.259  Egyptian pounds per international dollar. In calendar year 1995, the  official annual average exchange rate (based on monthly averages) was  3.392 Egyptian pounds per U.S. dollar. The ratio of the PPP conversion  factor to the official exchange rate is 0.371.

The Memoranda of Understandings between the  MFO and the Department of the Army established in 1994 and 1998  confirm additional understandings and procedures to supplement Annex II  of the 1982 Exchange of Letters.", "Under the terms of these cost-sharing arrangements, U.S. costs to support  the MFO has increased from a low of $55.8 million in fiscal year 1996 to  $70.8 million in fiscal year 2003 as depicted in table 3\u2014a 20 percent  increase overall. While State Department\u2019s contribution to the annual MFO  budget has averaged about $16 million since fiscal year 1995, the number  of U.S. military personnel participating in the MFO has declined 11 percent  since then, as depicted in table 4 below. However the cost of U.S. military  participation has risen approximately 25 percent between fiscal year 1996  and 2003.", "As depicted in table 3, a number of factors account for this increase in the  total cost of U.S. commitments to the MFO over this period:    Total troop salaries increased 27 percent, despite a decrease in the U.S.  troop contingent between fiscal years 1995 and 2002. These salaries  constitute over 80 percent of the cost of the total Army contribution. In FY  2002, the Army substituted Army National Guard forces for the regular  Army personnel, contributing to a salary cost increase of 12 percent  between fiscal years 2002 and 2003. National Guard troops tend to be older  and have been in grade longer than regular Army forces and are  consequently paid more. Across-the-board salary increases for all military  forces is another factor contributing to rising military costs, according to  Army officials.", "Special pay and allowances paid to U.S. soldiers participating in the MFO  mission have increased nearly ten-fold since fiscal year 1995, going from  about $300,000 to $3 million in fiscal year 2003. Under the March 1982  Exchange of Letters between the MFO Director General and the Secretary  of State, the MFO agreed to pay for certain special allowances to U.S.  military personnel participating in the MFO mission, including a Family  Separation Allowance for married personnel and Foreign Duty Pay for  enlisted personnel. The coverage and rates of these existing allowances  has been expanded since then to include both enlisted men and officers  and costs about $250 per soldier per month. Moreover, in fiscal year 1997,  DOD began providing imminent danger pay to military personnel serving  in Israel and Egypt. The current rate amounts to $225 per soldier per  month. In fiscal year 2003, the imminent danger pay allowance constituted  78 percent of total DOD special pays provided to military personnel  participating in the MFO.", "Reimbursement payments from DOD to the MFO increased 13 percent.", "Currently, the U.S. Army provides the MFO a credit or \u201coffset\u201d for certain  costs associated with the support of U.S. forces.
