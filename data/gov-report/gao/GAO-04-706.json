The Chairmen of the House Committee on Government Reform and its Subcommittee on Technology, Information Policy, Intergovernmental Relations and the Census requested that GAO assess the (1) reported status of 24 selected agencies in performing effective patch management practices, (2) patch management tools and services available to federal agencies, (3) challenges to performing patch management, and (4) additional steps that can be taken to mitigate the risks created by software vulnerabilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Based on agency-reported data, agencies generally are implementing important common practices for effective patch management, such as performing systems inventories and providing information security training. However, they are not consistently performing others, such as risk assessments and testing all patches before deployment. Additional information on key aspects of agencies' patch management practices--such as their documentation of patch management policies and procedures and the frequency with which systems are monitored to ensure that patches are installed--could provide OMB, Congress, and agencies themselves with consistent data that could better enable an assessment of the effectiveness of an agency's patch management processes. Several automated tools and services are available to assist agencies in performing patch management. These tools and services typically include a wide range of functionality, including methods to inventory computers, identify relevant patches and workarounds, test patches, and report network status information to various levels of management. A centralized resource could provide agencies with selected services such as the testing of patches, a patch management training curriculum, and development of criteria for patch management tools and services. A governmentwide service could lower costs to--and resource requirements of--individual agencies, while facilitating their implementation of selected patch management practices. Agencies face several challenges to implement effective patch management practices, including (1) quickly installing patches while implementing effective patch management practices, (2) patching heterogeneous systems, (3) ensuring that mobile systems receive the latest patches, (4) avoiding unacceptable downtime when patching high-availability systems, and (5) dedicating sufficient resources toward patch management. Agency officials and computer security experts identified a number of additional steps that can be taken by vendors, the security community, and the federal government to assist agencies in mitigating the risks created by software vulnerabilities. For example, more rigorous software engineering practices by software vendors could reduce the number of software vulnerabilities and the need for patches. In addition, the research and development of more capable technologies could help secure information systems against cyber attacks. Also, the federal government could use its substantial purchasing power to influence software vendors to deliver more secure systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies rely extensively on computerized information systems  and their software to carry out their missions.

Attacks  can be launched against specific targets or widely distributed through  viruses and worms.", "The sophistication and effectiveness of cyber attacks have steadily  advanced. According to security researchers, reverse-engineering patches  have become a leading method for exploiting vulnerabilities. Reverse  engineering starts by locating the files or code that changed when a patch  was installed. Then, by comparing the patched and unpatched versions of  those files, a hacker can examine the specific functions that changed,  uncover the vulnerability, and exploit it. By using the same tools used by  programmers to analyze malicious code and perform vulnerability  research, hackers can locate the vulnerable code in unpatched software  and build to exploit it.", "According to NIST, every month skilled hackers post 30 to 40 new attack  tools to the Internet for others to download, allowing them to launch  attacks. Further, CERT/CC has noted that attacks that once took weeks or  months to propagate over the Internet now take just hours, or even  minutes. In 2001, security researchers reported that the Code Red worm  achieved an infection rate of more than 20,000 systems within 10 minutes,  foreshadowing more damaging and devastating attacks. In 2003, the  Slammer worm, which successfully attacked at least 75,000 systems,  reportedly became the fastest computer worm in history, infecting more  than 90 percent of vulnerable systems within 10 minutes.

When a virus or worm is reported that  exploits a vulnerability, virus-detection software vendors also participate in  the process. When a software vendor is made aware of a vulnerability in its  product, the vendor typically first validates that the vulnerability indeed  exists. If the vulnerability is deemed critical, the vendor may convene a  group of experts, including major clients and key incident-response groups  such as FedCIRC and CERT/CC, to discuss and plan remediation and  response efforts. In addition, FedCIRC may conduct teleconferences with  agency Chief Information Officers (CIO) to coordinate remediation and  OMB, through FedCIRC, may request the status of agencies\u2019 remediation  activities for selected vulnerabilities.

In addition, we  interviewed private-sector and federal officials about their patch  management experiences and practices. We then developed a series of  questions that were incorporated into a Web-based survey instrument. We  pretested our survey instrument at one federal department, one component  agency, and internally at GAO through our Chief Information Officer\u2019s  office. We also corresponded with OMB to obtain and discuss the process  for their data call of the Microsoft RPC and Cisco IOS vulnerabilities. For  each agency to be surveyed, we identified the CIO office and notified each  of our work and distributed a link to access the web-based survey  instrument to each via e-mail. In addition, we discussed the purpose and  content of the survey instrument with agency officials when requested. All  24 agencies responded to our survey. We did not verify the accuracy of the  agencies\u2019 responses; however, we reviewed supporting documentation that  agencies provided to validate their responses. We contacted agency  officials when necessary for follow up. We then analyzed agency responses  to determine the extent to which agencies were performing patch  management practices.", "Although this was not a sample survey and, therefore, there were no  sampling errors, conducting any survey may introduce errors, commonly  referred to as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in how a  particular question is interpreted, in the sources of information that are  available to respondents, or in how the data are entered into a database or  were analyzed can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results.  We took steps in the development of the survey instrument, the data  collection, and the data analysis to minimize these nonsampling errors. For  example, a survey specialist designed the survey instrument in  collaboration with GAO staff with subject-matter expertise. Then, as stated  earlier, it was pretested to ensure that the questions were relevant, clearly  stated, and easy to comprehend. When the data were analyzed, a second,  independent analyst checked all computer programs. Because this was a  Web-based survey, respondents entered their answers directly into the  electronic questionnaire. This eliminated the need to have the data keyed  into a database, thus removing an additional potential source of error.", "To determine the tools and services available to federal agencies to  perform patch management, we interviewed patch management software  and service vendors as well as computer-security experts to discuss and  examine their products\u2019 functions and capabilities. We also conducted  literature searches and reviewed available documentation. We interviewed  FedCIRC officials to discuss their experiences with PADC and other tools  and services available to agencies. In addition, questions regarding patch  management tools and services were included in the survey we sent to the  23 CFO agencies and to DHS. Finally, we discussed with agencies the  capabilities and limitations of the specific tools and services they utilized.", "Finally, to determine the challenges to performing patch management and  the additional steps that can be taken to mitigate the risks created by  software vulnerabilities, we reviewed professional information technology  security literature, examined available commercial software patch  management tools and services, and solicited agencies\u2019 input on patch  management challenges in our survey. We also interviewed relevant federal  and private-sector officials and computer security experts. Finally, we  reviewed reports prepared by the National Cyber Security Partnership  subgroups tasked with identifying patch management challenges and  developing recommendations.", "We conducted our work in Washington, D.C., Charlotte, N.C., and  Schaumburg, Ill., from September 2003 through May 2004, in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Key contributors to this report were Michael Fruitman, Elizabeth Johnston,  Stuart Kaufman, Anjalique Lawrence, Min Lee, David Noone, and Tracy  Pierson."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government  for the American people.
