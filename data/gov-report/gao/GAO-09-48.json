In 2007, State reported the U.S. contractor pool for building NECs had reached its limit and proposed legislation to amend the criteria to qualify for NEC awards. GAO was asked to examine (1) how contractor participation in the NEC program changed in recent years, (2) the degree to which State assessed the need for and potential outcomes of its proposed amendment, (3) factors contractors consider when deciding to participate in the program, and (4) actions State has taken to address reported declines in contractor participation. GAO examined two indicators of contractor participation; reviewed State documents and proposed legislation; and interviewed State officials and U.S. firms that won NEC awards from 2001-2007."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State received at least two bids--the legislatively specified minimum for adequate competition--for 60 of the 61 NEC projects it awarded from 1999-2008, and received three or more bids for at least 49 of the 61. Nonetheless, there was a statistically significant decline in the number of bids per NEC project from 2002 to 2008. GAO also found that the number of firms prequalified to bid on NEC projects also declined during this period. While many factors could affect contractor participation, GAO found the declines in the number of prequalifying firms and bids received were due, in part, to rising construction costs, which made it more difficult for some firms to meet qualification criteria. In addition, officials from five firms cited insufficient profits and State management practices as reasons for their recent withdrawals from the program. State has not systematically assessed the need for, or the possible outcomes of, its legislative proposal that would open competition for NEC awards to construction firms that cannot meet current qualification criteria. Although State identified several factors it believed reduced contractor participation, it has not assessed whether a sufficient number of contractors capable of meeting current requirements exists or how its legislative proposal would affect the NEC program. Specifically, State has not assessed the potential benefits or identified the potential risks of its legislative proposal, and has not stated how the risks would be mitigated. Absent these analyses, it is unclear whether the proposed amendment, including its December 2008 revision, would benefit State's embassy construction program. Contractors interviewed by GAO cited various incentives and challenges that affected their decision to participate in the NEC program. Although making profits was cited as the primary incentive for participating, contractors reported losing money on 42 percent of the contracts they performed. Contractors also cited several significant challenges that affected their decisions to submit contract proposals, including meeting State's shortened construction schedules, supplying labor and material to remote locations, finding and retaining cleared American workers, managing financial constraints, and dealing with foreign governments. Firms also expressed concerns with State's processes, including unclear solicitation documents and contract requirements, laborious design reviews, and State's 2001 decision to end formal partnering relationships with contractors. State has made several recent efforts to encourage contractors' participation in the NEC program. State has begun new outreach efforts to improve relations with contractors, and undertaken several changes to its management practices and organizational structures, including lengthening project schedules, improving clarity of contract requirements, and establishing a project management group to provide coordination and oversight throughout each phase of a project. While these changes address some contractor complaints, their full effects may not be apparent for a number of years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the 1998 terrorist bombings of the U.S. Embassies in Nairobi,  Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, which killed 220 people and injured  thousands more, the Department of State (State) began an unprecedented  effort to replace more than 180 overseas diplomatic facilities. From 1999- 2008, State awarded contracts worth approximately $5.8 billion to  construct new embassy and consulate compounds (NEC) and diplomatic  annexes at 79 overseas posts, with the majority of these facilities being  built under management and construction reforms first implemented in  2001. State reported that, as of December 2008, it had constructed 64 new  embassies, consulates, and annexes; had another 31 projects under way;  plans to construct 90 more facilities from 2009 to 2023; and, after 2023,  would need to replace facilities at approximately 50 overseas posts.  However, in the summer of 2007, State\u2019s Bureau of Overseas Buildings  Operations (OBO) told several congressional committees that the current  pool of American contractors qualified and able to carry out diplomatic  construction projects overseas had nearly reached its capacity and that the  subsequent reduced competition for contracts would result in increased  contract costs. To increase competition for NEC contracts, State proposed  legislation to amend the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism  Act of 1986 to give State the discretion to allow more participation by  construction firms which currently cannot meet the qualifying criteria for  NEC awards.", "At your request, this report addresses the status of the contractor base for  State\u2019s embassy construction program, including: (1) how contractor  participation in the NEC program has changed in recent years, (2) the  degree to which State has assessed the need for or potential outcomes of  its proposed amendment to the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and  Antiterrorism Act of 1986, (3) factors that affect contractors\u2019 decisions to  participate in the program, and (4) actions State has taken to address the  reported decline in the number of contractors willing to participate in the  program.", "To complete our review, we examined two indicators of contractor  participation in the NEC program: (1) the number of companies  prequalifying to bid on projects per year from 2002-2008 and (2) the  number of firms that submitted bids on NEC projects from 2002-2008.  These two indicators help to measure contractors\u2019 willingness to  participate in State\u2019s program since both prequalifying for and bidding on  contracts require active efforts on the contractor\u2019s part. We also reviewed  State\u2019s proposed amendment to the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and  Antiterrorism Act of 1986, reviewed documents and interviewed State  officials on analyses the agency conducted in support of the proposed  amendment, and researched ongoing overseas construction operations of  the 100 largest U.S. design-build construction firms. We determined that  the data used to complete these analyses were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. To determine factors affecting contractors\u2019 decisions to  participate in the program, we completed structured interviews with 17  U.S. contractors awarded NEC or diplomatic annex construction contracts  from 2001 to 2007 to obtain information about State\u2019s construction process  and the incentives that encourage contractors to participate in the  program. These contractors had completed, or were in the process of  completing, a total of 78 separate construction contracts valued at  approximately $4 billion dollars. Finally, to assess actions State has taken  to expand its NEC contractor base, we reviewed (1) reports on State\u2019s  embassy construction program issued by GAO and State\u2019s Office of the  Inspector General; (2) OBO\u2019s past six annual Long-Range Overseas  Buildings Plans; (3) relevant laws and regulations, including the Omnibus  Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, federal acquisition  regulations, and State reports and decision memos; and (4) delivery  methods and partnering policies employed by other federal agencies and  supported by leading industry groups. We also attended OBO\u2019s quarterly  Industry Advisory Panel meetings, met with State staff familiar with  contracting and construction processes, and spoke with representatives of  the Associated General Contractors of America and the American Council  of Engineering Companies. This report does not contain all of the  responses to our interview questions. The full responses to our questions  can be viewed at GAO-09-47SP.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2007 to January 2009,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

On August 7, 1998, terrorist bombings of the U.S.  embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, killed 220  people and injured thousands more. Subsequent investigations into these  attacks and on the conditions of U.S. overseas facilities determined that  U.S. embassies and consulates worldwide were insecure, unsafe,  overcrowded, deteriorating, and \u201cshockingly shabby.\u201d Unless security  vulnerabilities were addressed, employees and the public using these  facilities would remain at risk of terrorist attacks.", "In the wake of these reports, State embarked on an unprecedented effort  to construct diplomatic facilities at 214 overseas posts. The goal of this  effort is to replace insecure, dilapidated, and dysfunctional embassies,  consulates, and other overseas diplomatic office buildings with safe,  secure, functional, and modern facilities as quickly as possible. As of  December 2008, OBO had completed construction for 64 new embassies,  consulates, and annexes and had relocated more than 19,500 U.S.  employees into these new facilities. State has 31 additional ongoing  construction contracts for new facilities and plans to build approximately  90 more facilities from 2009 to 2023. Beyond this effort, State officials said  that after 2023, OBO would need to replace facilities at approximately 50  posts.

However, due to systemic weaknesses in  program management, as well as subsequent funding limitations, State  completed only 24 of the 57 construction projects planned under the  Inman program. Following the demise of the Inman program in the early  1990s, State initiated very few new construction projects, until the 1998  embassy bombings in Africa prompted additional funding for security  upgrades and the construction of secure embassies and consulates.", "In response to the performance problems experienced under the Inman  program, State implemented numerous reforms to its management  structure and contracting, planning, and construction processes. These  reforms were designed to speed completion of projects, reduce costs, and  standardize processes, and they had the cumulative effect of reducing the  average construction cycle time by 2 years and 9 months. Among the  most prominent reforms were    elevating the former Office of Foreign Buildings Operations to OBO; relying on the design-build delivery method, which reduces the number of  solicitation, proposal, and award processes from two to one and allows  contractors to begin basic construction before the design process is  completed;    convening the Industry Advisory Panel on a quarterly basis to advise OBO  on industry best practices in the construction sector; and    holding an annual industry day event to solicit a broader pool of  contractors.", "Starting in 2002, OBO also implemented the Standard Embassy Design  (SED) to expedite the planning, awarding, design, and construction of  NECs. The SED is a series of documents that outline site and building  plans, specifications, and design criteria, and explain how to adapt these  specifications to a particular project and contract requirements. The SED  is not an actual building design but rather a template that standardizes the  basic plans for the structural, spatial, safety, and security requirements for  each NEC, including the following:     main office buildings and annexes;    security features, such as the Compound Access Control (CAC) buildings    utility buildings, warehouses, and General Services annex;  living quarters for Marine Security Guards (MSGQ); and    employee and visitor parking.", "The SED also identifies ways to allow for future building expansion on the  site; establishes minimum permissible baseline standards for materials and  interior finishes; and factors in environmental concerns such as  temperature, humidity, dust, rain, and air quality when designing and  selecting mechanical equipment. Figure 1 shows the general features for a  standard design NEC.", "Since 2002, there have been three primary classes of standard design  embassy and consulate compounds\u2014small, medium, and large\u2014based on  the size and cost of the facility, each of which have predefined  construction schedules and total project durations associated with them.   In 2004, State introduced a fourth class of SED, called Extra Large or  Special SEDs, which generally exceed the size and cost of large SEDs.  Finally, in 2007, State introduced the Standard Secure Mini Compound,  which is generally smaller and less costly than a small SED. In addition,  OBO has developed standard designs for MSGQs, and stand-alone  unclassified annexes.

The act defines adequate  competition as the presence of two or more qualified bidders submitting  responsive bids for a specific project. In this context, a U.S. person is  defined, in part, as a company that  is incorporated or legally organized under the laws of the United States;    has its principal place of business in the United States;   has performed within the United States or at a U.S. diplomatic or consular  establishment abroad administrative and technical, professional, or  construction services similar in complexity, type, and value to the project  being bid;    has total business volume equal to or greater than the value of the project  being bid in 3 years of the 5-year period before the specified date;    employs U.S. citizens (1) in at least 80 percent of its principal management  positions in the United States and (2) in more than half of its permanent,  full-time positions in the United States;     will employ U.S. citizens in at least 80 percent of the supervisory positions  on the project site; and    has the existing technical and financial resources in the United States to  perform the contract.", "Contracts for construction projects that do not involve technical security  requirements may be awarded to foreign firms.

When proposing the amendment, State argued that  amending the law would increase competition for NEC awards by opening  the contractor pool to smaller U.S. construction companies and to foreign  companies that previously could not qualify for NEC projects. Congress  did not act on the proposed amendment.

In the first phase, the prequalification of offerors, contractors  submit documentation attesting how they meet the legal, technical, and  financial qualifications for each project on which they wish to bid. State  then reviews this documentation to certify whether contractors do, in fact,  meet the criteria. Once State completes these reviews, it issues a list of  contractors eligible to bid for each contract award. Only companies that  State certifies as prequalified under the first phase receive, and may  respond to, subsequent requests for proposals (RFP) for major  construction awards. In the second phase, RFPs, State solicits and  evaluates contractors\u2019 bids for construction awards, including technical  and price proposals. Contractors bid a firm, fixed price for a project;  therefore, the winning contractor will deliver the defined scope of the  project for the price of the contract.", "After State awards a design-build contract, the contractor must develop a  project design and work plan that incorporates all construction and  security features outlined in the RFP and contract documents. During this  design phase, the contractor must also begin preparing for construction by  obtaining local building permits, buying or ordering materials, and  mobilizing workers. In addition, under the design-build delivery method,  contractors can begin construction of some buildings and systems that do  not require security clearances\u2014such as perimeter walls, warehouses, and  mechanical support buildings\u2014before the full design is approved.  However, construction of the main office building\u2014the chancery or  consulate\u2014generally does not proceed until the design is approved and  State certifies to Congress that it meets all security requirements. During  the construction phase, OBO monitors contractors\u2019 schedules, inspects  and reviews contractors\u2019 work, and certifies that construction is  substantially complete once contractors meet all requirements of the  contract. Once construction is certified as being substantially complete,  State conducts final commissioning to ensure that building systems\u2014such  as fire protection, electrical, and mechanical\u2014were installed properly and  operate according to design criteria and manufacturer specifications. Once  all systems pass the commissioning process, the building is certified to be  occupied and post staff may move in."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Reports That NEC Costs Are Rising", "paragraphs": ["In September 2008, State reported that construction costs had increased  dramatically since 2001 and that the trend was likely to continue.

In an earlier analysis, State attributed the  overall cost increases to two factors: inflation for construction materials  and the decrease in the value of the dollar. State reported that, overall,  prices for construction materials rose 44 percent from December 2003 to  July 2008. In addition, State reported that the significant decline in the  value of the dollar resulted in additional construction-cost increases of  approximately 2 percent per year since 2003."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Has Generally Met the Adequate Competition Requirement for Awarding NEC Contracts, but the Level of Contractor Participation Has Declined", "paragraphs": ["Although State has generally received at least two bids for NEC projects  since 1999, which meets the adequate competition clause, the number of  contractors participating in the State\u2019s program has declined. State  documents show, and State officials reported, that from 1999 to 2008, the  department received at least two bids for all but one of the 61 NEC  projects awarded through a competitive process, and three or more bids  for at least 49 of the 61 awards. Table 2 shows the number of firms  prequalifying to bid on NEC projects and the number of bids submitted for  each NEC project from 2002 to 2008. Despite having adequate  competition for all but one NEC award, we found a statistically significant  decline in the number of bids State received per NEC contract from 2002  to 2008. We also found that the number of firms per project prequalified to  bid also declined during that period. These results demonstrate that the  level of contractor participation in the NEC program has declined.", "In addition, from 2002 to 2008, noticeable fluctuations occurred in both the  annual average numbers of firms per project that prequalified to bid on  NECs and bids received. From 2002 to 2005, the annual average number of  firms that prequalified to bid ranged from approximately 6 to  approximately 8 (see table 2). In 2006, the average increased to more than  13, then declined by 69 percent to about 4 in 2008. The average number of  bids submitted per project from 2002 to 2005 ranged from 3.5 to  approximately 4, increased to 5 bids per project in 2006, then decreased by  38 percent, to approximately 3 bids per project in 2008.", "Although the declines in contractor participation can be attributed to  many factors, we found that project costs partly explained the declines. In  statistical analyses, we found that State\u2019s estimated NEC project cost is a  strong predictor of the actual number of firms that prequalify to bid on  projects, such that higher estimated costs result in fewer prequalifying  firms and lower estimated costs result in more prequalifying firms. We also  found that the actual number of prequalifying firms per project showed a  strong positive correlation with the number of bids submitted per project.  Thus, estimated project costs directly affect the number of prequalifying  firms and indirectly affect the number of bids submitted.", "To illustrate these relationships, we compared the annual average  estimated costs for NECs with the annual average numbers of  prequalifying firms and bids submitted. As noted previously, State  reported that NEC costs have more than doubled from 2001 to 2008.", "Although there were yearly variations between 2002 and 2005 in the  average estimated costs for NECs and the average numbers of  prequalifying firms and bids submitted, the changes during these years  were not large. However, from 2005 to 2006, the average estimated costs  for NECs declined by 28 percent from $69 million to $50 million. Because  the financial criteria in 2006 were lower than in 2005, it was easier for  firms to demonstrate the capacity to meet those requirements. As a result,  the number of prequalifying firms per project rose from approximately 7 in  2005 to more than 13 in 2006, and the number of bids per project increased  from 3.7 to 5. However, from 2006 to 2008, the average estimated NEC  project cost more than doubled, rising to approximately $110 million per  project. This increase made it more difficult for firms to meet the financial  requirements to bid for and win NEC awards. As a result, fewer firms  prequalified for and bid on NEC projects in those years.", "The profitability of NEC projects for contractors and State\u2019s overall  management of the NEC program may also have affected contractor  participation, particularly in recent years. For example, the decline in the  prequalification rate also reflects five firms, which, combined, built a total  of 27 embassies, consulates, and annexes for a total value of $1.63 billion,  withdrawing from the NEC program from 2006 to 2008. Although each of  these five firms prequalified to bid on NECs in 2005, none of them chose to  prequalify for 2008 projects, with one company withdrawing in 2006, two  in 2007, and the remaining two in 2008. Officials from these companies  cited insufficient profits and disagreements with State\u2019s management of  the program as factors contributing to decisions to withdraw. However,  three of the firms indicated they would consider participating in future  years but would base such decisions on the resolution of outstanding  issues with current and past contracts and State\u2019s willingness to reform its  management practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Has Not Systematically Assessed the Need for or Possible Outcomes of Its Legislative Proposal", "paragraphs": ["State has conducted no systematic analyses in support of its proposed  amendment to the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of  1986, including whether such legislative changes are needed to maintain  an adequate contractor base or how such changes would affect the  program. Although State asserts that the declining contractor base has  created a less competitive and less cost-effective program, the department  reported no systematic efforts to analyze the relationship between  competition for NEC contracts and actual contract awards. State officials  did report that from 1999-2008, the department received at least two  bids\u2014the legislatively defined minimum number for adequate  competition\u2014for all but one NEC project solicited as an open  competition. However, they did not comment on whether this minimum  standard was sufficient to receive optimal prices for the government.", "In support of its initial legislative proposal, in October 2007, State  identified several factors that it believed discouraged contractors from  participating in the program, including: (1) working with State was not as  profitable as working with private companies or with other federal  agencies, (2) the challenging and sometimes dangerous locations of NEC  projects, (3) the high cost of skilled American workers with security  clearances, (4) dissatisfaction with firm fixed-price contracts for NECs,  and (5) the relatively abundant domestic construction market. However,  State did not provide any detailed analyses in support of these  conclusions.", "State\u2019s initial legislative proposal indicates that the number of U.S.  companies capable of meeting the current requirements to qualify for NEC  awards is nearing capacity. However, State has not systematically  analyzed the extent to which the U.S. contractor community can meet  these requirements. Therefore, we reviewed the degree to which some of  the largest U.S. construction companies have participated in the NEC  program. We compared the list of the top 100 U.S. design-build firms for  2008 compiled by Engineering News Record with the list of firms that  have either prequalified for or won NEC awards since 2002.  The ranking  is based on companies\u2019 total 2007 revenues from design-build contracts  where the projects were designed and constructed by employees of the  company in whole or in joint-venture partnership with other firms and  subcontractors. The total revenues for these firms ranged from $104  million to $11.2 billion.", "We found that only 14 of the top 100 companies prequalified for NECs in at  least one year from 2002-2008, and only 7 won at least one NEC award. In  addition, only 3 of the top 100 companies prequalified for 2008 NEC  projects\u2014B.L. Harbert International, LLC; Caddell Construction Co. Inc.;  and Weston Solutions Inc.  While not all of the 100 companies may be  interested in pursuing overseas construction, some firms not currently  engaged in the NEC program are capable of working in overseas locations.  For example, the top 100 list shows that 34 of the 100 firms derived  income from overseas construction contracts. Ten of these 34 firms  prequalified to bid on at least one occasion from 2002-2008, and two of  these 34 firms prequalified to bid for 2008 NEC projects.", "In addition, we examined company Web sites and conducted Lexis-Nexis  searches to determine the extent to which companies listed among the top  100 design-builders for 2008 and that have never won NEC awards have  experience in countries where State plans to build NECs in 2009. We  found that at least 16 of the 93 companies that have not received NEC  contracts under the current program have ongoing operations in eight of  the nine locations planned for 2009 (see table 3). However, none of those  16 companies prequalified to bid on State\u2019s 2008 projects, and only two of  those companies prequalified for projects in past years.", "A greater reliance on foreign firms, as specified in State\u2019s 2007 legislative  proposal, could increase security risks for NECs. Currently, foreign  companies may not bid on projects that involve technical security unless it  involves only low-level technology. State\u2019s initial legislative proposal  would provide the Secretary with discretion to waive the preference for  U.S. contractors so long as the Secretary determined that it is more  economical or efficient to do so and that the security of the project would  not be compromised in doing so. However, State has not yet reported how  it would ensure project security would not be compromised, including  providing a clear explanation of how the controlled access areas would be  securely constructed and identifying the additional safeguards needed to  oversee construction.", "Finally, amending the requirements to allow greater access to small U.S.  companies and foreign companies could also affect construction  management on site. However, because small firms may not have the  technical capacity to construct all facets of NECs and, because foreign  firms cannot currently construct controlled access areas of embassies and  consulates, it is unclear how construction of highly technical areas would  be accomplished. Although State has not yet determined how to resolve  these items, it could choose to award multiple contracts to complete  targeted areas of work. State has taken an approach somewhat similar to  this for some NEC contracts, to date, by awarding small projects, primarily  annexes, to small U.S. and foreign construction firms, which sometimes  proceed simultaneously with a larger NEC project previously awarded to  other companies. State has also awarded separate contracts to construct  unclassified and classified areas of some NECs, such as for the Baghdad,  Iraq, and Suva, Fiji, embassies. OBO officials noted that this multiple  contracting is inefficient and leads to frequent conflicts between  contractors over precedence of work. Relying on small contractors in a  similar approach, with multiple contracts, to complete a typical NEC  project may multiply these problems, and State has not yet reported how it  would mitigate this concern.", "In December 2008, State informed us that it has drafted a revised  legislative proposal to allow for more U.S. firms to qualify as U.S. persons,  noting that all U.S. companies that can meet the specified security  requirements should be permitted to bid for and win NEC contracts. In  addition, State said that it would no longer pursue greater access to NEC  contracts for foreign firms. State\u2019s revised proposal would, in effect, open  competition for NEC awards to smaller U.S. firms. However, according to  State officials, the projects planned through the remainder of the program  are expected to be more complex and more costly, in general, than the  projects awarded to date. Given that State\u2019s experience with multiple  contractors working independently at a construction site has not worked  well, it is unclear how State could increase smaller firms\u2019 participation  without significantly increasing the government\u2019s risk.

As previously discussed, some contractors  said that they expended comparatively more time completing a design for  State and having it certified for construction than on a design for other  owners\u2019 projects, which precluded them from beginning construction as  early as they wanted and prevented State from fully realizing the time- saving potential of design-build delivery.", "In its revised approach, State will use the \u201cbridging\u201d design method to  provide more focused design detail to construction contractors.

Under the  bridging method, State would first contract with a design firm\u2014referred to  as either the bridging architect, criteria architect, or the owner\u2019s design  consultant\u2014to develop an initial design that incorporates critical  requirements and that can be certified for construction.

For example, State might negotiate  waiving or reducing liquidated damages that it could assess for a  contractor\u2019s late completion in exchange for the contractor withdrawing  its REA.

Under the former organizational structure, project  executives responsible for construction and commissioning were not  heavily involved in planning efforts conducted by planning managers.  Similarly, planning managers who typically spent at least a year developing  project requirements prior to the contract award were normally not  involved in design and construction oversight efforts managed by project  executives. As a result, no one in OBO maintained comprehensive  knowledge of a project from start to finish, which may have contributed to  accountability gaps when a project passed from one office to the next.", "The new project management group, the Project Development and  Coordination (PDC) Division, resides within the Office of Program  Development, Coordination, and Support\u2014formerly called the Office of  Project Execution.

During the  construction phase, project managers will coordinate with construction  executives from the Office of Construction, Commissioning, and  Maintenance to support on-site project directors in administering NEC  construction contracts. The working group noted that during construction  the three individuals\u2014project director, project manager, and construction  executive\u2014must have clearly defined roles that are properly coordinated  to avoid confusion and to ensure that resources are being used efficiently.  Under the new organizational structure, the project director is State\u2019s on- site representative who routinely interfaces with the contractor and serves  in the key role of contracting officer\u2019s representative. The construction  executive is the Washington-based focal point for all communications  from the project director and performs key functions, such as serving as  the alternate COR, and processing invoices and project change requests.  At the same time, the project manager serves as leader of the Washington- based team and is responsible for tasks such as leading integrated design  reviews; managing contract documents; and, in conjunction with the  construction executive, reporting to senior management on project  performance at monthly review meetings.

In 2007, State concluded that \u201cthe current pool of American contractors  qualified and able to carry out diplomatic construction projects overseas  has nearly reached its capacity.\u201d In 2007, State proposed amendments to  the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986 that would  allow smaller U.S. companies and foreign companies to compete for  projects for which they currently would not qualify. Congress did not act  on the proposed amendment. In December 2008, State indicated it would  modify that proposal to extend greater opportunities only to U.S.  construction firms that currently cannot meet the U.S. persons definition.  However, State has completed no systematic analysis in support of its  conclusion and legislative proposal, including assessments of the  significance and cause of changes in contractor willingness to participate  in the NEC program, how these changes have affected its construction  program, how its proposed amendments would address those causes and  effects, the risks associated with its proposed amendments, or how it  would mitigate those risks.

First, increasing construction costs have made it  more difficult for some firms to qualify for awards. Second, contractors  reported that State management and construction processes undermine  their ability to turn a profit, which is their primary incentive for  participating in the program. State has recently implemented a number of  changes to its management of the NEC program by improving  communications with the contractor community, refining some of its  management practices by implementing process reforms and mitigating  some of the risks associated with NEC projects, and reorganizing its  management structure. These efforts are designed to improve State\u2019s  overall management of the NEC program, including increasing the number  of firms willing to participate in the program, and they address some of the  important factors contractors reported as affecting their decisions to  participate in the NEC program.

State also said that since full and open competition is a  central principle for federal acquisitions, a cost-benefit analysis is  unnecessary. We disagree with State\u2019s view. State initiated a process to  revise the qualifying criteria for NEC awards, but it has provided no  compelling analytical support for why the criteria should be amended,  how such an amendment would be implemented, the expected benefits  and potential risks associated with the changes, or how any identified  risks would be mitigated.

Collectively,  we refer to this class of projects as NECs. Data for prequalifying firms  were derived from the Department of State\u2019s (State) Office of Logistics  Management and were cross-referenced with prequalification records  derived from the Federal Business Opportunities Web site  (http://www.fbo.gov). Data for the number of bids were also derived from  State\u2019s Office of Logistics Management and, to the extent possible, were  corroborated with contract information and State analyses obtained  during previous GAO work. In cases where discrepancies occurred  between the two sources, or where we could not confirm the data, we  used the data provided by State. Data for the number of prequalifying  firms and number of bids submitted for all 10 NECs awarded from 1999 to  2001, as well as for three projects from 2002 onward, were unavailable;  thus, they were excluded from the analyses. Non-NEC projects, including  those labeled by State as interim office buildings (IOB), newly acquired  buildings (NAB), new office annexes (NOX), and Standard Secure Mini  Compounds (SSMC), were also excluded from the analyses. Table 2 shows  the NEC projects included in our analyses, and the numbers of  prequalifying firms and bids submitted for each NEC award (see page 16 of  this report). We determined that these data on the numbers of  prequalifying firms and bids received were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To determine how contractor participation has changed over time, we  tracked the variations in the yearly average number of firms per project  that prequalified to bid for NECs and the yearly average number of bids  submitted per NEC project. We also compared these averages with the  yearly average estimated NEC project costs. Data for estimated costs  derive from two sources. For fiscal years 2005 to 2008, the estimated costs  for NECs derived from notices of solicitations for contractors to submit  prequalification packages. In cases where a range was provided for the  estimated cost, we used the maximum estimated value for our analysis.  Estimated costs for 2002 to 2004 were calculated based on (1) a 2005 OBO  analysis of variances between contractor bid prices and the government  estimated prices for each NEC project and (2) the actual original value of  the contract award. We determined that these cost data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "We also developed two regression models to understand the factors that  influence contractor participation. Each model was based on the  individual NEC contracts (NEC, NOB, and NCC) that were awarded from  2002 to 2008 (see table 2 on page 16 of this report). The first model used  fiscal year and estimated project cost as independent variables to predict  the number of firms that prequalify to bid per NEC project. We found a  statistically significant inverse relationship between the estimated NEC  project cost and the number of prequalifying firms (coefficient   estimate = -0.09, p-value = 0.000), such that higher estimated costs result in  fewer prequalifying firms, and lower estimated costs result in more  prequalifying firms. However, the relationship between fiscal year and the  number of prequalifying firms was not statistically significant (coefficient  estimate = 0.34, p-value = 0.108). In the second model, we used the fiscal  year and the number of prequalifying firms for each NEC project as  dependent variables to predict the number of bids received per NEC  project. We found a statistically significant inverse relationship between  fiscal year and the number of bids per project (coefficient estimate = -0.19,  p-value = 0.020), such that the number of bids per NEC project declined  significantly from 2002 to 2008. We also found that the number of  prequalifying firms per project are significant predictors of the number of  bids received (coefficient estimate = 0.18, p-value = 0.002), such that more  bids are received when more firms prequalify to do so. In our modeling,  we considered statistical significance to help specify the variables to  include in our models.", "To address the second objective\u2014the degree to which State has assessed  the need for or potential outcomes of its proposed amendment to the  Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986\u2014we reviewed  State documents on legal requirements to qualify for NEC awards, State\u2019s  proposed amendments to these legal requirements, and State\u2019s contract  solicitation and award processes. We also conducted interviews with State  staff on the level of analyses State completed in support of the proposed  amendment, the likely benefits that would be gained, how risks to the  government would change, and how those risks would be mitigated. To  test State\u2019s assertion that sufficient capacity no longer exists among the  U.S. contractor base to complete NEC awards, we compared the extent to  which firms listed by Engineering News Record (ENR) in its compilation  of the top 100 U.S. design-build firms for 2008 had prequalified for NEC  awards from 2002 to 2008, and received awards from 2002 to 2008. The  top 100 list is determined by ranking companies\u2019 total 2007 revenues  derived from design-build contracts where those construction projects are  designed and built by its own workforce or in conjunction with joint- venture partners and subcontractors. We also searched Web sites of, and  conducted Lexis-Nexis searches on, the top 100 companies to determine  whether these firms have ongoing operations in countries where State\u2019s  Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) plans to build NECs in  2009, as listed in OBO\u2019s Long-Range Overseas Buildings Plan, FY 2008- 2013. Underlying these analyses is our assumption that the companies on  this list could meet at least the financial criteria, as outlined in the  Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, to qualify for  NEC awards since (1) the 96th-ranked firm prequalified to bid for NEC  awards in fiscal year 2008 that were in excess of its 2007 revenues and   (2) at least four other firms not on the list\u2014American International  Contractors Inc. (Special Projects), Aurora LLC, Environmental Chemical  Corporation International, and Framaco International\u2014prequalified for  the 2008 awards. We did not independently confirm the validity of ENR\u2019s  methodology for developing its top 100 ranking, nor did we independently  verify the accuracy of information derived from the company Web sites or  Lexis-Nexis searches. However, because our analysis was designed to  illustrate a potential for untapped contractor capacity, we determined that  the data we used were sufficiently reliable.", "To address the third objective\u2014factors that affect contractors\u2019 decisions  to participate in State\u2019s construction program\u2014we identified the universe  of 21 U.S. construction firms that won awards to build U.S. embassies,  consulates, and diplomatic annexes since 2001. Foreign firms and U.S.  firms awarded only contracts for construction other than office buildings,  such as Marine Security Guard quarters, staff housing, and other  construction projects were not included in our census. Three of the 21 U.S.  firms were excluded from our interviews for various reasons\u2014one  company is no longer in business, while two others received sole-source  contracts that would make them unable to respond to a number of the  competitiveness questions in our interview instrument. A fourth company  was excluded because we could not arrange a meeting with that company.  As a result, we interviewed 17 U.S. contractors from March-June 2008 (see  table 6). From 2001 to 2007, these 17 companies were awarded 78 NEC  and related contracts with original values totaling approximately $4  billion. This latter value represents 81 percent of all embassy, consulate,  and annex construction contracts awarded through 2007.", "To obtain consistent information from the contractors, we developed a  structured interview instrument that included approximately 70 closed-  and open-ended questions designed to assess contractor views and  experiences on a wide range of construction-related topics, including,   (1) construction experience and experience with State and other federal  agencies; (2) State\u2019s program-level and on-site construction management  policies and processes; (3) incentives for pursuing construction awards;  (4) challenges in completing NEC and related construction projects; and  (5) profitability of NEC and related projects. To ensure that respondents  understood the questions in the same way, that we had phrased the  questions appropriately for this population, and that we had covered the  most important issues, we pretested our instrument with three contractors  and made revisions based on their input. Prior to fully implementing the  instrument, it was reviewed by the staff from the U.S. Naval Facilities  Engineering Command and State\u2019s Office of the Inspector General.

We have adjusted the title of this report to reflect State\u2019s comments  that although State has taken actions designed, in part, to increase  contractor participation, the addition of more interested, responsible  bidders for State projects would benefit the program. 2.  State notes that it has recently increased the construction schedules  for each class of SED, and streamlined the RFP process and reformed  some design processes to help contractors better understand  requirements and begin construction more quickly. State also said that  contractors should be aware of the period of performance when  preparing bids for State projects. We acknowledge in the body of the  report that State has increased the time allotted to construct the  various categories of SEDs. We agree with State that, based on the  RFP documents, contractors should be aware of the planned  construction time frame and the associated risk prior to submitting  contract proposals. The report acknowledges State\u2019s efforts to  streamline RFP documents and improve the design process; however,  it may take a number of years and completed projects to determine  how the changes affect contractors\u2019 ability to complete construction  according to schedule. 3.  State said that its methodology for estimating risk and salary increases  is not arbitrary, but rather based on demonstrated financial criteria.  Since we did not analyze how risks and salaries are estimated, we  make no explicit or implicit statement on the validity of the  methodology used. State also said that a solution to less competition  for NEC awards could be to draw in larger U.S. firms that have the  financial capacity for the work, in accordance with GAO  recommendations. As a result, it has recently reached out to one of the  largest U.S. construction contractors and would continue outreach  efforts with other large firms. Although we do present an analysis that  shows a significant number of large contractors with overseas  experience have not been part of the NEC program, we do not  recommend that State rely solely on large contractors. 4.  State questioned why we chose to highlight the declines in the number  of firms prequalifying to bid on NECs from 2006 to 2008 when that  decline was not statistically significant. We explain within the text that  there was an overall decline in the number of firms prequalified to bid  on NEC projects from 2002 to 2008. We also state that the large  number of firms that prequalified in 2006 is likely explained by the  relatively low cost for the projects awarded that year. We also note  that from 2006 to 2008, the average number of firms prequalfied per  project decreased by 69 percent from 13 to 4. When considered with  the declines in the number of firms bidding on projects, these declines  indicate a decrease in contractor participation, especially in recent  years. 5.  State commented that the results of our contractor interviews could be  biased from our exclusion of a small contractor with a limited-sized  claim and our inclusion of a large contractor with current claims of  more than $90 million. We do not believe our analysis was affected by  contractor bias. The draft report incorrectly stated the reason for  excluding the first contractor State cited from the structured  interviews. The contractor was excluded primarily because its only  contract from 2001 to 2007 was awarded as a sole-source contract.  Because the contractor received a sole-source contract, we believed it  could not address many of the questions involving competition for  NEC awards. We have made this correction in appendix I. We note this  same contractor was terminated from its contract for nonperformance  and subsequently filed for and received bankruptcy protection as a  result of the termination. As a result, we felt its inclusion could risk  biasing our work, but the contractor was not excluded for this reason.  The second contractor State cited was a major participant in the NEC  program, having completed 17 NEC and other projects from 1999 to  2008. We are aware of the claims the contractor has filed for a number  of projects it performed, but we do not believe the existence of those  claims biased our discussions with that firm or our findings, in general. 6.  State disagreed with many of our comments in a draft of this report on  the role of the new project manager positions. In particular, State  commented that project managers are not intended in any way to  replace existing oversight during the construction phase as stated in  our report. Our draft report did not, in fact, indicate that project  managers should replace existing oversight. Rather, our intent was to  question whether the project manager\u2019s effectiveness in performing  lifecycle oversight of a project could be compromised by sharing  reporting responsibilities with the construction executive during  construction phase. Nonetheless, in light of State\u2019s comments, and to  avoid confusion, we deleted the paragraph on which State\u2019s comments  are based.  7.  State clarified that project directors could approve contract  modifications of up to $25,000 per change and up to $250,000 per year.
