In March 1999, we reported that measuring job creation that results from economic development programs is problematic. EDA reports that it adjusted its targets related to creating and retaining permanent jobs based on our report, resulting in conservative targets. In addition, EDA uses multiple measures to assess its performance related to this outcome. Among the achievements that EDA reports were creating or retaining over twice as many jobs in distressed areas as planned, obtaining millions of dollars in private sector investments in distressed communities ahead of schedule, obtaining more state and local funds than anticipated, awarding a larger portion of its grants to areas of highest distress, and decreasing the processing time for grant applications. The one performance measure for which the target was not met was the percentage of Economic Development District and Indian tribe planning grantees whose Comprehensive Economic Development Strategies were submitted on time and were acceptable. Commerce explained that this target is not based on statutory requirements and was originally an estimate. In addition, some delays may have stemmed from new legislation that changed the process for some grantees. EDA said that it is analyzing trends to determine if adjustments need to be made to future targets.", "EDA presents clear and reasonable strategies for the future, which include the following:   providing grants for economic development projects in distressed   providing grants to implement economic adjustment strategies in communities that experience sudden losses of jobs and severe economic distress,   strengthening and expanding its strategic planning and investment activities through a network of regional planning organizations, and   disseminating information on economic development issues affecting distressed communities to entities involved in helping those communities.", "EDA said that it used program evaluations to develop valid performance measures, verify results, provide a more complete understanding of overall program performance, and improve program performance. EDA also identified specific program evaluations that it had used in the past, as well as evaluations that are currently under way.  EDA reports that it plans to collaborate with other federal agencies on ways to evaluate and measure crosscutting activities to improve economic development assistance for distressed communities\u2014a topic that was covered in our September 2000 report.", "For each of its performance measures, EDA describes the data source, as well as its data validation and verification efforts.

NOAA reported its fiscal year 2000 performance for this goal using measures such as the lead time and accuracy of forecasts and warnings. Specifically, NOAA met its targets for flash floods and winter storms that are covered by warnings. On the other hand, it did not issue warnings for flash floods, winter storms, and tornadoes with as much lead time as targeted and its false alarm rate for tornado warnings was higher than targeted. NOAA\u2019s performance on one measure\u2014the accuracy of warnings for hurricanes\u2014 was not applicable this past year because no hurricanes made landfall during the 2000 season. In some cases, NOAA\u2019s performance stayed about the same as last year even though the target was not met for fiscal year 2000. For example, the reported accuracy for marine forecasts involving winds and waves remained at 50 percent, slightly below the target of 51 percent. Similarly, the reported lead time for severe weather warnings for flash floods increased from 41 minutes to 43 minutes, but fell short of the target of 55 minutes.", "In reporting on these measures, Commerce\u2019s report offered explanations for its failure to meet targets, which often involved atypical weather conditions. For example, in explaining why it did not meet its three targets for tornado warnings, NOAA noted that the 2000 tornado season had few well-organized storm systems, resulting in fewer and weaker tornadoes that are harder to detect. Similarly, in explaining why it did not meet its target of 20 percent accuracy in 3-day precipitation forecasts, NOAA indicated that the past year had been relatively dry, a factor that can lower the accuracy score. In addition, NOAA noted that this measure was being used for the first time and, therefore, was considered a baseline for this measure.", "NOAA noted that improvements are difficult to observe on an annual basis and that historical trends show that the agency continues to improve the accuracy and lead time of warnings related to severe weather hazards. NOAA\u2019s strategies for further improving its performance are clear and reasonable. These strategies include continuing its investments in research and new technologies, maintaining continuous satellite coverage, strengthening weather observing and prediction systems, and improving the dissemination of weather forecasts and warnings to the public and others. NOAA also stated that it uses annual program evaluations at its National Weather Service (NWS) field offices as part of its quality control to ensure the reliability of its data and products; however, it did not elaborate on the results of these evaluations.", "For each of its performance measures, NOAA describes the data source, as well as its data validation and verification efforts. In addition, NOAA generally discusses data limitations. For example, for its measure related to hurricane warnings, NOAA states that there is a large variability in the hurricane warning program due to sample sizes and types of storms.", "Our prior work drew attention to problems that NWS faced in developing and implementing weather-forecasting technologies. Because of these and other problems, we identified NWS\u2019 efforts to modernize its critical weather systems as a high-risk area in our 1995, 1997, and 1999 high-risk series reports. We made a series of recommendations aimed at helping NWS improve its management of the modernization effort, and NWS has implemented many of those recommendations. Most recently, in January 2001, we removed NWS\u2019 modernization effort from our high-risk list because of the progress NWS had made in addressing our recommendations and in implementing a critical information processing system. NWS is continuing to improve its modernization systems and has reported that these efforts are critical to its ability to improve warnings and forecasts over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increase Access of U.S. Businesses to International Markets", "paragraphs": ["Commerce\u2019s progress made toward ensuring that U.S. businesses have greater access to international markets is unclear for at least three reasons. First, most of the targets related to this outcome were not met and performance for those targets during fiscal year 2000 was lower than performance during fiscal year 1999. For example, the International Trade Administration (ITA) did not meet its target for the number of counseling sessions held with U.S. businesses and held about 20,000 fewer sessions in fiscal year 2000 than it held in fiscal year 1999. ITA stated that the number of counseling sessions did not reflect its level of success given the emphasis on using electronic means to communicate with U. S. firms, but ITA did not describe its efforts to communicate electronically. Also, ITA did not meet the target for the value of gross exports supported through advocacy efforts and reported that the dollar value was $8.9 billion for fiscal year 2000, as opposed to $9.8 billion for fiscal year 1999. Second, it is not clear whether ITA met its targets for two measures. Specifically, ITA reported that it met the original targets for the number of \u201cnew-to-market\u201d and \u201cnew-to-export\u201d firms.  ITA explained that it had revised these targets upward in the fiscal year 2001 performance plan and did not meet the revised targets; however, ITA did not explain why it used the lower targets for this report. In addition, based on the same data, Commerce\u2019s accountability report for fiscal year 2000 states that the target for the number of \u201cnew-to-market\u201d firms was not met. Third, ITA reported that its ability to demonstrate future progress is hindered by the limitations of the measures that it uses. ITA reported that it faces inherent difficulties in quantifying its progress due to the reluctance of its business clients to volunteer proprietary information and the unanticipated shifts in the world economy. In addition, ITA faces the challenge of isolating its contribution to U.S. trade objectives from that of U.S. industry and other U.S. agencies.", "While ITA met its targets for the number of antidumping and countervailing duty cases processed and for the dollar value of market openings, it is discontinuing use of the dollar value of market openings because it does not directly relate to ITA\u2019s success in enforcing trade laws and agreements. ITA also plans to discontinue using the number of counseling sessions held with U.S. businesses and the value of gross exports supported as performance measures. While ITA explains its reasons for discontinuing measures, some of the explanations were very brief. For example, ITA states that the value of gross exports is being discontinued as a measure to reflect departmental goals and objectives but does not describe those goals and objectives or explain the relationship of this measure to those goals and objectives.", "ITA has taken steps to improve its ability to demonstrate progress towards its goals by discontinuing three measures and adding two new measures. In addition, ITA presented a multi-step strategy for improving its performance. While this strategy is clear and reasonable, ITA\u2019s prospects for success in improving its ability to demonstrate progress are unclear because, for each of its four performance goals for fiscal year 2002, it plans to rely on one, narrowly focused measure to demonstrate progress. For example, ITA will measure its progress in increasing U.S. exports by implementing the National Export Strategy by using the number of \u201cnew- to-market\u201d firms. ITA states that this measure is circumstantial evidence of overall export growth and adds that it cannot measure actual dollar value of exports because of limitations on the data, such as the reluctance of businesses to reveal that information. In another instance, Commerce will use the number of anti-dumping and countervailing duty cases processed to measure its progress in improving American competitiveness and access to foreign markets by enforcing compliance with U.S. trade laws. However, in summarizing the limitations to this information, ITA states that the number of cases processed depends entirely on the number of injurious foreign trade actions taken and on the responses of parties other than ITA.", "In some cases, data exist that could support additional measures related to ITA\u2019s performance goals. For example, as we reported in March 2000, ITA\u2019s Trade Compliance Center relies on multiple sources of information and reporting mechanisms to ensure that trade agreements are monitored and compliance issues are promptly addressed. These sources of information include U.S. businesses, other parts of Commerce, and U.S. embassies overseas. The Trade Compliance Center also produces regular reports on possible compliance violations for use by other executive branch agencies. Thus, ITA already collects and maintains a rich set of useful data that is directly related to one of its key performance goals\u2014 improving competitiveness and access to foreign markets by enforcing compliance with U.S. trade laws and agreements.", "ITA identified both internal and external program evaluations that were related to its performance goals. Specifically, ITA reported that, in response to one of our reports, it clarified criteria for the types of agreements that are to be included in a trade database. Also, ITA reported that it conducted a number of internal reviews that identified needed changes in programs, administration, and management that were implemented at the end of these reviews.", "For each of its performance measures, ITA describes the data source, as well as its data validation and verification efforts. In addition, ITA generally discusses data limitations. For example, ITA explains that its success in collecting data on \u201cnew-to-export\u201d firms is dependent on its clients\u2019 willingness to provide such information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensure That the United States Is Secure From Proliferation of Dual-Use Commodities and Chemical Weapons", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau of Export Administration\u2019s (BXA) progress toward ensuring that the United States is secure from the proliferation of dual-use commodities and chemical weapons is unclear. As we observed last year, BXA\u2019s ability to demonstrate progress toward this outcome has been hampered by the tendency of its measures to reflect workload and outputs\u2014rather than outcomes\u2014and a lack of clarity in the presentation of its performance goals.", "BXA reported that it met its targets for the number of strategic industry analyses completed, the number of investigations accepted for criminal or administrative remedies, the number of enforcement outreach visits, the number of end-use visits conducted, and the number of nonproliferation and export control international cooperative exchanges. However, BXA reported that it plans to discontinue using the last four of these measures for external reporting in the future. BXA said that it was changing its measures to align them more closely with new departmental objectives. However, BXA did not describe those objectives or explain why these measures do not support those objectives. In addition, BXA did not achieve its targets for average export licensing processing time, high-risk transactions deterred, licensing decisions made, number of investigations completed, and export assistance seminars and conferences attended. BXA plans to discontinue using all of these measures except the number of high-risk actions deterred.", "While BXA attributed its lack of success in meeting these targets to several factors\u2014including the liberalization of export controls, the growing complexity of its investigations, and staff limits\u2014its explanations were not always complete. For example, BXA said that the decline in the number of high-risk transactions deterred was due to unforeseen regulatory, policy, and technological changes, but did not describe those changes or explain their impact on the measure. In addition, BXA stated that it did not meet its target for number of licensing decisions due to unanticipated liberalizations of export controls. However, Commerce has advocated such changes and the report did not provide enough information to explain how these liberalizations differed from those advocated by Commerce. In another case, BXA said that it did not meet its targeted number of seminars and conferences due to budget constraints and its inability to fill critical personnel vacancies; however, it did not provide supporting details.", "BXA broadly described strategies for meeting the targets for its five performance goals associated with this key outcome. However, like ITA, BXA\u2019s prospects for success in improving its ability to demonstrate progress are unclear because for fiscal year 2002, it plans to rely on one measure to demonstrate progress for each of these performance goals. For example, to ensure that the U.S. defense industrial base is healthy and competitive, BXA describes strategies such as coordinating federal support for U. S. defense firms involved in procurement competitions overseas, facilitating business contacts between U. S. industry and potential customers, maintaining the competitiveness of U.S. defense firms, and minimizing the burden of offsets placed on firms that make defense sales to foreign customers. To measure its performance related to this goal, BXA plans to use the dollar value of contracts won in international competitions by U.S. defense firms. While this measure may be an indicator of BXA\u2019s success in this area, additional measures would provide further evidence of progress.", "Like the other component agencies, BXA identified program evaluations that were related to its performance goals. Specifically, BXA reported that, in response to reports from Commerce\u2019s Office of Inspector General and us, BXA initiated its own program reviews related to data validation. BXA reported that it used the results of these program evaluations to identify improvements in data entry and review, among other things.", "For each of its performance measures, BXA describes the data source, as well as its data validation and verification efforts.

Most notably, Commerce clearly showed whether targets for performance goals were met or not met, rather than using the three-tiered scoring system that was used in last year\u2019s report. Furthermore, for most of its component agencies and for departmental management, Commerce\u2019s combined performance report and plan includes summaries of the mission, priorities and management challenges, actual and targeted levels of performance, and resource requirements. These summaries are followed by detailed explanations of the performance goals and measures that include explanations of whether performance targets were met or not met, as well as any changes, additions, or deletions from the prior year. In addition, an appendix in the combined document summarizes performance measures across component agencies, links them to Commerce\u2019s strategic goals, and designates whether the targets were met or not met.", "In our June 2000 report, we recommended that the Secretary of Commerce ensure that the fiscal year 2000 performance report (1) classify performance measures as met or unmet to more clearly communicate the agency\u2019s performance, (2) consistently explain why targets were not met when differences occur between actual and targeted performance, and (3) provide information about plans and schedules for meeting targets when they are not met. Commerce\u2019s combined report and plan addresses these recommendations. For each performance measure, the document includes a table that lists the targeted and actual performance for fiscal years 1999 and 2000, clearly indicates whether the targets were met or not met, and lists targets for fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The table is followed by a narrative explanation of that measure. For the measures whose targets were exceeded or not met, the description usually explains whether Commerce has adjusted its performance targets for future years based on actual performance. For example, EDA reports that it has created or retained over 12,000 jobs in distressed areas, yet one of its fiscal year 2001 targets is to create or retain 7,201 jobs by fiscal year 2004. The narrative explains that this is the first year for which data have become available for this measure and the high number of jobs created or retained could have been due, in part, to strong economic growth; consequently, additional data are required before adjusting long-term projections. In another case, ITA reported that the number of \u201cnew-to-export\u201d firms for fiscal year 2000 was 33,514, which was fewer than in fiscal year 1999; consequently, ITA reduced its fiscal year 2001 target for this measure from 36,949 firms to 30,336 firms to reflect trends experienced in fiscal year 2000. Each performance goal also includes a list of the measures that were discontinued, accompanied by explanations; an action plan, including planned strategies; a description of crosscutting activities both inside and outside of the department; and a discussion of external factors and accompanying mitigation strategies.

Commerce notes that it held a departmentwide meeting in August 2000 that involved senior managers who generated ideas for changing Commerce\u2019s human capital strategy and incorporating human capital management into all major management systems. To assess how well it achieves this goal, Commerce plans to measure implementation of a process to identify current and projected mission- related workforce needs, the value of human resources services, the efficiency and effectiveness of hiring systems, recruiting activities, the alignment of performance management with mission accomplishment and overall recognition, and implementation of a telecommuting program.", "For fiscal year 2000, Commerce reports achievements that include developing a workforce analysis plan and identified workforce planning tools, pilot testing a Web-based recruitment and referral system, integrating performance management and awards, and pilot testing a telecommuting program.
