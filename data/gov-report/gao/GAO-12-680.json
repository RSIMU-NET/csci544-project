Domestically, DOD provides special education mainly within DOD schools. In contrast, DOD schools overseas vary in the types and levels of disabilities they are readily equipped to serve. For example, DOD schools in Ramstein, Germany, are equipped to serve children with severe disabilities of any type, whereas schools in some other overseas installations have no pre-established special education programs of any kind.", "Overseas assignment of servicemembers with children with special educational needs requires coordination between the military branches through their Exceptional Family Member (EFM) programs and the DOD Education Activity--the office that oversees education of military dependent children in DOD schools. Each branch implements its own processes for screening military families and assigning servicemembers to locations where there are school services that can meet their families' needs. However, impediments to effective placements may strain school resources. More specifically, ineffective screenings may result in families being placed in locations where schools are not readily equipped to serve certain needs. For example, we found one case in which a school that only had programs in place for students with mild disabilities received a student with severe needs who had not been educationally screened.", "Families in many of GAO's focus groups were generally satisfied with the services DOD provided their children with special needs once they received them, but they felt that the limited availability of special education and medical specialists overseas presented challenges. Some parents were concerned their children were not receiving all the services they needed, partly due to difficulties DOD schools encounter hiring and retaining special education staff, especially overseas. While the military branches provide family support services, parents in our focus groups also indicated they lacked information about obtaining special education and related medical services. DOD is taking some steps to provide better information to families, but the extent to which these efforts are helping them is unclear.", "DOD's recently established Office of Special Needs (OSN) is responsible for enhancing and monitoring support for military families with special needs. OSN and the military branches have initiated efforts to improve screening and overseas assignment of military families with special needs. However, it is unclear when some of these efforts will be completed. Moreover, while OSN was established in part to enhance and monitor the military branches' support for families with special needs, it has limited enforcement authority and oversight over the branches' EFM programs. Specifically, it is limited in the extent to which it can compel the branches to comply with DOD or service-level program requirements, and it has no direct means by which to hold them accountable if they fail to do so. In addition, DOD currently lacks agencywide benchmarks and performance goals for all components of the EFM program. As a result, it cannot assess the effectiveness of the branches' EFM programs and ensure that improvements are made when needed. Without overall performance information to proactively identify emerging problem areas, some of the branches have had to conduct investigations to address problems after they have arisen."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense (1) ensure the military branches medically and educationally screen all school-age children before relocation overseas; (2) direct OSN to establish benchmarks and performance goals for the EFM program; and (3) direct OSN to develop and implement a process for ensuring the branches' compliance with EFM program requirements.

We determined these data to be reliable for the  purpose of describing the population of children with disabilities in DOD  schools and reporting information about screenings and assignment  concerns. We conducted site visits to five military installations in Europe  and two in the United States, as well as telephone interviews with agency  officials at one military installation in the Pacific. We selected these  locations based on several criteria, including the number of children with  disabilities enrolled in DOD schools, the level of special education  services schools were equipped to provide, variation in urban and remote  areas, and variation among the four military branches. During our site  visits and Pacific teleconference, we conducted meetings with officials  from 15 schools and held 22 focus groups with the parents of students  receiving special education services to discuss their perceptions of the  services their children have received. While the results of these focus  groups cannot be generalized to all parents of children with disabilities,  nor are they representative of the population of parents, common  responses across groups and recurring themes provide some degree of  validation. We also interviewed DODEA officials in the United States and  overseas, including district and school officials, such as principals, special  education coordinators, and teachers.

EDIS  helps identify children with disabilities and delivers early intervention  services to eligible infants and toddlers, from birth through age 2. EDIS  also provides medical assessments necessary to determine children\u2019s  eligibility for special education services. For example, in order to provide  special education services for children with emotional impairments or  autism spectrum disorders, DODEA requires medical evaluations and  diagnoses by qualified medical professionals, such as developmental  pediatricians, psychologists, or psychiatrists.

Overseas, EDIS also provides related services for children  enrolled in DOD schools.", "Domestic DOD schools provide special education for all types and levels  of disabilities, mainly within DOD schools. However, according to DOD, in  certain cases students may receive services from external service  providers that DOD contracts with or they may be placed in local public  schools. Overseas, the military branches and DODEA have implemented  a system of specific, pre-established programs for different types of  disabilities and levels of services in each school. For example, schools in  Ramstein, Germany, have programs designed to serve children with all  types of disabilities, whereas schools in Iwakuni, Japan, have programs  that serve only a few types of disabilities, and the Seville Elementary  School in Spain has no programs for any type of disability. Agency  officials explained that this variation is a function of the size of the military  community and the needs of the military.

If the medical screening identifies  an EFM program-enrollable condition, the servicemember is referred for  EFM program enrollment.", "Each branch implements its EFM program differently, and the branches\u2019  screening and assignment coordination processes also vary somewhat.  Generally, through a process referred to as EFM program assignment  coordination, the servicemember\u2019s personnel office coordinates with the  medical department to verify the availability of medical services in the  planned location overseas. During this process, the military branch is also  required to coordinate with DODEA about the educational programs  available. DODEA makes a recommendation based on the services  available at the schools, and the branch\u2019s medical department makes a  recommendation about the availability of medical services. The military  branch then determines whether the servicemember and his or her family  should proceed to the planned location. Depending on the  recommendations of both medical and educational reviewers, the  servicemember may be approved for travel accompanied by family  members, recommended to relocate to a different location, or allowed to  take an unaccompanied tour. However, according to DODEA and one  branch\u2019s military officials, the installation\u2019s command personnel may  override a recommendation for an unaccompanied tour and allow the  servicemember to bring the family if he or she has special skills that are  needed at an installation.", "Each year, some military families with children with special educational  needs are sent to locations that are not prepared to serve their children\u2019s  needs upon arrival. This may occur either due to a \u201cscreening failure\u201d  (i.e., when an educational screening did not occur) or an \u201cassignment  concern\u201d (i.e., when the family was screened but the child was  nonetheless enrolled in a school unequipped to meet his or her needs).  DODEA records the number of screenings completed and assignment  concerns, as well as the reasons for such concerns. DODEA data show  that since school year 2008-09, there have been 93 instances when  children were educationally screened, but still arrived at a school that did  not have programs in place to meet their needs. This may have  occurred because (1) the student\u2019s needs were more severe than the  educational or medical screening indicated, (2) the military overrode  DODEA\u2019s assignment recommendation, or (3) the servicemember was  approved for one location but was reassigned to another. Moreover,  several DODEA and school officials we interviewed confirmed that a  number of children with special educational needs who were not  screened have enrolled in their schools. For example, school officials in  Naples said that a few years ago, the school received 44 incoming  students with IEPs, but only four of those students had been  educationally screened through the EFM program. According to OSN  officials, schools are generally able to accommodate children with mild  disabilities regardless of the location, and such cases would not be  recorded as assignment concerns. However, DODEA officials overseas  also stated that when children with severe disabilities are sent to locations  that do not have appropriate pre-existing programs, even a very small  number of these cases can require substantial additional resources.

Senior OSN officials estimated that about half the families with children  with special needs who are eligible to enroll in the EFM program have not  done so. They attributed underenrollment to several factors, including that  some families having children with very mild disabilities may think they  are not eligible for the program or may not be aware it exists. DODEA\u2019s  Europe area and military officials at three of the eight installations  included in our study explained that more families are eligible to enroll in  EFM programs than have done so. OSN and military officials at three  installations also explained that families with special needs may not  realize they are required to enroll in EFM programs. DOD officials also  explained that a family might be using an off-base medical provider who  is not aware of the program. An EFM program official from one installation  added that families who rarely relocate may not understand why it is  important to enroll. Another EFM program official from a different  installation acknowledged that more work needs to be done to raise  awareness and enroll families in EFM programs.", "Servicemembers may also intentionally circumvent educational screening  and EFM enrollment. More specifically, servicemembers sometimes avoid  identifying their children\u2019s special educational needs by declining special  education services or inaccurately completing relevant forms, according  to DODEA officials in Europe and the Pacific, as well as other DOD  entities we interviewed. Senior OSN officials believe that a fair number of  families intentionally opt not to enroll in the EFM program because some  are concerned that enrollment may adversely affect servicemembers\u2019  careers. They noted that there is a perceived stigma associated with EFM  enrollment among servicemembers. Some servicemembers have also  been known to travel with their families against recommendation and  once on base, request approval from the installation leadership for the  family to stay, according to DODEA and military officials at one  installation. In seven of our focus groups, parents said they felt that  enrolling in EFM would hurt their chances of being assigned to a position  or location they desire. However, DOD policy states that servicemembers  with children with special educational needs should be assigned to  appropriate locations overseas consistent with the needs of the military  and the career of the servicemember. According to senior OSN and  military officials at two installations, EFM enrollment does not limit  servicemembers\u2019 career opportunities. They noted that servicemembers  can accept an unaccompanied tour to the desired location or seek a  different assignment that would better support the family\u2019s needs if the  initially planned location is not suitable.", "EFM programs may not be as effective as they could be due to  inconsistent policy enforcement regarding enrollment. DOD policy  provides that a servicemember who fails or refuses to provide the  information required for overseas screening and assignment or knowingly  provides false information may be subject to disciplinary action and  administrative sanctions, including denial of command sponsorship.  However, OSN and military officials we spoke to at two installations  indicated that installation commanders rarely take such disciplinary  actions.", "Medical screening failures may also contribute to underenrollment in EFM  programs. More specifically, some special educational needs are  identified when families complete medical screenings for overseas  assignments. However, officials from OSN and a military branch  explained that sometimes these needs are not identified during  screenings, resulting in families not being enrolled in EFM programs. For  example, if a servicemember\u2019s child is diagnosed with autism by a civilian  provider, the military\u2019s overseas screening personnel may not be aware of  it\u2014since, according to officials from this branch and DODEA, they only  have access to records from military hospitals or treatment facilities\u2014 unless families disclose this information. Senior DOD officials stated that  they believe such failures are uncommon and have minimal impact on  EFM program enrollment.", "In addition, some branches\u2019 EFM programs face administrative  challenges that may contribute to underenrollment of families with special  needs. A military official from one installation observed that EFM program  staff often do not complete the EFM program paperwork or they take a  significant amount of time to do so because other duties take priority. For  example, officials from two installations said that ideally enrollment should  occur within 4 to 6 weeks, but can sometimes take several months for the  process to be completed. Moreover, officials at two installations from one  military branch told us that enrollment forms were not always forwarded to  the receiving installation for review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Failures to Screen and Coordinate Assignments May Strain School Resources", "paragraphs": ["When screening and assignment processes are ineffective, students may  arrive at schools that are not immediately equipped to meet their needs.  Officials at some schools we visited told us it can be difficult to  accommodate students whose needs they are not structured to serve.  DODEA district and area office officials concurred, and noted that this is  one of the most significant challenges that schools overseas face. To  meet the needs of students, schools may need to reallocate or increase  staff and other resources, which can be difficult with limited resources.", "According to a senior DODEA official, the local district or area  administrative offices will first attempt to shift existing resources to meet  the needs of students. Typically, a school might bus a student to another  location or hire a paraprofessional. However, if necessary, DODEA will  purchase new equipment or hire a teacher, a process that can be lengthy  in some instances. For example, during our review of DODEA\u2019s screening  and assignment concern database, we found one case in which a school  overseas that did not have pre-existing programs in place for students  with severe cognitive disabilities received such a student. The student\u2019s  family had not gone through EFM program screening before the  servicemember\u2019s authorization to travel was approved. Once the child\u2019s  educational records were reviewed, travel was not recommended for the  family, but the family arrived nonetheless. As a result, the school had to  expend additional resources to meet the student\u2019s needs.", "In contrast to military personnel, civilian families are not required to enroll  in EFM programs or to undergo medical screenings prior to relocating  overseas. According to DOD officials, under federal law human  resource offices are prohibited from asking civilian employees whether  their family members have certain medical conditions or other special  needs and cannot bar employment or relocation to overseas installations  based on such factors. However, according to DOD policy, DOD human  resource offices are responsible for providing information to civilian  employees regarding the educational and medical services available at  overseas installations, so that the civilian employee or selectee may  make an informed choice regarding whether to accept the overseas  position. DOD human resource offices are also required to provide a point  of contact to answer applicants\u2019 questions.", "Officials from two schools we visited also said that because civilian  families do not undergo any systematic screening before transferring  overseas, they tend to have the most severe needs. Senior DOD officials,  however, told us they do not maintain data on whether civilian families  have more severe needs than active duty families. A school official at an  installation in Europe told us that the majority of students with severe  special needs enrolled in schools on that installation are civilians, and that  military dependents with similar needs would have been identified and  likely prevented from transferring there during the screening and  assignment process.

More specifically, participants in seven focus groups said they  believe that there are shortages of occupational therapists or physical  therapists at certain schools. For example, a parent in one focus group  believed her child was not receiving necessary services as often as she  felt was warranted. In the 2008-09 school year, DODEA issued 285  reports of unavailability of medically related services for military  dependents in the Pacific region due to the number of vacancies at Navy  EDIS clinics and delays in filling positions. According to these reports,  unavailable services included diagnostic evaluations, social work  services, as well as occupational and physical therapy. Since 2009, many  of these cases have been resolved. In school years 2009-10 and 2011- 12, there were 41 reports of unavailability of medically related services.", "In addition, participants in six of our focus groups expressed concern with  perceived shortages of paraprofessionals to assist special education  teachers, and participants in four focus groups also stated that they  believed there was high turnover among them. Officials from three  schools we spoke with and DODEA officials from one district indicated  that there are shortages of paraprofessionals or high turnover among  them. The high turnover rate among paraprofessionals can be especially  disruptive for children with special needs, who thrive on consistency,  according to parents in three of our focus groups.", "Participants in seven focus groups told us it has been difficult for them to  obtain medical services for their children. Since IEPs require medical  diagnoses for some conditions, limited medical services can directly affect  students\u2019 educational progress. According to DODEA guidelines, certain  impairments require medical reports from appropriate specialists, which  can include developmental pediatricians, psychologists, autism clinicians,  and audiologists, among others. Some school, DODEA, and EFM  program officials we met with confirmed that it can be difficult for families  to obtain medical services on base. For example, while DOD officials told  us that military families have greater access to developmental  pediatricians than civilians, officials at a domestic school we visited said  that waiting lists for developmental pediatricians at the military medical  treatment facilities are so long that families frequently seek care from  private providers. Further, a senior military official at another domestic  installation told us that the local military treatment facility does not have a  permanent developmental psychologist and as a result, some families  have to wait almost 2 months for appointments. In addition, participants in  five focus groups told us it has been difficult for them to obtain a particular  type of autism therapy for their children, especially overseas. For  example, one focus group participant in Germany told us there is a long  waiting list to receive Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy in  Germany. While the military does not provide ABA therapy in military  treatment facilities, according to DOD officials, many families have  become accustomed to receiving this service in the United States. Some  DODEA area and school officials we spoke with acknowledged a  shortage of autism specialists overseas.", "Moreover, officials from many DOD schools we visited said it is difficult to  fill and retain key positions, including special education teachers,  paraprofessionals, and specialists. When a school needs additional staff  to fill vacant teacher or specialist positions, candidates are first recruited  from the local area. If they cannot be recruited locally, candidates are  hired from the United States through a process that can take several  months. Hiring delays may create staffing challenges for schools, and  they may need to rely on substitutes or reallocate existing staff. For  example, officials from one overseas school said that they began the  school year with long-term substitutes in special education classrooms  because teachers were not yet in place. In addition, officials from the  same school stated that although the school began the process of filling a  projected speech and language therapist vacancy in April 2011, the  position was not filled until late September of that year, several weeks  after the school year had begun. As a result, school officials stated they  had to divide the workload among existing staff and some students  received fewer services in the meantime. Officials from two additional  schools noted their speech and language therapists\u2019 caseloads exceeded  the DODEA standard of 30 to 50 students. Officials from one of these  schools said it is unclear when they will receive another speech and  language therapist to reduce their large caseloads. DODEA area officials  also noted the difficulties in hiring speech and language therapists and  other special education staff. Overall, parents in seven focus groups  stated that they believed their children did not always receive all the  speech and language therapy they needed, and some of these parents  felt that there were shortages of these therapists. Likewise, DODEA  district officials in Europe and a few school officials we spoke with  overseas also acknowledged that hiring and retaining special education  paraprofessionals can be difficult, citing low pay and the fact that the  hiring pool\u2014typically spouses from the local community\u2014is a small and  highly mobile population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Families Lack Information about Obtaining Services", "paragraphs": ["The family support components of each of the military branches\u2019 EFM  programs are responsible for supporting military families with special  needs by providing information and referral and nonclinical case  management services.

Without overall  performance information to proactively identify emerging problem areas,  some of the branches have only been able to react to specific problems  after they have arisen. For example, entities within the Air Force and  Navy have conducted internal audits or investigations in response to  concerns regarding special education services and EFM programs. In  December 2009, the Inspector General of the Air Force initiated an  investigation of the Air Force\u2019s EFM program in response to complaints  from a number of Air Force families with special needs. The  investigation substantiated many of the complaints from families,  including allegations that installations did not follow required assignment  coordination procedures. As of June 2012, the Air Force has not  determined its plans to respond to the investigation findings. Similarly, in  April 2009, the Naval Audit Service initiated an audit of the Marine Corps\u2019  EFM program.

The audit focused on  services for school-aged children enrolled in the Navy\u2019s EDIS program in  the Mediterranean area. It found that there was inadequate centralized  oversight over local programs as well as inadequate educational  screening for families being assigned to overseas locations.

In the 2011 White House report, the  heads of 16 executive branch agencies, including the Secretary of  Defense, committed to making the well-being of military families one of  their highest priorities and to improve their access to services and  support. Further, the Administration emphasized the importance of  ensuring that military children are provided a quality education. Due to  their frequent relocations, accessing educational services may be  particularly difficult for military families\u2014especially for those with children  with special educational needs. DODEA and the military branches provide  special education services to eligible families thorough a complex system  that varies by location. While families in our focus groups were generally  satisfied once their children received special education services, they  faced challenges obtaining these services, in part due to the limited  availability of medical and related service providers at overseas  installations. In addition, families may lack sufficient information about  accessing special education and related medical services. The  challenges families and schools face in obtaining and providing special  education services are not unique to DOD schools. However, the  complexity of DOD\u2019s system for providing services\u2014especially  overseas\u2014along with the high mobility of military families is unique.  Consequently, effective overseas assignment and family support  processes are essential for meeting the needs of families with children  with special needs. Impediments to effective assignment coordination,  such as ineffective screening processes, can result in families being  assigned to overseas installations that are unable to readily meet their  children\u2019s educational and medical needs. As such, it is important that the  branches\u2019 screening and assignment processes for children with special  needs are consistently conducted in a thorough manner.", "OSN has recently taken some steps to enhance the military branches\u2019  EFM programs. However, it is unclear when some of these efforts will be  completed or if they will be effectively implemented. While OSN was  established in part to monitor the military branches\u2019 support for families  with special needs, it has limited enforcement authority over the  branches\u2019 EFM programs. Specifically, it is limited in the extent to which it  can compel the branches to comply with DOD or service-level program  requirements, and it has no direct means by which to hold them  accountable if they fail to do so. As such, it is important that OSN develop  processes to strengthen its oversight of the branches\u2019 EFM programs to  ensure that they are operating effectively.", "Moreover, DOD currently lacks uniform performance goals and  benchmarks for all aspects of the EFM program.
