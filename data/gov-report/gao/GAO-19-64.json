Laboratory initiated research authority. This authority, as implemented, provides labs with a means to fund new science and technology projects that they consider a priority. Labs may use a percentage of all funds available to the lab and are permitted to charge customers of the lab a percentage fee of the costs for activities performed by the lab for the customer.", "2. Direct hire authority. This authority enables labs to compete with private industry for high-quality talent. For example, it provides for streamlined hiring of applicants with relevant advanced degrees, or students enrolled in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics programs.", "3. Laboratory enhancement pilot program authority. This authority generally allows lab directors to propose alternative methods that might lead to more effective lab management, and waive certain policies or procedures that might affect implementation of these methods.", "4. Micro-purchase authority. This authority raises the threshold for small purchases for DOD research lab activities from $3,500 to $10,000 to facilitate acquisitions.", "While labs have used these authorities, their use has sometimes been limited, particularly with the laboratory initiated research authority.

This lack of capability, officials noted, creates a significant administrative burden related to charging these fees.", "Navy: In fiscal year 2017, Navy labs invested $7.3 million in lab infrastructure projects, compared to $32.9 million and $53.7 million at the Air Force and Army, respectively. Navy lab officials told us that they were restricted in their use of infrastructure funds available under the laboratory initiated research authority due to a lack of clear guidance as to whether and how to use this authority within the Capital Investment Program of the Navy Working Capital Fund.", "Army: The Army requires its labs to use a similar percentage of funds from two sources: (1) what it refers to as directly appropriated funds and (2) funds labs charge for customer activities. Some Army lab directors reported assessing a lower rate on customer funds than allowed so as not to drive customers away. The labs then generally charge a lower than desired rate on their directly appropriated funds, which further constrains the total funding available to them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making three recommendations to enhance DOD's use of laboratory initiated research authority, including that the Air Force assess potential accounting system improvements, the Navy clarify how labs can use the authority for infrastructure improvements, and the Army assess its policy to determine whether changes are needed to remove disincentives for labs to use the authority.

Moreover, these defense labs have encountered problems with  recruiting and retaining a high-quality workforce and maintaining their  facilities, according to the Defense Science Board. Congress has  provided DOD with several tools and mechanisms, which we refer to in  this report as authorities. The various authorities have provided laboratory  directors with greater ability to make their own decisions regarding  laboratory administration and management, funding allocations and  personnel. One of these authorities also provides for labs to seek waivers  to existing DOD policies that are believed to stifle innovation and  flexibility. Senate report 114-255 accompanying the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 noted the importance of these  authorities as a step toward accelerated innovation and flexibility. It  included a provision for us to study the lab governance used by DOD and  other agencies. In this report, we (1) evaluate how defense labs have  used selected legislative authorities to foster innovation and efficiency  and identify what barriers, if any, impede their use; (2) identify and  describe governance models used by selected DOD-sponsored FFRDCs  and UARCs; and (3) identify and describe governance models used by  selected non-defense labs, specifically at the Department of Energy  (Energy) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).", "For each of our three objectives, we interviewed key agency and lab  officials as well as contractor representatives. To evaluate how defense  labs have used selected legislative authorities and identify any barriers  that have impeded their use, we took inventory of the over 20 lab-related  authorities that have been enacted since 1994. From that list, we selected  for review four specific authorities that our recent work on best practices  for science and technology management and expedited defense lab  hiring have shown are, or have the potential to be, the most crucial for  supporting DOD labs\u2019 innovation missions. We then reviewed DOD-wide  and military service-specific policies as well as documents and reports  that detailed implementation of the selected authorities. We also  administered a survey to 44 lab directors (or their equivalents) to collect  information on their use of the four authorities, their perceptions about  each authority\u2019s effectiveness, and any perceived barriers to each  authority\u2019s use. A total of 31 lab directors completed and returned surveys  to us, which constituted a response rate of 71 percent. For the two  authorities in our review that have been in place the longest, we analyzed  relevant DOD data on lab personnel hiring and infrastructure investments.  Based on our reviews of supplementary documentation and interviews  with agency officials, we determined that these survey data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analysis.", "To identify and describe governance models used by DOD-sponsored  research centers, we focused our review on the three FFRDCs  designated as research and development labs as well as all 13 UARCS  sponsored by DOD entities.

These projects include those not  specifically tied to defined requirements, outside of the normal 2-year  budget planning process. The authority directs the Secretary of  Defense to establish mechanisms under which lab directors may use  an amount of funds equal to not less than 2 percent and not more  than 4 percent of all funds available to the defense lab for projects  under the four allowable categories. Further, lab directors are  permitted to obtain additional funding by charging customers a fixed  percentage fee that may not exceed 4 percent of costs.", "Direct Hire Authorities. These authorities provide lab directors with a  streamlined and accelerated hiring process.

In our review of DOD  documentation, we found that, among the military departments, Navy  labs funded recapitalization and revitalization projects using the  laboratory initiated research authority the least. As recently as early  2017, a DOD-commissioned study found that defense labs face  substantial infrastructure deficiencies that it has not yet identified  funding to address.

The Army  implemented this policy to maximize the laboratory initiated research  authority\u2019s effect on its 17 laboratories. However, the Office of the  USD(R&E) reported in March 2018 that the policy was having a  significant limiting effect on the breadth and scope of activities  executed under this authority. Similarly, we found that the policy  may, in practice, create a disincentive for Army lab directors to use  the authority. In their responses to our survey, Army lab directors,  representing key capability areas, acknowledged their concern about  the percentage fee they assessed on customer funds affecting their  ability to increase or maintain their customer bases. Further, some  Army lab directors reported assessing a lower percentage fee on  customer funds than allowed, which could help retain customers that  might otherwise be driven away with higher assessed fees to carry out  activities. As a result, these labs generally are setting a lower  percentage fee on their directly appropriated funds, thereby lowering  the overall laboratory initiated research funding available to them.  Nonetheless, the Army has not assessed its policy to determine  whether changes are needed to eliminate these disincentives.  Continuing to operate without such an assessment could result in  Army labs using the laboratory initiated research authority to fund  fewer self-initiated projects\u2014with the downstream effect that fewer  new technologies for warfighters are available.", "The Navy applies a consistent fixed percentage fee of costs  across its labs. Within the Navy, senior leadership has set the fixed  percentage fee of costs the labs charge on customer funds at 2  percent. A senior Navy science and technology official stated that  Navy leadership set a uniform fixed percentage fee to charge to  customer activities across the Navy lab enterprise, in part, to ensure  the labs were not inadvertently competing against one another for  customer funds. For example, without a uniform rate, a Navy warfare  center could offer a lower fee to entice a customer to use it rather than  another center. The use of a fixed percentage fee facilitates program  offices selecting warfare centers on the basis of best available match  in capabilities. On the other hand, the Navy\u2019s fixed 2 percentage fee  of costs does limit\u2014by half, as compared to the maximum 4 percent  allowable\u2014the amount of fees that Navy labs can collect.

Senior Navy research and development officials  perceived these matters as being the easiest from which to obtain  buy-in from Navy policy officials and attorneys, as well as Navy  leadership. Phase 2 will include proposals related to Information  Technology systems for research and development networks, while  Phase 3 will most likely address personnel issues.", "Navy research and development officials deferred proposals\u2014 including information technology network enhancements\u2014that might  require extensive discussions with policy officials and attorneys  stakeholders across the Navy.

For instance, a senior Navy official  indicated that multiple stakeholders from across the Navy\u2014including its  Office of Small Business Programs\u2014raised concerns about the  authority\u2019s potential impact on small businesses as micro-purchasing  allows defense labs to bypass small business set asides. Several labs  reported similar stakeholder concerns that prevented implementation of  the micro-purchase threshold increase.", "At the same time, however, lab officials we interviewed expressed the  view that the increased threshold will be beneficial, consistent with their  opinions about the laboratory enhancement pilot program. For example,  officials at the Naval Research Laboratory stated that increasing the  threshold to $10,000 allows their scientists and engineers to directly  purchase necessary equipment and materials through simplified  procedures. They identified examples of projects that had been delayed  by as much as several months because scientists and engineers used  other than simplified acquisition procedures to purchase a relatively  inexpensive piece of equipment, such as a specialized microscope,  because the cost was above the previous threshold of $3,500.", "Similarly, the Army\u2019s Armament Research, Development and Engineering  Center reported that the micro-purchase threshold increase enables the  lab to use simplified acquisition procedures for more items. As a result,  they noted that the new authority increases efficiency by reducing  contracting time and cost for those additional items. The Navy\u2019s Space  and Naval Warfare Systems Center Atlantic similarly reported that  requirements, which were previously procured using other than simplified  acquisition procedures, took up to 60 to 90 days to procure, while it took  as little as 3 to 4 days under this new authority, which enabled its  scientists and engineers to purchase materials needed for critical, time  sensitive projects.

A written agreement of sponsorship between the government  and the FFRDC must be prepared when the FFRDC is established, which  may be included in a contract between the government and the FFRDC,  or in another legal instrument under which an FFRDC accomplishes  effort, or it may be in a separate written agreement. Historically, DOD  sponsors retain contractors for many years or decades as FFRDC  operators. We found that research centers undertake DOD-sponsored  projects and, in some limited instances, scientific projects initiated by  centers that are overseen by DOD staff. Individual sponsors enter into  noncompetitive contracts with FFRDCs and UARCs. DOD uses  noncompetitive contracts to establish or maintain an essential  engineering, research, or development capability to be provided by an  educational or other nonprofit institution or a federally funded research  and development center.", "Scientific Project Funding: We found that project sponsors provide  funding to existing contracts. For example, the government issues orders  for requirements under Lincoln Laboratory\u2019s indefinite delivery indefinite  quantity base contract as funding sponsors approve new projects.  Individual project sponsors, along with the primary sponsor, oversee how  project funds are spent by the centers. Project sponsors decide whether  they will continue to work with these entities based on perceived  performance success. This effectively provides an incentive for FFRDCs  and UARCS to perform successfully.

This funding helps the centers ensure that development projects  are not limited to just satisfying near-term DOD requirements. Instead,  future generations of DOD technologies can be funded. For example,  officials at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory  proactively conducted work on advanced naval defense technologies in  response to similar technology development in adversary countries.  Although Navy sponsors did not fund this initial work, they subsequently  provided funding in this area after Hopkins\u2019 research identified a risk  reduction strategy for the Navy, according to the Johns Hopkins officials.

We previously  found in October 2008 these limits were imposed in response to concerns  that DOD was inefficiently using its FFRDCs. We found that the STE  workload limitation aimed to ensure that FFRDC work was appropriate  and limited resources were being used for DOD\u2019s highest priorities. As a  result, Software Engineering Institute officials said they decline many  DOD programs\u2019 requests for assistance due to the annual work hour  limitation. Further, officials at the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s  Studies and FFRDC Management Office reported that this limit  significantly constrains the use of DOD\u2019s FFRDCs and that DOD  customer demand for their services is significantly greater than the annual  STE limit.

The authority provided in  Section 219 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act  for Fiscal Year 2009, as implemented, provides lab directors with  flexibility to fund projects in four allowable categories: basic and  applied research; technology transition; workforce development; and  revitalization, recapitalization, or repair or minor military construction  of lab infrastructure.", "Laboratory Enhancement Pilot Program. Section 233 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 established a  pilot program for lab directors to propose alternative and innovative  methods that might lead to more effectively managing and operating  labs and authorized lab directors to waive any regulation, restriction,  requirement, guidance, policy, procedure, or departmental instruction  that would affect implementation of these methods unless such  implementation would be prohibited by a provision of an existing  statute or common law.", "Direct Hire Authority. Four types of direct hire authorities authorized  by Congress since 2008 are intended to provide a streamlined and  accelerated hiring process to allow the labs to successfully compete  with private industry and academia for high-quality scientific,  engineering, and technician talent.", "Micro-purchase Authority. The Federal Acquisition Regulation  states a preference for government agencies, to purchase and pay for  micro-purchases of supplies or services using the government-wide  commercial purchase card up to and at the micro-purchase threshold,  but micro-purchases may be conducted using any of the simplified  acquisition methods. While the FAR micro-purchase threshold was  generally  $3,500 at the time of our review, Congress increased this  threshold to $10,000 for activities of DOD science and technology  reinvention laboratories in Section 217 the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.", "Although Congress has provided additional legislative authorities to  defense lab directors to address hiring, infrastructure, and technology  transition challenges, the authorities that we covered in our review are the  ones that our prior and current work have shown are currently, or have  the potential to be, the most critical for supporting science and technology  reinvention laboratories\u2019 innovation mission within DOD labs. DOD lab  leaders use these authorities to flexibly fund projects intended to facilitate  research and development; propose alternative and innovative methods  that might lead to more effective lab management; directly hire personnel  at DOD labs including students currently enrolled in science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics (STEM) programs; and expand critical  science and technology purchases using simplified acquisition methods.", "To identify the extent to which DOD laboratories have used these  authorities as well as to identify what potential barriers existed to using  these authorities, we administered a survey to 44 STRL directors (or their  equivalent) to collect information on the use of these specific authorities,  their perceptions about the effectiveness of those authorities, and their  perceptions about any barriers to using these authorities. The members  of the population surveyed were the 44 defense laboratories defined as  science and technology reinvention laboratories. For the purposes of our  review, we defined laboratories as inclusive of Air Force technical  directorates (10), Army warfare centers (17), and Navy warfare centers  (17). We emailed questionnaires to the laboratories beginning in late  March 2018, and survey data collection ended in early May 2018, with 31  labs returning completed questionnaires, for an overall response rate of  71 percent at the laboratory level.", "We took steps to minimize the potential errors that the practical difficulties  of conducting any survey may introduce. Nonresponse error can result  when a survey fails to capture information from all population members  selected into a survey sample. Of the 13 questionnaires not returned, 4  were Army warfare centers, and 9 were Air Force research directorates.  Throughout the data collection period, we made multiple follow-up  attempts by email and phone to those labs not yet responding. The Air  Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) provided a single survey response for  the entire laboratory enterprise. Not all returned questionnaires may have  answers to every question applicable to a respondent. However, this  question-level nonresponse did not exceed one for any of the questions  applicable to all 31 labs. Because we selected the entire population of  laboratories for our survey, our estimates are not subject to sampling  error. We developed our list of the 44 labs in our population in  consultation with DOD, and are confident that none were left out, so our  or survey has no known sources of coverage error. We conducted  pretests of the draft questionnaire with 3 laboratories in the population  and made revisions to reduce the possibility of measurement error from  differences in how questions were interpreted and the sources of  information available to respondents. After reviewing the answers  received, we also followed up as necessary with respondents to clarify  apparent inconsistencies or other possible misreports, and made changes  to responses where corrections were needed. A second, independent  analyst checked the accuracy of all computer analyses to minimize the  likelihood of errors in data processing.", "To obtain additional information on this objective, we reviewed relevant  legislation which established or amended these authorities and reviewed  applicable DOD and service policy documentation. Further, we collected  military service related information on the usage of two authorities, such  as:", "Spending data on the use of the laboratory initiated research  authority.
