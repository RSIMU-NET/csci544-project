Our nation's vast transportation system of airways, railways, roads, pipelines, transit, and waterways has served this need, yet it is under considerable strain from (1) increasing congestion, (2) the large costs to maintain and improve it, and (3) the human cost of over 44,000 people killed and over 2.5 million injured each year in transportation-related accidents. The Department of Transportation implements national transportation policy and administers most federal transportation programs. For fiscal year 2008, the department has requested $67 billion to carry out these and other activities. While the department carries out some activities directly, such as employing about 15,000 air traffic controllers to make certain that planes stay a safe distance apart, it does not have direct control over the vast majority of activities that it funds, such as local decisions on the priority and placement of airports, public transit, and roads. In other cases, such as railways and pipelines, the infrastructure is owned and operated by industry. This statement presents GAO's views on major transportation challenges facing Congress and the department. It is based on GAO products, including recommendations made, and the products of others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Financing mechanisms for the nation's transportation system are under stress. Our nation's transportation infrastructure is threatened by increasing demand for transportation services, and revenue from traditional funding mechanisms for the nation's highway and aviation systems may be unable to keep pace at current tax rates. In addition, freight traffic is projected to grow substantially, but current planning and financing mechanisms impede public strategies to address needs. Our nation's mobility is threatened because the nation's infrastructure is under great strain. Congestion across modes (e.g., aviation, highways, and rail) is expected to worsen. However, funding by mode and the lack of performance-related goals result in little assurance that funds are being channeled to the most critical mobility concerns and that intermodal approaches can be integrated into the transportation system. Improvements in transportation safety are needed to reduce the number of deaths and injuries from transportation accidents--about 95 percent of which occur on our nation's roads. Increases in congestion across modes as a result of population and economic growth could cause deterioration in transportation safety despite departmental and state efforts to reduce accidents. The transition from the current air traffic control system to a broader and modernized system will be one of the department's most complex undertakings. In previous years, FAA has faced systemic management and acquisition problems that led us to designate its air traffic control modernization program as high risk.

These issues are important for three reasons. First, the  nation\u2019s economic vitality and its citizens\u2019 quality of life depend  significantly on the soundness, safety, and security of its vast  transportation system. This system fuels the nation\u2019s economic engine,  facilitating the movement of goods and people. Second, transportation  solutions are typically expensive, and the federal government\u2019s financial  condition and fiscal outlook are worse than many may understand. This  calls for a reexamination of the goals of transportation policy, how we  hold stakeholders accountable for results, and how programs are financed.  Finally, as an implementer of congressional policy, the Department of  Transportation must be a high-performing agency\u2014one that innovates,  delivers results, is fiscally prudent, and has a workforce that can meet 21st  century challenges.", "My remarks today focus on four primary transportation challenges and  some that are continuing concerns. (See fig. 1.) Some are solely within the  Department of Transportation\u2019s purview; some require congressional  action as well. For the most part, these challenges are the ones that we  identified in 2003 as part of our series of reports of performance and  accountability challenges facing the federal government. This is not  because little or no progress has been made. In many cases there has been  progress. Rather, it is because some of these challenges\u2014such as  improving mobility and transportation safety\u2014are so vast, and the  department\u2019s ability to address them is so indirect, that years of focused  efforts will be needed to see measurable improvements. In addition to our  completed work on these issues, we have a body of ongoing work that  should be of use to Congress and the department as our country moves  forward to improve the design of transportation programs, delivery of  services, and accountability for results (See app. I and a list of related  GAO products at the end of this statement).", "My statement is primarily based on work that we have completed over the  past several years for Congress. We also reviewed assessments of the  Department of Transportation\u2019s activities prepared by its Office of  Inspector General and key departmental documents, such as its budget,  strategic plan, and performance and accountability report. Finally, we  discussed these issues with selected senior officials within the  department. We conducted our work in February 2007 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Financing mechanisms for the nation\u2019s transportation system are  under stress. The efficiency of the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure is  threatened by increasing demand for transportation services, and revenue  from traditional funding mechanisms may be unable to keep pace at  current tax rates. Revenues to support the Highway Trust Fund\u2014the  major source of federal highway and transit funding\u2014are eroding, with  recent estimates forecasting a negative balance of more than $14 billion by  the end of fiscal year 2012. For aviation, there is concern that with the  current funding system, the costs of providing and modernizing air traffic  control services might increase without a corresponding increase in  revenues collected from users. In the future, freight traffic is projected to  grow substantially, putting strain on our nation\u2019s transportation systems,  but current planning and financing mechanisms impede public strategies  to address needs, and industry\u2019s ability to fund its capacity increases to  meet growth is largely uncertain. As a result of these concerns, we  designated financing the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure as a high- risk issue this year.", "The challenges in reforming transportation finance systems are critical to  maintaining and improving our nation\u2019s mobility. The nation\u2019s  infrastructure is under great strain; congestion across modes is significant  and expected to worsen. However, federal funding levels are not linked to  specific performance-related goals and outcomes, resulting in limited  assurance that federal funding is being channeled to the nation\u2019s most  critical mobility needs. Furthermore, federal funding is often tied to a  single transportation mode, which may limit the use of federal funds to  finance the greatest improvements in mobility. It is also unlikely that  mobility can be enhanced unless major modes\u2014air, highway, rail, transit,  and water\u2014are well connected. However, intermodal connections, such as  multimodal passenger terminals and roads that link freight terminals and  major highways, are among the transportation system\u2019s weakest links.", "The department is implementing a number of new initiatives aimed at  mitigating congestion, including providing funds to local governments to  test innovative ideas for curbing congestion and new funding for projects  that have national or regional benefits. In the aviation arena, the Federal  Aviation Administration (FAA) is leading a multiagency effort to transform  the air traffic control system in order to safely handle the projected growth  in the demand for air travel. While these steps are encouraging,  successfully addressing the nation\u2019s mobility needs requires strategic and  intermodal approaches and solutions.", "Improving transportation safety is an imperative. Each year over 44,000  people are killed and over 2.5 million are injured in transportation-related  accidents. Of particular concern is the limited progress in improving safety  on our nation\u2019s roads, where about 95 percent of all transportation  fatalities occur. Projected increases in congestion across modes, as a  result of population and economic growth, could cause deterioration in  transportation safety despite vigorous efforts to reduce accidents. To  address these problems, the department is carrying out a number of  initiatives related to improving aviation, commercial motor carrier,  highway, railroad, and pipeline safety. However, certain areas require  increased attention. In particular, improvements in data, performance  measures, and evaluations are needed to determine whether programs are  achieving intended results. For example, agencies need to develop better  measures of the direct results of their efforts\u2014such as safety  improvements made as a result of enforcement of safety standards\u2014that  contribute toward reductions in accidents. This information can also hold  agencies accountable for the performance of their programs and support  congressional oversight.", "FAA has worked with the Joint Planning and Development Office (JPDO)  to design and plan the Next Generation Air Transportation System  (NextGen) and will face challenges as it moves toward implementation  and integration of NextGen systems. This transition from the current air  traffic control system to the broader and modernized NextGen system will  be one of the Department of Transportation\u2019s most complex undertakings.  In previous years, FAA has faced systemic management and acquisition  problems that led us to designate its air traffic control modernization  program as high risk. FAA has made significant progress in its handling of  air traffic control acquisitions, but a key challenge going forward will be to  institutionalize these improvements and to continuously improve in this  area. FAA and JPDO also need to provide Congress with a valid and  comprehensive estimate of the costs of the NextGen system, including the  identification and costs of necessary research, development, and  demonstration projects. One limited, preliminary estimate concluded that  FAA\u2019s budget under a NextGen scenario would average about $15 billion  per year through 2025, or about $1 billion more annually (in today\u2019s  dollars) on average than FAA\u2019s fiscal year 2006 appropriation. JPDO has  estimated that failure to achieve a timely transition to NextGen could  result in a gap between the demand for air transportation services and  available capacity that could cost the U.S. economy billions of dollars  annually.", "In addition, the department and the transportation sector as a whole face  persistent human capital challenges that put their mission performance  at risk. Both face an impending shortage of people with the skills and  competencies they will need in the future. Furthermore, while the  department has made significant improvements in recent years in its  financial management, it received a qualified opinion on its 2006  financial statements because of material weaknesses related to certain  FAA activities. Finally, the department has retained some responsibilities  and involvement in transportation security and emergency  preparedness and response and is working with the Department of  Homeland Security to further clarify its role."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The safe, efficient, and convenient movement of people and goods  depends on a vibrant transportation system that meets those needs. Our  nation has built a vast transportation system of roads, airways, railways,  pipelines, transit, and waterways that facilitate commerce and improve  our quality of life. The flow of people and goods is enormous: the nation  moved about 5 trillion ton miles of freight and 5 trillion passenger miles of  people in 2004. Spending for commercial, personal, and government  transportation represents about 11 percent of the gross domestic product.  Yet there is a price for this system:  Increasing congestion on the ground and in the air delays the arrival of  people and freight at their destinations and imposes economic losses.  According to Department of Transportation estimates, congestion costs  Americans roughly $200 billion each year.", "The system is expensive to maintain and improve. Total federal, state and  local transportation expenditures are close to $200 billion annually.", "There is a human cost: over 44,000 people are killed in transportation- related accidents and over 2.5 million are injured each year.", "The transportation system is under considerable strain from these factors,  and this strain is expected to increase as the demand to move people and  goods grows resulting from population growth, technological change, and  the increased globalization of the economy. For example, according to the  Transportation Research Board, an expected population growth of 100  million people could double the demand for passenger travel by 2040.  Moreover, this population growth will be concentrated in certain regions  and states, further intensifying the demand for transportation in these  areas.", "The Department of Transportation implements national transportation  policy and administers most federal transportation programs. Its  responsibilities are considerable and reflect the extraordinary scale, use,  and impact of the nation\u2019s transportation system. The department has  multiple missions\u2014primarily focusing on mobility and safety\u2014that are  carried out by several operating administrations. (See table 1.)", "For fiscal year 2008, the President\u2019s budget requested $67 billion to carry  out these and other activities. This budget request would support about  55,000 full-time-equivalent employees.", "The department carries out some activities directly, such as employing  more than 15,000 air traffic controllers to coordinate air traffic to make  certain that planes stay a safe distance apart. However, the vast majority  of its activities are not under its direct control. For example, in recent  years the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) has provided state  governments nearly $34 billion each year to build and improve roads and  bridges and meet other transportation needs. However, for the most part  state and local governments decide which transportation projects have  high priority within their political jurisdictions. Similarly, while the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) encourages the  use of safety belts by the motoring public as a means of saving lives and  reducing injuries, states determine whether and how to punish  noncompliance. In other cases\u2014notably most freight railways and  pipelines\u2014the infrastructure is owned and operated by private companies  and the Department of Transportation regulates the safety of their  transportation operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transportation Challenges Facing Congress and the Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": ["In our view, Congress and the Department of Transportation face four  major transportation challenges\u2014financing the nation\u2019s transportation  system, improving mobility, improving safety, and managing the  transformation of the air traffic control system.

In addition, the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges will constrain  decision makers\u2019 ability to use other revenue sources for transportation  needs. As a result of these concerns, we designated financing the nation\u2019s  transportation infrastructure as a high-risk issue this year.", "Revenues to support the Highway Trust Fund\u2014the major source of federal  highway and transit funding\u2014at the current fuel tax rate are eroding.  While receipts for the Highway Trust Fund, which are derived from motor  fuel and truck-related taxes, are growing, the federal motor fuel tax rate of  18.3 cents per gallon has not been increased since 1993 and inflation has  eroded purchasing power. In addition, increased fuel efficiency and the  advent of alternative-fuel vehicles will further erode trust fund receipts.  While increases in vehicle travel will increase fuel tax revenues, funding  already authorized in recently enacted highway and transit program  legislation is expected to outstrip the growth in trust fund receipts.  According to recent estimates from the Congressional Budget Office and  the President\u2019s budget, the trust fund balance will steadily decline and  reach a negative balance of more than $14 billion by the end of fiscal year  2012. (See fig. 2.) To help remedy this situation, a commission\u2014chaired by  the Secretary of Transportation\u2014will report later this year on  recommendations to place the trust fund on a sustainable path. In  addition, the Department of Transportation\u2019s strategic plan suggests  exploring tolling projects and private sector involvement to address  funding constraints\u2014ideas that some state and local governments are  currently exploring.", "Federal aviation programs are also facing growing infrastructure demands  with constrained resources, and a disruption in the flow of funds may  jeopardize FAA\u2019s ability to carry out its improvement programs. Demand  for air travel has increased in recent years, with over 740 million  passengers flying in fiscal year 2006. Failing to meet infrastructure  challenges in aviation may have significant consequences, since aviation is  an integral part of the economy. To meet anticipated increases in  commercial aviation travel, FAA and aviation stakeholders are developing  new systems to modernize and increase capacity, but it is uncertain  whether the current funding system can generate sufficient revenues to  meet these budgetary needs. FAA and some stakeholders have concerns  that the costs of providing and modernizing air traffic control services  might increase without a corresponding increase in revenues collected  from users. Under one preliminary estimate of modernization costs, FAA\u2019s  budget requirements would, on average, exceed fiscal year 2006  appropriation levels by approximately $1 billion a year (in today\u2019s dollars)  through 2025. To better connect FAA\u2019s revenues with the cost of air traffic  control services that it provides, the President\u2019s budget for fiscal year 2008  has proposed replacing, in fiscal year 2009, FAA\u2019s current excise tax  financing system, built largely around purchases of tickets and aviation  fuel, with a cost-based user fee system. This new system would aim to  recover the costs of providing air traffic control services through user fees  for commercial operators and aviation fuel taxes for general aviation.  However, some stakeholders believe that the current structure has been  effective in funding FAA and can be successful in the future, although  some modifications may be necessary. In addition, the President\u2019s budget  has proposed cutting and reallocating federal funds for developing  projects at the nation\u2019s 3,400 airports. FAA estimates the total cost for  planned airport projects eligible for funding at approximately $42 billion  (in nominal dollars) for fiscal years 2007 through 2011. FAA is also  proposing that Congress allow airports to collect more revenue from other  sources to help offset any reductions. Adding to uncertainty, the current  excise taxes that largely fund FAA revenue are scheduled to expire at the  end of September 2007, unless there is congressional action to renew them  or provide an alternative source of funding to avoid a lapse of revenue in  fiscal year 2008.", "Freight traffic is projected to grow substantially, putting strain on ports,  highways, railroads, and airports, but current public planning and  financing impede strategies to address capacity investment, and industry\u2019s  ability to fund its capacity increases to meet growth is largely uncertain.  Freight mobility\u2014the ability to move goods\u2014is a driver of economic  growth, and increasing congestion and unreliability of transportation  systems can have severe economic consequences. In the future, Congress  is likely to receive funding requests for additional freight projects and face  decisions about the federal role in the nation\u2019s freight infrastructure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Mobility through Intermodal and Modal Approaches", "paragraphs": ["While the federal government has made huge investments in our nation\u2019s  transportation infrastructure in the last 50 years, the expansion of this  infrastructure has not kept pace with needs and the system is currently  under great strain. Congestion across modes\u2014estimated to cost $200  billion per year\u2014is significant and is projected to worsen. For example,  travel on roads is expected to increase by about 25 percent from 2000 to  2010, freight traffic is expected to increase by 92 percent from 2002 to  2035, and demand for air travel is expected to climb by about 35 percent  from 2006 to 2015. To help address congestion concerns, the federal  government spends billions of dollars each year to build, maintain,  operate, and improve the nation\u2019s aging transportation system. As  congestion increases, federal policymakers face the challenge of ensuring  that funds are used efficiently in order to prevent congestion from  overwhelming the system. However, currently there is little assurance that  the projects selected and funded best meet national goals for meeting the  nation\u2019s mobility needs.", "The department and Congress have recently taken a number of new  actions to address this major threat to our nation\u2019s economic growth and  quality of life. In May 2006, the department announced a national strategy  that will provide $175 million to local governments to demonstrate and  test innovative ideas for curbing congestion. Certain large-scale pilot  projects would be chosen based on their sponsors\u2019 willingness to  implement a comprehensive congestion reduction strategy, including  congestion pricing, commuter transit services, and commitments from  businesses to expand flexible work schedules. The strategy also includes  initiatives to encourage private sector investment in transportation  infrastructure, promote the use of operational and technological  improvements, address major freight bottlenecks, and accelerate major  aviation capacity projects, among other things. The department is also  implementing a number of new initiatives to mitigate congestion that were  called for in the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation  Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), including programs to  allow states to monitor, in real-time, traffic conditions on major highways  and new funding for projects that have national or regional benefits. In  addition, SAFETEA-LU established a commission that will report on ways  to raise revenue for highway and transit projects and also reduce the costs  of congestion. Finally, in the aviation arena, FAA is the primary  implementer of a multiagency effort to transform the air traffic control  system in order to safely handle projected growth in the demand for air  travel. I will further discuss this effort later in my statement.", "While these steps are encouraging, successfully addressing the nation\u2019s  mobility challenges requires strategic and intermodal approaches and  solutions. The nation faces a growing fiscal crisis that challenges it to  fundamentally reexamine existing government programs and  commitments and to make tough choices in setting priorities and linking  resources to results. In particular, the Highway Trust Fund\u2014the largest  source of federal funding for transportation\u2014was created in 1956 for the  purpose of constructing the interstate highway system and, although that  system is now complete, the basic construct of the program, in terms of  financing and delivery mechanisms, has not changed. In addition, this and  other federal transportation programs do not have mechanisms to link  funding levels with the accomplishment of specific performance-related  goals and outcomes related to mobility. Most highway grant programs are  apportioned by formula, without regard to the needs or capacity of  recipients. In addition, the preponderance of evidence suggests that  federal-aid highway grants have influenced state and local governments to  substitute federal funds for state and local funds that otherwise would  have been spent on highways. State and local governments have broad  flexibility to select most projects that receive federal funding. As such,  there is little assurance that the projects selected and funded best meet  national goals for addressing the nation\u2019s mobility needs. Intercity  passenger rail service is also at a critical juncture, with the existing system  in poor condition and federal subsidies\u2014over $1 billion annually in recent  years\u2014not targeted to the greatest public benefits, including congestion  relief.", "Furthermore, transportation programs and funding mechanisms are  largely stovepiped by modes of transportation. For example, while  passenger and freight travel occurs on all modes, federal funding and  planning requirements focus largely on highway, transit, and aviation  passenger travel. This framework makes it difficult for intermodal projects  and other modal projects (e.g., freight or passenger rail) to be integrated  into the transportation system. We have found, for example, that the  limited visibility that freight projects receive in the process for planning  and prioritizing transportation projects as well as the lack of a  comprehensive evaluation approach, such as a cost-benefit framework,  impedes the implementation of improvements to better ensure that  systemwide, multimodal solutions are considered and adopted where  appropriate. It is unlikely that mobility can be enhanced unless major  modes\u2014air, highway, rail, transit, and water\u2014are well connected.  However, intermodal connections, such as multimodal passenger  terminals and roads that link freight terminals and major highways, are  among the transportation system\u2019s weakest links.", "The critical issues facing Congress and the department to effectively  address congestion problems and enhance the nation\u2019s mobility include:    How narrowly or broadly should the federal role be defined?", "Should federal programs be more closely aligned with specific national  interests and purposes, such as interstate freight mobility?", "Should formulas be revised to better consider need, performance,  capacity, and effort by states and localities?", "Can intermodal solutions be effectively carried out within the existing  federal modal program framework, or is another model needed?", "Finally, a high priority should be maximizing the benefits of federal  investments in transportation infrastructure and ensuring accountability  for results. Each year, FHWA distributes billions of dollars\u2014$34.2 billion  in fiscal year 2006\u2014to state governments for projects aimed at improving  the nation\u2019s highway systems. However, we have found that often  formal  analyses are not used in deciding among alternative projects, projects  often do not meet anticipated outcomes, and evaluations of outcomes are  not typically conducted. Furthermore, we have reported on the need for  improving accountability for results in FHWA\u2019s oversight of projects,  through goals and performance measures, for example. The agency has  made progress in this area, partly in response to mandated improvements  in SAFETEA-LU, but a continued focus on efforts to improve  accountability will be important. Finally, FAA provides funds to airport  operators to provide increased capacity at the nation\u2019s airports and has  estimated that the total cost for planned projects eligible for federal grants  for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 will be $42 billion. While changes the  Administration is proposing may reduce the amount FAA provides, it will  be essential to ensure that public benefits from these investments are  maximized."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Transportation Safety", "paragraphs": ["Each year, tens of thousands of people are killed and millions are injured  in transportation accidents in the United States. In 2005 alone, over 44,000  people were killed and over 2.5 million were injured in highway, aviation,  railroad, transit, and pipeline accidents. (See fig. 3.) Motor vehicle  crashes, in particular, exact an enormous personal and economic toll on  this country and are the leading cause of death for people aged 3 through  33. While transportation safety has improved considerably over the past 4  decades, in recent years, fatalities have plateaued. Since the highest pay- off actions\u2014such as improvements in vehicle crashworthiness and  increases in seat belt use\u2014have occurred, future progress will be more  difficult. Of particular concern is the limited progress in improving safety  on our nation\u2019s roads, where about 95 percent of all transportation  fatalities occur. Furthermore, motorcycle fatalities have steadily increased  over the past decade (to over 4,500 in 2005). While nonhighway modes of  travel are much safer, safety in these modes\u2014such as aviation and rail\u2014is  also a major concern because when accidents occur, they can have  catastrophic consequences. Projected increases in congestion across  modes, as a result of population and economic growth, could cause a  deterioration in transportation safety in the future despite vigorous efforts  to reduce accidents.", "To address these problems, the department has designated improving  safety as its highest priority. Its efforts to improve surface transportation  safety are wide-ranging and include programs to change driver  behaviors\u2014such as alcohol use and speeding\u2014that cause accidents;  enhance motor vehicle safety; improve the safety of highway and  intersection infrastructure; and improve safety performance in the motor  carrier, railroad, transit, and pipeline industries. SAFETEA-LU established  an incentive grant program\u2014which has been quite successful\u2014to  encourage states to pass primary seat belt laws. SAFETEA-LU also  mandated a number of other promising new initiatives, including a grant  program for highway safety that provides states with flexibility to target  funds to their most critical safety needs. Under this program, states are  required to prepare strategic highway safety plans, based on an analysis of  safety data, and to assess results. FAA focuses on improving safety in  commercial aviation, in which accidents are rare but have the potential for  a large loss of life, as well as in general aviation. The agency\u2019s safety  activities include air traffic control as well as certification and inspection  of various participants in the aviation industry, such as commercial  airlines, flight schools, and aircraft manufacturers.", "While the department\u2019s many efforts to improve transportation safety are  to be commended, certain areas require increased attention. In particular,  improvements in data, performance measures, and evaluations are needed  to determine whether programs are achieving intended results. For  example, in reviewing certain programs of the Federal Motor Carrier  Safety Administration aimed at improving driver behavior, we found that,  in some cases, funds were being directed to initiatives that lacked  information on whether they worked and that evaluations of program  impacts were not planned for a number of years. In reviewing a NHTSA  grant program to help states improve the quality of their traffic safety data,  we found that the agency did not have an effective process in place for  monitoring progress. We have also found that the effectiveness of the  department\u2019s efforts to oversee and improve the safety performance of  airlines, truck companies, pipeline companies, and railroads is unclear  because of limitations in data, performance measures, and evaluation.  For example, agencies need to develop better measures of the direct  results of their efforts\u2014such as safety improvements made as a result of  enforcement of safety standards\u2014that contribute toward reductions in  accidents. Performance measures and evaluations, supported by  appropriate data, provide managers with information on program results  that helps them make decisions that can improve performance, including  decisions to refine programs and adjust policies and priorities. This  information can also hold agencies accountable for the performance of  their programs and support congressional oversight. While agencies have  been making progress in this area in response to our recommendations as  well as some mandated improvements in SAFETEA-LU, it is important that  the department continue to improve information on the performance of its  safety programs to have greater assurance that they are producing desired  effects.", "Furthermore, the department\u2019s ability to maintain the high level of safety  in the aviation industry will depend to a large extent on FAA\u2019s ability to  hire, train, and deploy its primary workforce, including safety inspectors  and air traffic controllers. FAA must overcome several key challenges in  this area. Planned changes in the agency\u2019s oversight approach for air  carriers will result in workload shifts for its inspectors that will make it  important for FAA to improve its staffing process. In addition, the agency  plans to hire almost 12,000 new air traffic controllers by 2015 to replace  retiring controllers and accommodate increases in air traffic and will need  to train these new controllers and incorporate them into its workforce."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managing the Transition to the Next Generation Air Transportation System", "paragraphs": ["The current approach to managing air transportation is becoming  increasingly inefficient and operationally obsolete. In 2003, Congress  authorized the creation of the JPDO, housed within FAA, to plan for and  coordinate the transition to NextGen, a complex and ambitious  multiagency undertaking that is intended to upgrade the system by 2025 to  safely accommodate increased air traffic. As the primary implementer of  the transition to NextGen, FAA faces challenges in moving from planning  to implementation, including institutionalizing management reforms it has  made in recent years, obtaining financial and technical resources and  expertise, and collaborating with JPDO on planning efforts. If FAA does  not meet these challenges, the realization of NextGen goals could be  severely compromised.

However, FAA has made significant progress in recent years.  For example, FAA established the Air Traffic Organization to operate and  modernize the air traffic control system. This organization is headed by a  Chief Operating Officer who has focused on implementing more  businesslike management and acquisition processes to address cost,  schedule, and performance shortfalls that plagued air traffic control  modernization in the past. FAA has reduced organizational stovepipes,  increased accountability for costs, and begun investment reviews of major  acquisitions. FAA has reported meeting its acquisition cost and schedule  goals for the last 3 years.", "JPDO has completed some initial planning necessary for implementing  NextGen. For example, JPDO has been developing an enterprise  architecture, or technical blueprint, that it expects will provide more  clarity regarding its expectations for NextGen, thereby facilitating (1)  coordination among JPDO\u2019s partner agencies and private sector  manufacturers, (2) alignment across agencies of research and  development activities with the blueprint, and (3) integration of  modernized systems in a way that minimizes overlap and duplication and  maximizes integration. As we reported in November 2006, a limited,  preliminary cost estimate concluded that FAA\u2019s budget under a NextGen  scenario would average about $15 billion per year through 2025, or about  $1 billion more annually (in today\u2019s dollars), on average, than FAA\u2019s fiscal  year 2006 appropriation.", "Despite its progress, as the key implementer of NextGen, FAA needs to  institutionalize improvements made and continuously improve. For  example, we recommended that, before making decisions to fund systems  already in service, FAA re-evaluate projects\u2019 alignment with strategic goals  and objectives, but FAA\u2019s acquisition management guidance does not  clearly indicate if this is yet the case. The agency developed a cost  estimating methodology, but has yet to implement it, as well as a  framework for improving system management capabilities, but has yet to  institutionalize it. Additionally, we recently recommended that FAA  examine its strengths and weaknesses with regard to the technical  expertise and contract management expertise necessary to transition to  NextGen. In response, FAA is considering convening a blue ribbon panel  to make recommendations, which we believe could help the agency begin  to address this concern.", "JPDO faces challenges in coordinating agencies and continuing planning  necessary for implementation of NextGen. For example, work remains to  synchronize NextGen\u2019s enterprise architecture with the partner agencies\u2019  planning documents and to keep the necessary research and development  on track. In addition, JPDO has yet to provide Congress with a valid,  comprehensive estimate of the costs to JPDO partner agencies for the  required research, development, systems acquisitions, and systems  integration. Finally, continuing collaboration between JPDO and the  Office of Management and Budget is needed to allow the budget agency to  make funding decisions based on a unified NextGen program. The  Congressional Research Service has pointed out that Congress may  examine options to align the budgets of the agencies involved, given that  JPDO does not have authority over funding, personnel, and resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Building Human Capital Strategies", "paragraphs": ["The department and the transportation sector as a whole face persistent  human capital challenges that put their mission performance at risk.  Building human capital strategies that will allow the department and the  transportation sector to attract, hire, and retain an effective workforce is  an overarching issue that directly affects their ability to respond to the  challenges I have outlined today. In particular, both are confronted with  an impending shortage of skilled people that threatens to have serious  short- and long-term consequences. For example, FAA alone expects to  lose about 10,000, or 70 percent, of its air traffic controllers over the next  10 years, mostly due to retirement. For the department and the  transportation sector as a whole, the growing demand for transportation  services will collide with the reality of fewer people entering  transportation-related fields. Further complicating this shortage, changes  in intergovernmental responsibilities for delivering transportation  services, new travel patterns, advances in technology, and changed public  expectations are redefining the competencies and skills that are needed.  Increasingly, transportation will require more diverse, sophisticated  management and technical competencies than ever before.", "The department has acknowledged that accomplishing its mission  depends on a strategic approach to human capital, and it is taking steps to  adopt such an approach. For example, in 2005, the agency piloted a  program to expand entry-level hiring in mission-critical occupations. Also,  in 2006, the agency increased its investments in human capital by 48  percent. Furthermore, the agency is working to align its human capital  initiatives to meet the President\u2019s Management Agenda. In the  department\u2019s current performance and accountability report, the Office of  Management and Budget awarded the department top marks for current  and prospective progress on its human capital initiative. However, the  department has not convinced its workforce about these results. In the  results of the 2006 federal employee human capital survey, the employees  scored the department lower in each of the four broad areas than they did  in 2004, when the survey was last conducted. Among the 36 federal  agencies surveyed, the department finished in the bottom 10 for talent  management and job satisfaction and in the bottom 3 for fostering a  results-oriented performance culture and for leadership and knowledge  management. The department will need to take further actions to address  these issues, to improve its ability to respond to the challenges it faces.", "Across the transportation sector, transportation agencies are also taking  steps to improve human capital practices, by identifying organizational  and staff competency needs, as well as other gaps. They are also beginning  to investigate nontraditional sources for qualified employees, such as  highly qualified retirees from other organizations, as well as ways to  develop individual competencies by training the existing workforce. While  these efforts are promising, these agencies vary widely, and although each  has its own unique capabilities and resources to address workforce needs,  all have limited resources. Furthermore, few have addressed their future  workforce needs comprehensively, which further complicates efforts to  predict how many people in specific job categories for each type of agency  will be needed in 5 or 10 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fostering Improved Departmental Financial Management", "paragraphs": ["In 2003, we cited financial management as a major challenge facing the  Department of Transportation, specifically, identifying weaknesses in the  accuracy and reliability of FAA\u2019s financial information. In recent years,  the department has made significant progress in managing its finances,  including substantial improvements in FAA\u2019s financial management  systems and practices. Improvements have included installing a  departmentwide financial system, including a new general ledger system  and integrated property systems at FAA, as well as receiving unqualified  opinions on its financial statements from auditors for several fiscal years  in a row. As a result of this progress, in 2005, we removed FAA\u2019s financial  management from our high-risk list.", "While progress has been made, work remains to ensure that the  Department of Transportation soundly manages its finances and accounts  for its use of federal and other funds. For fiscal year 2006, the department  received a qualified opinion on its financial statements and the auditors  cited two material internal control weaknesses. This qualified opinion  resulted from a material weakness at FAA relating to management\u2019s  inability to support the accuracy and completeness of a $4.7 billion  account used for equipment and facility projects. The department\u2019s Office  of the Inspector General has reported that correcting this deficiency will  be critical for FAA to meet its stated goal of sound financial management.  The other material weakness involves the financial management,  reporting, and oversight of the Highway Trust Fund agencies. During  fiscal year 2006, trust fund agencies implemented significant  improvements over several previously reported deficiencies. However,  weaknesses remained in several areas, including a lack of policies and  procedures to ensure more timely correction of any abnormal account  balances and concerns with the preparation and analysis of financial  statements. The Inspector General has listed several additional steps to  further improve oversight of the trust fund, including better detection of  improper payments and development of realistic project cost estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Transportation Security and Emergency Preparedness and Response", "paragraphs": ["The size and interconnectedness of the nation\u2019s transportation systems  make it highly difficult to secure against attack. In 2003, we cited  transforming transportation security as a major challenge facing the  Department of Transportation. In recent years, Congress has shifted  many of the department\u2019s security responsibilities to the Department of  Homeland Security, which now has primary responsibility for securing the  nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure, including aviation, railroad,  pipeline, and other systems. The Department of Transportation has  retained some involvement in securing transportation infrastructure, in  part, due to overlap with its safety efforts involving freight, including the  transportation of hazardous materials, and passenger rail. In light of these  changes, the department faces the challenge of working with the  Department of Homeland Security to clarify its remaining role in securing  the nation\u2019s transportation infrastructure. The sheer number of  stakeholders involved in securing transportation modes can sometimes  lead to communication challenges, duplication of effort, and confusion  about roles and responsibilities. For example, the department\u2019s safety  standards have at times conflicted with the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s security standards. Both departments have begun efforts to  strengthen coordination and cooperation to promote the security of the  transportation system. The departments have signed a memorandum of  understanding to define broad areas of responsibility for each department  and to delineate specific security related roles, responsibilities, resources,  and commitments for mass transit, rail, and other matters. However, the  departments\u2019 coordination efforts in this area are ongoing.", "The department also coordinates with the Department of Homeland  Security in developing protective measures affecting transportation and  has statutory roles related to emergency preparedness, response, and  recovery. This encompasses programs like FHWA\u2019s Emergency Relief  program, which provides funding to states to repair or reconstruct  highways and roads damaged or destroyed in disasters. During times of  disaster, the department plays a significant role as the lead and supporting  agency for coordinating transportation support. In this role, it is primarily  responsible for coordinating the provision of federal and civil  transportation services, as well as the recovery and restoration of  transportation infrastructure, among other things. In the future, the  department will be tasked to further clarify its roles and responsibilities  with the Department of Homeland Security in planning for and providing  evacuation assistance. Catastrophic disasters like Hurricane Katrina  demonstrate the importance of transportation preparedness and response  to ensure the safe evacuation of citizens in emergencies when state and  local governments are overwhelmed. Yet the department\u2019s  responsibilities in providing evacuation assistance have not been entirely  clear. In addition, despite recent progress by the federal government in  providing evacuation assistance, gaps remain. For example, the  Department of Homeland Security has not yet clarified, in the federal  government\u2019s plan for disaster response, the leading, coordinating, and  supporting federal agencies to provide evacuation assistance when state  and local governments are overwhelmed, and what their responsibilities  are. One White House report recommended that the Department of  Transportation be designated as the agency responsible for developing the  federal government\u2019s capability to carry out mass evacuations when state  and local governments are overwhelmed.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
