Because competitive outsourcing can potentially displace thousands of government employees, federal agencies, including DOD components, traditionally approached competitive sourcing hesitantly. Thus, with a combination of institutional preference to maintain in-house control over activities, along with restrictive legislative provisions in effect between the late 1980s through 1994, DOD activities placed relatively little emphasis on competitive sourcing during that time. The limited competitions that did occur most often involved the Air Force. However, in 1995, with congressional and administration initiatives placing more emphasis on competitive sourcing as a means of achieving greater economies and efficiencies in operations, DOD\u2019s senior leadership embraced it as a means of achieving savings and freeing up funds for other priority needs. In August 1995, the Deputy Secretary of Defense directed the services to make outsourcing a priority. Subsequently, DOD placed emphasis on competitive sourcing, recognizing that both the public and private sectors are parties to the competitions. This new emphasis led to plans by the services to consider studying over 200,000 positions by the end of fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Circular A-76 Process", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s competitive sourcing is guided by OMB\u2019s Circular A-76, issued in 1966. In 1979, OMB supplemented the circular with a handbook that included procedures for competitively determining whether commercial activities should be performed in-house, by another federal agency through an interservice support agreement, or by the private sector. OMB updated this handbook in August 1983 and in March 1996. The latest revision was intended to reduce the administrative burden of performing A-76 competitions and to make cost comparisons between private sector proposals and government estimates more equitable. For example, in response to industry concerns that agencies were not fully accounting for their overhead costs, OMB imposed the requirement that government overhead costs be calculated based on a standard rate of 12 percent of direct labor costs and placed increased emphasis on the use of best value criteria in competitions.", "To compare costs of in-house versus contractor performance, OMB\u2019s supplemental handbook requires the government to determine the most efficient and effective way of performing an activity with in-house staff. Based on this most efficient organization (MEO), the government prepares an in-house cost estimate and compares it with the offer selected from the private sector. OMB\u2019s A-76 guidance stipulates that work will remain in-house unless the private sector offer meets a threshold of savings that is at least 10 percent of personnel costs or $10 million over the performance period. The minimum cost differential was established by OMB to ensure that the government would not contract out for marginal estimated savings.

DOD also requires that each service enter the original baseline cost of the function and the estimated dollar savings from each of the competitions into CAMIS and track actual costs and savings from the completed competitions for  3 years. We have previously reported some concerns about the accuracy and completeness of data contained in the CAMIS system. A list of our recent reports on competitive sourcing issues is included at the end of this report.", "DOD\u2019s data on cost comparisons completed between fiscal year 1978 and 1994 show that estimated savings occurred\u2014usually through a reduction in personnel\u2014regardless of whether the government or a private sector company was awarded the work. These estimated savings were achieved primarily by closely examining the work to be done and reengineering the activities to do them with fewer personnel, whether in-house or outsourced.

In March 1997, we reported that prior savings estimates were based on initial savings estimates from competitive sourcing competitions, but that expected savings can change over time with changes in scope of work or mandated wage changes. Further, we noted that continuing budget and personnel reductions could make it difficult to sustain the levels of previously projected savings. At the same time, we noted two areas of competitive sourcing that appeared to offer the potential for significant savings.

One appeal, however, did not meet this criteria and was dismissed. Of the appeals accepted for consideration, only one resulted in a reversal of the original award decision. The private sector competitor stated that the government in-house estimate did not include all relevant costs, and the agency\u2019s reviewing authority agreed. When these costs were included in the government\u2019s estimate, the private sector firm\u2019s price was lower. In addition to the 10 appeals cited above, we identified one protest to GAO from one of the private sector competitors. GAO upheld the service\u2019s decision to retain the activity in-house.", "We also examined the files of a sample of nine completed competitions and conducted interviews with officials associated with completing the competitions and satisfied ourselves that the required cost comparisons were made as required by A-76 guidelines. In eight instances, we found that the agencies had elected to conduct public/private competitions and cost comparisons even where the number of civilian employees involved was less than 10, and according to A-76 guidance, direct conversions could have been made without competition. Agency officials said that they conducted a cost comparison on these functions, because they felt it was fairer to the employees.

However, the percent won by the private sector was closer to the Air Force\u2019s historic average of 60 percent. At the same time, when considering all competitions completed in the October 1995 through March 1998 time frame, the percentage of competitions won by the private and public sectors fluctuated over time. For example, for 26 competitions completed in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, 77 percent were won by the private sector. This contrasted with 27 competitions completed between October 1997 and March 1998, where 56 percent were won by the private sector.", "We also analyzed the results to determine whether any differences existed among winners depending on whether competitions involved single or multiple functions. We found that 43 of the competitions involved single functions, while 10 involved multiple functions. However, the outcomes were the same for each grouping, with 60 percent being won by the private sector.", "We further analyzed the results to determine to what extent the use of a standardized 12-percent overhead rate imposed on government cost estimates may have affected the outcome of the competitions. As previously noted, the private sector has historically registered concerns about the extent to which government activities fully account for costs of their operations in developing MEOs under the A-76 process. Also, some concerns existed on the public side that the new overhead rate could cause more competitions to be won by the private sector. As noted in our February 1998 report, in reviewing development of this overhead rate, we found that the 12-percent rate lacked an analytical basis. As a result, it could either understate or overstate overhead costs in any specific/particular competition.", "We found that 39 (74 percent) had used the 12-percent overhead rate. Of those, 54 percent were won by the private sector. The remaining 14 competitions were not required to use this rate because they were either completed prior to its implementation or were in the final stages of the process.

The Army does not have official guidance on determining savings. However, we found the Army calculates the baseline cost by multiplying baseline workyears by the average cost per workyear in the MEO estimate. Savings are then calculated by subtracting the winning contract price or MEO estimate from the baseline cost. By using the average cost per workyear in the MEO estimate, savings are determined in terms of current year dollars.", "Projected Defense Finance and Accounting Service savings were calculated using an estimate of baseline costs prior to the competitions, while projected savings of the Defense Commissary Agency were calculated by taking the difference between the MEO and the private sector contractor\u2019s offer, according to respective agency officials.", "A Navy official told us there is currently no official Navy guidance on how to determine savings. He also said that if an activity has determined a baseline cost of operations, savings can be determined by subtracting the winning offer from the baseline. However, if no baseline information is available, the difference between the MEO and a winning contractor\u2019s offer, for example, may be used to estimate savings.

In March 1997, we reported that historic difficulties in preparing good performance work statements had often required revisions. We noted that those revisions and changes in required labor rates and other factors can require contract modifications and adjustments to costs of work to be done. To the extent performance work statements need to be subsequently adjusted because they do not adequately capture the scope of work to be done, initial savings baseline estimates are overstated.", "Although most of the competitions included in our review had only been completed for about 15 months or less, we found that changes in performance work statements had occurred in 18 of the 53 competitions. Some changes were due to inadequate initial statements of work; many others were due to new missions or work requirements that were not known at the time the performance work statement was written.", "Two contracts had to be recompeted because of inadequate performance work statements. For example, a contract for grounds maintenance at Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, had to be terminated because the performance work statement did not adequately reflect the work that had to be done. Subsequently, it has taken a year to rewrite this statement and resolicit the function, according to a base official. In another instance, a performance work statement was modified after award for aircraft maintenance according to an Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma, official, to increase inspections on C-141 aircraft included in the original statement of work, as well as adding work involving support for the C-17 aircraft. The C-17 aircraft was assigned to Altus after the cost comparison had been completed. An Air Force official said that they do not adjust estimated savings once performance periods begin because changes frequently occur in performance work statements that make it difficult to determine actual savings.", "Also, since savings estimates are based on the winner successfully performing the function for the entire award period, savings from the competitions may diminish, for example, if contracts are terminated before the end of this period. Of the 32 competitions that were won by the private sector, 4 were terminated within 14 to 26 months.

We also met with contracting and other installation officials at four installations and the Defense Finance and Accounting Service where the A-76 competitions were conducted to review and discuss in detail the process followed for the nine selected competitions. To determine if the nine competitions were in compliance, we compared agency procedures with the protocols outlined in the A-76 handbook. The competitions selected for detailed review were storage and warehousing, Fort Riley, Kansas; dining facility, Fort Sam Houston, Texas; Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station, Stockton, California; aircraft maintenance, Altus Air Force Base, Oklahoma; base operating support, Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas; base operating support and aircraft maintenance, Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida; regional jet engine maintenance, Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas; base operating support, Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi; and facilities, logistics, and administration services, Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Denver, Colorado; Indianapolis, Indiana; Kansas City, Missouri; Cleveland, Ohio; and Columbus, Ohio. With the exception of the Air Force, to determine the estimated dollar savings from each of the competitions, we contacted the contracting officials who were responsible for each of the A-76 competitions. The savings information for all Air Force competitions is determined centrally at the Air Force\u2019s Innovations Center, Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. In addition, for two of the three competitions completed by the Navy, we obtained the estimated dollar savings from Center for Naval Analyses reports. We also discussed the methodology used to determine savings with officials from the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, and the Defense Commissary Agency. We did not independently verify the savings estimates or the number of positions reduced.", "To determine the factors that could affect the actual savings achieved from the competitions, we analyzed the data obtained on each of the competitions, and reviewed prior reports on outsourcing.", "We performed our review from September 1997 to November 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Defense, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Commandant of the Marine Corps; the Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interested congressional committees.

The solid lines indicate the process used when the government issues an Invitation for Bids, requesting firm bids on the cost of performing a commercial activity. This type of process is normally used for more routine commercial activities, such as grass-cutting or cafeteria operations, where the work process and requirements are well defined. The dotted lines indicate the additional steps that take place when the government wants to pursue a negotiated, \u201cbest value\u201d procurement. While it may not be appropriate for use in all cases, this type of process is often used when the commercial activity involves high levels of complexity, expertise, and risk.", "Most Efficient Organization (MEO) activities Additional steps required for request for  proposals (RFP)", "The circular requires the government to develop a performance work statement. This statement, which is incorporated into either the Invitation for Bids or Request for Proposals, serves as the basis for both government estimates and private sector offers. If the Invitation for Bid process is used, each private sector company develops and submits a bid, giving its firm price for performing the commercial activity. While this process is taking place, the government activity performs a management study to determine the most efficient and effective way of performing the activity with in-house staff. Based on this \u201cmost efficient organization,\u201d the government develops a cost estimate and submits it to the selecting authority. The selecting authority concurrently opens the government\u2019s estimate along with the bids of all private sector firms.", "According to OMB\u2019s A-76 guidance, the government\u2019s in-house estimate wins the competition unless the private sector\u2019s offer meets a threshold of savings that is at least 10 percent of direct personnel costs or $10 million over the performance period. This minimum cost differential was established by OMB to ensure that the government would not contract out for marginal estimated savings.", "If the Request for Proposals\u2014best value process\u2014is used, the Federal Procurement Regulation and the A-76 supplemental handbook require several additional steps. The private sector offerors submit proposals that often include a technical performance proposal and a price. The government prepares an in-house management plan and cost estimate based strictly on the performance work statement. On the other hand, private sector proposals can offer a higher level of performance or service.", "The government\u2019s selection authority reviews the private sector proposals to determine which one represents the best overall value to the government based on such considerations as (1) higher performance levels, (2) lower proposal risk, (3) better past performance, and (4) cost to do the work. After the completion of this analysis, the selection authority prepares a written justification supporting its decision. This includes the basis for selecting a contractor other than the one that offered the lowest price to the government. Next, the authority evaluates the government\u2019s offer and determines whether it can achieve the same level of performance and quality as the selected private sector proposal. If not, the government must then make changes to meet the performance standards accepted by the authority. This ensures that the in-house cost estimate is based upon the same scope of work and performance levels as the best value private sector offer. After determining that the offers are based on the same level of performance, the cost estimates are compared. As with the Invitation for Bids process, the work will remain in-house unless the private offer is (1) 10 percent less in direct personnel costs or (2) $10 million less over the performance period.", "Participants in the process\u2014for either the Invitation for Bids or Request for Proposals process\u2014may appeal the selection authority\u2019s decision if they believe the costs submitted by one or more of the participants were not fair, accurate, or calculated in the manner prescribed by the A-76 handbook."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "List of OMB Circular A-76 Competitions Completed October 1995 Through March 1998", "paragraphs": ["Positions competed (Civ./mil.)", "Positions reduced (Civ./mil.)", "29 civ.", "29 civ.", "13 civ.", "15 civ.", "22 civ.", "22 civ.", "1 mil.  30 civ.", "1 mil. 29 civ.", "23 civ.", "39 civ.", "11 civ.", "11 civ.", "Maxwell AFB, AL Fuels management 16 mil.  7 civ.", "11 mil.", "Laughlin AFB, TX Base operating 177 mil. 101 civ.", "177 mil 93 civ.", "Keesler AFB, MS Ground  13 civ.", "29 civ.", "1,401 mil. 43 civ.", "692 mil. 17 civ.", "14 civ.", "13 civ.", "34 civ.", "32 civ.
