Among other things, the 1996 Act included a new provision, which is called expedited removal, for dealing with aliens who attempt to enter the United States by engaging in fraud or misrepresentation (e.g., falsely claiming to be a U.S. citizen or misrepresenting a material fact) or who arrive with fraudulent, improper, or no documents (e.g., visa or passport). The expedited removal provision, which went into effect on April 1, 1997, reduces an alien\u2019s right to seek review of a determination of inadmissibility decision.", "In the years preceding the passage of the 1996 Act, concerns were raised about the difficulty of preventing illegal aliens from entering the United States and the difficulty of identifying and removing the illegal aliens once they entered this country. The expedited removal process was designed to prevent aliens who attempt to enter the United States by engaging in fraud or misrepresentation or who arrive without proper documents from entering this country at our ports of entry.", "Several legal services organizations and individual aliens have challenged the constitutionality of the expedited removal process established by the 1996 Act (see app. I for a discussion of these court cases).

This requirement remains applicable under the 1996 Act. INS has about 4,500 inspectors and about 260 staffed ports of entry. Generally, aliens provide inspectors with documents that show they are authorized to enter this country. At this primary inspection, the INS inspector either permits the aliens to enter or sends the aliens for a more detailed review of their documents or further questioning by another INS inspector. The more detailed review is called secondary inspection. In deciding whether to admit the alien, the INS inspector is to review the alien\u2019s documents for accuracy and validity and check INS\u2019 and other agencies\u2019 databases for any information that could affect the alien\u2019s admissibility. After reviewing the alien\u2019s documents and interviewing the alien at the secondary inspection, the inspector may either admit or deny admission to the alien or take other discretionary action. INS can prohibit aliens from entering the United States for a number of reasons (e.g., criminal activity or failing to have a valid visa, passport, or other required documents).

During this hearing, aliens who said they had a fear of persecution if they were returned to their home country could file an application for asylum. The immigration judges\u2019 decisions could be appealed to EOIR\u2019s Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which is a quasi-judicial body that hears appeals of INS\u2019 and immigration judges\u2019 decisions. Furthermore, the alien could appeal BIA\u2019s decision through the federal court system. The scope of the federal court\u2019s review was limited to whether the government followed established procedures. Aliens who were excluded from entering the United States under this process generally were barred from reentering this country for 1 year.

We selected San Ysidro (CA), as a southern land port; Niagara Falls (NY), as a northern land port; and Miami International, Los Angeles International, and John Fitzgerald Kennedy International (JFK) Airports. According to INS, these ports were expected to have large volumes of expedited removal orders, and the airports were anticipated to have a large number of credible fear referrals.

The penalty for inadmissible aliens, including those subject to expedited removal, generally increased from the aliens\u2019 being prohibited from entry in the United States for 1 year in the pre-1996 Act exclusion process to being prohibited from entry for 5 years under the post-1996 Act expedited removal process. Furthermore, inspectors have added responsibility to identify aliens who have a fear of returning to their home country.

INS would present evidence and examine and cross-examine the alien and witnesses. At the end of the hearing, the judge would render a decision, such as (1) exclude the alien (i.e., not allow him/her to enter the United States); (2) grant the alien relief from exclusion (i.e., allow the alien to enter this country); or (3) permit the alien to withdraw his or her application for admission (i.e., allow the alien to voluntarily leave the country).", "Either the alien or INS (or both) could appeal the immigration judge\u2019s decision to BIA.

The district court\u2019s review was limited to determining if the government followed established procedures (e.g., that a fair hearing was held, that INS followed its regulations, and that the immigration judge\u2019s decision was supported by the record). The alien then could appeal an adverse district court decision to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and, ultimately, to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The group consists of representatives from the Offices of Inspections, International Affairs, Asylum, Detention and Deportation, Field Operations, and General Counsel. One way in which the group carries out its duties is through visits to INS field units where group members review case files and meet with management and staff involved in the expedited removal process to discuss such things as resource materials, the process, and policy issues. Among other things, the Working Group has provided additional written guidance on the taking of sworn statements and on when to permit aliens to withdraw their applications. INS established an Asylum Office quality assurance team at headquarters to review selected credible fear files. According to INS officials, the quality assurance team is to focus on credible fear determination issues, while the Expedited Removal Working Group is to focus on the entire expedited removal process, including asylum and inspection. This quality assurance team consists of four asylum officers who are to analyze decisions in individual cases, provide feedback to applicable asylum officers, and identify trends or patterns on the basis of the reviews. Initially, the feedback to asylum officers was informal and each member of the group used his or her own review method. Beginning January 2, 1998, the team is to use a checklist to standardize the monitoring and to review all negative credible fear determinations before the decision is served on the alien. The team is to prepare monthly reports that are to address problems faced by all offices and is to address serious problems immediately. INS\u2019 Office of Internal Audit examines field unit functions and operations. The objectives of these reviews include evaluating units\u2019 effectiveness and determining compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and procedures. Beginning in April 1997, the audits were to include reviewing the expedited removal process. In chapter 2, we discussed OIA\u2019s first report that included the expedited removal process.", "As part of its efforts to communicate with outside entities that deal with immigration issues, INS has met periodically with nongovernmental organizations to discuss issues related to the expedited removal process, including the credible fear process. Some of the concerns of the nongovernmental organizations are discussed in the next section of this chapter.", "In addition to these previously mentioned mechanisms, INS established certain procedures to help ensure that the expedited removal process is implemented properly and consistently. First, INS stated it trained about 16,400 of its staff on the implementation process for the 1996 Act, including the expedited removal (and credible fear) provision. According to INS officials, asylum officers were to be given additional training on making credible fear determinations. Second, INS issued operating procedures that require inspectors and asylum officers to follow specific steps when considering issuing expedited removal orders and making credible fear determinations. Third, INS requires that all expedited removal orders and credible fear determinations be reviewed by a supervisor. Finally, for aliens who were determined not to have a credible fear of persecution, INS may, at its discretion, offer a second credible fear interview to an alien, even if the alien has not established a credible fear before an asylum officer or after an immigration judge review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns Raised by Nongovernmental Organizations", "paragraphs": ["Several nongovernmental organizations provided information about their concerns regarding the expedited removal process and including information on (1) issues related to the expedited removal process and credible fear determinations and (2) specific problems that aliens said they encountered when they arrived at ports of entry. In addition, these organizations provided data describing specific situations of INS\u2019 handling of aliens who were subject to expedited removal. We did not verify the data they provided. These organizations\u2019 concerns about the process included allegations that aliens did not understand the expedited removal process because, for example, the removal order was legalistic and incomprehensible; interpreters\u2019 competency varied, which in some instances caused serious mistakes to be made in translation; consultants were denied access to documents in applicants\u2019 case files, such as the sworn statements; and attorneys were not allowed to play a meaningful role at the credible fear interview (e.g., they were not permitted to make opening or closing statements or to ask questions, and they had no opportunity to consult with their clients before deciding whether to request a negative credible fear review by an immigration judge).", "The organizations also raised allegations of INS officers\u2019 unprofessional treatment of aliens attempting to enter the United States. The alleged actions of INS officers included (1) not explaining the expedited removal process, including applying for asylum; (2) not providing interpretation services; (3) verbally abusing the aliens; and (4) not providing physical amenities, such as food, water, bed and blankets, and bathroom facilities.", "In addition to the INS mechanisms discussed above that are related to these types of issues, INS officials told us that every alien and consultant has access to the relevant documents regarding the alien\u2019s case (e.g., sworn statement). Regarding the consultant\u2019s role, INS stated that the consultant and the asylum officer should share a cooperative role in developing and clarifying the merits of the alien\u2019s claim. Furthermore, the consultant should generally be given the opportunity to make a statement at the end of the interview, comment on the evidence presented, and ask the alien additional questions. Concerning the competency of interpreters, INS procedures provide that the alien or the alien\u2019s consultant has the right to request a different interpreter if he or she feels that the interpreter is not competent or neutral. Additionally, INS officials said that the alien or the alien\u2019s consultant may request another interpreter for whatever reason. Regarding unprofessional behavior, INS stated that it will do more to ensure that aliens, including those who attempt to enter illegally, know their civil rights and how to register a complaint if abused by an INS officer. Furthermore, the Commissioner said that INS insists on proper, humane, and polite treatment of people who are entering the United States whether their documents are correct or not.", "We had no way to determine the validity of the issues that the organizations raised, including the specifics about any individual alien. Our limited observations, case file reviews, and discussions with INS officials did not identify problems similar to those raised by the organizations. Concerning our observations, our presence may have affected what took place during inspections, interviews, and reviews, but we have no way of knowing whether, how, or to what extent this happened."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes to the Expedited Removal Procedures", "paragraphs": ["INS is in the process of changing aspects of the expedited removal procedures on the basis of input it has received from its internal groups and the nongovernmental organizations. These changes include the following: INS is revising some expedited removal forms that contain explanations to be read to the alien (e.g., Information about Credible Fear Interview). According to INS, as part of this revision process, it has asked some of the nongovernmental organizations to review the forms to make them easier for aliens to understand. INS assigned the responsibility of being an expedited removal expert to selected staff for each region and district to ensure that policy guidance is distributed, understood, and implemented. INS officials have completed training these staff on their new duties associated with being an expedited removal expert. INS said that it permits aliens to provide their own interpreters for credible fear interviews."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
