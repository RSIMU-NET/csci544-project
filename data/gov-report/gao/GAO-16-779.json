This report examines trends, over the past 10 years, in (1) the condition and (2) the funding of the nation's bridges, as well as (3) how states fund and manage their bridge programs, given the 2012 legislative changes. GAO analyzed FHWA's bridge conditions and funding data; reviewed applicable laws, relevant FHWA program guidance, and federal guidance on performance measures; and interviewed federal officials and transportation officials from 24 states and D.C., selected to include those with large bridge inventories, among other factors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Bridge conditions have generally improved nationwide from 2006 to 2015, based on GAO analysis of federal bridge data. For example, the percentage of structurally deficient bridge deck area (the surface area that carries vehicles) decreased from 9 percent to 7 percent nationwide during this period. The number of structurally deficient bridges also decreased from 13 percent to 10 percent nationwide. However, some states have substantially higher percentages of structurally deficient deck area than others. Bridge conditions may become more challenging to address as bridges age, because the number of bridges and amount of total deck area increased dramatically from the 1950s through the 1970s, generally with a 50-year design life. Analysis of federal bridge data shows that the amount of structurally deficient deck area is greatest for bridges built from 1960 through 1974, indicating an expected need for additional maintenance, replacement, or rehabilitation.", "Federal funds obligated for bridge projects have remained relatively stable from 2006 to 2015, between $6 billion and $7 billion annually in most years. During this period, the use of federal funds on bridges shifted somewhat from building new bridges to projects that preserve existing bridges, such as bridge rehabilitation or preventative maintenance. While the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) estimates total funds dedicated to bridges and collects data on bridge conditions nationwide, it does not track the linkage between federal funds and changes in bridge conditions. GAO has previously reported that linking performance outcomes with resources invested can help agencies to more clearly determine how changes in invested resources may result in changes to performance. Using such performance measures would help FHWA demonstrate the link between federal funding and outcomes for bridges.", "Officials from the selected 24 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) reported little change in the way they have funded and managed bridges since 2012. Officials from 21 states and D.C. reported bridge funding has been stable since the federal bridge program was consolidated in 2012. Officials from 3 states reported an increase in bridge funding since that time. The general stability in bridge funding may be a result of the long time frame for planning bridge projects; for example, bridge funding cycles can be 5 years or longer, a time span that means any changes would not be apparent for several years. Officials from 10 states mentioned increased flexibility in their ability to use federal funds for bridge projects. Changes from the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act provided states flexibility to determine whether to spend federal highway funds on bridges or other highway needs. Further, officials from 18 states and D.C. reported that they have not changed how they prioritize bridge projects relative to other transportation projects. With respect to challenges, officials from 14 states described inadequate funding as a challenge, and officials from 13 states reported aging bridges as a challenge. For many of these states, the challenge of maintaining aging bridges is intertwined with the challenge of inadequate funds."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOT direct FHWA to develop measures on the linkage between the federal funding of bridges and the desired outcomes\u2014maintained or improved bridge conditions\u2014and report results to Congress.

In 2015,  the United States had nearly 612,000 bridges comprising over 4-billion  square feet of total deck area. Bridge safety first emerged as a high- priority issue in the United States in the 1960s, following the collapse of  the Silver Bridge between Ohio and West Virginia, a collapse that killed  46 people. Congress responded to national concerns by establishing the  first federal bridge program in 1970, which provided a funding mechanism  to assist states in replacing unsafe bridges on the federal-aid highway  system. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), within the federal  Department of Transportation (DOT), both: (1) administers the program  that supports the construction, maintenance, and preservation of the  nation's bridges and (2) oversees the implementation of the National  Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS), among other duties. While federal  funding is provided to state governments to help improve highway  infrastructure, state and local governments own and maintain most of the  nation\u2019s highways and bridges.

In 2012, after over 40  years of having a dedicated federal bridge program, provisions in the  Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) altered the  sources of federal funds to use for bridge activities and projects and gave  states more flexibility in determining how to allocate highway funds.

To determine trends  in funding the nation\u2019s bridges, we reviewed and analyzed data on federal  obligations for bridge projects in FHWA\u2019s Fiscal Management Information  System (FMIS) from fiscal years 2006 through 2015. We assessed the  reliability of the data that we used by reviewing documentation and  interviewing FHWA officials on data verification and found the data to be  reliable for our purposes.

We selected this non-generalizable sample of states because  they have large bridge inventories and receive relatively high levels of  federal surface transportation funding and for geographic dispersion.  From the selected states, we further selected 5 states for site visits,  based on similar selection criteria, in order to obtain additional  information. We selected California, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and  Washington for site visits.

MAP-21 included a  number of statutory requirements related to transforming the surface  transportation system to a performance-based approach. For instance,  MAP-21 directed DOT to establish performance measures related to  highway safety, asset condition, and highway system performance,  among other things. In some cases, MAP-21 required DOT to use the  rulemaking process to implement performance-based requirements. In  2015, the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation Act (FAST Act), which  reauthorized surface transportation programs, largely maintained current  program structures, including MAP-21\u2019s overall performance- management approach.

State and local agencies typically provide matching  funds on bridge projects that receive federal funding and may contribute  funds beyond their match amount. State-level DOTs are responsible for  ensuring bridge inspections are completed and for inventorying bridges  within their states according to federal standards (except for tribally or  federally owned bridges).

A bridge that is both structurally deficient and functionally  obsolete is listed as structurally deficient in the NBI.", "In this report, we assess the conditions of bridges classified as  structurally deficient by both the total deck area and number of bridges.  Analysis of conditions based on the total number of bridges without  considering the size of bridges can create an incomplete picture. A state  may have a large number of deficient bridges, but if the deficient bridges  are small bridges, the total deck area in need could still be relatively low.  In comparison, another state could have very few deficient bridges, but if  those deficient bridges are large, the total deck area in need could be  much higher. Bridges may vary significantly in size and generally, the  needs of larger bridges are more costly than those of smaller bridges.

FHWA does not issue guidance on which bridges to  target with federal funds, such as specifically targeting structurally  deficient bridges. However, MAP-21 contained a penalty provision  where any state whose percentage of total deck area of bridges on the  NHS classified as structurally deficient exceeds 10 percent for 3 years in  a row must devote funds (equal to 50 percent of the state\u2019s fiscal year  2009 HBP apportionment) to eligible projects on bridges on the NHS until  they meet this minimum threshold.

The report also  estimates future-spending needs to maintain or improve current  conditions and performance.", "However, FHWA currently lacks a mechanism for tracking the relationship  between the invested funds and the corresponding outcomes\u2014 maintained and improved bridge conditions. Given that FHWA already  estimates total funds dedicated to bridges and collects data on bridge  conditions nationwide, it has the information needed to create  performance measures that would demonstrate the link between federal  funding and the outcomes for bridges. According to leading practices for  government management identified by OMB and GAO, agencies should  not only have and report performance measures but also use them to link  outcomes with resources invested. Specifically, the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 and the GPRA  Modernization Act of 2010 establish the framework for performance  management in the federal government. Under this framework, federal  agencies are required to, among other things, assess whether relevant  programs and activities are contributing as planned to established  goals. Further, MAP-21 included a declaration on the importance of  accountability and linking performance outcomes to investment  decisions. We have reported that linking performance outcomes with  information on resources invested (i.e., data on the resources used to  produce an outcome, including costs) can help agencies to more clearly  understand how changes in invested resources may result in changes to  performance.", "We have also reported that an effective way to show the relationship  between resources invested and outcomes is for agencies to use  efficiency measures. These measures are typically defined as the ratio  of two elements: a program\u2019s inputs (such as its costs or hours worked by  staff), to its outputs or outcomes (see fig. 7).", "OMB has issued guidance with examples of meaningful performance  measures, including some efficiency measures:  for the Forest Service, cost per acre of environmentally important  forest protected (provides costs per acre, including actual program  obligations and other dedicated funds);  for the Patent and Trade Office, cost per patent processed (provides  costs per patent, including staff expenses and overhead costs); and  for the Office of Child Support Enforcement, total child support dollars  collected per dollar of program expenditures (provides outcomes\u2014 dollars in child support collected\u2014per total administrative  expenditures including staff expenses).", "However, determining inputs\u2014or invested resources\u2014for efficiency  measures can be challenging when there are non-federal entities  contributing resources. Despite the usefulness of efficiency measures, we  have acknowledged that many of the outcomes for which federal  programs are responsible are part of broader efforts involving federal,  state, local, and other partners, and thus it can be difficult to isolate a  particular federal program\u2019s contribution to the broader outcomes. This  is the case for highway programs, since funds from federal, state and  local sources all contribute to maintained or improved asset conditions.  However, federal guidance exists that may help. To assist agencies in  implementing the GPRA framework, OMB issued guidance about how  federal agencies might address the challenge of developing performance  measures for programs that co-mingle funds from different sources (i.e.,  federal, state, and local funds) in support of a broad goal. The guidance  acknowledged that it can be difficult to assess the marginal impact of the  federal investment for programs where combined co-mingled funding  contributes to the same broad performance outcome, but recommended  that agencies should nonetheless seek to assess the marginal impact of  the federal investment to the overall outcomes. OMB guidance noted that  in such cases, the resource inputs from non-federal partners may be  relevant in assessing the effectiveness of programs matched by federal  assistance. OMB suggested that in such cases, agencies should consider  crafting two performance measures of efficiency: one measure reporting  unit costs in terms of output per federal dollar spent and another measure  reporting unit costs in terms of the output per combined dollars spent.", "FHWA officials told us that they have not developed measures linking  resources to outcomes. This is mostly due to limitations of the previous  version of their financial tracking system, FMIS. Specifically, officials  explained that prior to the most recent version of FMIS (Version 5), which  was launched in October 2015, data were collected on a project segment  level that may have included multiple bridges. Thus, it was not possible to  directly compare federal obligations on bridge projects to outcomes, in the  form of bridge conditions found in the NBI. However, when asked, officials  said that such a comparison could be possible with the newest version of  FMIS by creating a connection between FMIS and the NBI and showing  what happens to bridge conditions when federal obligations change over  time. Using such performance measures would help FHWA to  demonstrate the link between federal funding and outcomes for bridges.  As FHWA has reported in recent budget requests, states face increasing  challenges in finding sufficient funding for their infrastructure needs. In  addition, as GAO has previously reported, bridge infrastructure\u2014like most  of the nation\u2019s physical infrastructure\u2014is under strain.

Transportation officials in  Seattle, Washington, told us that the state DOT distributes a total of about  $35 million per year in federal funds to local agencies, which compete for  a part of those funds; however, the city\u2019s highest priority bridge has a  replacement cost of about $350 million, which far surpasses what they  may receive. Given the gap in funding for large projects, officials said they  will be forced to close large bridges that are deemed unsafe if they are  unable to raise the funds needed to repair them.", "Some state and local officials reported that many bridges are reaching the  end of their intended service life. According to officials from several states  and local agencies, most bridges were designed to last 50 years. Officials  from 13 of the states we interviewed reported aging bridges as a  challenge. For many of these states, the challenge of aging bridges is  intertwined with the challenge of inadequate funds. State DOT officials  stated that aging bridges require more costly maintenance and repairs  and many need to be replaced. See table 5 for examples of challenges  cited related to aging bridge inventories.", "Other challenges were also cited by state DOT officials. See table 6 for  examples of challenges that were less frequently stated."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Bridge conditions have generally improved nationwide over the past  decade. However the increase in the number and size of bridges that are  approaching the limits of their design life will likely place a greater  demand on bridge owners in the near future, making it more difficult to  mitigate issues in a cost-effective manner. While FHWA collects  information on bridge conditions annually and maintains data on federal  obligations dedicated to bridges, it lacks performance measures  demonstrating the link between bridge funding and changes in bridge  conditions. This lack is in part because a limitation in the prior financial- tracking system, which did not allow the direct comparison of federal  obligations with bridge projects\u2019 outcomes. However, with recent  improvements to FMIS, FHWA has the information needed to create an  efficiency measure or measures to demonstrate the link between federal  funding and the outcomes for bridges. This information can support  Congress in making informed choices about how to best invest the limited  available resources in maintaining or improving the condition of the  nation\u2019s bridges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Department of Transportation  direct the FHWA Administrator to develop an efficiency measure or  measures that demonstrate the linkage between the federal funding of  bridges and the desired performance outcomes, such as maintained or  improved bridge conditions, and report the resulting information to  Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOT for its review and comment.

We limited our review of NBI data to bridges  that are located on public roads and that are at least 20 feet in length. We  obtained NBI data for bridges during the selected calendar years for an  aggregate of all records and by state, including all 50 states; District of  Columbia (D.C.); and Puerto Rico. Specifically, we reviewed data by  number of bridges and total deck area, looking at deficiency status and  year of bridge construction, among other data. We calculated total deck  area based on a formula using structure length and deck width\u2014or in the  case of culverts (structures with fill over them), approach roadway width\u2014 using NBI data.", "To determine trends in funding the nation\u2019s bridges, we reviewed and  analyzed federal obligations data on bridge projects in FHWA\u2019s Fiscal  Management Information System (FMIS) from fiscal years 2006 through  2015. Specifically, we obtained federal obligations data for bridge new  construction, bridge replacement, bridge rehabilitation, bridge  preventative maintenance, bridge protection, and bridge inspection and  related training. We analyzed the data by improvement codes and by  federal highway programs. In addition, we analyzed FHWA\u2019s available  data on state and local governments\u2019 spending for bridge projects by  reviewing data from the 2013 FHWA Conditions and Performance Report,  reviewing FHWA\u2019s Highway Statistics Series of reports, and interviewing  FHWA officials. We assessed the reliability of the data that we used by  reviewing documentation and interviewing officials on data verification  and found the data to be reliable for our purposes. We also reviewed  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance and leading practices  we have previously identified related to tracking, through performance  measures, the linkage between funding and outcomes and compared  current activities to this guidance and these leading practices.", "To determine how states fund and manage their bridge programs,  including any challenges they face, we interviewed representatives from  the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  and the National Association of County Engineers. We also interviewed  state officials from 24 states and D.C. We selected this non-generalizable  sample of states because they have large bridge inventories, relatively  high levels of federal surface transportation funding, and for geographic  dispersion. The selected states were: California, Connecticut, Florida,  Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan,  Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma,  Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Texas, Vermont,  and Washington. From the selected states, we further selected 5 states  for site visits, based on selection criteria similar to that stated above, in  order to obtain additional information from each state. We selected  California, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Texas, and Washington for site  visits. In these states, we met with state transportation officials, FHWA  Division Office officials, and officials from two local-government  transportation agencies from each state. We selected the non- generalizable sample of local agencies based on recommendations from  state officials of nearby local agencies that could accommodate our site  visit schedule.
