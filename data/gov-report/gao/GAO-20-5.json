This support totalled over $2.4 billion and included providing staff to assist at Emergency Operations Centers and establishing Disaster Recovery Centers to coordinate disaster assistance services for survivors. In addition, FEMA provided Public Assistance grant funds to local jurisdictions to help address community infrastructure needs, such as debris removal. FEMA also assigned federal agencies to perform various missions to help with response and recovery\u2014for example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was assigned with contracting for debris removal services in some instances.", "Officials from jurisdictions that GAO spoke with described practices that aided in wildfire response and recovery, but also reported experiencing challenges. Specifically, officials in affected areas noted that collaboration between FEMA and California's Office of Emergency Services allowed for timely information sharing, and FEMA's assistance at Disaster Recovery Centers greatly assisted survivors in obtaining necessary services. Among the challenges cited were onerous documentation requirements for FEMA's Public Assistance grant program and locating temporary housing for survivors whose homes were completely destroyed. In addition, the unique challenge of removing wildfire debris led to confusion over soil excavation standards and led to overexcavation on some homeowners' lots, lengthening the rebuilding process.", "FEMA has developed an after-action report identifying lessons learned from the October and December 2017 wildfires, but could benefit from a more comprehensive assessment of its operations to determine if additional actions are needed to ensure that policies and procedures are best suited to prepare for future wildfires. The combination of recent devastating wildfires and projections for increased wildfire activity suggest a potential change in FEMA's operating environment.

Assistance that FEMA provided to jurisdictions with major disaster  declarations from wildfires from 2015 through 2018;  2.  Selected jurisdictions\u2019 perspectives on FEMA wildfire response and  3.  The extent to which FEMA has identified and addressed key lessons  learned.", "To determine the assistance FEMA provided during the major wildfire  disasters in our review, we gathered data from 2015 through 2018 from  various FEMA databases, including FEMA systems for financial  accounting, grants tracking, and gathering of other disaster-related  information. These data included the dollar amount of Public Assistance  provided to state and local applicants, Individual Assistance provided to  survivors, and monies reimbursed to other federal agencies to which  FEMA assigned various tasks. We also gathered data through the  California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection on acreage burned,  structures destroyed, and lives lost and verified these data with officials  from this state department. By leveraging information such as data  gathered and interviews conducted during other assessments of data  reliability from previous GAO reviews, and confirming data with relevant  officials from the California state department, we determined that these  data were reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives. The six  disaster declarations in this review represent the universe of major  disaster declarations for wildfires for which FEMA provided both Public  Assistance and Individual Assistance from 2015 through 2018. We  identified them by reviewing data available on FEMA\u2019s website. We  selected this date range to reflect the very active 2017 and 2018 seasons  and the years immediately prior, to be able to observe similarities and  differences in these experiences. These disaster declarations are listed in  table 1.", "In addition, we developed fire maps for the six major disasters in our  review using open source data from the Homeland Infrastructure  Foundation-Level Data website and the U.S. Census Bureau.

During these interviews, we discussed officials\u2019  perspectives on successes and challenges, and potential areas for  improvement. We supplemented the information gathered during these  interviews during site visits to Napa and Sonoma Counties to meet with  county and city officials in-person and observe wildfire-damaged areas  and efforts to rebuild neighborhoods damaged or destroyed by the fires.  We also gathered additional state and federal perspectives on the August  2018 California wildfires during a site visit to the Joint Field Office in  Sacramento, California, and the Shasta County Disaster Recovery Center  in Redding, California. While the views of these officials cannot be  generalized to represent all jurisdictions affected by wildfires, they provide  valuable perspectives on the successful elements of the response and  recovery process and particular challenges experienced by local officials.", "To determine the extent to which FEMA has identified and addressed key  lessons learned, we interviewed officials from FEMA\u2019s headquarters  responsible for Public Assistance program delivery as well as FEMA\u2019s  Regions IV and IX, which coordinate assistance in Tennessee and  California, respectively. In addition, we reviewed documents such as prior  GAO reports, FEMA program guidance, and after action reports.

FEMA can provide reimbursement to help support wildfire suppression  (e.g., labor costs for overtime or seasonal personnel involved in fire  suppression activities). When a wildfire burns on nonfederal lands and  threatens to become a major disaster, a state governor or governor\u2019s  representative may request federal assistance via a Fire Management  Assistance Grant (FMAG) administered by FEMA. While the fire is  burning, a governor\u2019s office can submit a verbal request for an FMAG to  the designated FEMA regional office, followed within 14 days by a formal  written request. The regional administrator then either approves or denies the request after consulting with relevant officials from the U.S.  Forest Service or bureaus within the U.S. Department of the Interior about  technical aspects of the fire. Eligible FMAG costs include, among other  things, equipment and supplies, labor costs, travel and per diem,  temporary repairs of damage caused by firefighting activities, mobilization  and demobilization of resources, and limited costs of pre-positioning fire  prevention or suppression resources.", "From fiscal years 2009 through 2018, FEMA awarded 374 FMAGs  totaling $952,318,049.

A disaster declaration is the  primary mechanism by which the federal government gets involved in  funding and coordinating response and recovery activities. Under the  National Response Framework, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) is the federal department with primary responsibility for  coordinating disaster response, and within DHS, FEMA has lead  responsibility. From fiscal years 2009 through 2018, a total of 19 major  disasters were declared as a result of wildfires.

The eligibility rules outline the types of  damage that can be reimbursed by the federal government and steps that  federal, state, and local governments must take in order to document  eligibility. If the debris on private property is determined to be so  widespread that it threatens the health, safety, or economic recovery of  the community, FEMA may determine that debris removal from private  property, including contaminated soil, is eligible for reimbursement under  the Public Assistance program. An applicant (a state, territorial, or tribal  government) may contract for debris removal. Alternatively, if an applicant  lacks the capability to perform or contract for debris removal, the  applicant may request that the federal government perform the work. In  such cases, FEMA may task another federal agency, typically the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), to perform or contract the work by  issuing a mission assignment (see description below).

For example, the Environmental Protection  Agency provided hazardous material cleanup of damaged properties, and  USACE provided public works services, such as contracting for debris  removal.", "As response activities continued and recovery began, FEMA and the  state emergency management agencies established Joint Field Offices,  which are temporary field offices established to coordinate federal and  state efforts in disaster response and recovery, and provided resources to  help individual disaster survivors with community services and housing  needs. For example, following wildfires in November 2018\u2014including the  Camp Fire in Butte County\u2014FEMA provided over $55 million to survivors  to reimburse them for the cost of temporary lodging and rentals after their  homes were destroyed. In addition, FEMA provided funding and support  to local jurisdictions to help address community infrastructure needs. For  example, FEMA obligated money to pay for wildfire debris removal from  public property as well as from private property, given the widespread  effect on the community of toxic fire debris.", "Also to support recovery, in coordination with state and local entities,  FEMA established and staffed Disaster Recovery Centers, which are  facilities or mobile offices where survivors can go for information about  FEMA programs or other disaster assistance programs.

Debris removal posed several  challenges for state and local jurisdictions affected by the wildfires.  Wildfires typically leave no remaining structure, and the resulting ash  contains contaminants that must be carefully removed, wrapped, and  disposed of before survivors can move back to their properties. This can  make the wildfire debris removal process costlier and more complicated  than for other types of disaster debris. California\u2019s Department of  Resources, Recycling, and Recovery typically handles debris removal  after local disasters in the state, but it did not have the capacity to handle  the high volume of debris caused by the 2017 Northern California  wildfires. As a result, the state asked FEMA to assign USACE with the  debris removal mission.", "According to local officials, there was some confusion over how much  contaminated soil should be removed from some properties. Specifically,  in some cases, USACE removed more soil than necessary at home sites  in an attempt to \u201cscrape\u201d the soil deeply enough to remove all possible  contaminants at the site; however, this did not take into account that  some contaminants, such as arsenic, occur naturally in the soil. As a  result, some property owners were left with large over-excavated pits on  their property that needed to be filled in before rebuilding could occur.  Figure 5 shows a property site that, according to local officials, had been  excavated below the foundation of the home and thus needed to be  refilled with soil, complicating the rebuilding effort. In addition, officials  from one county stated that USACE staff rotations made it difficult for  state and local officials to communicate debris removal options clearly both internally and to the public, leading to confusion among some  survivors about their best options for debris removal.", "In 2018 and 2019, we reported on issues with contracting for wildfire  debris removal. We found that USACE\u2019s debris removal contracts, while  broad enough to cover any type of debris, had been used primarily to  manage hurricane debris removal and did not address issues posed by  wildfire debris removal. We also found that miscommunication at the  federal level resulted in differing expectations between USACE and state  and local officials about debris removal work to be performed, such as the  types of structures to be removed from private property and acceptable  soil contamination levels. According to USACE officials, they relied on  FEMA to manage communication with states and localities and to identify  and manage expectations about the scope of work to be performed. We  recommended, among other things, that FEMA take the lead to work  together with USACE to revise the mission assignment policy and related  guidance to better incorporate consideration of contracting needs and to  ensure clarity of contracting-related coordination responsibilities.

Wildfires pose an  additional challenge because in contrast to disasters such as hurricanes  or floods where there may be a substantial portion of a home left  standing, and property may be habitable after the most dangerous debris  is removed, wildfires generally destroy entire structures and leave a pile  of contaminated debris and soil. This kind of damage requires a lengthier  clean-up and necessarily precludes survivors from occupying the property  until state and local officials declare the lot safe for habitation.", "In the meantime, one of FEMA\u2019s responsibilities under the Mass Care,  Emergency Assistance, Temporary Housing and Human Services  Emergency Support Function is to help displaced disaster survivors with  access to temporary housing. This has posed challenges for some of the  counties we spoke with, most notably in select Northern California  communities. In particular, officials in two California counties noted that  vacancy rates are very low in these areas, and there were few places to  house survivors who were either waiting to rebuild on their property or  had been living in rental properties that were destroyed. In addition, in  one California county there have been a limited number of potential sites  available (such as commercial parks or group sites) to place transportable  temporary housing units. According to FEMA, several factors limited the  number of commercial or group sites available for such housing units,  including limited space for the housing units, contaminated utilities, and  challenges with local jurisdictions responsible for deciding whether and  where to place group sites.", "According to FEMA officials, the nature of fire debris affects the array of  post-disaster housing options that FEMA can offer through its Individual  Assistance program. For example, although FEMA can provide  replacement assistance for destroyed homes and repair assistance for  homes with damage that can be repaired, the complete destruction of  homes due to fires significantly lengthens the recovery processes. Rental  assistance and lodging reimbursement are limited by lack of access to  rental properties, and the use of manufactured housing units is limited by  lack of group sites that meet requirements, including adequate space for  such units and access to utilities (e.g., potable water not contaminated by  fire damage). See Appendix I for more information on this program.", "FEMA officials acknowledged that providing housing for survivors has  long been a challenge for the agency.

Residents who participated in the private property debris removal  program who were paid out of FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance program, and  subsequently also received an insurance benefit for debris removal, were  required to repay the federal government for the duplicate benefit.  According to these county officials, they were not aware that collection  would be their responsibility until about 2 years after the initial debris  removal took place. The officials noted that the administrative burden for  identifying the affected homeowners and the amount owed and then  collecting the payments was significant, and taxed their administrative  capacity. They said they wished they had been aware sooner that they  would have to absorb this duty, so they could put systems in place.  According to FEMA and state officials, however, these requirements were  included in FEMA\u2019s Public Assistance Program and Policy Guide, which  states that local governments are responsible for implementing private  property debris removal, including the requirement to collect and  reimburse FEMA for any duplicate benefits.

FEMA\u2019s  2017 wildfire after-action report offered response and recovery lessons  learned from both the challenges identified and successful practices.  Some, but not all, of these were mirrored in our interviews with California  jurisdictions that were affected by recent wildfires. Among its findings, the  2017 wildfire after-action report identified several areas for improvement.  For example, FEMA\u2019s immediate activation of the Transitional Sheltering  Assistance program and lack of a unified information system to track  applicants\u2019 eligibility for all Individual Assistance programs at the time of  the wildfires resulted, in some instances, in applicants receiving sheltering  benefits inappropriately (i.e., receiving Transitional Sheltering Assistance  benefits despite their residence being undamaged). One potential action  to address this challenge identified in the report was to add information on  Transitional Sheltering Assistance program applicants into the database  that FEMA uses to track disaster information to ensure those applicants  have access to all benefits and reduce the potential for duplication. FEMA  officials have stated that since the 2017 wildfires, policy changes have  been made to address this issue, including adding Transitional Sheltering  Assistance program applicant data to the information system used to  track eligibility for all Individual Assistance programs.", "In addition, FEMA reported that the typical contracts USACE had in place  for debris removal were not designed to address the nature (i.e., fire- related debris) and scope of work required, particularly with respect to  private property debris removal. The agencies worked together to rapidly  scope the statements of work for the debris removal contracts to provide  services to survivors, but FEMA ultimately found that the contract  requirements lacked detail and clarity, resulting in additional costs.  USACE prepared its own after-action report after the 2017 wildfires,  which also identified challenges with the scope of its debris removal  contracts and the mission assignment task orders, and planned to  incorporate lessons learned in future debris removal contracts.", "According to FEMA Region IX officials, many of the issues regarding  debris removal stemmed from not having documented processes in place  to govern wildfire debris removal specifically. In its after-action report,  FEMA identified potential actions to address these challenges\u2014such as  developing standard operating procedures in coordination with USACE  for fire debris removal\u2014to correct these and other identified areas for  improvement. According to USACE officials, FEMA subsequently  provided funds through a 2018 wildfire disaster declaration to USACE to  develop such standard operating procedures. USACE officials told us  they had shared these procedures with FEMA and stated that the  procedures will help guide future wildfire private property debris removal  operations.", "The 2017 after-action report also identified a number of strengths and  best practices during 2017 wildfire response and recovery efforts in  California. For example, the report noted that collaboration and pre- existing relationships between federal and state personnel helped to  overcome knowledge gaps about certain programs and improved survivor  outcomes (such as the placement of temporary housing units based on  work done by an interagency task force). In addition, Facebook provided  FEMA with pre- and post-disaster survivor locations (provided voluntarily  by the survivor) that helped identify where survivors were located after the  wildfires.

As shown in figure 6, from 1953 to the  present, the number of major disaster declarations from wildfires has  increased in nearly every decade since 1950 and most dramatically in the  last two decades. During Congressional testimony from March 2018,  FEMA\u2019s Region IX Administrator stated that fire season has changed  from covering spring through early fall to a now year-round event, and  that the unprecedented impacts from the 2017 wildfire season would  linger for years to come.", "Land use practices and climate trends increase the likelihood that severe  and intense wildfires will affect people and communities. As we have  described in previous reports, land use practices over the past century  have reduced forest and rangeland ecosystems\u2019 resilience to fire. Land  use practices like fire suppression and timber harvesting have contributed  to abnormally dense accumulations of vegetation. These accumulations  can fuel uncharacteristically large or severe wildfires. At the same time,  development occurring in and around wildlands\u2014an area often called the  wildland-urban interface\u2014has increased, placing more people,  businesses, and infrastructure at risk. The wildland-urban interface  contains 46 million single-family homes, representing about 40 percent of  single-family homes in the United States. According to the 2014  Quadrennial Fire Review, 60 percent of new homes built in the United  States since 1990 were built in the wildland-urban interface. As the  footprint of human activity and settlement into the wildland-urban interface  expands, the risk of fire exposure to people and property is expected to  increase further.", "In addition, changing climate conditions, including drier conditions in  certain parts of the country, have increased the length and severity of  wildfire seasons, according to many scientists and researchers. For  example, in the western United States, the average number of days in the  fire season increased from approximately 200 in 1980 to approximately  300 in 2013, according to the 2014 Quadrennial Fire Review. According  to the U.S. Global Change Research Program\u2019s 2018 National Climate  Assessment, warmer and drier conditions have led to a greater incidence  of large forest fires (fires with an area greater than 386 square miles) in  the western United States and Alaska, a trend expected to continue as  climate warms and the fire season gets longer.", "Despite these trends and projections, FEMA does not plan to  comprehensively assess operations to determine whether and how  policies and procedures might need to change to better respond to  changing operational conditions. According to FEMA officials, they had  not considered conducting this kind of review, because they believe their  existing mechanisms\u2014specifically after-action reporting, the continuous  improvement process, and program specific mechanisms such as the  Public Assistance Change Control Tool\u2014will allow them to incorporate  relevant lessons into policies and procedures.", "According to FEMA officials, after a major disaster, FEMA\u2019s standard  practice is to identify areas for improvement and develop lessons learned  that can improve FEMA planning and policy and support national  preparedness by preparing an after-action report which is required by  FEMA policy. FEMA has a continuous improvement program which  serves as the overarching process by which it identifies and responds to  operational lessons learned identified in after-action reporting.  According to FEMA officials, FEMA headquarters reviews all completed  after-action reports to identify any areas for improvement that may need  to be addressed through changes in policies and procedures.", "Although the continuous improvement process and its reliance on after- action reporting offers the opportunity to incorporate discrete lessons  learned into select policies and procedures, there are some limitations in  its ability to offer a comprehensive assessment of its internal controls in  light of the strong potential that wildfire disasters will continue to increase.  By its nature, after-action reporting captures select issues at a specific  time and in a specific place, but it is not a dedicated effort to assess how  various policies and procedures may need to be changed to better  respond to changing operational conditions. For example, in our  discussions with fire-affected jurisdictions, we noted that some  programmatic or policy challenges were specific to or made more difficult  by the nature of wildfires, such as the complexities of debris removal and  difficult housing missions.
