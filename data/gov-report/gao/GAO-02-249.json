Although all carriers issue bulletins, operate call centers, and maintain websites, each carrier develops its own communications policies and strategies. This approach results in a duplication of effort as well as variations in the quality of carrier communications. CMS provides little technical assistance to help carriers develop effective communication strategies. Neither CMS carrier oversight nor self-monitoring by the carriers is comprehensive enough to provide sufficiently detailed information that could either pinpoint specific communication problems or identify poorly performing carriers. CMS is working to improve its physician communications by consolidating new instructions and regulations and issuing them on a more predictable schedule to lessen the burden of frequent policy changes that physicians cannot anticipate. CMS is also enhancing its education programs for both physicians and carrier staffs and expanding its efforts to obtain physician feedback.

Given this open-ended entitlement, it is essential that appropriate and effective rules and policies be specified so that only necessary services are provided and reimbursed. To accomplish this, the Congress and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the federal agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that administers Medicare\u2014have promulgated an extensive body of statutes, regulations, policies, and procedures regarding what shall be paid for and under what circumstances. CMS, which relies on the assistance of about 50 claims administration contractors to operate the Medicare program, is charged with communicating this information to medical providers, including  physicians, so that they can bill the program properly.", "Recently, physicians and their representatives testified at congressional  hearings that their participation in Medicare is becoming increasingly  burdensome. Among other things, they reported being inundated with  large volumes of complicated, unclear, and inconsistent information from  the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and its carriers about  Medicare program requirements. They also expressed concern that,  because rules change frequently, their understanding of billing rules may  be obsolete and incorrect, which could lead to inadvertent billing errors.", "This report responds to your request, which recognized both the need for  HHS, and particularly CMS, to routinely communicate regulations,  instructions, and guidance to physicians, and the concerns of physicians  regarding the quality of the materials they receive. Specifically, you asked  us to examine several aspects of Medicare communications, including (1)  the quality of Medicare information provided to physicians by HHS, and  CMS and its carriers, (2) the quality of CMS\u2019s management and oversight  of carrier communications, and (3) current CMS efforts to enhance the  communication process.", "To understand physicians\u2019 concerns regarding Medicare communications,  we first solicited the views of individual physicians from several  specialties and representatives from relevant professional organizations.  As part of this effort, we obtained the cooperation of seven physician  practices of varying sizes that provided us with information on the volume  and type of Medicare communications they received during a 3-month  period. These practices were located in different areas of the country and  received information from different carriers. They also provided us with  excerpts from documents they received and shared their views on the  usefulness of the information they received during that time frame. In  addition, we interviewed officials at several carriers and HCFA. We also  met with officials at other HHS agencies to discuss their communications  with physicians participating in the Medicare program.", "On the basis of this information, and because the vast majority of  Medicare communications are issued by carriers on behalf of CMS, we  focused on the information carriers provide to physicians. We then  conducted an evaluation of the quality of the three main methods carriers  use to provide information to physicians\u2014bulletins they publish and mail  to physicians, telephone call centers that respond to physician questions,  and Internet Web sites to serve participating physicians. Specifically, to  assess bulletins we reviewed recently issued bulletins from 10 carriers to  determine whether they organized material in ways that would help  readers locate information. We evaluated the timeliness and completeness  of these bulletins by examining them to determine when certain CMS- issued memorandums, which were relevant to physicians, were included.  To assess the quality of information provided to physicians calling carriers  with questions, we telephoned 5 of the 37 provider assistance call centers  with frequently asked questions (FAQ) taken from carrier Web sites. With  CMS\u2019s assistance, we scored the completeness and accuracy of these  responses. We also visited 3 carrier call centers to observe their operations  and to study the carriers\u2019 approaches to monitoring the performance of the  customer service representatives who are responsible for responding to  physician inquiries. To assess carrier Web sites we examined 10 such sites  to determine if they complied with requirements established by CMS, as  well as to assess whether the information presented on those Web sites  was accurate, complete, and timely. We did not evaluate communications  issued by all Medicare carriers; our findings are limited to those carriers  we reviewed and cannot be projected to other carriers.", "To evaluate the quality of CMS\u2019s management and oversight of carriers\u2019  communications activities, we identified relevant requirements that CMS  imposes on carriers regarding their communications with physicians. We  also examined CMS\u2019s allocation of key resources devoted to  communication activities. In addition, we observed CMS officials conduct  an on-site performance evaluation of one carrier\u2019s call center. To identify  CMS\u2019s efforts to improve Medicare communication to physicians, we  spoke with officials from CMS, carriers, medical associations, physicians  and their practice administrators, and reviewed related documentation.  We identified recent initiatives CMS has undertaken to improve physician  communications and also explored its plans for future enhancements.", "Appendix I contains more information regarding the scope and  methodology of our work. A more detailed description of our review of  carrier call centers is contained in appendix II. Appendix III summarizes  the amount and types of information the seven physician practices  received from both governmental and nongovernmental sources from  February 1, 2001, through April 30, 2001.

CMS manages Medicare, the nation\u2019s  largest health insurer, in a challenging and complex environment in which  medical providers and beneficiaries form a vast network of stakeholders  with differing priorities. The agency is charged with developing  regulations and policies that implement the statutory provisions of the  Medicare program. The program is operated by CMS with the assistance of  approximately 50 carriers and fiscal intermediaries\u2014generally health  insurance companies\u2014that annually process about 900 million claims  submitted by nearly 1 million providers and private health plans. Medicare  is estimated to have spent nearly $240 billion in fiscal year 2001 for  services provided to approximately 40 million elderly and disabled  beneficiaries.", "In order to receive reimbursement from Medicare, CMS requires  physicians to submit claims that identify the services they have performed  by using the agency\u2019s national uniform procedure coding system. Like  other Medicare providers, physicians are responsible for billing Medicare  correctly for services performed and informing beneficiaries of the level of  Medicare coverage at the time of service. To do this they need reliable  information on Medicare coverage, claims coding and documentation  requirements, claims submission instructions, program changes, and  carrier policies.", "CMS communicates information describing its billing requirements, as  well as other relevant regulations and policies, to physicians primarily  through its carriers. The carriers communicate with physicians in several  ways. They send physicians bulletins periodically to update them on new  rules and program changes, provide toll-free lines to call centers so  physicians can obtain answers to questions, and maintain Web sites that  include postings of, among other things, new Medicare developments and  carrier-sponsored training. CMS and its carriers also sponsor a variety of  provider education activities, such as workshops and on-line training  courses, to help familiarize physicians with billing rules and other aspects  of the program and to update them on program changes.", "Physicians have become increasingly vocal about the timeliness and  quality of the Medicare information CMS and its carriers provide. For  example, last year, in congressional testimony, physicians and their  representatives reported frustration because carrier communications are  often unclear and do not always provide them with advance notice of  program changes. They also charged that, when they seek clarification,  carrier personnel often give them incorrect answers to their questions.", "CMS establishes carrier requirements, including some related to  communications, in its annual budget and performance requirements  (BPR). For example, the BPRs require carriers to communicate with  physicians about local medical review policies (LMRP) and claims  submission procedures. CMS is responsible for monitoring the  performance of its carriers to ensure that they accurately and efficiently  fulfill their requirements and properly implement Medicare policies. Much  of CMS\u2019s oversight is accomplished through its periodic evaluations of  carrier performance. In addition, the agency also requires carriers to  routinely submit evidence of their own self-monitoring activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier Communications Are Often Difficult to Use, Out of Date, Inaccurate, and Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["Medicare information provided by carriers for physicians is often difficult  to interpret and use, out of date, inaccurate, and incomplete.

Carriers have discretion regarding the bulletins\u2019 format and  organization, but they are required to reprint certain CMS-provided  information verbatim. For example, carriers receive and reproduce CMS- issued guidance\u2014known as program memorandums (PM)\u2014which convey  details about upcoming program changes scheduled to become effective in  the next few months.", "Our review of bulletins issued from March through July 2001 by 10  randomly selected carriers showed that there are several aspects of the  bulletins, including their organization and length, which hinder their  usefulness. As a result of carriers\u2019 freedom to develop their own bulletins  with little direct CMS guidance, there was considerable variation in the  organization and format of the bulletins we reviewed. While bulletins  issued by 6 of the 10 carriers organized information by subject matter or  specialty, the others provided only an alphabetical key word index instead  of a table of contents to assist the user. Providing only a key word index  makes it difficult to identify information relevant to different physician  practices. Some carriers that serve physicians in several states issued a  single bulletin for all their states. Some of these bulletins had information  for each state contained in a separate insert or section. Other, less helpful,  multistate bulletins only noted state differences within individual articles,  requiring physicians or their staffs to scan each article to determine  whether it was relevant and applicable to their practices. In addition, the  bulletins were typically over 50 pages in length and several exceeded 80  pages, making them lengthy documents to search.", "In several instances, bulletins were late, or provided little advance notice,  in communicating HCFA-issued program changes to physicians. To test  the timeliness of carrier bulletins in communicating information, we  selected four PMs that HCFA issued from February through April 2001  concerning program changes that physicians would need to be aware of in  billing for certain services. We then reviewed the bulletins issued from  March through July by the 10 carriers we sampled, to determine when the  four PMs were included in the carriers\u2019 bulletins. In 11 instances, PMs  were either not communicated through carriers\u2019 bulletins until after their  scheduled implementation dates, or they did not appear at all in the  bulletins we reviewed, as shown in table 1. In 11 additional instances,  bulletins communicated the memorandums less than 30 days prior to the  implementation date, giving physicians little advance notice to help ensure  their compliance with Medicare rules. Overall, 6 of the 10 carriers did not  communicate at least one of the four PMs before its scheduled  implementation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier Call Centers Often Provide Inaccurate and Incomplete Information and Lack Standard Policies and Sufficient Resources", "paragraphs": ["Customer service representatives (CSR) at carrier call centers we tested  rarely provided appropriate answers to questions we posed. Eighty-five  percent of the responses we received from CSRs from 5 carrier call  centers were inaccurate or incomplete.", "To assess the accuracy of responses provided by CSRs, we made 61 calls  to the provider inquiry lines at call centers and asked three questions from  the FAQ pages on carriers\u2019 Web sites concerning the appropriate way to  bill Medicare in circumstances commonly encountered by physicians.When calling, we identified ourselves as GAO representatives and asked  the CSRs to answer our questions as if we were physicians. CSR responses  were recorded verbatim and submitted to a Medicare coding expert at  CMS along with the text of the questions and answers used. We used the  following questions when making our calls:  1.\t If a physician provides critical care for 1 hour and 15 minutes, how  should the services be reported? Should code 99292 (for an additional  30 minutes) be reported? Should the reduced services modifier be  used?  2.\t What is the proper way to bill for an office visit on the same day as a  surgical procedure?  3.\t Can code 99211 be reported if a nurse in the physician\u2019s office provides  instruction on self-administering insulin?", "Appendix II provides the answers that appear on the Web sites.", "The results of the test, which were validated by the coding expert, showed  that 32 percent of the answers were inaccurate, 53 percent were  incomplete, and only 15 percent were complete and accurate. These  results are illustrated in table 2. There was little variation among the  carriers in the overall accuracy and completeness of their answers.", "Many physicians we spoke to expressed frustration that CSRs will not  always provide information on how to properly code certain claims.  Carrier call centers had varying policies about providing physicians with  specific coding information. Knowing the appropriate code for a medical  service is essential to properly billing Medicare. Although CMS does not  have a policy preventing them from doing so, managers at the carrier call  centers we visited reported that it is not their policy to provide  information to callers on how to code a specific claim. Carriers reported  that they are reluctant to provide specific codes because the CSRs lack the  medical expertise to appropriately make coding judgments, and they do  not have the physician\u2019s clinical documentation at the time of the calls to  understand the procedure or service in context.", "During our test of call center accuracy, we noted that CSRs followed  different procedures regarding coding-related inquiries and frequently did  not adhere to the carriers\u2019 stated policy. While in 19 cases the CSRs  provided neither a code nor referral to a source of coding information,  specific codes were given in 24 instances. Specific referral to a bulletin  issue or to a regulation number was given in 16 other cases, but for 7 of  these cases the information was too vague to enable someone to locate the  coding rules. Even when the referrals to information sources were  accurate, physicians told us that being directed to other carrier  publications does not respond to their need for readily accessible  interpretation of Medicare regulations.", "Our visits to 3 call centers also revealed that there is no uniformity or  standardization across carriers in the types of technological resources  available to CSRs. For example, 1 call center we visited had an on-line  searchable database of LMRPs that facilitated quick retrieval of the  appropriate information by the CSRs. Representatives at the 2 other call  centers used hard copy bulletins or bulletins posted on their Web sites in a  nonsearchable format. CSRs without easily searchable tools told us that  they relied heavily on their more experienced colleagues, in the absence of  more authoritative sources, for answers.", "The lack of technological resources at call centers can affect centers\u2019  abilities to monitor the performance of their CSRs. One call center we  visited was able to record calls from providers and the computer screens  accessed by CSRs to determine whether their responses were accurate  and complete, while the other two call centers could only record the  telephone calls. Two call centers we visited were able to electronically  observe each CSR\u2019s phone line activity to track the length and origin of  calls; however, another call center had no electronic information and  could only monitor lines and identify the type of caller by listening to the  calls as they took place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carrier Web Sites Not Easy to Use and Often Did Not Meet HCFA-Mandated Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Most of the 10 carrier Web sites we reviewed did not contain features that  would allow physicians to quickly and directly obtain the information they  needed.

Only 4 of the 10 Web sites we examined contained site maps. Only 6  contained search functions and in two instances, the search functions did  not work. Three sites had neither search functions nor site maps, making  them difficult to navigate to access information. Furthermore, the Web  sites often contained out-of-date information.

The lack of standard approaches to  communication by carriers makes consistent oversight more challenging  for CMS.

Carrier  call centers are instructed to perform \u201cquality monitoring\u201d no more than 10  times a quarter for each CSR, but CMS\u2019s definition of what constitutes  accuracy and completeness in call center responses is neither clear nor  specific. For example, CMS defines accuracy as not being inaccurate\u2014as  opposed to providing necessary and complete information to allow  physicians to correctly bill the program. In the case of Web-based  communication, the BPRs contain few requirements about the clarity or  timeliness of information. Instead, they generally focus on legal issues\u2014  such as measures to protect copyrighted material\u2014that, while important,  do not enhance physicians\u2019 understanding of, or ability to correctly  implement, Medicare policy.", "CMS officials acknowledged that physician communications have received  less support and oversight than other aspects of carrier operations and  attributed this, in part, to a lack of resources. CMS\u2019s regional offices,  which are most directly responsible for carrier oversight, provide  assistance to carriers through business function experts (BFE) whose  principal method of oversight is participation on CPE teams. A CMS  official told us that there are not enough BFEs to provide direct technical  assistance to all carriers in all areas of communication. Furthermore, a  lack of budgetary resources limits BFEs\u2019 travel to carrier sites. One  regional BFE we interviewed handles four functional areas, including  provider education and provider phone inquiries, for 6 separate Medicare  carriers. The BFE interviewed noted that little hands-on technical  assistance is provided. Despite the fact that bulletins are a key means of  physician communication, and Web sites are growing in importance, some  regions have not been allocated any BFEs for these functions. Moreover,  no region has a full-time equivalent staff member dedicated to these  critical forms of communication, leaving carriers to solve problems  independently.", "CMS\u2019s efforts to assist carriers in sharing successful approaches are also  limited. The agency\u2019s annual conference for call center managers provides  a forum for sharing information and strategies. However, similar  opportunities do not exist for carrier staff members working with bulletins  and Web sites. CMS collects and posts on-line a carrier BestPractices  Handbookrelating to provider communications and education, but as of  January 2002, the information had not been updated in a year. Further, the  handbook contains little detail about how to implement the strategies for  improving communications.", "The lack of specific standards, sufficient technical assistance, and best  practice guidance creates an environment in which, as one CMS business  function expert said, each carrier must develop its own communication  strategies, resulting in duplication of carriers\u2019 efforts and variations in the  quality of their service to physicians.

Previously, these reviews had been limited to beneficiary call  centers.", "We observed one CPE team as it evaluated the operations of a provider  call center. This team focused mainly on performance standards that  address procedures, such as how long a caller is kept on hold or whether  the CSR had given an appropriate greeting, rather than whether  information provided was complete and accurate. In order to evaluate the  carrier\u2019s performance in monitoring its CSRs, the CPE auditor listened to  10 prerecorded calls that had been evaluated by the carrier at an earlier  date. However, the CPE auditor did not access the claims information to  evaluate whether the information being provided to the callers was  correct. While assessing procedural performance is important, helping  ensure that callers receive the correct information is essential.", "In addition to CMS\u2019s evaluation of call centers through CPEs, the agency  requires carriers to evaluate the performance of their call center CSRs.  Carriers must monitor up to 10 calls for each CSR each quarter\u2014  amounting to about 90 of the more than 30,000 provider inquiries received  by a given carrier each quarter.

They also  submit quarterly activity reports on communications.

CMS also provided  us with technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In addressing our first recommendation to assume responsibility of a  national bulletin for physicians, CMS pointed out that it is taking steps to  \u201cnationalize\u201d information contained in these bulletins. It said it is already  including articles of national interest regarding Medicare issues in carrier  bulletins. CMS also said it is planning a National Provider Bulletin Project  to study the practicality of establishing a national source for the  information included in these bulletins as well as potential changes to the  publication and distribution process.", "In response to our second recommendation that new performance  standards be established for carrier call centers, CMS described a variety  of initiatives it has under way to help enhance the quality of these  communications. CMS agreed that providing timely, correct, and  consistent answers to physicians\u2019 questions is imperative. The agency  stated that it has instituted a new program of performance standards that  features more effective oversight and evaluation and that includes new  quality call monitoring procedures. Although this new plan appears to  contain key components of an effective communication strategy, CMS\u2019s  description of this effort does not contain sufficient detail for us to fully  assess its usefulness. We believe such a plan ultimately needs to  incorporate specific performance measures for which the carriers could  be held accountable. Although CMS indicated it plans to devise ways of  objectively measuring carrier performance, it said that it does not yet have  such measures in place.", "In response to our third recommendation to set standards and provide  carriers with additional technical assistance to enhance carrier Web sites,  CMS outlined the requirements that carriers must meet. CMS indicated it  was satisfied with carriers\u2019 performance in this area, pointing out that an  examination of Web sites was part of this year\u2019s annual CPE reviews.  According to CMS, none of the carriers have been deficient in their  compliance with CMS requirements, and CPE reviewers found most of the  Web sites to be user-friendly. Although these CPE reviews may not have  detected deficiencies at carrier Web sites, as we have noted most of the  Web sites we reviewed did not comply with some of CMS\u2019s requirements.  CMS has agreed to reexamine its Web site monitoring efforts.", "Regarding out fourth recommendation, CMS agreed that utilizing expert  teams to conduct CPE reviews would be the best means of ensuring  substantive evaluations. However, CMS said that it believed that  implementing our recommendation would require the agency to establish  a team of dedicated review staff, which would not be feasible given the  agency\u2019s available resources. Although CMS said it could not implement  our recommendation at this time, it indicated that it will nonetheless try to  continue building the expertise of its review staff. According to CMS,  many of the staff members that performed these reviews last year will  perform them this year as well. In addition, CMS said it will continue to  provide relevant training to these staff members.", "Officials of the American Medical Association and the Medical Group  Management Association also reviewed a draft of this report.
