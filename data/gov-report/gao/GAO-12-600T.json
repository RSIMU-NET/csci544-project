Since its initiation in 2002, MDA has been given a significant amount of flexibility in executing the development and fielding of the ballistic missile defense system. This statement addresses progress MDA made in the past year, the challenges it still faces with concurrent acquisitions and how it is addressing parts quality issues. It is based on GAO\u0092s April 2012 report on missile defense and its June 2011 report on space and missile defense parts quality problems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2011, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) experienced mixed results in executing its fiscal year 2011 development goals and tests. For the first time in 5 years, GAO was able to report that the agency delivered all of the targets used in fiscal year 2011 test events with the targets performing as expected. In addition, the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense program\u0092s Standard Missile-3 Block IA missile was able to intercept an intermediate-range target for the first time and the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense program successfully conducted its first operational flight test. However, none of the programs GAO assessed were able to fully accomplish their asset delivery and capability goals for the year. Flight test failures, a test anomaly, and delays disrupted MDA\u0092s flight test plan and the acquisition strategies of several components. Flight test failures forced MDA to suspend or slow production of three out of four interceptors currently being manufactured. Some of the difficulties in MDA\u0092s testing and production of assets can be attributed to its highly concurrent acquisition approach.", "Concurrency is broadly defined as the overlap between technology development and product development or between product development and production. High levels of concurrency were present in MDA\u0092s initial efforts and are present in current efforts. For example, MDA\u0092s flight test failures of a new variant of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program\u0092s interceptors while production was underway delayed delivery to the warfighter, increased costs, and will require retrofit of fielded equipment. Flight test costs to confirm its capability has increased from $236 million to about $1 billion. MDA has taken positive steps to incorporate some acquisition best practices, such as increasing competition and partnering with laboratories to build prototypes. For example, MDA took actions in fiscal year 2011 to reduce acquisition risks and prevent future cost growth in its Aegis SM-3 Block IIA program. Nevertheless, as long as newer programs adopt acquisition approaches with elevated levels of concurrency, there is still considerable risk of future performance shortfalls that will require retrofits, cost overruns, and schedule delays.", "MDA is also taking the initiative to address parts quality issues through various means, including internal policies, collaborative initiatives with other agencies, and contracting strategies to hold its contractors more accountable. Quality issues have seriously impeded to the development of the missile defenses in recent years. For example, during a fiscal year 2010 Terminal High Altitude Area Defense flight test, the air-launched target failed to initiate after it was dropped from the aircraft and fell into the ocean. A failure review board identified shortcomings in internal processes at the contractor to be the cause of the failure. This failure led to a delay of the planned test, restructuring of other planned tests, and hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to develop and acquire new medium-range air-launched targets. Parts quality issues will require sustained attention from both the executive and legislative branches. MDA is exhibiting some leadership, but there are significant barriers to addressing quality problems, such as the increase in counterfeit electronic parts, a declining government share of the overall electronic parts market, and workforce gaps within the aerospace sector."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no new recommendations in this statement. In the April 2012 report, GAO made recommendations to strengthen MDA\u0092s longer-term acquisition prospects including a review of MDA\u0092s acquisitions for concurrency to determine whether the proper balance has been struck between planned deployment dates and concurrency risks to achieve those dates. The report includes additional recommendations on how individual program elements can reduce concurrency.

To enable MDA to field and enhance a  missile defense system quickly, the Secretary of Defense in 2002 delayed  entry of the BMDS program into DOD\u2019s traditional acquisition process  until a mature capability was ready to be handed over to a military service  for production and operation. To meet a presidential directive to deliver an  initial capability by 2004 and to meet a presidential announcement in  2009 to deploy missile defenses to Europe, the program concurrently  developed and fielded assets and continues to utilize this approach.

While this  approach enabled MDA to rapidly deploy an initial capability in 2005 by  concurrently developing, manufacturing, and fielding BMDS assets, it also  led to the initiation of large-scale acquisition efforts before critical  technologies were fully understood and allowed programs to move  forward into production without having tests completed to verify  performance. After delivering its initial capability in 2005, MDA continued  these high-risk practices that have resulted in problems requiring  extensive retrofits, redesigns, delays, and cost increases. While MDA has  incorporated some acquisition best practices in its newer programs, its  acquisition strategies still include high or elevated levels of concurrency  that result in increased acquisition risk\u2014including performance shortfalls,  cost growth, and schedule delays\u2014for these newer programs.", "Concurrency is broadly defined as overlap between technology  development and product development or between product development  and production of a system. This overlap is intended to introduce systems  rapidly, to fulfill an urgent need, to avoid technology obsolescence, and to  maintain an efficient industrial development and production workforce.  However, while some concurrency is understandable, committing to  product development before requirements are understood and  technologies mature as well as committing to production and fielding  before development is complete is a high-risk strategy that often results in  performance shortfalls, unexpected cost increases, schedule delays, and  test problems. At the very least, a highly concurrent strategy forces  decision makers to make key decisions without adequate information  about the weapon\u2019s demonstrated operational effectiveness, reliability,  logistic supportability, and readiness for production. Also, starting  production before critical tests have been successfully completed has  resulted in the purchase of systems that do not perform as intended.  These premature commitments mean that a substantial commitment to  production has been made before the results of testing are available to  decision makers. Accordingly, they create pressure to avoid production  breaks even when problems are discovered in testing. These premature  purchases have affected the operational readiness of our forces and quite  often have led to expensive modifications.", "In contrast, our work has found that successful programs that deliver  promised capabilities for the estimated cost and schedule follow a  systematic and disciplined knowledge-based approach, in which high  levels of product knowledge are demonstrated at critical points in  development.require an appropriate balance between schedule and risk and, in  practice, programs can be executed successfully with some level of   This approach recognizes that development programs  concurrency.  For example, it is appropriate to order long-lead production  material in advance of the production decision, with the pre-requisite that  developmental testing is substantially accomplished and the design  confirmed to work as intended. This knowledge-based approach is not  unduly concurrent. Rather, programs gather knowledge that  demonstrates that their technologies are mature, designs are stable, and  production processes are in control before transitioning between  acquisition phases, which helps programs identify and resolve risks early.  It is a process in which technology development and product  development are treated differently and managed separately. Technology  development must allow room for unexpected results and delays.  Developing a product culminates in delivery and therefore gives great  weight to design and production. If a program falls short in technology  maturity, it is harder to achieve design stability and almost impossible to  achieve production maturity. It is therefore key to separate technology  from product development and product development from production\u2014 and thus avoid concurrency. A knowledge-based approach delivers a  product on time, within budget, and with the promised capabilities.", "See figure 1 for depictions of a concurrent schedule and a schedule that  uses a knowledge-based approach.", "To meet the 2002 presidential direction to initially rapidly field and update  missile defense capabilities as well as the 2009 presidential  announcement to deploy missile defenses in Europe, MDA has  undertaken and continues to undertake highly concurrent acquisitions.  Such practices enabled MDA to quickly ramp up efforts in order to meet  tight presidential deadlines, but they were high risk and resulted in  problems that required extensive retrofits, redesigns, delays, and cost  increases.", "Table 3 illustrates concurrency in past efforts and its associated effects.  Among earlier MDA programs, concurrency was most pronounced in the  GMD program, where the agency was pressed to deliver initial  capabilities within a few years to meet the 2002 presidential directive. The  consequences here have been significant, in terms of production delays  and performance shortfalls, and are still affecting the agency.", "In recent years, MDA has taken positive steps to incorporate some  acquisition best practices, such as increasing competition and partnering  with laboratories to build prototypes. For example, MDA took actions in  fiscal year 2011 to reduce acquisition risks and prevent future cost growth  in its Aegis BMD SM-3 Block IIA program. The agency recognized that  the program\u2019s schedule included elevated acquisition risks, so it  appropriately added more time to the program by revising the schedule to  relieve schedule compression between its subsystem and system-level  design reviews. In addition, it incorporated lessons learned from other  SM-3 variants into its development to further mitigate production unit  costs. Moreover, for its PTSS program, MDA has simplified the design  and requirements.", "However, table 4 shows that the agency\u2019s current acquisition strategies  still include high or elevated levels of concurrency that set many of its  newer programs up for increased acquisition risk, including performance  shortfalls, cost growth, and schedule delays.", "In our April 2012 report, we made two recommendations to strengthen  MDA\u2019s longer-term acquisition prospects. We recommended that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Office of Acquisition Technology and  Logistics to (1) review all of MDA\u2019s acquisitions for concurrency and  determine whether the proper balance has been struck between the  planned deployment dates and the concurrency risks taken to achieve  those dates and (2) review and report to the Secretary of Defense the  extent to which the directed capability delivery dates announced by the  President in 2009 are contributing to concurrency in missile defense  acquisitions and recommend schedule adjustments where significant  benefits can be obtained by reducing concurrency. DOD concurred with  both of these recommendations.", "In addition, we recommended specific steps to reduce concurrency in  several of MDA\u2019s programs. DOD agreed with four of the five missile  defense element-specific recommendations and partially agreed with our  recommendation to report to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and to  Congress the root cause of the SM-3 Block IB developmental flight test  failure, path forward for future development, and the plans to bridge  production from the SM-3 Block IA to the SM-3 Block IB before  committing to additional purchases of the SM-3 Block IB.  DOD  commented that MDA will report this information to the Office of the  Secretary of Defense and to Congress upon completion of the failure  review in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012.

By the time the problem was discovered, the manufacturer no  longer produced the part and an alternate contractor had to be found to  manufacture and test replacement parts.
