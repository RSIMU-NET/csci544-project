Medical supplies accounted for the  majority of spending on goods, at $11.1 billion. As discussed in more  detail below, supply orders placed under the MSPV program are  generally not included in this total.", "Our analysis also indicates that the VA relied on competitive procedures  for the majority of its spending on goods and services from fiscal year  2013 through fiscal year 2015, obligating roughly $28.8 billion, or 63  percent of its total obligations, using full and open competition, as shown  in figure 3.

We  reported earlier this year that total contracting awards to SDVOSB and  VOSB firms have increased in recent years, in part because of the  Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and Information Technology Act of 2006,  which required VA to set annual goals for contracting with SDVOSBs and  VOSBs and directed VA to restrict competition to veteran-owned small  businesses if it is reasonably expected that at least two such businesses  will submit offers and the award can be made at a fair and reasonable  price, known as the Rule of Two.

VA procurement  policy, dated June 15, 2012, requires mandatory usage of eCMS for most  procurement actions valued above the micro-purchase threshold  (currently $3,500). Many individual MSPV orders are under the micro- purchase threshold, and those actions were not recorded in the system.  Further, VA policy exempted MSPV orders placed by ordering officers  from being recorded in eCMS. According to VHA\u2019s MSPV program office,  because ordering officers\u2014as opposed to contracting officers\u2014do the  bulk of VA\u2019s MSPV ordering, this exemption resulted in VA not capturing  these orders in eCMS.

We compared FPDS-NG and eCMS  data for fiscal years 2013 through 2015 and found that the total  obligations recorded in FPDS-NG were about $10.4 billion more than in  eCMS. Based on our analysis, it appears that the primary reason for this  gap is that orders under the pharmaceutical prime vendor program are  not being recorded in eCMS but rather are being manually reported to  FPDS-NG. VA\u2019s Senior Procurement Executive told us that the omission  of many prime vendor orders from eCMS limits VA\u2019s knowledge and  oversight of its contract obligations. As the Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government also note, leadership needs complete  information to provide effective management and oversight. Those  standards state that U.S. government agencies should clearly document  transactions, ensure that documentation be readily accessible, and  ensure that transactions are complete and accurate. As described  above, we found billions of dollars not contained in eCMS. While VA has  taken some steps to improve the completeness of eCMS information,  such as adding data on high-tech medical equipment orders, most prime  vendor orders are still omitted.

Additionally, we found that VA\u2019s  decentralized acquisition function\u2014which does not always have clearly  delineated organizational roles and responsibilities\u2014contributes to  confusion among customers regarding which contracting entity they  should consult to acquire various goods and services, sometimes causing  VA contracting entities to perform overlapping roles."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Does Not Always Ensure That Procurement Policies Are Cohesive and Effectively Communicated", "paragraphs": ["Key VA procurement policies are outdated and difficult for contracting  officers to use.

The VA Director of Procurement Policy stated that the 1997  VAAR was not completely rescinded upon the publication of the 2008  edition because some of the prior provisions remained relevant. We found  that the necessity to use two VAAR versions to understand which of the  provisions are relevant is causing confusion among contracting officers.  For instance, a 2015 edition of the VA Handbook for Acquisition  Professionals states:  There are two active versions of the VAAR: 1997 and 2008. Neither  version is comprehensive. All information in the 2008 version still  applies (unless an Information Letter, circular, directive or  memorandum specifically states otherwise); not all of the information  in the 1997 version still applies.

If the section is not preceded by \u2018:::,\u2019 it no longer applies.", "Since contracting officials voiced confusion and raised concerns with the  2008 VAAR, the Office of Procurement Policy undertook a gap analysis of  three sections of the 1997 version of the VAAR, for which the language  either differed between the 1997 and 2008 versions or was omitted from  the more recent 2008 version entirely. Following our inquiries about this  issue, the Office of Procurement Policy took action to fully rescind the  1997 VAAR. In June 2016, VA\u2019s Senior Procurement Executive informed  us that this process had been completed, including the rescission of the  1997 VAAR in its entirety, meaning that VA contracting officials are now  to refer solely to the 2008 VAAR.", "A new revision of the 2008 VAAR is also in development, but the  progress towards completion has faced delays. VA began the process in  2011 but does not plan to finalize the new VAAR until December 2018,  including the required rulemaking process. According to VA\u2019s Director of  Procurement Policy its Senior Procurement Executive, several reasons  contributed to these delays, including various steps in obtaining internal  review from VA\u2019s legal department and input from other stakeholders,  such as VISN and Medical Center Directors. VA\u2019s Senior Procurement  Executive also stated that this revision of the VAAR has just recently  become a high priority for the department and senior management  attention may be needed to help expedite revisions and the ultimate  issuance of the updates. In addition to revising the VAAR, VA\u2019s Office of  Procurement Policy, within the Office of Acquisition and Logistics, is also  developing a new VA Acquisition Manual that will serve as a companion  to the VAAR and replace VA\u2019s other sources of procurement policy.  Issuance of the manual is expected to follow the same schedule as the  updated VAAR. The lengthy delay in updating this fundamental source of  policy for contracting officers impedes their ability to effectively carry out  their duties.

The Office of Procurement  Policy is no longer issuing these policy memoranda, but in previous years  it and other offices had issued at least 170, which typically did not have  expiration dates. The Director of Procurement Policy stated that the  guidance set forth in these letters was meant to be temporary in nature.  For example, a 2009 Information Letter outlining contract oversight  processes established dollar thresholds for certain reviews\u2014which  officials in VA contracting offices cited during our visits\u2014but Procurement  Policy officials said that these thresholds had since been revised by an  interim Acquisition Flash until a Procurement Policy Memorandum can be  developed. The Director of Procurement Policy also stated that the  Office of Procurement Policy does not have a complete list of all  Information Letters and is working to develop a complete repository, in  some cases by gathering them from the contracting officers themselves.  As of April 2016, the office had identified approximately 170 Information  Letters through this process, 70 of which the Director said had been  rescinded entirely or were replaced by Procurement Policy Memoranda.  The Director of Procurement Policy further stated that access to the  repository is limited to Office of Procurement Policy staff to prevent  recirculation of outdated Information Letters among the department\u2019s  contracting staff, which could cause confusion on which policy is in effect.  The Office of Procurement Policy has not established a firm time frame  for completing its efforts to rescind or replace the Information Letters.  Without a firm time frame, there is the risk that this effort will lose traction.", "As an example of the confusion we found among the various sources of  policy and guidance, we analyzed information specific to contracting with  SDVOSBs, which is an important part of VA\u2019s procurement process.  Additionally, we spoke with one contracting officer who found the  available information on this issue challenging to navigate. Several  sources of VA policy address SDVOSB contracting. Figure 5 shows an  example of VA making policy changes without incorporating them into the  VAAR.", "For example, the contracting officer responsible for one of our selected  contracts for surgical equipment stated that, using the VAAR as her  guide, she awarded a $335,000 contract to an SDVOSB on a sole-source  basis without a justification and approval. However, an internal post- award review found that this action was not permitted based a 2012  VAAR deviation and a 2013 Procurement Policy Memorandum. Both  required a justification and approval from contracting office management  for a contract of this value. The contracting officer was unaware of this  policy change because she believed the VAAR to be the most current  policy. This particular contracting office subsequently provided training to  its staff regarding sole-source contracting with SDVOSB firms.", "The issues associated with contracting with SDVOSB and VOSB firms  have recently been subject to heightened attention due to the June 2016  Supreme Court decision, which concluded that VA must restrict  competition to veteran-owned small businesses if it reasonably expects  that at least two veteran-owned firms will submit offers and the award can  be made at a fair and reasonable price, even when VA will otherwise  meet its annual minimum contracting goals. According to VA\u2019s Senior  Procurement Executive, this decision will have a large impact on VA  contracting because, among other things, the ruling requires training for  VA contracting officers. VA began providing this training in July 2016 and  plans to continue it on an ongoing basis through webinars. VA also plans  to staff a hotline to assist contracting officers in implementing the  Supreme Court ruling.

For example, SAC\u2019s  responsibility for specialty medical and surgical supplies could include  some areas covered by the NAC\u2014especially since the NAC had this  responsibility in prior years. Some contracting officials we spoke with  characterized the March 2013 memorandum as more of a guide than a  mandate, resulting in confusion about how flexible these roles and  responsibilities really are.

In our discussions with officials who rely on contracting staff, they told us  they had experienced difficulties due to workload constraints. Specifically,  one medical center\u2019s chief logistics officer\u2014responsible for managing  supplies\u2014stated that his local contracting office had at times turned away  some purchase requests because it could not staff them. In some cases,  workload prevented contracting officials from pursuing the optimal  acquisition strategy. For example, medical center and contracting staff  identified a medical center\u2019s month-to-month purchase orders for patient  transportation as problematic because no long-term contract was in  place, but no action was taken for more than a year due to lack of staff  availability. Once a new contract was finally awarded about 2 years later,  the annual value of the contract had decreased by about $1.7 million.  According to the COR, the pricing on this new contract was much better.  These savings could have been realized much sooner if the contracting  office had been able to proceed immediately once the need was  identified. Another contract that we reviewed covered a requirement for  the delivery of durable medical equipment. The contracting officer that  currently oversees the requirement said that the contract passed among  several contracting officers who had retired or were on extended sick  leave; the current contracting officer stated that he received the  requirement just as the contract was ending and expected to non- competitively extend the contract due to a lack of time to compete the  requirement. Additionally, a recent GAO review of one specific type of VA  contract\u2014sole-source contracts for affiliates\u2014found that workload  demands and training shortcomings for the contracting officers were a  challenge to VA\u2019s ability to manage these contracts in a timely manner.  One contracting officer we met with also stated that, while training at the  VAAA, he had to work each evening following class because his  colleagues were not available to provide backup. We spoke with the  leadership of seven different contracting offices in the course of our  review, and, in six of those cases, managers said that workload was a  challenge for their staff.", "Our analysis supported the concerns we heard from VHA contracting  officers and their managers. VHA\u2019s contracting officers process a large  number of small dollar-value actions to support medical center  operations. According to eCMS data, contracting staff in the three VISNs  we visited executed a total of about 36,000 actions in fiscal year 2015, the  majority of which were small transactions, representing total obligations of  about $1.6 billion. According to figures provided by local managers, the  three offices had a total of about 363 contracting officers. This average of  about 100 actions per year per contracting officer is indicative of the fact  that VHA contracting officers must process a comparatively large number  of small transactions. The number of actions a given contracting officer is  able to process varies, given the wide spectrum of cost, complexity, and  risk, and there is no single standard to apply. GAO has previously noted,  in our inclusion of strategic human capital management on our High Risk  list, that contract specialists are one area of the federal workforce that has  been identified by an Office of Personnel Management working group as  having a skills gap.", "As VA\u2019s Acting Chief Acquisition Officer noted, the need for contracting  officers to process frequent and urgent small-dollar transactions reduces  their ability to plan ahead and take a strategic view of procurement needs.  We found that many VHA contracting actions are short-notice urgent  purchases to support immediate patient care, even though many of the  items are repetitive procurements. For instance, a review of eCMS  records for one of the VISNs we visited indicated that from fiscal years  2013 through 2015 hundreds of actions each year were identified as  \u201cemergency\u201d purchases in the requirement description. In many cases,  these purchases were for routine items such as surgical or lab equipment  supplies. The Acting Chief Acquisition Officer said that VA\u2019s efforts to  consolidate requirements through strategic sourcing and make greater  use of ordering officers for routine items will help reduce these demands;  however, these efforts are in their initial stages.", "Several of the CORs we spoke to also cited workload as a challenge. For  these representatives, who work in program offices, medical departments,  and other operational roles, an additional challenge is that working with  contracts is not their primary role. Of the 19 CORs we spoke with, 5 said  that it was difficult to balance their COR duties with their regular job  responsibilities. CORs typically develop key portions of the contract  documentation, such as work statements and cost estimates.

But the review also found that certain  medical centers had been successful in creating new staff positions to  assist CORs. In April 2014, VHA officials directed all VISNs and medical  centers to develop and fund medical-center-based liaisons to assist in the  contracting process. These contract liaisons, some of whom have  backgrounds in contracting, were intended to assist CORs in performing  their duties by providing guidance, assisting with procurement  documentation, and supporting COR training status. For example, two  CORs we spoke with, as well as chief logistics officers from facilities in  VISNs that had implemented the contract liaison position, said that the  liaisons have improved the procurement process by clarifying  documentation and process requirements.

The prime vendor operates a  local warehouse and delivers supplies ordered by the medical center,  typically multiple times per week.

The NAC contracting officers  who award these national contracts delegate authority to place orders on  the contracts to ordering officers at the medical centers, who place the  orders with their local prime vendor.

Use of these national  contracts is also required by VA policy and regulation. Figure 9 provides  an overview of the MSPV process.", "However, the current MSPV process is confusing and cumbersome. This  makes it difficult for ordering officers to buy their supplies through the  correct national contracts (administered by the NAC) and take full  advantage of their discounted pricing, as required by VA policy. As noted,  these savings can be substantial. In addition to the supply items available  on national contracts, the MSPV system also allows ordering officers to  buy thousands of items directly from VA\u2019s Federal Supply Schedule  contracts, which lack the degree of discounted pricing of the national  contracts. Further, the information technology systems that support the  ordering process create obstacles for ordering officers to easily use the  discounted national contracts. Most orders are placed through IFCAP, a  decades-old IT system with a text-based interface, which does not include  a tool to look up items that are available on the national contracts. For  instance, ordering officers must know the exact item number\u2014which is  different for each vendor\u2014to enter into IFCAP. Replicating a prior order is  simpler than cross-referencing contracts and item numbers to ensure that  the items are being procured on the national contracts. Figure 10 shows  an example of the IFCAP text-based interface used by ordering officers.", "We found that while tools are available elsewhere to help ordering officers  identify the right national contracts, these are not easy to use. NAC has  provided spreadsheets listing its national contracts and the thousands of  items available under them, but ordering officers must visit the website to  find the spreadsheets and then cross-reference manually to the items that  they need to purchase. Ordering officers can also search for supplies via  the web-based Contract Catalog Search Tool, which is also operated by  NAC. This tool can be searched multiple ways, such as by item name or  contract vehicle. In addition, its search results include thousands of  Federal Supply Schedule items\u2014for instance, a search for \u201cbandage\u201d  returns 5,073 results, as shown in Figure 11. Given these obstacles,  ordering officers may be ordering based on historical purchases because  it is simpler or because of local preferences. By failing to use VA\u2019s  national contracts, medical centers may be failing to take advantage of  their discounted pricing.", "In addition to possibly missing out on discounted pricing on national  contracts, orders over the current micro-purchase threshold of $3,500  placed directly on the Federal Supply Schedules via the MSPV system  are subject to a FAR requirement to document a best value determination  after review of pricing from at least three vendors. Some orders are over  the micropurchase threshold, though the majority of orders are under the  threshold. Ordering officers placing orders directly on the Federal Supply  Schedules via the MSPV system would not conduct a best value  determination because the system does not present them that  opportunity. Thus, VA runs the risk of not complying with FAR  requirements in this regard.", "VA officials recognize that placing orders directly on the Federal Supply  Schedules through MSPV is problematic because they may be missing  out on discounted prices. However, neither we nor VA are able to assess  the full the extent to which MSPV orders are placed directly on Federal  Supply Schedules because of data limitations. But VA officials estimate  that this represents a substantial number of purchases. As noted above,  individual MSPV orders are generally not recorded in eCMS, although a  2016 policy now requires these orders to be reported in summaries at  least monthly. Currently, the prime vendors submit sales reports to NAC  that show transaction-level detail, but VA officials stated that these  reports are not consistent across the seven prime vendor contractors\u2014for  instance, the data fields vary. The acting head of VHA\u2019s MSPV Program  Office stated that it is not possible to estimate the portion of purchases  that are made directly on Federal Supply Schedules because VHA\u2019s data  do not differentiate between FSS and national contract purchases.  Officials from NAC and SAC also acknowledged that ordering officers can  order supplies directly from the Schedules, even when national contracts  are available. Officials from the SAC, which is now responsible for the  MSPV program, told us they plan to analyze the vendor-provided data to  determine the extent to which MSPV orders are bypassing national  contracts by being placed directly on the Federal Supply Schedules.

Under the new approach, SAC has already awarded new prime  vendor contracts and is in the process of awarding the supporting national  contracts for individual types of supplies. According to the Acting Chief  Acquisition Officer, VA has been planning for this change since 2011  when VA outlined a new approach to the MSPV program to improve  efficiency. More recently, improving the efficiency of how VA buys  medical and surgical goods has been identified as a priority under the  Secretary\u2019s MyVA initiative, including consolidating requirements to obtain  a larger portion of supplies through standardized national contracts.", "There will be a number of changes to how the MSPV program operates  under the new approach. First, SAC implemented new prime vendor  contract clauses that prohibit certain kinds of fees. According to NAC and  SAC officials, the current prime vendors charge suppliers fees to stock  their products in their warehouses, and these costs are indirectly passed  on to VA on the national contracts. SAC officials estimated the fees the  MSPVs charge suppliers\u2014which the current prime vendor contracts do  not prohibit\u2014range from 10 to 14 percent of the cost of the item. These  fees could represent a substantial increase in cost to VA. From fiscal  years 2013 through 2015, NAC reported that the VHA spent about $1.2  billion on MSPV sales. Using SAC\u2019s estimate of the scale of fees, we  calculated this could equal between around $120 million to $169 million in  fees paid by suppliers\u2014and, in turn, the VA medical centers\u2014over that  period. According to SAC officials, the new prime vendor contracts  specifically restrict the prime vendors from charging suppliers fees to  stock their products.", "Second, SAC plans to restrict ordering officers to a catalog of items on  national contracts, as opposed to allowing them to order directly from  Federal Supply Schedules. However, SAC faces a challenge in doing so.  In the initial rollout of the new process, purchases of certain Federal  Supply Schedule items not on VA national contracts will still be an option.  SAC officials stated that in order to ease the transition, about 4,500  Federal Supply Schedule items will be available initially. To accomplish its  goal of having all MSPV items under national contracts, SAC is also  awarding new national contracts for the thousands of items that will be  available for purchase through the new MSPV program. These national  contracts will cover supplies based on requirements identified by VHA  medical centers. To support this effort, VHA\u2019s MSPV program office is  identifying needs and setting consistent national requirements for medical  supply items. According to the director of this program office, VHA is  identifying items that should be offered in the new MSPV catalog through  a combination of analyses of current purchases and consulting with  project teams comprised of medical center clinicians. According to VHA  and SAC officials, they believe that about 8,000 to 10,000 unique items  will ultimately need to be available on national contracts to meet the  needs of all medical centers once ordering officers are no longer able to  use the Federal Supply Schedules for medical and surgical supplies.", "As of July 2016, SAC officials stated that VA had awarded national  contracts for about 1,800 items, including those on contract vehicles  transferred from NAC. VHA has set an internal goal of providing all  requirements\u2014detailed descriptions of the items to be purchased\u2014to  SAC by November 2016. However, the director of SAC stated that he  believes this timeline is aggressive and may be delayed. Once VHA has  submitted all requirements to SAC, additional time will be required to  award contracts. VA does not anticipate that SAC will be able to award  contracts for the full 8,000 to 10,000 items by the time the new MSPV  contracts become operational in late 2016\u2014the primary reason for the  addition of Federal Supply Schedule items to the catalog, as mentioned  above. According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, management should define objectives clearly to identify  risks. One example of objectives is time frames for achieving goals such  as this one. Given the importance to VA of ensuring that all MSPV items  are purchased through national contracts, it is critical that VA have  clearly-defined time frames for eliminating the ability for ordering officers  to directly order Federal Supply Schedule items from the MSPV catalog.  Without such time frames, VA is at risk of not ensuring that it gets the  available discount for these items.", "The final major change that SAC and VHA plan to implement is a new  online ordering interface, developed by a contractor for VHA, which will  provide ordering officers a more intuitive interface for the outdated and  difficult-to-use IFCAP system that is currently used for most orders.", "Figure 12 shows a sample screen from a pilot version of the new  interface.", "According to the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, information systems should be designed to help achieve an  organization\u2019s objectives. As VHA continues to develop the ordering  interface, it will be important that ordering officers can clearly distinguish  between items on national contracts and items directly on Federal Supply  Schedules. The national contracts are the required method of ordering,  when available, and they provide substantial discounts.", "There have been some delays in rolling out this new approach. In the  meantime, NAC and then SAC awarded one-year bridge contracts on a  sole-source basis to all current prime vendors to provide time for the  transition. VA anticipates transitioning operation of the MSPV to the new  contracts in December 2016. VA is currently preparing for this transition  to take place. Figure 13 shows the key events in this transition.", "Work remains to ensure that the transition to this new approach will be  successful. Updating the MSPV process affects how essential supplies  are ordered and delivered at 167 medical centers on a daily basis, and  facility logistics staff, including ordering officers, must be able to  implement the new approach. Some of the chief logistics officers and  ordering officers we spoke with expressed confusion over details of the  MSPV transfer to SAC. Three of the five medical center chief logistics  officers we spoke with said that they were uncertain about some details of  the transfer. Also, two of the three ordering officers we spoke with  expressed similar uncertainty. All of the chief logistics officers expressed  concern over whether the new MSPV approach would include all of the  items their medical centers currently require; one of these officials said  that he planned to work with his local Network Contracting Office to  procure supplies in the event that the new MSPV approach did not  include critical items. He reported that his office\u2019s analysis found 14 items  deemed critical to the function of the medical center that were not on a  preliminary list of supplies available through the new MSPV, nor were  acceptable substitutes. He stated that another 287 items they currently  purchase did not appear on the list, and his staff is in the process of  assessing whether acceptable substitutes will be included on a future list.  VHA\u2019s MSPV program office has developed a communication plan for the  transition that includes conferences, memoranda, and other  communications aimed at logistics personnel nationwide.

However, VA does not know how much of its contract spending  remains outside of strategic sourcing efforts, which could lead to VA  paying higher prices than it could otherwise obtain.", "Medical supplies are one area where strategic sourcing efforts have  lagged. As discussed above, the MSPV program does not ensure that  supplies are consistently purchased through VA\u2019s favorably-priced  national contracts, and many purchases were instead made directly from  Federal Supply Schedules. For example, in 2015, the Choice Act  Independent Assessment team conducted an analysis which found that  within one VISN, a single item\u2014a disposable blood pressure cuff\u2014was  purchased from six different vendors at significantly different prices,  despite the fact that a national contract was in place. According to VA  policy, use of a national contract is mandatory when one is in place for a  given type of supply, but VA does not have a process in place to monitor  VISN and medical center compliance with this requirement. GAO has also  previously reported that VISNs and medical centers have fallen short in  complying with VHA policies regarding the standardization of medical  supplies. If VA was able to realize savings of 10 percent on its fiscal  year 2015 MSPV spending, it could save about $46 million annually. VA  estimated that it saved approximately $103 million through the use of  national medical surgical contracts in fiscal year 2015. The planned  changes to the MSPV program, discussed above, may help increase the  percentage of supplies purchased via standardized national contracts  once fully implemented, but it is too soon to evaluate their success.", "There are opportunities to better apply strategic sourcing principles at the  regional level, as well. Within VHA, each of the 19 VISNs is responsible  for a regional network of multiple medical centers and clinics. Individual  medical centers within each VISN procure many goods and services  separately, despite the fact that their requirements are similar. There are  opportunities to consolidate these requirements\u2014such as security  services, elevator maintenance, and eyeglasses for patients\u2014to realize  both cost savings and greater efficiency in awarding and administering  contracts.", "We found efforts underway to consolidate requirements at the regional  level, but local autonomy and limited planning capacity pose obstacles.  For instance, one VISN we visited recently began an initiative to  consolidate requirements for purchases made by all of its medical  centers, especially services. VISN managers explained that they began  with the easiest requirements, such as security guard services and  elevator maintenance. They issued a draft memorandum with plans to  broaden this approach to most purchases. However, medical center staff  provided feedback that they preferred their own local contracts and did  not want VISN-wide contracts to become the default approach.", "Nevertheless, in our reviews of selected contract actions, we found a few  instances where program or contracting staff had been successful in  consolidating similar requirements across multiple medical centers. For  example, officials in two different VISNs told us that they had awarded  VISN-wide laboratory support contracts\u2014one VISN awarded a contract  for laboratory reagents, and the other VISN awarded a single contract for  outside testing services. In both cases, the contracting and laboratory  officials reported that they faced challenges, such as determining the  volume of the requirements, given that different medical centers have  slightly different equipment and demand. Both contracts are awarded,  and the COR for the testing services contract stated that it had achieved  significant savings for the VISN as a whole.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  visible leadership commitment is needed to drive changes like  consolidating fragmented procurement. Also, as stated in our 2012  report on strategic sourcing, best practices include clear guidance on  metrics for measuring success, including setting goals for use of strategic  sourcing contracts, establishing a centralized office, and holding senior  managers accountable to meet goals. VHA does not yet have these  types of practices in place for its regional medical centers and has not  taken steps to identify existing effective regional strategic sourcing  practices. VA\u2019s Acting Chief Acquisition Officer acknowledged that  fragmented procurement based on local preferences is a problem,  especially within VHA, and stated that he is trying to identify ways to  change this culture. While VA officials recognize that obstacles stem from  VA\u2019s culture of local autonomy, the cases we found where regional VISNs  had taken action\u2014in one case a VISN-wide initiative, and in other cases  for individual procurements\u2014indicate consolidating procurement is  possible with leadership buy-in, and that there are opportunities to share  lessons learned across VISNs. Within VHA, in VISNs where there is not a  consistent push by local leadership to pursue consolidation, it is  challenging for efforts driven by individual departments or contracting  personnel to overcome cultural obstacles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Than a Third of the Selected Contract Files Lacked Key Documents, and Internal Compliance Reviews Did Not Always Identify These Issues", "paragraphs": ["VA contract files we reviewed were often missing key documents,  increasing the risk that key processes and regulations were not followed.  Among the 37 VA contracts we reviewed, 13 were missing at least one  key required document\u2014including justifications for non-competitive  awards, documentation of market research, and documentation of price  negotiations\u2014from the base contract.

Table 2 summarizes the number of contracts missing key  documents.", "In six additional cases beyond those listed above, key documents were  not recorded in eCMS, but contracting officers were able to provide them  to us from hard copies or copies saved on their own computers. VA policy  requires that all contract documentation be saved in eCMS, and  documentation not saved in eCMS does not enable effective  management by subsequent contracting officers. For instance, for one of  the contracts, the contracting officer stated that she had only recently  been given responsibility for the contract, which had been awarded and  administered by a different contracting officer. There was very little  documentation in the eCMS file\u2014only a statement of work\u2014and the  contracting officer said that she was unsure how to perform contract  closeout activities without any invoices to reconcile against the funds  obligated.", "Of the 35 base contracts we reviewed, 10 were awarded to SDVOSB  firms under the Veterans Benefits, Health Care and Information  Technology Act of 2006. The contracting preference for these firms in  this statute is specific to VA. VA\u2019s Vets First Certification Program office  maintains a database of firms that have been verified as being owned by  a service-disabled veteran. Among these 10 contracts, contracting  officials took the extra step in seven cases of documenting this  certification in the contract file. Checking SDVOSB status is an important  safeguard to ensure that these contracts are awarded only to firms  eligible to receive them.", "In addition to missing documentation across many of the selected  contracts, one case indicates more fundamental shortcomings in the  procurement process. A medical center had procured non-emergency  patient transportation services, but that contract ended in 2010. The local  contracting office issued a solicitation for a new contract, but, due to  protests by a losing offeror (the incumbent), the award was withheld. To  continue to meet patient transportation needs, the contracting officer  awarded non-competitive purchase orders to the incumbent contractor\u2014 and continued to do so for 36 months. Medical center and contracting  office staff later identified this as a problem, and awarded a non- competitive one-year bridge contract to the incumbent vendor until a new  competitive contract could be awarded. However, the contracting office  was not able to move forward with a competitive contract, and instead  awarded a second one-year non-competitive bridge contract to the  incumbent contractor. In January 2016, a contract was awarded  competitively for patient transportation services, but it was also withheld  due to another protest. According to the COR and the contracting officer,  from October 2015 to June 2016, the contracting office again awarded  monthly purchase orders to the incumbent. The protest was resolved and  the new contractor began providing services in June 2016. According to  the COR, this contract provided substantial savings over the incumbent.", "VA policy requires some form of independent review for all acquisition  actions above the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000).  All seven contracting offices we spoke with had an internal compliance or  quality assurance function but varied in their approach, including how  individual contract files were reviewed. One office conducted post-award  audits of only one percent of contracts, which it said reflected the staff  resources available to cover the workload. Another office audited 10  percent of all contracts. A third office audited the top 25 contracts by  obligation amount. Finally, another office conducted audits of all contracts  over the simplified acquisition threshold; particularly in VHA contracting  offices, this approach would exclude the majority of actions from  compliance review. About 95, 94, and 96 percent of actions, respectively,  were under the simplified acquisition threshold in fiscal year 2015 at each  of the three NCOs we reviewed. Collectively, these actions represent  obligations of $509 million, about 33 percent of all fiscal year 2015  contract obligations by those three NCOs.", "The varied nature of the internal compliance reviews among the  contracting offices we visited results in a lack of consistency in selection  of contract actions for review. According to the FAR, file documentation  must be sufficient to establish a complete history of a transaction so that  informed decisions can be made at each step in the acquisition process,  actions taken can be supported, and information can be provided for  reviews and investigations. In addition, according to the Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, documentation is a key  process control to ensure that procurement regulations and other policies  are implemented as required. As evidenced by missing documentation in  our review of selected contract files, existing compliance reviews are not  identifying all contract file shortcomings. We found that a few of these  actions had been subject to local pre-award compliance reviews. While  our findings cannot be generalized to all VA contract actions, more than a  third of the files we reviewed were missing one or more key documents,  including some that were subject to compliance reviews.

At a more tactical level, the shortcomings we found in  contract files\u2014where required documents as fundamental as justifications  for sole source awards had not been prepared\u2014indicate that current  internal compliance reviews could be more effective. VHA tried to  alleviate workload challenges for its CORs by directing that all VISNs  implement contract liaisons, but the fact that 37 percent of medical  centers have not done so indicates that there is an impediment which  senior VHA officials have not addressed.", "Given the volume of VA spending on goods and services, it is important  that the department identify and implement cost savings opportunities.

In order to ensure universal usage and reduce duplicate work, the  Office of Acquisition and Logistics (OAL) should work with the  National Acquisition Center to develop a plan for adding functionality  to eCMS that will alleviate the need for NAC contracting officers to  enter obligations for high-tech medical equipment into two different  data systems.  2.  In order to ensure that VA\u2019s procurement data is complete and  accurate, the Office of Acquisitions and Logistics should develop  policies and procedures to ensure that obligations made through  prime vendor orders\u2014such as medical-surgical orders\u2014are  consistently captured in eCMS.  3.  In order to ensure that contracting officers have clear and effective  policies as soon as possible, the OAL should identify measures to  expedite the revision of the VAAR, which has been ongoing for many  years, and the issuance of the VA Acquisition Manual.  4.  To help contracting officers use current policy that is in effect in the  period before the updated VAAR and VA Acquisition Manual are  released, OAL should take interim steps to clarify its policy framework,  including establishing and adhering to set time frames for completing  the process of reviewing all Information Letters, and either rescinding  them or reissuing updated policy through Procurement Policy  Memoranda.  5.  To address remaining ambiguities in roles and customer relationships,  the Office of Acquisition, Logistics, and Construction should assess  whether additional policy or guidance is needed to clarify the roles of  VA\u2019s national contracting organizations, beyond that provided in its  March 2013 memorandum outlining the current structure.  6.  To improve the efficiency of the procurement process, VHA should  assess why its April 2014 directive to implement contract liaisons at all  medical centers has been inconsistently implemented and take  appropriate steps to increase use of these liaison positions, if  warranted.  7.  To ensure that VA has the data required to fully monitor the  certifications of its contracting workforce, OAL should determine the  appropriate frequency for archiving the data extracts on FAC-C  certifications to ensure that up-to-date data are readily accessible to  management.  8.  To maximize compliance with mandatory national contracts during the  transition to the new medical-surgical prime vendor process, SAC and  VHA Procurement and Logistics should take steps to ensure that:", "SAC has mechanisms in place to collect and monitor transaction  data to determine the extent to which VISNs and their medical  centers are complying with the requirement to use national  contracts.", "They establish achievable time frames for eliminating the ability  for ordering officers to directly order Federal Supply Schedule  items from the MSPV catalog once SAC awards national contracts  for these items and monitor progress on an ongoing basis.", "The ordering interfaces developed by the prime vendors clearly  distinguish and prioritize standardized national contracts over  items on Federal Supply Schedule contracts.  9.
