Consistent with GAO\u2019s mandate under the act, the report being released today is one in a series that GAO will provide to the Congress. This statement discusses steps taken by OMB, Treasury, and federal agencies to implement the act and highlights key findings and the recommendation from GAO\u2019s report ( GAO-17-156 ).

OMB and Treasury have established a new Data Standards Committee responsible for maintaining established standards and developing new data elements or data definitions. Although this represents progress, more remains to be done to establish a data governance structure that is consistent with leading practices to ensure the integrity of data standards over time. The transition to a new administration presents risks to implementing the DATA Act, including a potential shift in priorities. The lack of a robust and institutionalized data governance structure for managing efforts going forward also presents risks regarding the ability of agencies to meet the statutory deadlines in the event that priorities shift over time.", "Implementation plan updates . According to the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act agencies\u2019 implementation plan updates, most of them continue to face challenges implementing the DATA Act. GAO identified four overarching categories of challenges reported by agencies that may impede their ability to effectively and efficiently implement the DATA Act: systems integration issues, lack of resources, evolving and complex reporting requirements, and inadequate guidance. To address these challenges, most agencies reported taking mitigating actions, such as making changes to internal policies and procedures, leveraging existing resources, and employing manual and temporary workarounds. However, the information reported by the CFO Act agencies in their implementation plan updates indicates that some agencies are at increased risk of not meeting the May 2017 reporting deadline because of these challenges. In addition, inspectors general for some agencies have issued readiness review reports indicating that their respective agencies are at risk of not meeting the reporting deadline.", "Operationalizing data standards and technical specifications for data reporting . In November 2016, OMB issued additional guidance on how agencies should report financial information involving specific transactions, such as intragovernmental transfers, and how agency senior accountable officials should provide quality assurances for submitted data. Although OMB has made some progress with these efforts, other data definitions lack clarity which still needs to be addressed to ensure that agencies report consistent and comparable data. In September 2016, Treasury updated its version of the DATA Act broker, which it stated was fully capable of performing the key functions of extracting and validating agency data. Treasury officials stated that although they plan to continue to refine the broker to improve its functionality and overall user experience, they have no plans to alter key functions. Agencies have reported making progress creating their data submissions and testing them in the broker, but work remains before actual reporting can begin. Some agencies reported in their implementation plan updates that they developed plans for interim solutions, but some of these interim solutions rely on manual processing, which can be burdensome and increase the risk for errors.", "Pilot to reduce recipient reporting burden . GAO's review of the revised design for both the grants and procurement portions of the pilot found that they partly met each of the leading practices for effective pilot design. Although this represented significant progress since April 2016, GAO identified an area where further improvement is still needed. Specifically, the plan for the procurement portion of the pilot does not clearly describe and document how findings related to centralized certified payroll reporting will be applicable to other types of required procurement reporting. Further, in November 2016, this portion of the pilot was delayed to ensure that security procedures were in place to protect personally identifiable information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In addition to prior recommendations that GAO has made, in its most recent report, GAO recommends that OMB take steps to help ensure that the procurement portion of the pilot better reflects leading practices for effective pilot design.

As you know,  the critical deadline of May 2017 is approaching, at which time agencies  will be required to report their financial and payment data in compliance  with established standards. We have previously reported that OMB and  Treasury have taken significant steps toward implementing the act\u2019s  various requirements, including standardizing data element definitions,  issuing guidance to help agencies develop their implementation plans,  and designing a pilot for developing recommendations to reduce recipient  reporting burden. We have also reported that agencies have identified  challenges to the effective and timely implementation of the DATA Act,  including inadequate guidance, tight time frames, competing priorities, a  lack of funding, and system integration issues, and are taking actions to  mitigate these challenges.", "Today, we are releasing another report in a series of interim reports that  GAO is providing to the Congress in fulfillment of our mandate to provide  oversight of DATA Act implementation. Our report examined (1) steps  taken by OMB and Treasury to establish a clear data governance  structure, which is particularly important for the transition to a new  administration; (2) challenges reported by major agencies in their  implementation plan updates; (3) the operationalization of government- wide data standards and technical specifications for data reporting; and  (4) updated designs for the pilot for reducing recipient reporting burden  and progress made in its implementation. My statement will highlight key  findings and the recommendation from our report and provide updates on  the status of some of GAO\u2019s prior recommendations. As part of this  work, we analyzed OMB and Treasury documents and interviewed OMB  and Treasury staff and officials. We reviewed DATA Act implementation  plan updates from the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO Act)  agencies to determine challenges they continue to face. In addition, we  reviewed documentation from and interviewed officials from various  federal agencies to obtain information on (1) agencies\u2019 use of technical  guidance and (2) design of the pilot for reducing recipient reporting  burden (Section 5 Pilot). The work upon which this statement is based  was performed in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

For example, we  found that this policy guidance does not address the underlying source  that can be used to verify the accuracy of non-financial procurement data  or any source for data on assistance awards. In addition, in their  implementation plan updates, 11 of the 24 CFO Act agencies reported  ongoing challenges related to the timely issuance of, and ongoing  changes to, OMB policy and Treasury guidance.

The schema version 1.0, released by Treasury on April  29, 2016, is intended to standardize the way financial assistance awards,  contracts, and other financial data will be collected and reported under  the DATA Act. A key component of the reporting framework laid out in the  schema version 1.0 is the DATA Act Broker, a system to standardize data  formatting and assist reporting agencies in validating their data prior to  submitting them to Treasury. Treasury has been iteratively testing and  developing the broker using what Treasury describes as an agile  development process.

Department of Health and Human Services officials and OMB staff told us  that they are recruiting participants and have begun administering data  collection instruments for all components of the grants portion of the pilot.  However, in late November 2016, OMB staff and General Services  Administration officials informed us that they decided to delay further  implementation of the procurement portion of the pilot in order to ensure  that security procedures designed to protect personally identifiable  information were in place. As a result, General Service Administration  officials expect to be able to begin collecting data through the centralized  reporting portal sometime between late January 2017 and late February  2017. OMB staff stated that despite the delay, they still plan on collecting  12 months of data through the procurement pilot as required by the act.", "In our report being released today, we made a new recommendation to  OMB that would help ensure that the procurement portion of the Section 5  Pilot better reflects leading practices for effective pilot design. In  commenting on the report being released today, OMB neither agreed nor  disagreed with the recommendation, but provided an overview of its  implementation efforts since passage of the DATA Act. These efforts  include issuing three memorandums providing implementation guidance  to federal agencies, finalizing 57 data standards for use on  USASpending.gov, establishing the Data Standards Committee to  develop and maintain standards for federal spending, and developing and  executing the Section 5 Pilot. OMB also noted that, along with Treasury, it  met with each of the 24 CFO Act agencies to discuss the agency\u2019s  implementation timeline, unique risks, and risk mitigation strategy and  took action to address issues that may affect successful DATA Act  implementation. According to OMB, as a result of these one-on-one  meetings with agencies, OMB and Treasury learned that in spite of the  challenges faced by the agencies, 19 of the 24 CFO Act agencies expect  that they will fully meet the May 2017 deadline for DATA Act  implementation.", "Treasury also provided comments on our report being released today. In  its comments, Treasury provided an overview of the steps it has taken to  implement the DATA Act\u2019s requirements and assist agencies in meeting  the requirements under the act, including OMB\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s issuance  of uniform data standards, technical requirements, and implementation  guidance. Treasury\u2019s response also noted that as a result of the  aggressive implementation timelines specified in the act and the  complexity associated with linking hundreds of disconnected data  elements across the federal government, it made the decision to use an  iterative approach to provide incremental technical guidance to agencies.
