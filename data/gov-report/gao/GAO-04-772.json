At that time, some drug and device industry representatives noted that payment rates for many of these items decreased and were concerned that hospitals may limit beneficiary access to these items if they could not recover their costs. GAO was asked to examine whether the OPPS rate-setting methodology results in payment rates that uniformly reflect hospitals' costs for providing drugs and devices, and other outpatient services, and if it does not, to identify specific factors of the methodology that are problematic."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The rate-setting methodology used by CMS may result in OPPS payment rates for drugs, devices, and other services that do not uniformly reflect hospitals' costs of providing those services. Two areas of the methodology are particularly problematic. The hospital claims for outpatient services that CMS uses to calculate hospitals' costs and set payment rates may not be a representative sample of all hospital outpatient claims. For Medicare payment purposes, an outpatient service consists of a primary service and the additional services or items associated with the primary service, referred to as packaged services. CMS has excluded over 40 percent of multiple-service claims, claims that include more than one primary service along with packaged services, when calculating the cost of all OPPS services, including those with drugs and devices. It excludes these multiple-service claims because, when more than one primary service is reported on a claim, CMS cannot associate each packaged service with a specific primary service. Therefore, the agency cannot calculate a total cost for each primary service on that claim, which it would use to set payment rates. The data CMS has available do not allow for a determination of whether excluding many multiple-service claims has an effect on OPPS payment rates. However, if the types or costs of services on excluded claims differ from those on included claims, the payment rates of some or all services may not uniformly reflect hospitals' actual costs of providing those services. In addition, in calculating hospitals' costs, CMS assumes that, in setting charges within a specific department, a hospital marks up the cost of each service by the same percentage. However, based on information from 113 hospitals, GAO found that not all hospitals use this methodology: charge-setting methodologies for drugs, devices, and other outpatient services vary greatly across hospitals and across departments within a hospital. CMS's methodology does not recognize hospitals' variability in setting charges, and therefore, the costs of services used to set payment rates may be under- or overestimated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2000, hospitals have been paid fixed, predetermined amounts under a  prospective payment system (PPS) for outpatient services delivered to  Medicare beneficiaries.  By paying hospitals under a PPS, Medicare seeks  to encourage them to operate efficiently, as they retain the difference if  their payments exceed their costs of providing necessary services.   However, unlike most other Medicare PPSs, where each payment amount is  designed to cover the combined costs of a large bundle of services, the  outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) is more like a fee schedule  and pays a designated rate for each outpatient service provided to a  beneficiary.", "By law, the initial 2000 OPPS rates were based on hospitals\u2019 1996 median  costs.  During the development of OPPS, the anticipated use of 1996 data  prompted concerns that the costs of new technology items, such as drugs,  biologicals, and devices, first used after 1996 would not be represented in  the 2000 payment rates and that hospitals might not provide the newest  technology because of a perceived shortfall in payment.  Accordingly,  Congressional concerns were raised that beneficiaries might lose access to  some of these items upon implementation of the payment system.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that  administers Medicare, sets OPPS payment rates by using charges hospitals  report to CMS for the outpatient services they provide.  The agency has  used this methodology since setting the 2000 rates.  CMS converts each  hospital\u2019s charge to that hospital\u2019s cost for each service using a specific  adjustment for each of the hospital\u2019s departments.  Under OPPS, an  outpatient service consists of a primary service and its packaged services,  the additional services or items associated with the primary service.  For  example, the surgical insertion of a pacemaker, a primary service, includes  packaged services such as operating and recovery room services,  anesthesia, and surgical and medical supplies, including the pacemaker.   CMS combines the costs of the primary service and packaged services to  calculate a total cost for that primary service.  It assigns primary services to  ambulatory payment classification (APC) groups and calculates a payment  rate from the costs of the services in that group.  An APC may consist of  one primary service, but more often consists of two or more primary  services with clinical and cost similarity.  All primary services assigned to  one APC are paid the same rate.", "In response to concerns that the 1996 data that would be used to set the  2000 OPPS payment rates did not include cost data for new drugs and  devices first used after 1996, in 1999, the Congress required that a payment  be made for a temporary period, in addition to the OPPS amount, for  certain drugs and devices used in the delivery of outpatient services.  New  drugs and devices are eligible to receive these temporary additional  payments, known as pass-through payments, for 2 to 3 years depending on  when their eligibility first began and when cost data become available to  incorporate these items into OPPS as either a primary or packaged service.   These temporary payments for pass-through drugs generally are equal to 95  percent of the average wholesale price (AWP), and the temporary  payments for pass-through devices are equal to CMS\u2019s calculation of the  hospital\u2019s cost for the device.", "In 2003, the first year for which pass-through eligibility expired for any  drugs or devices, 236 drugs and 95 categories of devices were incorporated  into OPPS.  Of these drugs and devices, CMS designated 115 of the drugs  primary services and the remaining 121 drugs and all devices packaged  services.  While those drugs that became primary services have assigned  payment rates, the packaged drugs and devices do not.  At the time CMS  made the designations, some drug and device and hospital industry  representatives noted that in basing the payment for these items on  hospitals\u2019 costs, Medicare payments for many had declined significantly.   The drug and device industry representatives were concerned that if  hospitals could not recover their costs through OPPS payments, hospitals  would not purchase these items\u2014in essence, limiting beneficiary access to  the products.  Some hospital association representatives were concerned  that certain types of hospitals may provide a higher number of services  associated with drugs and devices, such as cancer center hospitals  providing chemotherapy services or teaching hospitals performing cardiac  procedures involving devices, and therefore may be disproportionately  affected by payment rate decreases for these items.  Furthermore, the  decrease in payment rates for drugs and devices led to broader concerns  about how CMS ensures that OPPS payment rates for all services reflect  hospitals\u2019 costs.", "You asked us to examine these issues.  Specifically, we (1) describe how  payment rates changed for those drugs and devices whose pass-through  eligibility expired in 2003 and 2004, (2) determine whether a particular type  or types of hospitals provide a disproportionate number of Medicare  outpatient services associated with drugs and devices, and (3) examine  whether the OPPS rate-setting methodology results in payment rates that  uniformly reflect hospitals\u2019 costs for providing drugs and devices, as well  as all other outpatient services, to beneficiaries, and if it does not, to  identify specific factors of the methodology that are problematic.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed 2003 and 2004 OPPS payment  rates and the 2003 and 2004 AWPs for former pass-through drugs that are  primary services, which we refer to as separately paid drugs.  The  remaining drugs and all devices were packaged.  Therefore, no identifiable  2003 or 2004 payment rate for these items exists and we could not analyze  any payment rate change.  We also analyzed the Medicare hospital claims,  the bills hospitals submit to CMS for payment, that were used to set the  2003 OPPS rates.  These claims were the latest data available at the time of  our analysis, and we determined they were reliable for our purposes.  From  the claims data, we identified the outpatient services most often associated  with drugs or devices.  We determined whether any hospital type provided  a disproportionate number of these outpatient services, such as hospitals  with and without an outpatient cancer center or major teaching status, with  major teaching hospitals defined as those having an intern/resident-to-bed  ratio of 0.25 or more.  We also analyzed hospitals by their urban/rural  location and by their volume of outpatient services.  We analyzed  information from 113 hospitals on how they set their charges for drugs,  devices, and other outpatient services.  Of these hospitals, we interviewed  officials from 5, received information from another 50 through association  and industry representatives who gathered the information on our behalf,  and received information from another 58 who were contacted by 7 state  hospital associations in geographically diverse areas on our behalf.   Because these 113 hospitals are not statistically representative of all  hospitals, we cannot generalize our results to other hospitals.  Finally, we  spoke with officials at CMS, individual hospitals, hospital associations,  drug and device manufacturers, and trade associations representing  manufacturers of drugs and devices.  We also spoke with consultants who  advise hospitals on setting charges for their services.  Our methodology is  detailed in appendix I.  We conducted our work from March 2003 through  August 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Medicare beneficiaries receive a wide range of services in hospital  outpatient departments, such as emergency room and clinic visits,  diagnostic services such as x-rays, and surgical procedures.  To receive  Medicare payment, hospitals report the services they provided to a  beneficiary on a claim form they submit to CMS along with their charge for  each service.  For Medicare payment purposes, an outpatient service  consists of a primary service and packaged services, the additional services  or items associated with that primary service.  CMS assigns each primary  service to an APC, which may include other similar primary services, and  pays the hospital at the designated APC payment rate, adjusted for  variation in local wages.  A hospital can receive multiple APC payments for  a single outpatient visit if more than one primary service is delivered during  that visit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS Methodology for Determining APC Payment Rates", "paragraphs": ["On outpatient claims, hospitals identify the primary services they provided  using a Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) code,  while they identify packaged services by either specific HCPCS codes or  revenue codes that represent general hospital departments or centers, such  as \u201cpharmacy,\u201d \u201cobservation room,\u201d or \u201cmedical social services.\u201d  In  addition to claims, hospitals submit annual cost reports to CMS that state  their total charges and costs for the year and the individual hospital  department charges and costs.", "As a first step in calculating the OPPS payment rate for each APC, CMS  obtains hospital charge data on each outpatient service from the latest  available year of outpatient claims.  It calculates each hospital\u2019s cost for  each service by multiplying the charge by a cost-to-charge ratio that is  computed from the hospital\u2019s most recent cost report, generally on an  outpatient department-specific basis.  In those instances when a cost-to- charge ratio does not exist for an outpatient department in a given hospital,  CMS uses one from a related outpatient department or the hospital's  overall cost-to-charge ratio for outpatient department services.  The cost of  each primary service is then combined with the costs of the related  packaged services to calculate a total cost for that primary service.  On  single-service claims, claims with one primary service, CMS can associate  packaged services with the primary service and calculate a total cost for  the service (see fig. 1).  However, in the case of multiple-service claims,  claims with more than one primary service, packaged services and their  costs listed on the claim cannot be associated with particular primary  services, as the costs of a packaged service may be associated with one or a  combination of primary services (see fig. 2).  For this reason, CMS  excluded all multiple-service claims from rate setting prior to 2003.   Beginning with the 2003 payment rates, CMS identified several methods  that allowed it to convert some multiple-service claims into single-service  claims, and therefore include them in its rate-setting calculations.", "After calculating the cost of each primary service assigned to an APC for  each hospital claim, CMS arrays the costs for all claims and determines the  median cost.  To calculate the APC\u2019s weight relative to other APCs, CMS  compares the median cost of each APC to the median cost of APC 0601, a  mid-level clinic visit, which is assigned a relative weight of 1.00.  For  example, if the median cost of APC 0601 is $100 and the median cost of  \u201cAPC A\u201d is $50, CMS assigns APC A a relative weight of 0.50.", "To obtain a payment rate for each APC, CMS multiplies the relative weight  by a factor that converts it to a dollar amount.  In addition, CMS annually  reviews and revises the services assigned to a particular APC and uses the  new APC assignments and the charges from the latest available outpatient  hospital claims to recalibrate the relative weights, and therefore the  payment rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expiration of Drug and Device Pass-Through Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["New drugs and devices are eligible to receive temporary pass-through  payments for 2 to 3 years, depending on when each drug and device\u2019s  eligibility began.

CMS stated that, in 2003, former pass-through drug costs were  most likely packaged with the six drug administration APCs.  The payment  rates for five of the six APCs decreased in 2003, when the costs of  packaged former pass-through drugs were included, compared to 2002,  when the costs of these drugs were not considered in the rate-setting  calculations (see table 1).  We are unable to determine why the costs of  these APCs decreased because fluctuations in costs for any of the primary  or packaged services in these APCs, in addition to the costs of the  packaged drug, could have affected the payment rates.  However, we would  have expected that combining the costs of up to $150 of packaged former  pass-through drugs with the costs of the primary services in these APCs  would have increased the 2003 payment rates for more of these APCs as  more than half of them are less than $150.", "To indirectly assess the payment rates of the devices in the 95 device  categories expiring from pass-through eligibility in 2003, we reviewed APCs  for which CMS determined that device costs made up at least 1 percent of  the APC\u2019s total cost.  We found that the payment rates of these APCs  varied substantially between 2002 and 2003, when the former pass-through  device costs likely were included.

In its comments, CMS suggested that an  analysis could be done using an algorithm to allocate charges among  multiple-service claims, but noted that such an approach could create  further distortions in the relative weights.  Our recommendation to CMS,  however, is that the agency should gather additional data on the relative  costs of services on single and multiple-service claims, rather than  continuing to analyze existing data.", "In response to our recommendation that CMS analyze the effect of hospital  charge-setting practices on the OPPS rate-setting methodology, CMS stated  that we should recognize that its rate-setting methodology that converts  hospital charges to costs using a cost-to-charge ratio does so at the level of  an individual hospital department.  The draft report noted the fact that CMS  generally calculates cost-to-charge ratios on a department-specific basis;  however, we have revised the report to highlight that information  throughout.  CMS also said that the application of cost-to-charge ratios to  charges of a hospital has long been the recognized method of establishing  reasonable costs for hospital services and was an important component of  the cost-based reimbursement system that was used by Medicare to pay for  hospital outpatient services before OPPS was implemented.  While we  agree that it was an important component of the prior payment system, we  believe the implementation of the current payment system has changed the  relevance of applying cost-to-charge ratios to determine hospitals\u2019 costs.   OPPS, rather than reimbursing individual hospitals on the basis of their  costs of providing outpatient services, uses costs from individual hospitals  to construct a prospective payment system that sets rates for individual  services that apply to all hospitals.  Finally, CMS stated that the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 specified  that cost-to-charge ratios would be used to set payment amounts for  brachytherapy sources; however, a discussion of brachytherapy payment is  outside of the scope of this report.", "In response to our recommendation that CMS analyze whether the OPPS  rate-setting methodology results in payment rates that uniformly reflect  hospitals\u2019 costs of the services they provide to Medicare beneficiaries and  make any appropriate changes in the methodology, CMS stated that it will  consider our recommendations as it continues to assess and refine the rate- setting methodology.  CMS said that it believes it has made great strides on  this issue and is continuing to pursue the analyses necessary to create  means by which all claims can be used to set the OPPS relative payment  weights and rates.", "CMS also made technical comments, which we incorporated where  appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Industry representatives generally agreed with the findings, conclusions,  and recommendations in the draft report.  Comments on specific portions  of the draft report centered on three areas:  payment rates of former pass- through drugs and devices, provision of services associated with drugs and  devices, and CMS\u2019s rate-setting methodology.", "Several industry representatives commented on our analysis of Medicare  payment for former pass-through drugs and devices.  AHA stated that  although when drugs have expired from pass-through status their payment  rates may have decreased, they are now more consistent, relative to costs,  with the payment rates for other OPPS services.  PhRMA agreed with our  finding that the payment rates for former pass-through drugs and devices  that are packaged cannot be evaluated and suggested that we recommend  that CMS specifically address this problem.", "Industry representatives commented on our analysis of the provision of  services associated with drugs and devices among different types of  hospitals.  ACCC agreed with the percentages of Medicare outpatient  services related to chemotherapy administration and cardiac services in  the draft report; however, it stated that it believed that these percentages  demonstrated that large hospitals provided a disproportionate share of  chemotherapy administration.  ACCC and AAMC stated that these  percentages also demonstrated that major teaching hospitals provided a  disproportionate share of chemotherapy administration services.  In  addition, both groups suggested that we perform other analyses by type of  hospital, such as the proportion of total payments, proportion of total  services excluding clinic services, or absolute number of services for which  chemotherapy administration and cardiac services accounted.", "Many of the reviewers addressed our finding that CMS\u2019s rate-setting  methodology may result in OPPS payment rates that do not uniformly  reflect hospitals\u2019 costs.  Representatives from AAMC, ACCC, AdvaMed,  BIO, and PhRMA agreed with our conclusion that CMS may not be using a  representative sample of claims to set payment rates and that CMS\u2019s rate- setting methodology does not account for variation in hospital charge- setting practices.  Several of these representatives suggested we analyze  and discuss other factors that could further skew CMS\u2019s calculation of  hospital costs, such as its use of incorrect or incomplete claims in rate  setting.", "Regarding the suggestion that we specifically recommend that CMS  address the issue that the payment rates for former pass-through drugs that  are packaged and former pass-through devices cannot be evaluated, we  believe that our more general recommendation allows the agency the  flexibility to determine the most appropriate analyses for examining the  rate-setting methodology.", "With respect to the comment that the percentages of Medicare outpatient  services accounted for by chemotherapy administration demonstrate that  certain types of hospitals provide a disproportionate share of these  services, we disagree.  As noted in the draft report, we found that these  percentages differ by type of hospital, but the differences are not  substantial, as all types of hospitals provided a relatively small proportion  of these services.  No type of hospital provided a disproportionately large  number of these services.  We analyzed the proportion of services, rather  than payments as industry representatives suggested, because we believe  that is the better analysis for determining whether a certain type of hospital  provides a disproportionate share of these services.  We did not analyze the  proportion of total services except for clinic services or the absolute  number these services made up, as we do not believe such an analysis  would accurately and comparably reflect potential differences between  hospitals for all outpatient services they perform.", "The industry representatives also made technical comments, which we  incorporated where appropriate.", "We are sending a copy of this report to the Administrator of CMS.

In addition, we analyzed drug average  wholesale prices (AWPs), drug sources (sole-source, multi-source, or  generic), and OPPS payment rates obtained from CMS.  We interviewed  officials at CMS and representatives from the American Hospital  Association, Association of American Medical Colleges, Association of  Community Cancer Centers (ACCC), Federation of American Hospitals,  Greater New York Hospital Association, as well as from one large hospital  system, one large hospital alliance, and five individual hospitals.  In  addition, we spoke with representatives from the Advanced Medical  Technology Association, Biotechnology Industry Organization, California  Healthcare Institute, Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of  America, as well as from seven drug manufacturers and three device  manufacturers.  We also spoke with consultants that advise hospitals on  setting their charges.", "To compare payment for drugs to previous pass-through payments, we  relied on information provided by CMS on drug sources and 2003 and 2004  drug payment rates, and on CMS\u2019s calculations of the AWPs for these drugs,  which we supplemented with our own calculations.  From CMS, we  obtained the drug source and the payment rate for the 115 drugs and the 7  drugs whose pass-through eligibility expired as of January 1, 2003 and  January 1, 2004, respectively, that were assigned to separate ambulatory  payment classification (APC) groups.  We used Medicare\u2019s January 2003  and January 2004 Single Drug Pricer files to determine the 2003 and 2004  AWPs, respectively, for most of the drugs.  For the 37 drugs that were not  included in the 2003 Single Drug Pricer file, we used the 2002 Drug Topics  Red Book, published by Thomson Medical Economics, to calculate their  AWPs.  For the 2 drugs that were not in the 2004 Single Drug Pricer file, we  used the 2003 Drug Topics Red Book, published by Thomson PDR, to  calculate their AWPs.  We calculated payment rates as a percentage of AWP  for all drugs in 2003 and 2004.  From our 2003 analysis, we excluded 1  multi-source drug for which we calculated an AWP from the 2002 Drug  Topics Red Book that was inconsistent with the 2002 AWP CMS provided to  us and another multi-source drug with an AWP of $0.34, but a payment rate  of almost 29,000 percent of that amount.", "To determine whether a particular type or types of hospitals provide a  disproportionate number of outpatient services associated with drugs and  devices, we used the outpatient claims file that CMS used to calculate the  2003 OPPS payment rates.  To perform our own data reliability check of  this file, we examined selected services to determine the reasonableness of  their frequency in the data set, given the population of the beneficiaries  receiving services and the setting in which they are delivered.  We  determined the data were reasonable for our purposes.", "Using the claims, we determined which outpatient services were most  often associated with drugs and devices and found that drugs were most  often associated with chemotherapy administration services and devices  were most often associated with cardiac services.  Then, also using the  claims, we compared proportions of chemotherapy administration and  cardiac services for all hospitals, as well as for cancer center and  noncancer center hospitals, major teaching and other hospitals, urban and  rural hospitals, and hospitals with different outpatient service volumes.   We included only those hospitals identified in CMS\u2019s 2003 OPPS impact file,  a data file CMS constructs to analyze projected effects of policy changes on  various hospital groups, such as urban and rural hospitals.  We excluded  hospitals with fewer than 1,100 total outpatient services, or approximately  3 outpatient services per day, as we believe such hospitals are not  representative of most hospitals with outpatient departments.  We defined  cancer center hospitals as those hospitals that were members of ACCC as  of February 28, 2003, the latest data available when we performed this  analysis.  We obtained the membership list from the ACCC.  Using the  September 2002 Medicare Provider of Services file and information  obtained directly from the ACCC, we determined the Medicare provider  numbers of ACCC members to identify claims billed by these hospitals.  We  defined major teaching hospitals as those hospitals having an  intern/resident-to-bed ratio of 0.25 or more.  We defined the urban or rural  location of a hospital based on the urban/rural location indicator in the  Medicare hospital OPPS impact file from calendar year 2003.  We defined  volume based on the number of services a hospital provided, also as  indicated in the impact file.  Small volume hospitals were those with fewer  than 11,000 services, medium volume hospitals were those with at least  11,000 services but fewer than 43,000 services, and large volume hospitals  were those with at least 43,000 services.", "We interviewed representatives from hospitals, hospital associations, and  drug and device manufacturers and the associations that represent them to  obtain information about hospital charging practices.  We received  information on charge-setting practices from 5 hospitals whose officials we  interviewed.

To set the base  charges for devices, 55 of 57 hospitals responding reported that they used  acquisition cost.  After setting base charges, 29 of 45 hospitals responding  reported that they marked up all of their clinic visit services by the same  percentage increase, although they reported using a variety of other  methods as well.
