However, the initiative did not fully meet its goals, and mid-level vacancies remain a problem at many posts, including some critical to the war on terror. State implemented various incentives to attract more mid-level officers to these locations, including offering extra pay to officers who serve an additional year at certain posts. However, it has not evaluated the effectiveness of these incentives and continues to have difficulties attracting qualified applicants. Mid-level positions at many posts are staffed by junior officers who lack experience, have minimal guidance, and are not as well-equipped to handle crises as more seasoned officers. This experience gap can severely compromise the department's readiness to carry out foreign policy objectives and execute critical post-level duties. State has made progress in increasing its foreign language capabilities, but serious language gaps remain. State initiated a number of efforts to improve its foreign language capabilities. However, it has not evaluated the effectiveness of these efforts, and it continues to experience difficulties filling its language-designated positions with language proficient staff. Almost one third of the staff in these positions do not meet the language requirements. The percentage is much higher at certain critical posts--for example, 60 percent in Sana'a, Yemen. Several factors--including the perception that spending too much time in one region may hinder officers' and specialists' promotion potential--may discourage employees from bidding on positions where they could enhance and maintain their language skills over time and limit State's ability to take advantage of those skills and the investment it makes in training. Gaps in language proficiency can adversely impact State's ability to communicate with foreign audiences and execute critical duties."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In recent years we have reported on a number of human capital issues that  have hampered the Department of State\u2019s (State) ability to carry out the  President\u2019s foreign policy priorities and objectives, particularly at posts  central to the United States\u2019 war on terror. For example, we reported that  State\u2019s permanent positions were understaffed and that the impact of  staffing shortfalls was felt most at hardship posts, including posts in  Africa and the Middle East and others of strategic importance to the  United States, such as China and Russia. In particular, we found that  State\u2019s assignment system did not effectively meet the staffing needs of  hardship posts and that State had difficulty filling positions there,  particularly at the mid-levels. Where such staffing gaps existed, new or  untenured officers worked well above their grade levels. We also reported  that State had shortages in staff with critical foreign language skills,  making it more difficult to combat international terrorism and resulting in  less effective representation of U.S. interests overseas.

We also  compared the language proficiency of staff in language-designated  positions with the requirements for the positions. We met with officials at  State\u2019s Bureau of Human Resources, Bureau of Consular Affairs, Foreign  Service Institute, and six regional bureaus. To observe post staffing and  language proficiency firsthand, we conducted fieldwork in Abuja and  Lagos, Nigeria; Sana\u2019a, Yemen; and Beijing, China. We selected the posts in  (1) Nigeria because of the low number of staff applying for each position;  (2) in Sana\u2019a because of the low number of staff applying for each  position, because it requires staff proficient in Arabic, which is a difficult  to learn language, and because of Yemen\u2019s importance to the war on  terrorism; and (3) in Beijing because it requires staff proficient in Chinese,  which is also a difficult language to learn, and because of its strategic  importance to the United States.

The department represents the United  States in about 172 countries, operating approximately 266 embassies,  consulates, and other posts. During several years in the 1990s, State lost  more staff than it hired, and the resultant shortfalls of staff and skills  endangered diplomatic readiness. To address these shortfalls, in 2002,  State implemented DRI, a $197 million effort designed to address a range  of goals. In particular, the goals of DRI were to hire 1,158 new foreign and  civil service employees over a 3-year period, support training  opportunities for staff, enhance the department\u2019s ability to respond to  crises and emerging priorities overseas and at critical domestic locations,  improve State\u2019s hiring processes to recruit personnel from more diverse  experiences and cultural backgrounds, and fill critical skill gaps. Table 1  shows DRI hiring goals for fiscal year 2002 through fiscal 2004.", "As of October 2005, State had about 19,000 American employees, including  FSOs, also called generalists; foreign service specialists; and civil servants.  FSO generalists help formulate and implement the foreign policy of the  United States and are grouped into five career tracks: management,  consular, economic, political, and public diplomacy. Foreign service  specialists provide support services at overseas posts worldwide or in  Washington, D.C., and are grouped into seven major categories:  administration, construction engineering, information technology,  international information and English language programs, medical and  health, office management, and security. Civil service employees support  the foreign policy mission from offices in Washington, D.C., and across the  United States.", "About 65 percent of Foreign Service employees serve overseas. State\u2019s  policy is that foreign service employees are to be available for service  worldwide. The process of assigning Foreign Service staff to their  positions begins when the staff receive a list of upcoming vacancies for  which they may compete. Staff then submit a list of positions for which  they want to be considered, or \u201cbids,\u201d and consult with their career  development officer. The process varies, depending on an officer\u2019s grade  and functional specialty. Figure 1 describes this process.", "About 64 percent of full-time FSOs serving overseas are assigned to  hardship posts. State defines hardship posts as those locations where the  U.S. government provides differential pay incentives\u2014an additional 5 to 35  percent of base pay, depending on the severity or difficult of the  conditions\u2014to encourage employees to bid on assignments at these posts  and to compensate them for the hardships they encounter there. A  hardship differential is established for a location only when that location  involves extraordinarily difficult living conditions, excessive physical  hardship, or notably unhealthful conditions affecting the majority of  employees officially stationed or detailed there. Living costs are not  considered in differential determination. Among the conditions that State  considers in determining hardship pay are poor medical facilities,  substandard schools for children, severe climate, high crime, political  instability, physical isolation, and lack of spousal employment  opportunities. Some hardship posts have greater difficulty in attracting  qualified bidders than others. In response to severe staffing shortages at  such posts, State established the Service Need Differential (SND)  Program, which began with the 2001 summer assignments cycle. Under  this program, an employee who accepts a 3-year assignment at a post  designated for SND is eligible to receive an additional hardship differential  over and above existing hardship differentials, equal to 15 percent of the  employee\u2019s base salary. However, chiefs of mission, principal officers, and  deputy chiefs of mission are not eligible to receive SND regardless of the  length of their tours. Entry-level employees on 2-year tours directed by the  Office of Career Development and Assignments (HR/CDA) are also  ineligible for SND. State\u2019s geographic bureaus initially identified the posts  designated to offer SND in 2001 and may add or remove posts once per  year. The program included 38 posts the first year. Table 2 lists the fiscal  year 2006 SND posts.", "In addition, in 2002, State established a working group to examine  incentives to encourage bidding on hardship posts. The working group  evaluated over 80 suggestions and ideas, such as requiring hardship  service for promotion to the senior foreign service and allowing  employees to negotiate shorter tours of duty. State implemented about 25  of the suggestions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State\u2019s Foreign Language Requirements", "paragraphs": ["As of October 2005, State had 3,267 positions\u201443 percent of all foreign  service positions overseas\u2014designated as requiring some level of foreign  language proficiency.

State  places the required languages into three categories based on the amount of  time it takes to learn them.", "Category I languages are world languages, such as Spanish and French,  which relate closely to English. Fifty-five percent of the language- designated positions require proficiency in a world language.", "Category II languages, such as Albanian or Urdu, are languages with  significant linguistic or cultural differences from English. State refers to  such languages as \u201chard\u201d languages. Twenty-nine percent of the language- designated positions require proficiency in a hard language.", "Category III, the \u201csuperhard\u201d languages, include Arabic and Chinese, and  are exceptionally difficult for native English speakers to learn. Sixteen  percent of the language-designated positions require proficiency in a  superhard language. Figure 2 shows the percentage of language-designated  positions by category.", "State\u2019s philosophy is to hire officers with a wide range of skills that it  believes are predictors of success in the foreign service. It does not hire  exclusively for skills that State can train, such as foreign languages. As a  result, State\u2019s primary approach to meeting its language requirements is  through language training, primarily through classes provided at its  training arm, the Foreign Service Institute (FSI). FSI\u2019s School of Language  Studies offers training in more than 60 languages. FSI also provides full- time advance training in superhard languages at FSI field schools and  programs overseas. In addition, overseas posts offer part-time language  training through post language programs funded by the regional bureaus  and their posts. Although State\u2019s main emphasis is on enhancing its foreign  language capability through training, it does have special mechanisms to  recruit personnel with foreign language skills. For example, applicants  who pass the oral assessment can raise their ranking by passing a language  test in any foreign language used by State. Additional credit is given to  candidates who pass a test in languages that State has deemed as critical  needs languages, including Arabic; Chinese; Korean; Russian; Turkic  languages (Azerbaijani, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Turkish, Turkmen, and Uzbek);  Indic languages (Urdu, Hindi, Nepali, Bengali, Punjabi); and Iranian  languages (Farsi/Persian, Tajiki, Pashto).

In our review, we found that mid- level staffing gaps persist; bids for mid-level positions at hardship posts  have not increased significantly since we reported in 2002; and positions  normally held by mid-level officers are typically staffed by junior officers,  sometimes on their first assignment, with few mid-level officers to provide  supervision or guidance. Recently, State launched the Global  Repositioning Initiative, which will move positions from places like  Europe and Washington D.C., to critical posts in areas such as Africa and  the Middle East.

In 2002, State  had more than 500 unstaffed foreign service positions; in 2005, there were  fewer than 200 such openings. However, the deficit in civil service staffing  has increased. In 2002, State had over 800 unfilled civil service positions;  in 2005, there were over 1,700 such positions. State hired most of its new  staff through DRI, bringing in more than 1,000 new employees above  attrition, thus achieving its numerical hiring goals. These employees were  hired primarily to allow staff time for critical job training\u2014also referred to  as a \u201ctraining float\u201d\u2014to staff overseas posts, and to be available to  respond to new emerging priorities. However, according to State\u2019s Human  Resources officials, DRI\u2019s goals became quickly outdated as new pressures  resulted from staffing demands for Iraq and Afghanistan. For example, the  department has currently levied what it calls an \u201cIraq tax\u201d on all its  bureaus in order to support its operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. In the  past 2 years, bureaus have had to give up a total of 280 mid-level generalist  and specialist positions for Iraq, and it is anticipated that another such tax  will be imposed for 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effectiveness of Hardship Incentives Has Not Been Measured", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in 2001, in an effort to address the growing number of mid-level  vacancies at hardship posts, State created a series of incentives\u2014including  extra pay and negotiated tour lengths\u2014to attract mid-level employees to  hardship posts around the world. For example, the SND Program offers  employees an extra 15 percent pay for an additional year of service at the  most difficult to staff posts. While State has information on the number of  officers actually enrolled in the program, it was not able to provide data on  the number of eligible officers who did not. State\u2019s Director General and  officials from its HR/CDA said that State has not completed any formal  evaluations of the incentives; instead, officials from the HR/CDA meet  informally to discuss how well the incentives are working. Without formal  evaluations, the department has not been able to systematically measure  whether the extra hardship pay incentive has had a significant impact on  staffing at hardship posts. Senior officials with whom we spoke in  Washington, D.C., and FSOs at hardship posts had mixed views on  whether the SND program has been effective. Some officers stated that the  pay differential was indeed a factor in their decision to bid on the post.  However, several former ambassadors and the Executive Director of the  Bureau of African Affairs said they believe the program has not attracted  additional bidders to African posts. These officials stated that the  incentive has had limited impact at posts that were already offering a 25  percent pay differential because the additional incentive is offset by the  harsh conditions at such posts.", "While it may be too early too assess the effectiveness of more recently  implemented initiatives, such as negotiated tour lengths, former and  current ambassadors with whom we spoke stated that this initiative may  not benefit posts. In particular, they noted that although negotiating a  shorter tour length might initially attract bidders to hardship posts, such  frequent rotations negatively affect a post\u2019s ability to carry out the United  States\u2019 foreign policy goals. For example, according to State, the average  length of tours at posts in the Muslim world is about 22 percent shorter  than those elsewhere. Noting the prevalence of 1-year tours in the Muslim  world, a senior official at State said that officers with shorter tours tend to  produce less effective work than those with longer ones.", "In addition to incentives, State has implemented a new career  development program\u2014the Generalist Career Development Program\u2014 that stipulates service at a hardship post as a requirement for  consideration of promotion to the senior foreign service.

Overall, posts in  Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia continue to receive the lowest  number of bids, averaging about 4 or 5 bids per position, while posts in  Europe and the Western Hemisphere receive the highest bids, averaging 15  and 17, respectively. For example, in 2005, posts in Bujumbura, Burundi;  Lagos and Abuja, Nigeria; Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; and Calcutta, India;  received, on average, between zero and two bids per mid-level officer  position.

As shown in figure 4, consular positions at 25 percent differential posts  received, on average, only 2.5 bids per position compared with 18 for  nonhardship posts. Low numbers of bids at hardship posts have resulted  in positions remaining vacant for long periods of time. For example, a  senior consular position in Lagos, Nigeria, has been vacant since July 2001,  and a consular chief position in Shenyang was vacant from December 2003  until August 2004. Such gaps negatively impact a post\u2019s ability to carry out  its mission.", "In 2005 consular and public diplomacy positions were the hardest to fill,  with 91 percent of the vacancies in these two tracks at the mid-level.  Although the department has seen an increase in spending on U.S. public  diplomacy programs, several embassy officials stated that they do not  have the capacity to effectively utilize increased funds. Moreover, these  staffing gaps also limit the amount of training public diplomacy officers  receive, because many officers are sent to fill a position quickly and never  benefit from full training, ultimately limiting the success of their public  diplomacy outreach efforts. Further, due to staffing shortages in consular  sections around the world, there are fewer staff to implement the new  interview requirements and screening procedures for visas, resulting in  extensive wait times for applicants for visa interviews at consular posts  overseas. From November 2004 through May 2005, there were 63 posts  reporting wait times of 30 or more days on a given month, signaling a  significant resource problem for State."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Mid-Level Positions Are Staffed by Junior Officers", "paragraphs": ["In order to fill vacancies, primarily at hardship posts, State sometimes  allows stretch assignments, which enable staff to bid for a position at  either a higher grade than their current grade level (called an \u201cupstretch\u201d)  or a lower grade (a \u201cdownstretch\u201d). Often, upstretch assignments are  offered as a reward and career-enhancing opportunity for staff who have  demonstrated outstanding performance, and many officers successfully  fulfill the duties requested of the higher grade level. However, a 2004  report by State\u2019s Inspector General found that in many African posts, for  example, there were significant deficiencies in the ability, training, and  experience of FSOs serving in upstretch assignments.", "At posts we visited in early 2006, we found staffing conditions similar to  those we reported on in 2002, when we found experience gaps and other  staffing shortfalls at hardship posts. For example, in 2002, we reported  that, in the 10-officer consular section in Lagos, only the consul had more  than one tour of consular experience. In addition, we reported that the  office had many unfilled mid-level positions, many of which were at the  time being staffed by first-tour junior officers and civil service employees  who had never served overseas. In our most recent visit, we found that the  consulate in Lagos was staffed by a mix of officers, including numerous  junior officers in stretch positions.", "Moreover, many officers in stretch positions at hardship posts continue to  lack the managerial experience or supervisory guidance needed to  effectively perform their job-duties. Junior officers in consular sections at  hardship posts consistently reported that they lack management guidance.  In addition, junior officers in stretch assignments at the various posts we  visited stated that, without mid-level officers to guide them, many times  they can only turn to senior management, including the ambassador, for  assistance. According to a 2004 State Inspector General report, more time  is spent by senior staff, including ambassadors, on operational matters,  and less time is devoted to overall planning, policy, and coordination than  should be the case. Many junior officers also stated that, although they  were filling stretch positions at the mid-level, they were not allowed to  receive management training from State due to their lower grade status.  According to one officer, she requested management training to help her  manage staff in accordance with her role as acting chief of a key section of  the embassy, but was denied the opportunity because, despite her current  assignment, she was not a tenured mid-level officer.", "Senior management at posts we visited shared some of these concerns. A  former Deputy Chief of Mission in Nigeria stated that it is extremely  difficult for junior officers to work in stretch assignments when there are  few mid-level officers to guide them. Ambassadors at these posts also  stated that, although many junior officers entering the foreign service are  highly qualified, they did not have sufficient training to handle some of the  high stress situations they encounter and often end up making mistakes.  For example, according to the U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria\u2014the third  largest mission in Africa with nearly 800 employees\u2014the embassy  presently had only three senior officers at the time of our visit, and public  affairs were handled entirely by first tour junior officers. Also, according  to U.S. officials in Beijing, the mid-level consular manager positions in  Shenyang and Chengdu, China\u2014two locations with high incidence of visa  fraud\u2014were held by first tour junior officers at the time of our visit. We  observed similar shortages and employees staffed above their grades in  consular sections in Africa and China when we reported on staffing of  hardship posts in 2002. Consular chiefs in Beijing raised concerns about  the lack of management guidance and supervision available to junior  officers due to the lack of mid-level officers at constituent posts in China.  One consular chief stated that the lack of adequate supervision at  constituent posts requires that he or his deputy frequently travel to the  posts outside of Beijing to provide guidance to the junior officers. Another  was concerned that her caseload limited the amount of guidance she was  able to give to her constituent posts.", "Other areas, such as regional security, are also compromised as a result of  mid-level vacancies. Security officers at one hardship post told us that,  without mid-level staff, they sometimes lack the resources to adequately  perform basic duties, such as accompanying the ambassador on  diplomatic travel or, as was the case during a recent visit by the First Lady,  providing adequate personnel to accompany her staff. Former  ambassadors with whom we spoke expressed serious concerns about the  department\u2019s diplomatic readiness and conveyed their belief that a post\u2019s  ability to carry out critical duties is significantly compromised when the  proper staffing levels, and particularly well-trained officers, are not in  place."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Family Issues and Locality Pay Discourage Bidding at Hardship Posts", "paragraphs": ["Many of the overseas staff we whom we met cited family considerations\u2014 child-related and spousal employment concerns, in particular\u2014as the  greatest obstacle to attracting mid-level officers to hardship posts. The  spouses and other household members of FSOs who responded to a State  internet survey listed spousal employment as the primary reason why  officers do not bid for hardship posts. In many hardship posts, it is  extremely difficult for spouses to find employment, particularly in China  and most of South Asia, where bilateral work agreements are not in place.  State officials told us that the department has recently initiated new  programs to mitigate this problem, such as providing fellowships for  spouses to continue their professional development, offering online  courses or entrepreneurial workshops to encourage small business  development, or training spouses to find employment in the local  economy. The department plans to expand these programs in the future  with a particular emphasis on spouses in hardship locations.", "The survey respondents also listed child-related issues as a major factor in  the officers not bidding for positions. A particular concern is that many  hardship posts do not have appropriate schooling for American children,  thus limiting options for employees with families. In Sana\u2019a, Yemen, for  example, post positions are only available to staff with children under age  5 or over 21 due to a lack of schools. This has been an outstanding  concern for the Sana\u2019a post, and post officials told us that post  management is heavily engaged in trying to find a solution to the problem.  In addition, the number of unaccompanied posts has increased in recent  years, making it difficult for employees with families to bid on them. As of  April 2006, there were 21 unaccompanied and limited accompanied posts  and more than 700 positions at such posts. Moreover, State officials said  that this number will probably increase due to increasing security  concerns around the world.", "Lastly, officers and State personnel we interviewed both, at hardship posts  and in Washington, D.C., consistently cited the lack of locality pay as a  deterrent to bidding at hardship positions. In 2002, we reported that the  differences in the statutes governing domestic locality pay and differential  pay for overseas service had created a gap in compensation penalizing  overseas employees. This gap grows every year, as domestic locality pay  rates increase, creating an ever-increasing financial disincentive for  overseas employees to bid on hardship posts. After accounting for  domestic locality pay for Washington, D.C., a 25 percent hardship post  differential is eroded to approximately 8 percent. As estimated in our 2002  report, differential pay incentives for the 15 percent differential hardship  posts are now less than the locality pay for Washington, D.C., which is  currently 17 percent and can be expected to soon surpass the 20 percent  differential hardship posts. Currently, there is legislation pending in  Congress to alleviate the locality pay disparity by providing FSOs  stationed outside the United States with locality-based pay equal to that of  Washington, D.C.

For example, State\u2019s Office of Recruitment  has targeted its recruiting outreach efforts to universities with strong  language programs and conferences of language professionals, as well as  associations and professional organizations, such as the Arab American  Institute, that have members already fluent in critical needs languages. In  addition, State offers bonus points on the foreign service exam to  candidates who demonstrate proficiency in critical needs languages. State  then requires these officers to serve in positions that will employ their  language skills during their first or second assignment. As of April, 2006,  almost 80 percent of entry level officers who received additional exam  points for their critical language skills were assigned to locations that  could utilize their language within their first or second tour.", "State has also implemented career development criteria, effective January  1, 2005, that require, among other things, foreign language proficiency as a  prerequisite for consideration for promotion. Specifically, in order to  become eligible for promotion to the senior foreign service, generalists  must demonstrate the ability to read and write a foreign language at a  general professional level. State\u2019s career development criteria for some  specialists also contain language proficiency requirements. In addition to  these requirements, State has developed financial incentives for officers  with certain proficiency levels in critical languages. Moreover, State has  enhanced its overseas language programs through various initiatives,  including expanded use of overseas language schools and post language  programs, as well as by increasing the number of weeks of training offered  in certain critical languages and by providing language immersion courses  for officers transitioning to new posts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Continues to Have Shortages of Staff Proficient in Foreign Languages", "paragraphs": ["Despite its efforts to enhance the language capabilities of its staff, State  continues to fill language-designated positions with staff who do not meet  the proficiency requirements.

Language  deficiencies exist world-wide, but were among the greatest in the Middle  East, a region of great importance to the war on terror, where 37 percent  of all language-designated positions were filled by staff without the  language skills required of their positions.

Almost 40 percent of  superhard language-designated positions worldwide (465 positions) were  filled by individuals who did not meet the language requirements of their  position; this figure was 30 and 25 percent for hard and world language  designated positions, respectively.

Six of the specialists we met with in Beijing  said they did not receive sufficient language training before arriving at  post. State officials have acknowledged that foreign service specialists  have not received the required amount of training, and FSI officials  attributed this situation to time constraints. Most specialists only have  enough time to participate in FSI\u2019s Familiarization and Short-term Training  language courses designed for beginners with 2 months or less time to  devote to training.

For example, the 50 language- designated, junior officer consular positions at posts requiring Chinese  require proficiency at a speaking level of 2 and reading level of 0. Consular  officers we met with in China who tested at that level said they could ask  appropriate questions during consular interviews, but could not always  understand the answers. They pointed out that Spanish or French  language-designated consular positions require a level-3 speaking and  reading language proficiency. Moreover, a survey of junior officers  currently serving in China revealed that most of the officers not interested  in serving in China again cited language issues as the primary reason.  According to the Deputy Chief of Mission in Sana\u2019a, the level-3 Arabic  speaking and reading proficiency requirements for senior officers do not  provide staff with the proficiency needed to participate in debates about  U.S. foreign policy. He described an instance when he was asked to appear  as an embassy spokesperson on an Arabic language media program. The  program, which involved a debate format and addressed U.S. politics,  lasted 1 hour and was conducted entirely in Arabic. The official said that,  given his 4+proficiency in Arabic, he was the only official at the embassy  capable of engaging in such a debate.", "According to a State Inspector General report on Embassy Tel Aviv, the  duties inherent in consular positions require staff to have better speaking  and reading Hebrew language skills than the required level 2. Therefore,  the Office of the Inspector General recommended that entry-level officers  be given the opportunity to study Hebrew for 4 weeks in Tel Aviv before  they begin work at the embassy. Another Inspector General report said  that staff in Cairo who speak Arabic below the required level-3 would  prefer to be able to speak at a more advanced level to conduct effective  public outreach. Officials from the Foreign Service Institute agreed that a  level-3 speaking and reading language proficiency in Arabic and Chinese  was more appropriate for junior officers assigned to consular positions,  but they explained that language-designated position requirements are set  at a level officers can realistically achieve in the limited amount of time  available to obtain training."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State\u2019s Assignment and Promotion System May Hinder Efforts to Improve Its Foreign Language Capability", "paragraphs": ["Several FSOs we met with said they believe State\u2019s current assignment and  promotion system may hinder officers\u2019 ability to enhance and maintain  their language skills over time, as well as State\u2019s ability to take advantage  of those skills and the investment it makes in training. For example, State\u2019s  requirements for tenure stipulate that junior officers work in a variety of  regions and jobs to prepare them for careers as generalists, while State\u2019s  assignment regulations do not allow junior officers and specialists to serve  consecutive tours at the same post. As a result, junior officers are often  assigned to second tours that do not utilize the language skills they  acquired for their first tour. For example, according to FSI, assignments to  Russian-speaking posts would be complemented by assignments  elsewhere in the world or Washington, D.C., to provide the broader  experience required at the senior level. There is also a perception among  some officers that spending too much time in one region can lead to being  labeled as too narrowly specialized, which could adversely impact the  officers\u2019 career. However, a senior State official asserted that the belief  that regional specialization hurts an officer\u2019s career is untrue, and, further,  that State\u2019s new career development plan supports regional specialization.", "In addition, the short length of some tours, such as 1-year unaccompanied  assignments, may not give an officer sufficient time to master a language.

In an effort to make better use of the  department\u2019s training investment, the FSI has encouraged officers and  specialists to take FSI courses to refine their language skills and achieve  greater facility when dealing with the local community. But officers in  both Yemen and China stated that State\u2019s assignment system does not  allow for sufficient time between assignments to utilize FSI\u2019s continued  language training. Compounding this problem, officers stated that their  language skills often diminish when a new assignment takes them to a  region requiring different language skills. According to FSI, the need to fill  gaps at posts, the lack of a training float, and other circumstances  particular to individual staff\u2014such as family issues, learning difficulties  and aptitude, and application\u2014hinder FSI\u2019s language training efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Foreign Language Capability May Adversely Effect State\u2019s Operations", "paragraphs": ["State\u2019s foreign language gaps may negatively impact posts\u2019 operations.

According to the officer, one of the foreign government officials  who did not understand English, and was therefore silent throughout the  initial meetings, had actually been the most valuable source of information  all along, yet could only convey that information when the meeting was  conducted in his own language. Additionally, according to senior officials  in two of the countries we visited, officers without fluent language skills  who accompany them to high-level meetings often produce inaccurate  notes. Since these notes provide a basis for the embassy\u2019s reporting, the  officials spend a great deal of time correcting notes rather than addressing  more pressing concerns.

According to a recent GAO report many public diplomacy officers in the  Muslim world cannot communicate with local audiences as well as their  positions require. For example, an information officer in Cairo stated that  his office does not have enough Arabic speaking staff to engage the  Egyptian media effectively. According to a State Inspector General  inspection report on the U.S. embassy in Damascus, public affairs officers  need Arabic language skills to maintain and expand contacts with  nongovernmental, human rights, and civil society groups, but the language  training offered in Damascus fails to prepare them for the idiomatic Arabic  spoken in the country.", "Management officers: According to one ambassador we met with, a senior  level embassy official, who did not have sufficient speaking and reading  language requirements for his position, met with a prime minister, but was  unable to participate fully in the top-secret discussion without an outside  translator present.

In  order to compare 2005 data with 2002 data from our previous report and  remain consistent, we used FS-04 tenured, FS-03, and FS-02 bid data.

We further noted that State\u2019s Director General had  stated, in a cable issued in January 2006 that the department had been  shortsighted in not providing sufficient language training to specialists.  We have included additional information on the overall percentages of  officers meeting language requirements for the two different groups.  6.  We have included additional information on the percentages of officers  meeting either the speaking or reading requirement, but not both  requirements.
