Inappropriate marketing may include activities such as providing inaccurate information about covered benefits and conducting prohibited marketing practices. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for oversight of MA organizations and their plans. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to examine (1) the extent to which CMS has taken compliance and enforcement actions, (2) how CMS has helped beneficiaries affected by inappropriate marketing and the problems beneficiaries have encountered, and (3) information CMS has about the extent of inappropriate marketing. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws and policies; analyzed Medicare data on beneficiary complaints, compliance actions and enforcement actions; and interviewed officials from CMS and selected state departments of insurance, state health insurance assistance programs, and MA organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS took compliance and enforcement actions for inappropriate marketing against at least 73 organizations that sponsored MA plans from January 2006 through February 2009. While the number of MA organizations varied during that time period, 192 MA organizations offered MA plans as of March 2009. Actions taken ranged from initial notices of noncompliance and warning letters to more punitive measures, such as civil money penalties and suspensions of marketing and enrollment. Nineteen of the 73 MA organizations had multiple types of actions taken against them. CMS helped beneficiaries who experienced inappropriate marketing by providing special election periods (SEP) through which beneficiaries could disenroll from their MA plan and enroll in new coverage without waiting for the twice yearly regular enrollment periods. However, some beneficiaries experienced financial or access-to-care problems as a result of inappropriate marketing that could not be addressed by a SEP. Financial hardships occurred, for example, when beneficiaries disenrolled from their MA plans and the withholding of premiums from Social Security for their former MA plan was not stopped promptly. In other cases, beneficiaries did not realize they had been enrolled in an MA plan until they tried to access services. Some of these beneficiaries experienced disruption of their access to providers and medications because their providers did not participate in the MA plan. CMS has limited information about the number of beneficiaries who experienced inappropriate marketing. Some beneficiaries who experienced inappropriate marketing may have exercised their option to disenroll from their MA plans during regular enrollment periods and might not have notified CMS of the marketing problems they encountered. For example, about 21 percent of beneficiaries disenrolled during the regular enrollment periods in 2007 from one type of MA plan that CMS officials acknowledged had a high incidence of inappropriate marketing. However, CMS discontinued a survey after 2005 that collected information on reasons for disenrollment and could have provided important information about the extent to which the disenrollments were the result of inappropriate marketing. CMS officials said that they plan to reinstitute a survey on disenrollment reasons in late summer 2010. CMS also has limited information about the number of beneficiaries who experienced inappropriate marketing because it did not directly track the number of SEP disenrollments. CMS did estimate the number of SEPs it provided for inappropriate marketing, but its estimates were based on data that were unreliable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Members of Congress and state agencies have raised questions about  complaints that some Medicare Advantage (MA) organizations and their  agents inappropriately marketed their health plans to Medicare  beneficiaries. Inappropriate marketing activities may include, for  example, MA organizations and their agents misrepresenting plan benefits  and conducting prohibited marketing practices, such as door-to-door  marketing without appointments and providing potential beneficiaries  with meals or gifts of more than a nominal value at marketing events to  induce enrollment. In this report, the term inappropriate marketing also  includes organizations\u2019 noncompliance with MA marketing requirements   pertaining to proper training, compensation, and licensure of agents and  registration of marketing events.", "Congress held several hearings on inappropriate marketing during 2007  and 2008. In some of these hearings, officials of state departments of  insurance (DOI) and MA beneficiaries and their advocates testified that as  a result of inappropriate marketing, some beneficiaries were enrolled in  MA plans in which they had not intended to enroll or that did not address  their health care needs as well as their prior coverage. In June 2007, in  response to increasing concerns that MA organizations were not  adequately overseeing their marketing activities and that this could  negatively impact beneficiaries, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), the agency responsible for administering Medicare and  contracting with MA organizations to provide Medicare-covered services,  took the unprecedented step of negotiating voluntary suspensions of  marketing and enrollment activities of seven MA organizations\u2019 private fee- for-service (PFFS) plans. CMS officials and others have acknowledged  that inappropriate marketing has been particularly problematic in PFFS  plans, in part because the structure of PFFS plans differs from other types  of MA plans. For example, while other types of MA plans have provider  networks, most PFFS plans do not. Instead, providers can choose to  accept or not accept a PFFS beneficiary on a service-by-service basis,  which may be confusing to beneficiaries.", "The federal government and states each have responsibilities regarding the  conduct of MA organizations and their agents. CMS is responsible for  enforcing MA organizations\u2019 compliance with MA marketing requirements,  including the requirements concerning agents acting on behalf of MA  organizations. Subject to certain exceptions, these requirements  supersede state laws or regulations, and as a result, states generally do not  have the authority to regulate MA organizations\u2019 marketing. MA  marketing requirements generally impose obligations upon MA  organizations and not directly upon their agents. States retain oversig authority over the marketing activities of agents. According to state  officials and the National Association of Insurance Commissio (NAIC), holding MA organizations accountable for the actions of agents  marketing their plans is an essential component of effective oversight of  agents.  NAIC officials told us that placing responsibility for agent activity  with MA organizations is important because organizations can implement  systemic requirements, such as rigorous training programs, and can act  faster than states to  discipline agents.", "Marketing requirements for MA organizations are based, in part, on  provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) and the Medicare  Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA). Under the  BBA, Congress required that private plans offered through Medicare  conform to fair marketing standards that, among other requirements,  prohibit organizations from providing monetary inducements to  beneficiaries for enrollment in a plan. In 1998, CMS published  implementing regulations that elaborated upon the BBA requirements,  including prohibiting MA organizations from engaging in door-to-door  solicitations and in activities that could mislead or confuse beneficiaries  or misrepresent the MA organization. CMS also provided guidelines to  MA organizations on appropriate marketing practices, which organizations  are required by regulation and under their contracts with CMS to follow.  The guidelines, among other things, require MA organizations to use state- licensed agents for marketing activities and set restrictions on these  activities, such as a maximum value for give-away promotional items.  MIPPA and its implementing regulations codified some of the  requirements already established under CMS\u2019s marketing guidelines for  MA organizations. MIPPA and its implementing regulations also clarified  existing marketing-related requirements and created new requirements for  MA organizations such as limiting agent commissions and requiring MA  organizations to comply with any request by a state for information related  to agent performance when the state is investigating the conduct of an  agent.", "CMS uses compliance and enforcement actions to bring noncompliant MA  organizations into conformity with MA marketing requirements.  Compliance actions include requiring MA organizations to develop  corrective action plans (CAP) that specify actions the organization will  take to address its noncompliance. Enforcement actions are more punitive  than compliance actions and include imposition of civil money penalties,  suspension of enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries, suspension of  payment to an MA organization, suspension of marketing activities for an  MA plan, and termination or non-renewal of the MA organizations\u2019  contract. CMS has the authority to impose these sanctions for certain  types of violations of marketing requirements by MA organizations, though  the agency is not required to take such actions.", "Given concerns about inappropriate marketing and its effects on  beneficiaries, you asked us to examine how CMS assists beneficiaries  affected by inappropriate marketing, the extent of the noncompliance, and  how CMS holds MA organizations accountable. Our report addresses the  following questions: (1) To what extent has CMS taken compliance and  enforcement actions against MA organizations for inappropriate  marketing? (2) How has CMS helped MA beneficiaries affected by  inappropriate marketing and what types of problems have they  encountered? (3) What information does CMS have on the number of  beneficiaries affected by inappropriate marketing?", "To determine the extent to which CMS has taken compliance and  enforcement actions against MA organizations for inappropriate  marketing, we analyzed CMS data on compliance and enforcement actions  CMS took against MA organizations for inappropriate marketing for the  period January 2006 through February 2009.", "To determine how CMS helped beneficiaries affected by inappropriate  marketing and the types of problems beneficiaries encountered, we  interviewed officials from CMS\u2019s central office and all 10 regional offices,   6 state DOIs, and 6 state health insurance assistance programs (SHIP) and  reviewed relevant documentation. We also visited three CMS regional  offices to conduct more detailed interviews. We chose one of the regional  offices because it had conducted detailed compilations of complaint data;  another regional office because it housed the division that coordinated  regional office oversight and monitoring activities; and a third regional  office because it had responsibilities for MA organizations with a high  concentration of PFFS plans. We interviewed DOI officials and SHIP  officials in the three states where we conducted site visits. In addition, we  interviewed DOI and SHIP officials from another three states because in  one of the states, the DOI took an enforcement action against an MA  organization for inappropriate marketing and in the other two states, DOI  officials testified before NAIC on inappropriate MA marketing and sales  practices.", "To obtain information about the number of beneficiaries affected by  inappropriate marketing, we used June 2007 through October 2008 data  from CMS\u2019s complaint tracking module on the number of beneficiaries  who claimed they were affected by inappropriate marketing and requested  CMS assistance to disenroll from their MA plan. We interviewed officials  in CMS\u2019s central office and all regional offices about their use of the  complaint tracking module data. We also reviewed a February 2008 study  conducted by one CMS regional office that analyzed CMS and MA  organizations\u2019 resolution of cases entered into the complaint tracking  module. In addition, we interviewed officials from CMS\u2019s central office  about plans to collect information on beneficiaries\u2019 reasons for  disenrollment from their MA plan.", "To determine the reliability of the data we used, we reviewed  documentation, examined the internal consistency and other aspects of  the data, interviewed CMS officials about reliability issues, or some  combination of the three. Based on our review, we determined that the  CMS regional office study of complaint tracking and the compliance and  enforcement data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  determined that the complaint tracking module data had significant  limitations. As a result, we reported total complaints from the  inappropriate marketing categories because this is an indicator that CMS  uses, but did not include any additional analyses of the complaint tracking  module data. Appendix I provides more detailed information on our  methodology. We conducted this work from March 2008 through  December 2009 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["CMS monitoring and oversight activities of MA organizations\u2019 compliance  with marketing requirements, include maintaining regular communication  with and providing technical assistance to MA organizations. In addition,  CMS conducts surveillance activities and audits of MA organizations to  collect information about potential problems and compliance with  marketing requirements.", "CMS\u2019s surveillance activities include tracking and analyzing complaint  rates by MA organization and category of complaint. In 2007, CMS initiated  a variety of new surveillance activities focused on monitoring MA  organizations\u2019 marketing of PFFS plans. Among other activities, CMS  implemented a secret shopper program that had CMS representatives, with  their identity concealed, attend PFFS marketing events and report on the  accuracy of marketing presentations and agents\u2019 compliance with  marketing requirements. Other surveillance activities included monthly  review of PFFS enrollment packages and review of agent training test  results. CMS also tracks other indicators under certain circumstances,  such as verifying that beneficiaries willingly and knowingly chose certain  plans. For example, for 2008, CMS required MA organizations to call  beneficiaries newly enrolled in PFFS plans to verify that beneficiaries  wanted to enroll in the plan and understood plan features. CMS  subsequently tracked the proportion of verified calls as one of its  marketing performance indicators.", "In conducting audits of MA organizations, CMS assesses whether  organizations\u2019 operations are consistent with federal laws, regulations, and  CMS policies and procedures in some or all of seven major categories,  including marketing. Audits typically involve a combination of desk  reviews of documents submitted by MA organizations, and, at CMS\u2019s  discretion, site visits. CMS uses a risk-based approach to identify MA  organizations for audit. While CMS may choose to audit only certain  categories in any given year, since at least 2006, CMS has included  marketing operations, and specifically those related to misleading  marketing, in its audits. CMS also conducts focused, or out-of-cycle, audits  of MA organizations to ensure that MA organizations implemented new  processes for previously identified areas of noncompliance and to  investigate potential noncompliance issues that CMS identified outside of  the audit cycle.", "In June 2008, CMS reorganized its internal structure for overseeing MA  plans and established standard operating procedures (SOP) for the  oversight of MA organizations. The 2008 SOPs outlined the agency\u2019s  oversight approach and clarified, among other things, what actions CMS  may take when MA organizations were found to be out of compliance with  marketing and other requirements. According to CMS officials, the SOPs  formalized many procedures that CMS was already using to oversee MA  organizations and were intended to ensure that these procedures were  being applied in a uniform manner nationwide.", "CMS\u2019s SOPs state that CMS is to consider the nature of each violation in  determining the appropriate compliance or enforcement action. The 2008  SOPs include the following actions from least to most severe:    Informal contact: phone call, e-mail, or meetings with MA organization  officials to provide technical assistance.", "Compliance: initial notice of noncompliance\u2014e-mail to the MA  organization, usually through the MA organization\u2019s compliance officer. An  initial notice of noncompliance is generally issued at the first finding of  relatively minor noncompliance with federal laws, regulations, or CMS  guidance, such as a single instance of inappropriate marketing activities.  The notice informs an MA organization that it is out of compliance and  directs MA organizations to reply to the email to indicate how it will  address the noncompliance.", "Compliance: warning letter\u2014formal letter to the MA organization\u2019s  compliance officer stating the concern or area of noncompliance that  requires immediate remedy for a limited and quickly fixable situation. CMS  also notifies MA organizations that continued noncompliance will lead to  stricter actions by CMS, such as requiring the MA organization to develop  a CAP.", "Compliance: CAP request letter\u2014formal letter to the MA organization\u2019s  chief executive officer stating the concern(s) and requiring the  organization to develop and implement a CAP for the specific violation(s).  CMS can require CAPs from MA organizations when the agency identifies  noncompliance that generally affects multiple beneficiaries and represents  an ongoing or systemic inability to adhere to Medicare requirements.  CMS\u2019s SOPs provide time frames for CMS and MA organizations to  respond, accept, and implement CAPs. CAPs are reported publicly on the  CMS Web site.", "Enforcement: sanctions provided for under federal law that CMS may  impose on MA organizations for what CMS considers egregious or  sustained noncompliance and for specific violations, including  misrepresenting or falsifying information to CMS, beneficiaries, or  potential beneficiaries, or substantially failing to carry out the terms of  their contracts with CMS. Sanctions may include civil money penalties;  the suspension of plans\u2019 marketing activities, enrollment, or Medicare  payment; or termination or nonrenewal of organizations\u2019 contracts with  CMS. Suspensions of plans\u2019 marketing activities, enrollment, or Medicare  payment are to remain in place until CMS is satisfied that the  noncompliance that served as the basis for the suspension has been  corrected and is not likely to recur.", "For more serious violations, CMS may choose to forgo initial, less formal  actions against an MA organization in favor of stricter actions, including  later-stage compliance or enforcement actions. However, the SOPs  indicate that compliance matters will generally escalate through the  compliance process in a step-by-step manner, starting with the initial  notice of noncompliance up through the CAP stage. CMS has also chosen  to negotiate voluntary suspensions with MA organizations rather than go  through formal processes to impose involuntary sanctions. According to  CMS officials, voluntary suspensions can result in a faster intervention. If  CMS makes the determination that the MA organization has engaged in  certain fraudulent activity, the agency is to refer the violation to the  Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General  (HHS OIG) for review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Took Compliance and Enforcement Actions against at Least 73 MA Organizations for Inappropriate Marketing", "paragraphs": ["From January 2006 through February 2009 CMS took a range of  compliance and enforcement actions against at least 73 MA organizations  for inappropriate marketing. While the number of MA organizations varied  during the approximately 3-year period, 192 MA organizations offered MA  plans as of March 2009. The exact number of MA organizations that were  subject to an action could be higher. According to CMS, the agency did not  begin tracking two types of action\u2014initial notices of noncompliance and  warning letters\u2014until June 2008. From June 2008 through February 2009,  CMS sent one initial notice of noncompliance and 76 warning letters to MA  organizations. (See app. II for more information about the types of  inappropriate marketing that resulted in initial notices of noncompliance  and warning letters.) From January 2006 through February 2009, CMS  required 37 CAPs from MA organizations and also took 5 enforcement  actions for inappropriate marketing\u20143 marketing and enrollment  suspensions and 2 civil money penalties. The 73 MA organizations against  which CMS took compliance or enforcement actions enrolled  approximately 7.4 million beneficiaries through February 2009. (See table  1.) These beneficiaries represented about 71 percent of all MA  beneficiaries. CMS also negotiated voluntary suspensions of marketing  and enrollment activities for PFFS plans with seven of these MA  organizations effective June 2007.", "In some cases, during the period from January 2006 through February  2009, CMS took multiple types of actions against the same MA  organizations because it determined that these organizations had more  than one inappropriate marketing violation. (See app. III for information  about the criteria CMS uses to make compliance and enforcement  decisions.) Nineteen of the 73 MA organizations subject to compliance or  enforcement actions had multiple types of actions taken against them.  Fifteen of the 19 organizations received at least one warning letter or  notice of noncompliance and a CAP. Two MA organizations received at  least one warning letter or notice of noncompliance, were required to  submit at least one CAP, and were subject to an enforcement action. One  organization received at least one warning letter or notice of  noncompliance and was subject to an enforcement action and another was  required to submit at least one CAP and was subject to an enforcement  action.", "The time it took for MA plans to implement CAPs varied widely and  changed over time. In May 2008, CMS revised its audit SOPs to generally  require MA organizations to fully implement CAPs within 90 days from  CMS\u2019s acceptance. Consequently, the average time from when CAPs  were requested to when corrective actions were fully implemented  decreased for CAPs accepted after May 2008. Specifically, corrective  actions for inappropriate marketing deficiencies were fully implemented  an average of 218 days after CAPs were requested for the 22 CAPs  accepted from January 2006 through April 2008 and an average of 174 d for the 13 CAPs accepted from May 2008 through February 2009. The  period of time from when CMS requested the CAP to when CMS accepted  the CAP increased, on average, from 90 days for CAPs accepted prior to  May 2008 to 145 days for CAPs accepted May 2008 through February 2009.  However, the average time from CMS acceptance of the CAP to when  corrective actions were fully implemented decreased from 128 days for  CAPs accepted from January 2006 through April 2008 to 29 days for CAPs  ays  accepted from May 2008 through February 2009. (See fig. 1.) Overall, the  period of time from when CMS requested CAPs to when MA organizations  fully implemented them varied widely for CAPs accepted both for the  period from January 2006 through April 2008 (from 61 to 410 days) and  from May 2008 through February 2009 (from 68 to 345 days).", "For enforcement actions, the implementation time periods varied widely  as well\u2014from approximately 2 weeks to 2 years before CMS took an  enforcement action after first identifying what it considered to be  inappropriate marketing. For example, CMS suspended the marketing and  enrollment activities of one MA organization based on results of CMS\u2019s  secret shopper activities that showed what CMS considered egregious  inappropriate marketing approximately 2 weeks after the MA organization  began marketing its MA plans. In contrast, in February 2009, CMS  suspended the marketing and enrollment activities for another MA  organization after 2 years of sustained noncompliance with marketing  requirements. During the 2-year period, CMS determined that this MA  organization employed agents who had engaged in activities that misled,  confused, or misrepresented the organization or its MA plans to  beneficiaries during three audits conducted between March 2007 and July  2008, for which CMS required CAPs. In addition, in July 2008, CMS sent the  MA organization a notice of noncompliance based on beneficiary  allegations of inappropriate marketing by agents selling its MA plans.

CMS announced that it had established a special SEP for  inappropriate marketing in a July 2007 memo to MA organizations. CMS  officials described these SEPs as their primary attempt to make  beneficiaries who experienced inappropriate marketing \u201cwhole.\u201d", "According to CMS\u2019s SOPs, MA beneficiaries qualify for the SEP if they call  1-800-Medicare or contact a CMS regional office and give reasonable  assurance that they were subject to inappropriate marketing; CMS does  not require the beneficiaries to provide evidence. According to CMS  officials, they decide whether to provide SEPs before investigations into  inappropriate marketing allegations are complete to ensure that  beneficiaries who did experience misleading marketing can disenroll from  the MA plan and enroll in other health coverage as quickly as possible.  Consequently, some of the beneficiaries who were provided a SEP might  not have been subject to inappropriate marketing.", "CMS offered MA beneficiaries either a prospective or retroactive SEP.  Under a prospective SEP, beneficiaries could disenroll from the MA plan  and return to their previous coverage or enroll in another option effective  the first day of the next month. CMS officials told us that the customer  service representatives at 1-800-Medicare generally processed prospective  disenrollments and enrollment in other MA plans or Medicare FFS. Under  the retroactive SEP, beneficiaries could disenroll from the MA plan and  return to their previous coverage or enroll in other coverage effective as  early as the date of their enrollment in the MA plan. Retroactive SEPs are  more complicated because they require payment adjustments for any  premiums paid and medical services received while the beneficiary was  enrolled in the plan. Retroactive SEPs are processed by regional office  staff.", "According to CMS\u2019s SEP SOPs, 1-800-Medicare customer service  representatives should ask beneficiaries who provide reasonable  assurance that they were subject to inappropriate marketing whether they  would like to prospectively disenroll from their plan and enroll in new  coverage. If the beneficiary agrees, the disenrollment from the MA plan  and enrollment in new coverage is handled by the customer service  representative. If the beneficiary requests a retroactive SEP, the case is  forwarded to a regional office. CMS\u2019s SEP SOPs state that regional office  officials are required to explain the consequences of a retroactive  disenrollment or enrollment to the beneficiary before such a disenrollment  is processed. If a beneficiary directly contacts a regional office with a  complaint of inappropriate marketing, officials should offer beneficiaries a  prospective SEP, although they may offer a retroactive SEP if the  beneficiary insists. While CMS\u2019s SOPs indicate a preference for offering  beneficiaries a prospective SEP, CMS officials we interviewed said that  whether CMS offers a prospective or retroactive SEP to a beneficiary  depends on what would be in the beneficiary\u2019s best interest.", "The most suitable SEP for a MA beneficiary depended on the beneficiary\u2019s  circumstances. For example, if beneficiaries used services while enrolled  in an MA plan, they could benefit from a prospective SEP if their cost  sharing\u2014the amount they paid out-of-pocket for a covered service\u2014under  the MA plan was lower than it would be under their restored or other  coverage. If these beneficiaries chose a retroactive SEP, they would have  to make up the difference between the lower cost sharing amount under  the MA plan and the higher amount under their restored or other coverage.  Conversely, beneficiaries who chose restored or other coverage with cost  sharing that was lower than the MA plan could benefit from disenrolling  retroactively because they would be reimbursed for the difference  between the out-of-pocket costs they incurred for services received under  the MA plan and the lower costs under the restored or other coverage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Beneficiaries Experienced Problems Associated with Retroactive Disenrollments, While Others Experienced Problems That Could Not be Fixed by a SEP", "paragraphs": ["Some DOI and SHIP officials we interviewed told us that MA  disenrollments and enrollments resulting from inappropriate marketing  generally appeared to go smoothly, but that some beneficiaries  experienced problems. Officials from some DOIs and a SHIP we  interviewed said some beneficiaries\u2019 retroactive disenrollments took  several months to process. Officials from one DOI said that some  beneficiaries received bills from collection agencies because provider  reimbursements associated with retroactive disenrollments were not  timely. An official from another DOI said that it could take from 10 to   30 days to receive enrollment material, including a plan identification card,  and this could cause access-to-care problems if beneficiaries needed  health care services before the material arrived. To help mitigate any  access-to-care problems, CMS officials said that they instructed 1-800- Medicare customer service representatives to give beneficiaries their MA  plans\u2019 contact information when they enrolled so that beneficiaries could  contact the plans directly for information about accessing services.  Additionally, CMS officials stated that CMS regional office employees  routinely worked with MA organizations to ensure that beneficiaries who  received a retroactive SEP could access services prior to receiving plan  identification cards.", "CMS officials told us that some of the problems encountered by MA  beneficiaries receiving a retroactive inappropriate marketing SEP were  unavoidable and inherent to the processing of a retroactive disenrollment.  They noted that under a retroactive SEP, different premium amounts  needed to be collected, provider bills and payments might need to be  retracted and reprocessed by the new insurer, and different cost-sharing  amounts applied. Therefore, a SEP could take time to be fully processed.  These officials stated that the administrative actions and associated  problems that beneficiaries may experience are preferable to keeping  beneficiaries in an MA plan after they have stated that they experienced  inappropriate marketing.", "Beneficiaries who stated they experienced inappropriate marketing may  also have experienced problems that the SEP could not address. For  example, these beneficiaries could have experienced financial or access- to-care issues prior to receiving the SEP. CMS, DOI, and SHIP officials  described cases in which beneficiaries did not realize they had been  switched to an MA plan until they tried to access services. These officials  said some of the beneficiaries experienced disruption of their access to  providers and medications because their providers did not participate in  the MA plan. DOIs and SHIPs also cited several other problems the  inappropriate marketing SEP could not resolve because the problems  were associated with private or state employee insurance plan provisions  or involved other government agencies, and hence were outside CMS\u2019s  jurisdiction. DOIs and SHIPs provided information about specific types of  cases that a SEP could not resolve:    A beneficiary had to pay higher premiums to obtain the same Medigap  polices that she had dropped when she was enrolled in a MA plan.", "Beneficiaries could not have coverage restored by their prior employer\u2019s  retiree health plan.

For example, we previously reported on disenrollment rates in PFFS plans  occurring during the regular enrollment periods for 2007. PFFS plans  were considered by CMS and others to have high rates of inappropriate  marketing. From January through April 2007, when the disenrollments  took effect, about 169,000 beneficiaries in PFFS plans, or 21 percent of the  total number of PFFS beneficiaries, disenrolled from the plan that they  were enrolled in. This 4-month total was more than double the  disenrollments from other plan types during that same time period.  However, the number of these beneficiaries who changed plans because  they were affected by inappropriate marketing was unknown because  CMS did not have data on why these beneficiaries disenrolled.", "After 2005, CMS discontinued a survey on disenrollment reasons that  provided information on the frequency of certain problems leading to  disenrollment. From 2000 to 2005, CMS conducted an annual survey  asking MA beneficiaries who disenrolled why they left their plan. Among  the disenrollment reasons that beneficiaries could have chosen was:  \u201cGiven incorrect or incomplete information at the time you joined the  plan.\u201d A 2005 analysis prepared by CMS contractors of survey results from  2000 through 2003 found that over this time period, the percent of  beneficiaries who said they disenrolled because they were given incorrect  or incomplete information at the time they joined their plan ranged from  about 9 to about 11 percent. However, in each of the 3 years, less than one  percent of beneficiaries who responded to the survey stated that this was  the most important reason for their disenrollment. The survey did not  collect information on the problems beneficiaries experienced as a result  of the reasons that led to their disenrollment or the disenrollment itself.

CMS officials plan to collect data over a 9- to  12-month period, so final results should be available sometime in 2011.  After the survey ends and results are analyzed, CMS will determine  whether to conduct additional surveys on disenrollment reasons.", "CMS did not directly track the number of SEPs it provided, but instead  estimated the number based on information collected in its complaint  tracking module. Complaints from beneficiaries who stated they  experienced inappropriate marketing and wanted to disenroll from their  MA plans were classified into one of two categories in CMS\u2019s complaint  tracking module. One category was for inappropriate marketing cases  that required regional office action to complete beneficiaries\u2019  disenrollment and enrollment in another plan. According to complaint  tracking module data provided by CMS, during the 17-month period from  June 2007 through October 2008, CMS received 18,331 such complaints.  CMS officials said that most of these cases were retroactive SEP  requests. The second category was for inappropriate marketing cases  that did not require regional office action to complete beneficiaries\u2019  disenrollment and enrollment in another plan. During the 7-month period  from April 2008 through October 2008, CMS received 1,689 inappropriate  marketing complaints that the agency determined did not need regional  office action. According to CMS officials, cases included in the second  category were primarily prospective SEP requests. CMS officials told us  that most of the complaints in these two categories resulted in an  inappropriate marketing SEP but that the total included some  beneficiaries who made such statements but did not disenroll.", "However, the complaint data were not a reliable source of information on  the number of beneficiaries who received the SEP. A study conducted by a  CMS regional office of a sample of about 170 complaints lodged between  August 2007 and January 2008 highlighted inaccurate and incomplete  documentation as well as a portion of inappropriate marketing complaints  that had been miscategorized:    About 33 percent of cases were resolved or closed inappropriately or  involved duplicate cases. For example, some cases were closed prior to  final resolution. In one of these cases, the MA organization indicated in  case notes that a beneficiary was experiencing a problem with  reimbursement and that it was doing additional research on the issue.  However, the MA organization closed the case prior to completing its  research on whether the beneficiary was due reimbursement and, if so,  whether the beneficiary received it. Four of the 54 cases in this category  were for instances in which multiple cases were open for the same  member and issue.", "About 28 percent of case resolutions were poorly documented. Most  frequently these cases contained notes in the complaint tracking module  that did not indicate when disenrollments took effect or addressed part of  the complaint but notes did not reflect that all aspects of the complaint  had been resolved.", "About 20 percent of cases were incorrectly categorized. The majority of  miscategorized cases were inappropriate marketing complaints that were  coded in categories other than inappropriate marketing.", "About 12 percent of cases lacked specific information about at least one  issue involved in the complaint, such as details about refunds or payments  owed to the beneficiary.", "Officials from another CMS regional office conducted a more informal  examination of complaint tracking module cases in 2008 and found similar  problems. The officials told us that the regional office did a spot check of  50 inappropriate MA marketing complaints by calling the beneficiaries and  determined that the notes in the complaint tracking module often did not  match the description of the complaint that the beneficiary provided  during the follow-up call. The officials also said that CMS staff examined  complaints against one MA organization and found cases of alleged  inappropriate marketing that were not categorized as such. The officials  from this regional office estimated that they had recategorized 60 percent  of all complaint tracking module cases within this region. However, other  CMS regional offices said the percentage of cases that needed to be  recategorized was small. The reason for this disparity is unclear, but it may  be due to how regional offices determined whether cases needed to be  recategorized.", "CMS officials told us that they used the results of internal studies of the  complaint tracking module to improve their ability to categorize  complaints.

While CMS has  used SEPs to assist beneficiaries, the agency was unable to prevent some  of them from experiencing negative consequences. Currently, CMS has  limited information on the extent of inappropriate marketing and the  number of beneficiaries affected. The agency intends to conduct a survey  of beneficiaries who disenrolled from MA plans and ask about their  reasons for disenrollment. Depending on the specific questions included,  such a survey could provide information about the number of beneficiaries  who experience inappropriate marketing and identify plans, plan types,  and geographic locations where inappropriate marketing problems are  most prevalent. CMS\u2019s information about the extent of inappropriate  marketing is also limited because the agency has not gathered reliable  information about the number of prospective and retroactive SEPs  provided for this reason. Without an investigation into individual cases,  CMS cannot determine whether all of the problems reported by  beneficiaries represent inappropriate marketing. Nonetheless, gathering  information on the reasons beneficiaries disenroll from their MA plans and  tracking the number of the SEPs that the agency provides would enable  the construction of useful indicators of the potential scope and location of  the marketing problems. Because of the potentially serious implications  for beneficiaries as a result of inappropriate marketing, it is important for  CMS to have information that can inform the agency\u2019s oversight efforts  and help it to appropriately target interventions when necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve CMS\u2019s oversight of MA organizations and its ability to  appropriately target interventions, we recommend that the Administrator  of CMS gather more information on the extent of inappropriate marketing  and the types of problems beneficiaries experienced as a result of  inappropriate marketing.

CMS also stated that while it  did not directly track the number of retroactive and prospective SEPs  provided for inappropriate marketing, it used data from its complaint  tracking module and considered that data a reasonable proxy of the total  number of SEPs requested for inappropriate marketing.

Specifically, the agency issued  the majority of notices of noncompliance and warning letters based on MA  organizations\u2019 noncompliance with required agent commission limits or  the results of surveillance activities (such as analysis of inappropriate  marketing complaints and secret shopper activities). CMS required the  majority of CAPs based on the results of audits of MA organizations.  Required agent commission limits, surveillance activities, and audits all  have explicit criteria for assessing compliance with agency requirements.  For example, of the 76 warning letters CMS sent to MA organizations for  inappropriate marketing practices, 44 were based on noncompliance with  required agent commission limits and 30 were based on the results of  surveillance activities. CMS regulations published in September 2008  require MA organizations to establish reasonable agent commission limits;  CMS sent warning letters to those MA organizations that had commission  limits that the agency determined were unreasonable.

Enforcement actions are expressly  provided for in federal statute as a remedy for certain violations. CMS  officials told us that the agency initiates enforcement decisions when  particular instances of non-compliance or failures to correct deficiencies  warrant a higher level of intervention. According to CMS officials, they  review various sources of evidence in determining whether to initiate an  enforcement action, including: beneficiary complaints; results of  surveillance activities, such as secret shopper observations; problems self- reported by the MA organization; data from audits; reporting requirements;  and information from DOIs and SHIPs. In addition, when making  enforcement decisions, CMS officials said that they consider the nature,  scope, and severity of the particular non-compliance, how many  beneficiaries have been or potentially could be adversely affected by the  noncompliance, whether the MA organization has failed to address a  serious compliance deficiency for which it has received prior notice and  opportunity to correct, whether the compliance deficiency has been  previously corrected but recurred, and CMS precedent in taking  enforcement actions in similar circumstances.
