However, the shift to remote claims filing in many states has raised concerns about maintaining a connection between the UI program and reemployment services. This report examines (1) the extent to which states have shifted to remote claims filing and how they are making claimants aware of program requirements and services, (2) what states are doing to facilitate reemployment of UI claimants, and (3) what is known about the extent to which UI claimants receive reemployment services and about their outcomes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Nearly all states accept most initial UI claims remotely by telephone, the Internet, or both. Even though claimants filing remotely no longer have face-to-face contact with UI staff at the time the claim is filed, all states told us they have found ways to provide information on eligibility requirements and reemployment services to individuals filing claims, such as by including this information in the scripts used by claims takers at UI call centers or as documents on Web pages. Officials from most states told us the shift to remote claims has not diminished their ability to provide information or deliver services to claimants. In fact, some report that this shift may have improved their ability to serve their customers. cross states, claimants have access to a variety of reemployment services, and states make use of UI program requirements to connect claimants with available services at various points in their claim. All federally approved state UI programs require that claimants be able and available to work, and in many states these requirements also serve to link claimants to reemployment services. States also engage some claimants in reemployment services through programs that identify certain groups for more targeted assistance. States primarily target reemployment services to claimants identified as most likely to exhaust their UI benefits before finding work, through federally required claimant profiling programs. Little is known about the extent to which claimants receive services from the broad array of programs designed to assist them or about the outcomes they achieve. States must meet a number of federal reporting requirements for their UI and employment and training programs, but none of these reports provides a complete picture of the services received or the outcomes obtained by UI claimants. GAO also found that few states monitor the extent to which claimants are receiving these services, and even fewer monitor outcomes for these claimants, largely due to limited information systems capabilities. Labor has some initiatives that may begin to shed light on claimant services and outcomes, but none will provide a complete picture."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several decades, both the U.S. economy and its workforce  have undergone substantial changes. Unemployed workers are now less  likely to be rehired by their previous employers and are at greater risk of  long-term unemployment than in the past. Over the past five decades, the  average duration of unemployment has been gradually increasing, so that  during 2002 periods of unemployment grew to an average of 16.6 weeks,  compared with 11.3 weeks during the 1950s. To assist workers who have  lost their jobs, the Unemployment Insurance (UI) Program provided about  $35 billion in temporary income support in calendar year 2004. The cost of  providing this income support, coupled with a growing trend toward  longer-term unemployment, increases the importance of quickly linking UI  claimants to the tools they need to become reemployed.", "To be eligible for income support under the UI program, claimants must  meet a federal requirement to be able to work and available for work.  Traditionally, claimants were required to apply for benefits in person at an  unemployment office, and information on available jobs and what they  must do to remain eligible for benefits was often given to them as part of  that process. However, over time many states have transitioned to the  remote filing of UI claims\u2014primarily by telephone or the Internet\u2014and  claimants have less face-to-face contact with staff. The shift to remote  claims filing has raised concerns about maintaining a connection between  the UI program and reemployment services.", "At the same time, the workforce development system\u2014responsible for  helping these workers become reemployed\u2014has undergone reform. With  the passage of the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) in 1998, services for  over 17 different federally funded programs have been streamlined into a  single service delivery structure, the one-stop system, and a broad range of  services are made available to anyone who walks through the door. To be  able to make these services available to all who seek them, state and local  officials have begun to rely more heavily on self-directed services, such as  allowing job seekers to use available Internet capabilities to conduct  online job searches or to use available computers to develop resumes  without staff assistance. This shift in service delivery strategy has raised  concerns that some UI claimants may not be receiving enough information  on reemployment services or timely assistance to help them find a job, and  little is known about whether states have policies in place to help  unemployed workers quickly become reemployed.", "To address these issues, we examined (1) the extent to which states have  shifted to remote methods for filing initial claims and how they are making  claimants aware of their responsibilities to look for work and the services  available to assist them, (2) what states are doing to facilitate the  reemployment of UI claimants, and (3) what is known about the extent to  which UI claimants receive reemployment services and about the  outcomes of claimants who receive these services.", "To learn more about the strategies implemented by state and local officials  to promote participation in activities that may assist claimants in getting a  job, we conducted telephone interviews with UI and workforce  development officials in 50 states. For purposes of this review, we defined  reemployment services to mean all reemployment activities funded  through Wagner-Peyser; WIA Adult and Dislocated Worker services; any  other training or job search assistance provided using federal funds, such  as Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA); and any state-funded  reemployment or training services. We supplemented the phone interviews  with a follow-up questionnaire to gather information on the strategies  states use to collect data on UI claimants who receive reemployment  services. In addition, we conducted site visits to four states\u2014Georgia,  Maryland, Michigan, and Washington\u2014chosen to give us a range of  unemployment rates, dislocation activity, and experiences implementing  remote claims, and to allow for geographic dispersion. On our site visits,  we interviewed state officials in the workforce development system and UI  programs and visited at least two local areas in each state, selected to  provide a range of urban and rural sites. In addition, we reviewed  documents and interviewed Department of Labor (Labor) officials and  other experts in the area of UI and reemployment services. For details  about our scope and methodology, see appendix I.

The program, which is administered by the states  with oversight from Labor\u2019s Employment and Training Administration  (ETA), provides temporary cash benefits to workers who lose their jobs  through no fault of their own. Today UI coverage is nearly universal,  extending to almost all wage and salaried workers. To help claimants  become reemployed, employment and training assistance is provided  through a number of federal programs, including Wagner-Peyser  Employment Service, WIA Adult, WIA Dislocated Worker, and TAA  programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Unemployment Insurance\u2014Structure of the Program", "paragraphs": ["The UI program is funded by federal and state taxes levied on employers.  The states collect the portion of the tax needed to pay UI benefits, while  the federal tax finances state and federal administrative costs and other  related federal costs. Labor holds these funds in trust on behalf of the  states in the Unemployment Trust Fund. In fiscal year 2004, Congress  authorized about $2.6 billion to states to administer their programs.", "Labor is responsible for overseeing the UI program to ensure that the  states operate an effective and efficient UI program. Labor is also  responsible for monitoring state operations and procedures, providing  technical assistance and training, as well as analyzing UI program data to  diagnose potential problems. Although Labor provides oversight and  guidance to ensure that each state operates its program consistent with  federal guidelines, the federal-state structure of UI places primary  responsibility for administering the program on the states. The states have  wide latitude to administer their UI programs in a manner that best suits  their needs within these guidelines.", "States establish initial eligibility requirements to determine which  unemployed workers are qualified to start collecting UI benefits. These  requirements seek to ensure that an unemployed worker has had sufficient  employment experience to qualify for UI benefits (known as the monetary  eligibility requirements), and to determine whether the worker lost the job  through no fault of his or her own (the nonmonetary eligibility  requirements). State claims representatives are responsible for  determining each claimant\u2019s initial eligibility for UI benefits by gathering  and (when possible) verifying important information, such as identity,  employment history, why the claimants is no longer working, and other  sources of income the claimant may have. Once the claim has been  submitted for processing, the state sends forms to the claimant\u2019s  employer(s) requesting them to verify the claimant\u2019s wages and the reason  the claimant is no longer working. If the individual\u2019s claim for UI is  approved, the state then determines the amount of UI benefits, depending  on the individual\u2019s earnings during the period upon which the claim is  based and other factors. In general, most states are expected to provide  the first benefits to the claimant within 21 days of the date the state  determined that the claimant was entitled to benefits.", "In order to remain eligible for benefits on a continuing basis, claimants  must also demonstrate that they are able to work and available for work  and are still unemployed. Claimants must submit this certification of  continuing eligibility\u2014by mail, telephone, or Internet, depending on the  state\u2014throughout the benefit period. This practice is usually done weekly  or biweekly. States may continue to monitor claimant eligibility through an  eligibility review program, in which certain claimants are periodically  contacted to review their eligibility for benefits, work search activities,  and reemployment needs. Typically, the maximum duration of benefits is  26 weeks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Claimant Profiling in the Unemployment Insurance Program", "paragraphs": ["In November 1993, Congress enacted legislation amending the Social  Security Act to require that each state establish a Worker Profiling and  Reemployment Services (WPRS) system and implement a process typically  referred to as claimant profiling. The claimant profiling process uses a  statistical model or characteristics screen to identify claimants who are  likely to exhaust their UI benefits before finding work. Claimants  identified through this process are then referred to reemployment services  while they are still early in their claim. For profiled claimants,  participation in designated reemployment services becomes an additional  requirement for continuing eligibility for UI benefits.", "To assist states in implementing WPRS, Labor developed a prototype  model for determining the probability that claimants will exhaust their  benefits based on a set of five claimant characteristics: education, job  tenure, industry, occupation, and the local unemployment rate. While  some states have included only these five variables in their profiling  models, others have used this prototype as a benchmark and have  included additional variables, such as the claimant\u2019s pre-unemployment  earnings, weekly benefit amount, UI wage replacement rate, potential  duration of UI benefits, delay in filing, and the ratio of quarterly earnings  to earnings in the base year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reemployment Services for Unemployment Insurance Claimants", "paragraphs": ["Reemployment services for UI claimants are usually delivered by a range  of federally funded employment and training programs, often through  consolidated service delivery structures called one-stop centers. When it  was passed in 1998, the WIA began requiring that about 17 federal  employment and training programs, including UI, provide services through  the one-stop system. WIA allows local areas considerable flexibility in how  these programs provide services through the system, so the degree of  connection throughout the one-stop system between UI and other  workforce programs can vary widely by state and local area. Among the  many federal workforce programs that may provide reemployment  services to UI claimants, four programs funded by Labor are most likely to  serve UI claimants: Employment Service, WIA Adult program, WIA  Dislocated Worker program, and TAA. All four of these are required to be  part of the one-stop system, and each has its own performance reporting  requirements.", "Employment Service. The Employment Service was created in 1933 by the  Wagner-Peyser Act, making labor exchange services\u2014that link job seekers  with job opportunities\u2014universally available to employers and job seekers  alike without charges or conditions. Historically, many states colocated  local Employment Service and UI offices so that when UI claimants  applied for benefits at Employment Service offices, they would be exposed  to employment services. Today, states\u2019 labor exchanges typically involve  online databases where job seekers can look for work and apply for jobs,  and where employers can post jobs and recruit employees. In addition,  Employment Service offers a range of services to job seekers, including  job search assistance, job referral, placement assistance, assessment,  counseling, and testing. Employment Service also offers a number of  services to employers, including taking job orders, recruitment, screening,  referrals of job seekers, assisting with job restructuring, and helping  employers manage layoffs.", "WIA Adult and WIA Dislocated Worker Programs. When WIA was enacted  in 1998, it replaced the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) programs for  economically disadvantaged adults and youth and for dislocated workers  with three new programs\u2014WIA Adult, Dislocated Worker, and Youth\u2014 that provide a broader range of services to the general public, no longer  using income to determine eligibility for all program services. WIA  programs provide for three tiers, or levels, of service for adults and  dislocated workers: core, intensive, and training. Core services include  basic services such as job searches and labor market information. These  activities may be self-service or require some staff assistance. Intensive  services include such activities as comprehensive assessment and case  management\u2014activities that require greater staff involvement. Training  services include such activities as occupational skills or on-the-job  training. Labor\u2019s guidance provides for monitoring and tracking of  performance for the adult and dislocated worker programs to begin when  job seekers receive core services that require significant staff assistance.  WIA currently excludes job seekers who receive core services that are  self-service and informational in nature from being included in the  performance measures.", "Trade Adjustment Assistance. To assist workers who are laid off as a  result of international trade, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 created the  Trade Adjustment Assistance program. Historically, the primary benefits  available through the program have been extended income support and  training. Participants are generally entitled to income support, but the  amount of funds available for training is limited by statute. Congress has  amended the TAA program a number of times since its inception.  Amendments to the TAA program in the TAA Reform Act of 2002 extended  income support to 78 weeks after exhausting UI benefits (plus 26 more  weeks if participating in and completing remedial training) and added new  health coverage assistance and wage insurance benefits for older  workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Funds to Support Reemployment Services", "paragraphs": ["To promote reemployment through the one-stop system, Congress  appropriated $35 million a year beginning in 2001 for Reemployment  Services Grants specifically to provide reemployment services for UI  claimants.

Of these states, 29 use both remote filing methods, while 10  accept claims only over the telephone and 5 take them only by Internet  (see fig. 1). In most states with telephone claims, claimants speak with  customer service representatives, although in 6 states claimants may use  an automated voice response system to complete their claim. In some  states with such automated systems, it is possible for a claimant to file an  initial claim without speaking to anyone. However, if problems occur  during the process, callers can be transferred to remote claims centers  where a service representative works with them to complete the claim. Of  the 6 states that did not accept remote claims, 3 said they plan to begin  accepting initial claims by Internet or telephone in the future. The  remaining 3 states still require claimants to file for unemployment  insurance in person. For example, Georgia officials told us that they do  not currently allow claimants to file initial UI claims remotely, preferring  instead to have claimants file in person at workforce centers, where they  typically file their claims using the state\u2019s private computer network. (See  app. II for more information on which states take initial UI claims  remotely by telephone or Internet.)", "In addition to accepting initial claims by telephone or Internet, some states  also reported using other remote filing methods. Officials in several states  told us that they accept claims submitted directly by employers, but the  role of employer-filed claims differs from state to state. For example,  Michigan officials told us they had established an employer-filed claim  process in which employers with more than 1,000 layoffs in 3 consecutive  years must file employee claims electronically. With an employer-filed  claim, the claimant is not involved in filing the initial claim but still must  certify and file for continuing claims. State officials told us that these  claims simplify the filing process in cases of large layoffs and help workers  receive their UI benefit checks more quickly. They said their goal was to  have 20 to 25 percent of all initial claims filed through this method. In  general, however, employer-filed claims are used for mass layoffs or  seasonal shutdowns.", "Most states that accept remote claims also allow claimants to file their  initial claims at a one-stop center, either by using available telephones\u2014 sometimes with a direct telephone link to a call center\u2014 or by using on  site computer resources to access the Internet. In Washington, for  example, individuals who come to the state\u2019s one-stop centers are directed  to file by Internet or by phone at an on site kiosk. These kiosks, which the  state has placed in most of its one-stop centers, provide a direct  connection to a call center and display UI program information to help  claimants understand the process.

Among the 39 states that allow filing by telephone, the  methods they use to notify claimants of their work search requirements  and available services vary.", "For eligibility requirements, most of the 39 states explain program  rules over the telephone, most often during the initial call. For  example, UI call center representatives in Washington give initial  claimants information on their responsibility to search for work, the  penalty for failure to do so, the location of the nearest one-stop center,  and the types of services claimants could receive at the one-stop. In  addition, a few states direct telephone claimants to a Web page where  they can find information on work search requirements and how to  certify and file for continuing claims.", "For reemployment services, all 39 states that accept initial claims by  telephone reported that all or most of their telephone filers are  provided information about these services, and approximately two- thirds of the states provide some of this information to their claimants  during the initial call. Telephone filers in over 20 states are also  directed to the one-stop system, through information that is either  provided during the telephone call or sent to claimants later by mail. In  Maryland, for example, officials told us that they inform claimants  about reemployment services during the initial call and provide  directions to the one-stop centers or Employment Service offices.  Additionally, a few states have one-stop staff follow up with claimants  to inform them of available services.", "The 34 states that allow remote filing by Internet also have a variety of  methods for notifying claimants about their work search requirements and  available services.", "For work search requirements, more than three-fourths of these states  reported that such information was available on a Web page that  claimants could access while filing their claims. In over 20 of those  states, individuals were required to go through an Internet page on UI  program rules in order to complete their claims. Some states provided  this information through a link on the Web page but did not require  claimants to access that page at the time they filed their initial claims.", "For reemployment services, all 34 states reported that all or most of  their Internet filers are provided information about these services. Over  three-fourths of those states provide some information to their  claimants during the initial online filing process, although claimants  may or may not be required to view this information to complete the  claim.

Additionally, many  told us that a link to this information is provided but claimants are not  required to access the document in order to complete the claim. In  some states, call center and one-stop staff may also contact claimants  with information on how they may obtain services.

In  Maryland, for example, officials told us that, as part of the claims filing  process, claims center staff inform telephone filers of the work search  requirement and the implications for not meeting it as well as the location  of the Employment Service offices. After the claim is filed, all claimants  are sent mailings that address UI and work search requirements and that  provide directions to the one-stops and Employment Service offices.

Officials in at least 7 of the states that  have established remote filing methods said they had faced challenges in  maintaining the connections between UI claimants and the reemployment  services available to them. For example, some states said that staff  providing reemployment services had less initial contact with job seekers,  who may wait several weeks before seeking out more information about  services available to them. However, officials in almost three-quarters of  the 44 states told us they thought the shift to remote claims either had no  negative impact or had improved their ability to deliver reemployment  services to UI claimants. Officials in some states reported that providing  reemployment services in a remote claims environment proved more  difficult at first. However, once they had completed the transition, they  said they have perceived no negative impact on the linkages between UI  and reemployment services. Officials generally cited benefits that included  improved customer service, more consistent information for claimants,  and the ability of states to focus their resources on providing  reemployment services to claimants.", "Several officials told us that they believed one benefit from the shift to  remote claims was improved customer service.

In addition, some states reported that it was easier  to get information about services to claimants.", "Additionally, some officials told us that they thought the use of remote  claims had helped ensure that claimants received consistent  information. Several states, for example, reported that using scripts for  telephone customer service representatives or screens of information  for Internet filers helps ensure that all claimants are told the same  thing.", "Some states said the transition to remote claims had enabled them to  shift their focus from filing claims to providing services, and had  reduced claims processing time.

In addition, officials in all but one state told us that claimants must meet a  work search requirement in order to remain eligible for benefits. The work  search requirement varies across states but is typically defined in terms of  the number of contacts claimants are required to make with employers. In  about half of the states with a work search requirement, officials told us  claimants subject to this requirement are required to make a specified or  minimum number of job contacts, ranging from one to five contacts per  week. In the rest, the required number of contacts is determined by what  is seen to be reasonable for a particular area or occupation or the  requirement is stated in more general terms.", "Claimants document that they are meeting their state\u2019s work search  requirement in a number of ways, most commonly by keeping a log of  work search activities that may be subject to review or by certifying they  are able and available to work through the process of filing for a  continuing claim. Washington, for example, has recently revised its work  search requirement to be more specific, requiring each week that  claimants make three job contacts, participate in three in-person  reemployment services at a one-stop center, or complete some  combination of the two. Claimants keep a log of these contacts and  activities, which is subject to random review. In Michigan, as in many  states, when claimants call in to the state\u2019s automated telephone system  each week to file for their continuing claims, they must also certify that  they are available for and seeking full-time work. In all states with a work  search requirement, officials told us that the primary consequence faced  by claimants who fail to comply is that they could be denied benefits.  However, the length of time for which benefits are denied, and the extent  to which claimants receive a warning prior to being denied benefits, varies  across states.", "These work registration and work search requirements often serve to link  claimants to reemployment services. The process of registering for work  with the state\u2019s labor exchange, for example, may bring claimants into an  Employment Service office or one-stop center where reemployment  services are delivered. Officials in nearly two-thirds of the 44 states where  claimants are required to register for work told us that coming into an  Employment Service office or one-stop center is either a required part of  the process or one of the options claimants have for completing their  registration. Officials in close to a third of the states with this requirement  told us claimants are automatically registered with the labor exchange  when they file their initial UI claim. In Michigan, for example, most  claimants file their initial claim remotely and may begin the work  registration process remotely as well by placing their resume on the state\u2019s  public online labor exchange. They must come into a one-stop center,  however, to have their resumes validated by one-stop staff in order to  complete the work registration process. In Washington, on the other hand,  claimants who are required to look for work are automatically registered  for work at the same time they file an initial telephone or Internet claim.  Under this system, claimant information is uploaded into the state\u2019s  workforce development management information system and becomes  available to one-stop center staff.", "Some states also use their processes for monitoring compliance with the  work search requirement to direct claimants to reemployment services.

The  level of information varies from suggestions offered on a case-by-case  basis to a discussion of strategies and services that is a standard part of  the interview.

This program, which  began in 1994, offers an interactive, 2-day, 10-hour workshop, addressing  self-assessment, job search resources, resume writing and interviewing  skills, and other community resources available to job seekers. Profiled  claimants selected for the workshop who fail to attend are given one  opportunity to reschedule; after that, their failure to participate is reported  to the UI program and their benefits may be suspended. When claimants  complete the workshop, they are registered with the Maryland Job  Service, they receive an individual employment plan, and the workshop  facilitator may refer them to additional services. Officials told us that  although they currently do not have data to show the impact of this  program, they have received very positive feedback about the quality and  effectiveness of the workshops.", "From our site visits we also learned that some states have developed  additional methods to target reemployment services to particular groups  of UI claimants. For example, one-stop staff in Washington have the ability  to identify various subgroups of claimants using a tracking device called  the Claimant Progress Tool. Officials told us that one-stop staff typically  use this tool to identify claimants who are about 100 days into their claim,  and then contact them for targeted job search assistance and job referrals.  This process was developed to help the state achieve a goal of reducing  the portion of their UI benefits that unemployed workers claim. Georgia\u2019s  state-funded Claimant Assistance Program identifies claimants who are  seen to be ready for employment and requires them to participate in the  same services required of profiled claimants. This program is designed to  help the state achieve its goal of generating savings for the UI Trust Fund.  Claimants meeting this program\u2019s eligibility criteria also have the option of  participating in the Georgia Works program, a recent state initiative to  promote on-the-job training opportunities for UI claimants. Through  Georgia Works, claimants receive 20 hours of on-the-job training weekly  for 8 weeks while continuing to receive their UI benefits.", "States often make use of Labor\u2019s Reemployment Services Grants \u2014  available since 2001 for direct services to UI claimants \u2014 to fund these  services. Officials in the majority of the states we interviewed told us their  states have been using the Reemployment Services Grant funds to hire  staff to provide reemployment services. For example, Maryland state  officials said they use their funds to hire staff for the Early Intervention  program, which has enabled them to run more workshops in areas that  need them and to make further improvements in the program. Some states  have also used these grants to direct reemployment services to claimants  beyond those who have been profiled and to support other enhancements  in the provision of reemployment services to claimants.

Because Labor  lacked the capacity to evaluate services across the broad array of  employment and training programs, it commissioned ADARE to begin to  fill the gap. ADARE is an alliance of 9 state partners\u2014Florida, Georgia,  Maryland, Missouri, Texas, Illinois, Washington, California, and Ohio\u2014that  cover 43 percent of the country\u2019s civilian workforce. ADARE provides  third-party researchers with detailed, longitudinal administrative data  from the 9 states on participants in several programs, including  Employment Service, WIA, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  (TANF), and Perkins Vocational Education, as well as UI wage and benefit  records and education records. ADARE efforts so far have focused largely  on evaluating welfare-to-work programs and WIA. Currently under way is  an effort to examine three facets of UI claimant behavior\u2014repeat claims,  benefit exhaustion, and reemployment profiles. Unfortunately, planned  expansions of the data collection have been slower to implement than  originally anticipated, and some of the data used in ADARE, such as the  WIA performance data, are limited. Having the capacity to link data across  multiple programs within a state is a major leap forward in understanding  UI claimants\u2019 participation in a broad array of programs and to measure  some of their outcomes. But, while the participating states represent a  relatively large proportion of the workforce, they don\u2019t provide a  nationwide perspective.

Most states lack  this information, arguably critical for good program management, often  because data reside in separate systems that cannot be easily linked. In the  new environment created by WIA, where claimants may be served by a  range of programs that go beyond Unemployment Insurance and  Employment Service, it becomes increasingly important to find new ways  to link program data across a broader range of programs.

The  nine-state effort under ADARE to link administrative data on participants  in a range of programs is a step in the right direction, but doesn\u2019t include  information on all services claimants receive. The common measures and  EMILE initiative are steps to provide more comprehensive and complete  information on those served by the one-stops, including unemployment  insurance claimants who come in to the one-stops for services. However,  the present EMILE proposal does not include a link to Unemployment  Insurance administrative data, so it will not be able to provide information  on all UI claimants, only those who receive services through a one-stop. As  such, EMILE cannot be used as a source of information on benefit  duration.
