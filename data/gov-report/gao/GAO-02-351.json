They were intended to provide quality, temporary lodging facilities and service for authorized personnel and to reduce official travel costs for DOD\u2019s mobile military community. DOD\u2019s lodging programs are classified as either permanent- change-of-station (PCS) or temporary duty (TDY). The major differences between PCS and TDY lodges are the number of rooms (fewer PCS rooms); the type of traveler they primarily serve; and their primary source of funding and support. TDY lodging typically receives more appropriated funding than does PCS lodging, which relies primarily upon nonappropriated funds generated from lodge operations. Historically, DOD\u2019s lodging programs have had varying linkages to the department\u2019s morale, welfare, and recreation (MWR) programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD Lodge Program", "paragraphs": ["The assistant secretary of defense for force management policy is responsible for establishing uniform policies for service lodging programs. DOD\u2019s lodging programs are classified as TDY or PCS on the basis of the type of traveler they primarily serve. Table 1 shows the magnitude of DOD\u2019s lodging programs.", "TDY lodges serve mainly individual military or civilian travelers who are temporarily assigned to a duty station other than their home station. In addition, they can serve military personnel and their families who are changing permanent duty stations. On a space available basis, they also serve military retirees and other people authorized by installation commanders. Room rates at these lodges are set at the lowest rate possible to reduce travel costs yet recover authorized nonappropriated fund expenses. While departmental regulations state that the cost of major upgrades and new lodges is expected to be paid with appropriated funds, in recent years some services have added a surcharge to the nightly room rate, which they accumulate and use for lodge construction and major renovation. The revenues from TDY lodging must be maintained in a separate nonappropriated fund account, designated as a lodging or billeting fund, and used only to operate and maintain the lodging facilities. Prior to 1991, Army TDY lodges were part of its MWR program. However, based on a GAO report that found the Army was overcharging TDY travelers to subsidize MWR activities, the Army, in 1991, established a separate lodging fund for TDY lodging revenues.", "PCS lodges primarily serve military personnel or DOD civilians (traveling outside the continental United States) who are changing permanent duty stations and their families. On a reservation basis, PCS lodges can also accommodate families, relatives, and guests of hospitalized military or their families and official guests of the installation as determined by the installation commander. On a space available basis, they can serve other authorized patrons, such as civilian PCS (personnel traveling inside the continental United States); military and civilian TDY personnel; military members not on official travel; military retirees; and relatives and guests of service members assigned to the installation. According to DOD\u2019s current guidance, the military services can choose how they provide PCS lodging services: (1) through a lodging or billeting fund with all of its revenue used to support lodging activities, as do the Air Force, the Army, and the Navy or (2) through an MWR fund as does the Marine Corps. When services are provided through an MWR fund, revenue is deposited into a single MWR installation account and used for the benefit of the local MWR program. The Marine Corps PCS lodging program is currently the only DOD lodging program operating in this manner. The cost of new PCS lodge construction for all the services is paid with nonappropriated funds, but the department\u2019s regulations permit some maintenance and repair to be paid with appropriated funds.", "Because the department allows the services to choose their method of managing PCS lodging, it has two sets of instructions providing guidance on managing lodging operations. One applies to PCS lodges operated as revenue-generating MWR or exchange service activities, and the other applies to all lodges not operated as such. Both sets of instructions implement policy, assign responsibility, and prescribe procedures for operating the lodges. However, the instructions differ in their program goals and authorized patronage, allowing wide latitude in the operation of PCS lodging programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MWR Programs", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s MWR program provides for the physical, cultural, and social needs and the well-being of service members, their families, and eligible civilians by providing an affordable source of goods and services like those available to civilian communities. DOD has determined that these programs are vital to mission accomplishment, are an integral part of the non-pay compensation system, and provide quality-of-life benefits for authorized patrons. The services\u2019 MWR programs\u2014such as gymnasiums, fast food operations, and libraries\u2014are intended to provide a sense of community among patrons in order to make individuals more satisfied with military life and to attract people to military careers.", "MWR programs receive financial support primarily from two sources: nonappropriated funds\u2014generated from profitable business activities such as retail outlets, restaurants, and golf courses\u2014and funds appropriated by Congress. DOD regulations classify MWR activities into three categories, which relate to the degree of appropriated fund support they are expected to receive.", "Category A activities\u2014such as athletic fields, gymnasiums, and libraries\u2014 are considered the most essential to supporting MWR. Such activities promote the physical and mental well-being of the military member, supporting the basic military mission. They are generally not expected to support themselves financially. Accordingly, DOD policy provides that a minimum of 85 percent of total expenditures should come from appropriated funds. The use of nonappropriated funds is limited to specific instances where appropriated funds are prohibited by law or where nonappropriated funds are essential to operate a facility or program.", "Category B activities\u2014such as swimming pools, automotive hobby shops, and child care centers\u2014are closely related, in terms of mission support, to those in Category A. These activities provide, to the extent possible, the community support systems that make DOD installations temporary hometowns for a mobile military population. DOD views these activities as having a limited ability to generate nonappropriated fund support and thus requiring less appropriated support than activities in Category A. The DOD standard for appropriated fund support is a minimum of 65 percent of total expenditures.", "Category C activities\u2014such as golf courses, clubs, and bowling alleys\u2014are revenue-generating activities. Although they may lack the ability to completely sustain themselves, they are expected to generate enough income to cover most of their operating expenses. In many cases, they also generate enough income to help support Category A and B activities. Thus, they may receive limited support from appropriated funds.", "DOD has established separate but similar classifications for its lodging program. TDY lodges are classified as Category A activities and are thus authorized a higher degree of appropriated support. PCS lodges may be classified, at the option of the service, as either Category A or Category C activities. In the past, the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps operated PCS lodges as Category C activities. In these cases, the lodges were part of the services\u2019 MWR programs and lodging revenues were often used to financially support other MWR programs. Currently, the Marine Corps\u2019 lodging program is the only one that still has any significant financial connection with MWR operations. DOD\u2019s proposed change to its PCS lodging policy is intended to sever this last connection and ensure that no PCS lodging revenues are used to support MWR programs. This change, if adopted, would require the services to deposit all PCS lodging revenues into a lodging fund separate from the MWR fund, which would be dedicated to supporting the service\u2019s lodging program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Proposed Policy Change Impacts the Marine Corps\u2019 MWR Program", "paragraphs": ["Except for the Marine Corps, DOD\u2019s proposed policy change will not impact the services\u2019 MWR programs.

Therefore, Corps officials may request a waiver from the policy if it is adopted. However, the Corps has options that could lessen the effect of the policy on both its MWR and lodging programs if necessary. With regard to the Army, prior to October 2000, the Army also used PCS lodging funds to support its MWR program. Presuming adoption of the policy change, the Army took a number of actions to minimize the impact on its MWR program. Therefore, it will no longer be affected by the policy change. However, as part of these provisions, the Army now permits its installations to charge its patrons not on official orders, such as military retirees, a surcharge that can be used by the local installation\u2019s MWR program.

Since 1996 the PCS lodges have reported steadily increasing earnings. For example, in fiscal year 1996 they reported a net profit of about $1.8 million, and by fiscal year 2000, they reported a net profit of about $5.1 million, which was used to operate the lodging program as well as help support MWR programs at the local installations. Marine Corps officials believe that the proposed policy is inappropriate for the Marine Corps, considering its size, decentralized organization, and the manner in which it operates its MWR and its TDY lodging programs. In addition, they believe that the lodges are a good source of future revenue for the MWR programs.", "If these lodging earnings are no longer available to the MWR programs, Marine Corps officials said that they would have to make changes to their MWR programs, such as reducing the quality-of-life services, raising rates, or seeking additional appropriations to compensate for lost revenues. Additionally, they are concerned that some of the lodges will not be able to operate profitably if they are removed from the MWR program. Currently, the MWR program provides the funds needed to expand, renovate, and construct new lodges. Without this support, officials said some installations might not be able to afford to renovate or build new lodges. They were also concerned that the proposed change might result in additional costs for overhead and common support and were unsure whether a separate lodging fund would be able to reimburse the MWR fund for the value of the lodging assets previously financed and built by the MWR fund. For these and other reasons, Marine Corps officials said they may ask for a waiver if the policy is implemented.", "Earnings from what the Marine Corps terms its MWR business activities,including its PCS lodges, help to support a number of MWR programs that cannot support themselves. In fiscal year 2000, the Marines\u2019 MWR business activities at installations that had PCS lodges reported profits of approximately $49 million. (See table 2.)", "Profits shown in table 2 are those reported for installations with PCS lodges before these profits were used to help support local MWR programs that may either collect no revenue, or insufficient revenue, to offset their operating costs (e.g., parks and picnic areas, swimming pools, and child development centers). After this support was provided, the Marine Corps\u2019 MWR program reported profits of about $7.8 million. If the PCS lodging profits of about $5.1 million had been set aside to support only the lodging programs, the MWR would still have earned about $2.7 million more than MWR expenses.", "The impact of losing PCS lodging earnings varies by installation. As a percent of total reported MWR program sales and profits in fiscal year 2000 (see table 2), PCS lodging was 2.1 percent of sales; but 10.4 percent of profits. These PCS profits ranged from a low of 2.1 percent of the total MWR profits at Parris Island, S. C., to as much as 37.4 percent at Camp Butler, Japan. All of the installations in table 2 earned a profit before those profits were used to help support local MWR programs. In addition, all but two of the MWR funds would have had profits remaining (after paying all MWR support costs) even if lodging earnings had not been available to them. The MWR fund at Parris Island, S.C., for example, had a net loss of about $940,000 in fiscal year 2000 after paying all MWR support costs. Without the $67,000 in profits from the PCS lodge, the net loss would have been even greater. The MWR fund at Camp Lejeune, N.C., would also have lost money if lodging earnings were not included. In fiscal year 2000, its net profit was about $68,000 after paying all MWR support costs. Without the $492,000 in PCS lodging profits, the fund would have lost about $424,000 for the year. Camp Lejeune officials said that this loss would have had a significant impact on the quality of life of that Marine community.", "According to Marine Corps officials, the impact of separating PCS lodging funds from the MWR program would be greater than suggested by simply focusing on PCS lodge profits. The officials indicated that removal of the PCS lodging funds would eliminate much needed funding flexibility and the ability to provide advance funding for future activities. Therefore, if the proposed policy is adopted, they said that these installations might have to increase fees or eliminate certain programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options to Compensate Marine Corps MWR Fund for the Loss of Lodging Revenue", "paragraphs": ["The Marine Corps has several options to compensate the MWR fund for the lost PCS lodging revenue. Currently the Marine Corps is not considering any of these options, which suggests that it is likely to request a waiver from the policy if it is adopted. Each of the options for maintaining a healthy MWR operation at each Marine Corps installation would need to be studied to determine which option or which combination would be the most effective. These options include, but would not be limited to, reducing or eliminating some MWR services or increasing the services\u2019 fees;   seeking additional appropriations or reprioritizing existing appropriations;   using the potential reimbursement for the net book value of the lodging assets.", "Marine Corps officials often cited reducing or eliminating MWR services as a possible but undesirable outcome of the policy change, but they did not specify which services would be reduced or eliminated, saying that this would be an individual installation decision. They also discussed the potential need to raise the fees charged for other MWR services used by Marines and their families. These MWR services, especially MWR Category B and C programs, charge varying fees to help support the MWR program. Raising the fees and reducing or eliminating some of these services is an option for the MWR program to offset the loss of lodging revenues.", "A second option available to the Marine Corps would be to seek additional appropriations or to reprioritize them. Depending on how vital the MWR program is to the military mission, DOD regulations permit varying levels of appropriated support. However, as shown in table 3, the Marine Corps provided less appropriated support in fiscal year 2000 than did the other services for Categories A and B MWR programs.", "According to DOD policy, Category A MWR programs (e.g., free professional entertainment and physical fitness programs) are considered most essential in meeting each of the military services\u2019 objectives and have virtually no capacity for generating nonappropriated revenues. DOD guidance specifies that they are to be supported almost entirely with appropriated funds. However, according to DOD data, in fiscal year 2000 Marine Corps appropriations paid 76 percent of Category A expenses compared to an average of about 92 percent by the other military services. (See table 3.) A portion of its lodging earnings helped offset the shortfall.", "Category B MWR programs (e.g., childcare programs and youth activities) are similar to Category A programs in importance to each service but have some revenue-generating capacity. In fiscal year 2000, Marine Corps appropriations paid 52 percent of Category B MWR expenses, compared to approximately 66 percent by the other services. Again, the Marine Corps used a portion of its lodging earnings to help offset the shortfall.", "Category C MWR programs (e.g., golf courses and bowling alleys) have enough revenue-generating capacity to cover most operating expenses and generally receive limited appropriated support.", "Because the Marine Corps has discretion to determine how much of its operations and maintenance appropriations will be used to support MWR activities, it could look for opportunities to allocate a greater portion of these appropriations to support MWR activities at levels closer to those provided by the other services. In fact, Marine Corps officials said they were taking steps to increase the percentage of appropriated support for MWR programs. The Corps also has the option to seek additional appropriations from the Congress to make up for the MWR program\u2019s loss of lodging revenues.", "A third option available to the Marine Corps is to follow a practice recently used by the Army\u2014reimbursing the MWR fund for the value of lodge assets previously held in the MWR program. The Marine Corps estimates the current net book value of its lodging facilities is about $18 million but this could increase as current and planned construction projects are completed. Because most of these assets were built or obtained with MWR funds, the MWR program may be entitled to a reimbursement if the lodging assets are transferred to a separate lodging fund. The Army used this approach when it changed its lodging program to meet the requirements of the proposed policy. In that case, the Army established a multiyear payment schedule to reimburse the MWR program from annual lodging receipts. Such a program in the Marine Corps could provide a source of annual funds to help compensate for lost lodging revenue, at least in the shortterm."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options to Ensure Marine Corps Lodges Will Continue to Operate without MWR Support", "paragraphs": ["The Marine Corps also stated that without continued MWR support, the operations of some of its PCS lodges would be negatively affected.

The options include, but would not be limited to   sharing pooled PCS lodge revenues across all installations and   combining PCS and TDY lodging operations and sharing resources.", "Pooling and sharing of lodging profits across the Marine Corps installations (e.g., creating a centrally managed lodging fund) could help ensure that money is available to meet all installations\u2019 PCS lodging needs, including construction or remodeling needs and additional support costs. Shortfalls at one location could be met with profits from others. The Marine Corps already pools and shares some lodging earnings. For example, each MWR business activity (including the lodges) contributes to a central MWR construction fund, which is shared by all installations.", "Currently, the Marine Corps PCS and TDY lodges (like those of the Navy) are managed and operated by two separate organizations. The Office of the Deputy Commandant, Installations and Logistics manages the Marine Corps\u2019 TDY lodges, and the Marine Corps Community Services manages its PCS lodges.

The proposed new policy change does not address this issue.", "Contrasting PCS and TDY lodging programs, OSD officials pointed out that TDY lodging guidance ensures greater consistency across the services. It requires that the services manage their TDY lodges similar to Category A MWR activities. Such lodges are considered to be mission-sustaining; can receive appropriated funds for major renovations and new lodge construction; and can receive other appropriated support typically provided by the local installation (e.g., for minor repairs and electricity). The goal of this type of lodging program, according to DOD\u2019s guidance, is to provide quality lodging facilities at the lowest possible price to official DOD patrons traveling on orders. This, in turn, reduces the travel costs of operational units, allowing use of appropriated funds for other purposes.", "However, current PCS lodging guidance permits management of lodges as Category A mission-sustaining lodges or as Category C revenue-generating lodges. First, for Category A mission-sustaining PCS lodges, the services follow DOD\u2019s lodging guidance which is similar to guidance followed by TDY lodges. A major difference, however, is that the services must use nonappropriated funds (e.g., from lodging revenues), not appropriated funds, to renovate or build new PCS lodges. The Air Force and Army have combined their TDY and PCS lodging programs and operate them as Category A mission-sustaining activities. While they maintain some distinctions between the two types of lodges (e.g., PCS lodges are designed more for families and generally provide some type of kitchen facilities), lodging rates are kept as low as possible. Further, generally one organization on each installation manages and oversees lodging operations. Revenues in these cases are deposited into a single lodging fund and are used only to support the lodging programs.", "Second, the services MWR program or exchange service can manage PCS lodges as Category C activities. In these cases, DOD\u2019s lodging criteria are completely different. Most notably, they do not designate PCS lodges as mission-sustaining. Rather, they are classified as revenue-generating activities that, with some minor exceptions, should be financially self- supporting. Consequently, they are expected to receive only limited appropriated support. There is also no requirement that lodging rates be kept to the lowest possible price. The Navy and Marine Corps have separate TDY and PCS lodging programs. They manage their TDY programs as the Air Force and Army manage theirs but manage their PCS programs as revenue-generating activities. Each military installation usually has two lodging organizations, each with its own rate structures and funding priorities. The Navy\u2019s PCS lodging revenues go into a separate lodging fund, while Marine Corps revenues go into a single MWR fund. DOD officials said that besides creating an inequitable situation among the services, the variety of operations makes it practically impossible to collect consistent data and analyze the effectiveness of the lodging programs.", "The proposed lodging policy, by itself, will not result in more consistent lodging policies and operations among the services. Although, the proposed policy would prevent the services from operating PCS lodges as Category C MWR activities and require them to deposit lodging revenues into \u201cthe Military Service\u2019s Lodging Fund,\u201d it would not prevent the services\u2019 MWR programs from continuing to manage separate PCS lodging programs. DOD\u2019s May 2, 2001, report, for example, states that the Navy\u2019s PCS program will not be affected by the change because the Navy already deposits PCS lodging revenue into a separate lodging fund. Moreover, if DOD implements the proposed policy, OSD officials said that the Navy and the Marine Corps could choose to continue to operate separate PCS and TDY lodging programs as long as lodging revenues were not used to support MWR programs. Thus, the policy would not necessarily resolve DOD\u2019s concern about the inconsistent management approaches being used by the military services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reduce Lodging Room Rates", "paragraphs": ["OSD officials said, and we confirmed, that there is a relatively large difference in PCS room rates charged by the military services. As shown in table 4 below, the average room rates for fiscal year 2000 ranged from $27 to $55 (actual room rates ranged between $6 and $105 overseas and between $15 and $70 domestically). In these officials\u2019 views, this variation in rates creates an inequitable situation between the services that should be resolved.", "All of the services offer lodging at rates below commercial rates. However, higher lodging room rates in some services increase the appropriations needed to support PCS travelers. PCS travelers and their families  and a large number of TDY travelers stay at PCS lodges. Because these travelers are reimbursed for the actual cost of their rooms, higher rates have a direct impact on the operation and maintenance accounts of their organizational units.", "As shown in table 4, the services have different criteria for establishing PCS room rates. The Air Force uses the same formula as it does for TDY rates. This formula is designed to recover current operating costs and provide sufficient funds to periodically refurbish lodging interiors (e.g., furniture and paint). It also adds a $6 per-night surcharge (included in the room rates shown above), which is collected centrally and used to pay for the expense of renovating existing lodges and building new ones. Theoretically, this process establishes the lowest possible price needed to meet lodging standards. As shown in the footnotes to table 4, the Army has, since October 1, 2001, adopted a similar approach to that of the Air Force in establishing nightly room rates. It now uses, for example, the same type of formula for establishing PCS room rates and charges a $6 per night surcharge to fund the construction and renovation of its lodges.", "The Navy and Marine Corps have greater flexibility to establish lodging rates. Each performs a local market survey and/or attempts to establish rates that are lower than the federal per-diem rate but will allow them to earn at least a 20-or 25-percent profit.", "The proposed policy change does not specifically address lodging rates. There could be some impact on the rates, however, depending on how the services choose to implement the new policy. For example, when the Army implemented the proposed policy, it combined its TDY and PCS lodging programs and began to eliminate distinctions between the two; it set a single rate of $32, which includes the $6 per night surcharge, for both types of lodges. It is not clear at this time how the proposed policy might affect rates charged by the Navy and Marine Corps. As discussed in the previous section, the proposed policy does not specifically require the Navy to combine its TDY and PCS lodging programs, and Navy officials indicated they do not plan to do so."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improve Quality of Lodging Facilities", "paragraphs": ["OSD officials perceived a wide difference in the quality of PCS lodges across the services. They attributed this difference to a number of factors, all related to funding. How the proposed policy will affect some of these issues is unclear.", "First, the inconsistent operating and funding arrangements allowed by DOD\u2019s current lodging guidance allows some services to deposit lodging revenues into a lodging or billeting fund while the Marine Corps deposits revenues into an MWR fund. This creates an inconsistency in how lodging funds can be used. The new policy will eliminate this inconsistency.", "Second, differences exist in how funding is obtained for lodging modernization and new construction. Lodging revenues in the Army and Air Force (which operate their lodges as Category A mission-sustaining activities) must be sufficient to fund current operating expenses, periodic refurbishment of the lodging interiors, major renovations to the building exteriors, and the construction of any new or replacement lodges. However, the formula used by these two services to set lodging rates does not include factors for renovation or new construction. Therefore, the Army and Air Force lodging programs have added a nightly surcharge to their room rates to pay for these types of capital improvements. The Navy and Marine Corps (which operate their lodges as Category C revenue- generating activities) have greater flexibility to set lodging rates to generate additional revenue for capital improvements or other purposes.", "Third, the degree of appropriated support provided at the local installation level (e.g., minor repairs and grounds maintenance) varies greatly. Much depends on other funding priorities at the installation and the installation commander\u2019s interest and support.", "During our work, we stayed at and/or visited 16 of DOD\u2019s 191 installations with PCS lodges, many of which had more than one PCS lodge building. We observed the general quality of the facilities and discussed management and funding issues with local managers. While this small sample does not allow us to project findings to all PCS lodges, our overall impression is that the lodges were generally in good condition. While we noted differences in the quality and age of the buildings and general appearance of the surrounding grounds, most of the interior furnishings were reasonably up to date, and the rooms were clean. Naturally, some of the lodges appeared better than others, but for our small sample, this did not seem to be related to a particular service or method of operation. Rather, it was more a product of the lodges\u2019 age (some were over 50 years old while others had recently been constructed); how recently the interiors had been refurbished (each of the services seemed to have a cyclical refurbishment plan to keep the interiors fresh); whether the exteriors had been adequately maintained or recently renovated; and the degree of support and interest by the local installation commander and his management team. To illustrate this last point, the PCS lodging facilities at Fort Bragg, N. C., appeared to be in very good condition. Local lodging managers said they were lucky because a past installation commander had considered the lodges to be an important quality-of-life issue and made them a priority for funding. Other locations we visited had not benefited from this degree of support.", "The proposed policy will ensure that lodging revenues are used exclusively for lodging purposes, but the extent to which it will change existing conditions and approaches to upkeep and renovation is unclear. All the services already have programs underway to either renovate or build new or replacement lodges. Because DOD\u2019s current guidance does not permit the services to use appropriations to fund PCS lodge construction, they have used different methods to generate needed funds. For example, as shown in table 4 above, the Air Force and Army currently charge $6 per room, per night, which is deposited into centrally managed construction funds and redistributed on a priority basis. Similarly, each Marine Corps lodge deposits 2.5-percent of its annual revenues into a central MWR construction fund, which is redistributed on a priority basis to all MWR programs. The Navy\u2019s PCS lodging program, which is managed centrally by the Navy Exchange Service Command, earns sufficient profits to renovate existing lodges and build new ones. As discussed previously, similar differences also exist with regard to appropriated fund support at the local installation level. Army and Air Force lodges (because they operate as Category A mission-sustaining activities) are authorized to receive appropriated funding for routine maintenance and other types of support. Navy and Marine Corps lodges (because they operate as Category C revenue-generating activities) are also authorized some indirect appropriated support but generally are expected to be self-supporting at most installations.

Therefore, to determine its PCS lodging requirements, the Exchange Service tracks total occupancy rates and other data that indicate whether there is an unmet demand from any of its authorized patrons (e.g., number of people turned away). It then assesses the potential return on investment and prepares long range plans to build new lodges or expand existing ones at the installations with the most need.

Unlike the other services, these profits are used to help support Marine Corps MWR programs at the local installation level. Capital to renovate or build new PCS lodges comes predominately from a MWR construction fund managed centrally at the Marine Corps Community Services\u2019 headquarters at Quantico, Va. This fund receives 2.5 percent of the revenues from all Marine Corps MWR business activities (including the PCS lodges) managed by the Marine Corps Community Services and redistributes them to the activities based on relative priorities and potential return on investment. From fiscal years 1996 through 2000, the Marine Corps PCS lodging programs contributed about $1.2 million to the fund but received MWR program commitments of about $21 million to renovate or build new lodges. According to a Marine Corps lodging official, to determine PCS lodging requirements, the Corps relies on four factors, 1) condition of current facilities, 2) percent of occupancy and the number of reservation requests that could not be filled, 3) return on investment of the planned lodging, and 4) availability of housing in the local area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lodging Guidance and Approach", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s lodging guidance says that PCS lodges are provided specifically for PCS travelers.

This surcharge generated about $100 million from fiscal years 1996 through 2000. Over the last several years, the Air Force has based its PCS construction program on a 1995 contractor report that described the condition of the Air Force\u2019s PCS lodges and recommended a comprehensive program to bring them up to standard. This program involved the construction of lodges at a cost of about $141 million with an additional $224 million in additional requirements not yet funded.

Currently, the Army funds this strategy and any resulting lodge construction and renovation with a $6 per-room, per-night surcharge. Because the Army estimates it will take 32 years to complete the program at this rate, it expects to increase the surcharge incrementally by $1 per year (starting in fiscal year 2003) until it reaches $12.

For this reason, if the proposed policy is adopted and the Marine Corps requests a waiver, we would support a short-term waiver to permit the Marine Corps time to evaluate implementation options. However, we do not believe that a permanent waiver is necessary, considering the reported amount of lodging earnings involved. While the Navy already separates accounting of its lodging fund from its MWR fund, it does not currently plan to create a consolidated lodging fund for both PCS and TDY lodges as seems to be suggested by OSD\u2019s May 2, 2001, report to the Congress.
