This report: (1) assesses how VA's policies for risk management reflect prevailing standards, and (2) evaluates VA's oversight of risk management at VHA medical facilities. GAO compared VA policies to ISC standards; reviewed VA documents; interviewed VA and ISC officials; and assessed risk assessment activities at nine medical centers selected based on factors such as patient and security-incident data and geographical diversity.

ISC was established via executive order to develop security standards and best practices that federal agencies are to follow when developing and conducting risk assessments. As part of this process, VA's policy identifies minimum countermeasures as called for in ISC's standards. In other areas, VA policy only partially adheres or does not adhere to ISC's standards, for example:", "Of the five factors ISC calls for when calculating a facility's security level, VA considers three but does not consider a facility's population and size.", "VA policy does not include performance measures, such as the number of countermeasures in use or the percentage of facility assessments completed; this percentage is a key element of ISC's standards for assessing the effectiveness of an agency's security programs.", "Officials at VA said that its risk management program was developed prior to the ISC standards' being issued in 2013 and that it is up to each agency to determine how to best apply the standards. Nevertheless, VA officials said they are currently reexamining their policies. Until VA reviews its policies in accordance with ISC standards, its approach to risk management may not yield the appropriate security posture needed to adequately protect its medical centers.", "VA's oversight activities for risk management do not encompass key aspects of the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and Circular A-123 from the Office of Management and Budget that require agencies to conduct oversight activities to ensure the accountability and effectiveness of agency programs. VA has an oversight process to ensure that biennial assessments of individual facilities' security are completed. However, VA:", "does not review the quality of medical centers' required risk assessments,", "does not identify whether countermeasures were implemented appropriately by the medical centers, and", "does not collect system-wide data to gain an understanding of physical security issues across medical centers.", "In the absence of a comprehensive VA-wide strategy or guidance that reflects these internal control standards, individual sites have established their own approaches to carrying out VA's risk management policy. For example, the nine sites GAO reviewed conducted their security assessments differently, and none of the assessments indicated that all of the threat categories in VA's policy were reviewed. The lack of a system-wide oversight strategy means that the differences among medical center approaches, along with the security effects of those different approaches, are unknown. Accordingly, VA does not know if its medical centers are adequately protected, and it may be missing opportunities to leverage resources nationally and make better informed, proactive policy decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Department of Veterans Affairs review and revise its risk management policies to reflect prevailing standards, and develop an oversight strategy to assess the effectiveness of risk management programs at VHA facilities.

For example, in 2015, a psychologist was fatally shot  while working at a VA medical clinic. Ensuring physical security for these  medical centers can be complicated because VA has to balance safety  and security with providing an open and welcoming health-care  environment. Furthermore, VA serves a vulnerable population with high  rates of post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse.", "VHA is responsible for physical security at its facilities and has issued  policies and standards that the facilities must follow when assessing  physical security risks. To fulfill this responsibility, VHA conducts a range  of activities such as performing risk assessments, implementing  countermeasures designed to minimize risks, and providing law  enforcement services through VA police departments. To help agencies  such as VA with their physical security, the Interagency Security  Committee (ISC) issued standards for risk management of federal  facilities, and agencies are supposed to follow the standards.", "You asked us to examine how VA ensures it is providing a secure  environment at VHA facilities.

This process included reviewing the Risk Management  Process for Federal Facilities (ISC Standard) for assessing physical  security and providing recommended countermeasures at federal  facilities. To assess VA\u2019s oversight of risk management of physical  security at VHA facilities, we identified and examined oversight and  management mechanisms at the national, regional, and local levels,  including reporting mechanisms that prioritize or track facility risks or the  implementation of countermeasures at VHA facilities. We also reviewed  VA\u2019s oversight activities against Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, because internal controls play a significant role in  helping agencies achieve their mission-related responsibilities using  proper oversight mechanisms. In addition, we reviewed VHA police  responsibilities for physical security and law enforcement, including  conducting risk assessments and identifying needed countermeasures.", "As part of our review, we selected nine VHA medical centers to include a  range of patient volumes, rates of security incidents per patient, and  locations, among other considerations. For each of these medical  centers, we assessed the most recent physical security documents and risk  reviewed the data and reporting mechanisms used to prioritize and  track facility risks and the implementation of countermeasures at VHA  facilities, and  conducted semi-structured interviews with VA police, facility directors,  and union representatives at these medical centers.", "These steps enabled us to identify: (1) the officials\u2019 approach to physical  security, (2) which countermeasures were adopted, and (3) what  additional countermeasures or other efforts, if any, remain to be  implemented. While the results from these nine medical centers are not  generalizable to all VA medical centers, they provide illustrative examples  of how the department\u2019s risk assessment policies are being implemented  as well as a range of perspectives on physical security activities.

For example,  medical centers with large numbers of staff, patients, and visitors may  require more resources for securing the facility compared to smaller  medical centers with fewer people frequenting the facility daily. Some  medical centers are located in densely populated urban areas, while  others are located in non-urban areas, and their security challenges may  differ. For example, facilities in urban areas may be located near busy  public roads, making it more difficult to implement physical security  enhancements such as barriers or setbacks from the street.  Furthermore, some VHA medical centers consist of a single hospital and  others may include a campus with many buildings.  According to VA  officials, these differences can lead to unique security challenges.  Medical centers offer different types of services, which can influence the  types of security required. For example, officials from multiple medical  centers we reviewed told us that emergency rooms and mental health  areas experience high levels of security incidents, requiring additional  security measures in these areas.", "VA specifies various physical security requirements for its medical  centers. These include physical access control systems, security  cameras, silent alarm distress signaling, and perimeter fencing.

As a result, VA may not be considering all the  relevant risk factors that make a facility a more or less desirable target for  threats.", "Identify the facility\u2019s baseline countermeasures: The ISC Standard  calls for baseline countermeasures to vary based on facility\u2019s risk level.  For example, depending on a facility\u2019s security level and the type of  undesirable threat posed, the use of X-ray or magnetometers may be  required to screen visitors. Alternatively, agencies are allowed to create  templates by facility type. That is, an agency can identify the specific risks  posed to particular facility types and customize different sets of  countermeasures that can serve as the baseline for those facility types.", "VA has created templates based on facility types rather than varying its  baseline countermeasures relative to a facility\u2019s risk level, which is  permissible under the ISC Standard.

Agencies may customize the threats they assess to their specific  situations, after having considered the 33 undesirable events.

They told us that officials at the time considered the ISC\u2019s full  list of undesirable events and that these eight threat categories were and  remain the most prevalent in the health care\u2019s operating environment that  represents the majority of VHA facilities. However, officials could not  provide documentation of how their eight categories related to ISC\u2019s  defined undesirable events and why certain undesirable events appear to  be included and others excluded within VA\u2019s policies pertaining to risk  management. By not reviewing all the undesirable events identified by the  ISC, VA may be overlooking some potential threats present at its  facilities.", "Determine necessary countermeasures: ISC calls for agencies to  determine if their baseline countermeasures or templates address a  facility\u2019s established risk level following an assessment. ISC has also  clarified that its standards allow for countermeasures to be customized to  specific facilities and situations. For instance, if the risks from undesirable  events at a specific facility are found to be higher or lower than the level  of protection afforded by the baseline set of countermeasures, the   baseline countermeasures can be changed (up or down) to meet the level  of assessed risk.", "VA policy calls for police at each of VHA\u2019s medical centers to conduct  vulnerability assessments biennially.

This procedure reflects the ISC  Standard that necessary countermeasures be identified at the facility level  by an agency\u2019s security organization.", "However, VA policy does not require recommended countermeasures to  be related to the baselines established in the templates.

The ISC Standard also requires agencies to document  the acceptance of risk in these instances and outline alternative strategies  considered or implemented, and opportunities in the future to implement  needed countermeasures. The ISC Standard notes, in particular, that  risks accepted at the facility level may have a bearing on agency-wide  risk management efforts and therefore documentation of risk acceptance  shall be provided to the headquarters security office.", "As previously discussed, medical center directors are to determine if and  how to implement recommended countermeasures. This reflects the ISC  Standard that information from assessments be forwarded to and used by  decision makers. However, VA policy does not require the documentation  of risk acceptance. That is, VA has no policy requiring its officials to  document the rationale for rejected or deferred countermeasures,  proposed alternative mitigations, and future planning. Without such a  requirement, OSLE does not have full knowledge of the extent of risk  acceptance that has occurred or what alternative countermeasures have  been pursued.", "Measure performance: According to the ISC Standard, agencies are to  assess and document the effectiveness of their security program through  performance measurement and testing. Measures should be based on  agency mission goals and objectives. As examples of performance  measures, the ISC Standard suggests that agencies could track the  number of countermeasures in use or the percentage of facility  assessments completed. Moreover, the ISC Standard states that agency- level leadership must communicate its priority and commitment to  performance measurement and ensure that the physical security  performance measures enhance accountability, prioritize security needs,  and justify investment decisions to maximize available resources.", "VA lacks documented policies or performance measures in place for  assessing the effectiveness of its security program, which does not reflect  the ISC Standard. VA policy outlines that local medical-facility directors at  VHA facilities shall ensure that law enforcement activities (such as  vulnerability assessments) are conducted in a legally and technically  correct manner, but provides no guidance to ensure uniform measures  and processes are being used to assess the performance of security  programs. Without a policy that establishes uniform performance  measures, VA cannot evaluate the effectiveness of physical security  programs being locally implemented across its facilities.", "According to VA officials, VA\u2019s risk management process was developed  before the ISC\u2019s standard for risk management processes was originally  issued in 2013. VA officials we spoke with said as a member of ISC they  utilize it as a forum for exchanging ideas on best practices and  interpreting the standards but it is then up to each agency to determine  how best to apply ISC standards. VA officials said that they are currently  reexamining their policies but have not reached out to the ISC for  assistance. ISC officials told us they are available to act as resource for  any agency requesting aid in developing or reviewing risk management  processes.", "VA cannot assure that the differences between its process and the ISC  Standard are inconsequential to how it identifies and manages risk at  local facilities and across its real property portfolio. According to the ISC  Standard, not using an appropriate risk-management process can result  in facilities that may either have (1) less protection than needed resulting  in inadequate security or (2) more protection than needed resulting in an  unnecessary use of resources. This situation might reduce the availability  of resources that could be applied elsewhere. For example, although all  VHA medical centers have the same mission, variations in location and  physical configuration of a facility may create unique risks or risks that are  relatively higher or lower in some cases than at other VHA facilities with  the same mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Does Not Assess the Effectiveness of Its Risk Management Process", "paragraphs": ["Agencies are expected to manage the effectiveness of program  operations in achieving their missions. A range of federal standards and  guidance assist agencies improve the accountability and effectiveness of  their programs by helping agencies adapt to shifting environments,  evolving demands, changing risks, and new priorities. For example, in  July 2016, OMB updated guidance to establish management\u2019s  responsibilities for enterprise risk management (ERM). ERM is intended  to yield an \u201centerprise-wide,\u201d strategically aligned portfolio view of  organizational challenges that provides better insight about how to most  effectively prioritize resource allocations to ensure successful mission  delivery. More specifically, the guidance discusses both internal control  and ERM and how these fit help together to manage agency risks.  Additionally, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  describes internal control as a process put in place by an entity\u2019s  oversight body, management, and other personnel, a process that  provides reasonable assurance that objectives related to operations,  compliance, and reporting will be achieved, and that serves as the first  line of defense in safeguarding assets. Elements within these standards  include: holding people accountable for their responsibilities, having effective operations that produce intended results in a manner  that minimizes the waste of resources, and using quality information to achieve objectives.", "However, according to OSLE officials, OSLE does not assess program  effectiveness, Instead, officials said that OSLE\u2019s role in overseeing VHA\u2019s  risk management process is limited to reviewing the activities of each  VHA medical center\u2019s police department\u2019s activities. Specifically, as it  relates to the risk assessment process discussed earlier, the OSLE  review focuses on whether (1) vulnerability assessments are completed  within the required time frame (at least every 2 years); (2) annual physical  security surveys that are used to inform the vulnerability assessments are  completed and documented, and (3) intruder detection tests are  completed. The OSLE inspectors may also spot-check specific areas to  determine whether physical security measures that are in place meet  VA\u2019s standards. The areas checked are at their discretion and not  identified in policy. Findings from these inspections, including any  deficiencies identified in physical security, are reported to the medical  center director for action.", "According to OSLE officials, they do not have any authority to ensure  deficiencies are corrected and thus generally do not follow up on the  status of their findings prior to the next inspection. Although the results of  these inspections are stored by OSLE, we did not find that it uses them to  identify trends in security deficiencies or track medical centers\u2019 risk levels.", "OSLE does not assess the medical center\u2019s compliance with VA\u2019s overall  risk management process, the extent to which recommended security  measures have been implemented, or decisions not to implement security  recommendations. Furthermore, OSLE does not collect data that would  allow it to know what security deficiencies have been identified across all  VHA facilities and the status of recommended countermeasures. Because  VHA lacks an oversight strategy that includes these elements, it cannot  begin to assess the effectiveness of security at its facilities.", "The lack of a system-wide oversight strategy is particularly troublesome  given the authority and autonomy of medical center directors to determine  the appropriate physical security measures needed for their facilities. At  the nine medical centers, we found differences in how they implemented  the risk management requirements and countermeasures and in how they  collected security related data. Without a strategy for system-wide  oversight, VA cannot ensure that local physical security-decisions are  based on actual risk, are appropriate to protect the facility, and are  effective, or whether the variations or the security impact of them are  important.", "Implementing VA\u2019s risk management requirements: A key element of  internal controls is having a process in place to hold people accountable  and ensure that the agencies\u2019 policies are being implemented as  intended. While OSLE\u2019s inspections assess whether the vulnerability  assessments were completed, we found that they did not assess the  quality of those assessments or whether they aligned with VA\u2019s policy  requirements. Specifically, we found differences in how the assessments  were done at the nine medical centers we reviewed and that some were  not consistently reviewing the full range of threats required by VA policy.  For example, none of the vulnerability assessments we reviewed included  documentation that all eight of VA\u2019s threat categories were reviewed, and  at three locations, no threat categories were documented as reviewed in  the assessments. Additionally, in some instances, VA police assessed  different threat categories than the required 8 categories. OSLE officials  told us that local VHA police have the discretion to review any threats  they perceive relevant to their facility; however, they reported that this  should be done in addition to the eight threat categories identified in VA  guidance. In a decentralized environment such as VA\u2019s, there may be  greater risk that VA police will inconsistently apply VA\u2019s risk management  process. Furthermore, as discussed earlier, VA has not established  performance measures, in accordance with ISC standards, for its risk  management process. This, according to the ISC, would help to ensure  accountability, prioritize security needs, and justify investment decisions  to maximize available resources.", "Implementing countermeasures: Internal controls guidance speaks to  having effective operations that produce intended results in a manner that  minimizes the waste of resources. ERM also speaks to the effective and  efficient use of resources. We found wide variation in the progress made  in implementing countermeasures across the nine locations we reviewed.  This variation happens, in part, because of competing priorities and lack  of dedicated physical- security budgets. As a result, medical center  directors make localized decisions about where they spend their  resources. The police force is responsible for identifying appropriate  countermeasures, but it is then up to the medical center directors and the  managers in the areas for which deficiencies have been identified to  implement the corrective actions. All of the medical center directors we  interviewed reported weighing decisions to fund infrastructure deficiencies  affecting healthcare delivery versus funding physical security projects. For  example, one acting director told us that the center needs to repair a  leaking roof in its hospice care unit. The director told us that this project,  which uses funding from the same pool of money as physical security  projects, will be prioritized because it directly impacts the quality of patient  care.", "Officials at the sites we reviewed described varying levels of commitment  from medical center directors to prioritize physical security infrastructure  projects. Officials at one site said that they currently have difficulty getting  the resources they request to implement security countermeasures, but  that the same had not been the case at previous medical centers where  they worked. Specifically, one official noted that it can be difficult to  convince a medical center director to fund security measures designed to  protect the site from situations that have not yet occurred, such as  countermeasures to improve perimeter security or increase standoff  distance for critical areas, which are important parts of prevention for  active-shooter type scenarios.", "One of the key countermeasures medical centers use for physical  security is the police force. We noted variations in police staffing at the  nine locations we studied. VA policy sets a minimum level for the number  of VA police officers who must be on patrol at any given time if certain  conditions are met. Some local VHA officials we spoke with said they  need to staff above this level because following the minimum staffing  level can be problematic when officers are needed to respond to multiple  incidents at the same time, such as escorting one patient and responding  to a disruptive patient in a different wing of the hospital, officials stated.  Officials noted that incidents can be the driving factor for changes. One  site we reviewed increased their police presence in the emergency room,  in response to a stabbing incident that occurred there.", "The critical role that police play at these medical centers can be adversely  affected, however, because of challenges related to recruiting and  retaining law enforcement personnel. All sites we reviewed reported hiring  vacancies in their departments, and multiple sites discussed challenges in  maintaining any police at the recommended level at their facilities,  hindering the ability of the police to respond to multiple incidents. As  further described in appendix II, each VHA medical center police force is  managed locally, under the control of the medical center director.", "We also found varying levels of security provided by VA medical centers  for their community based outpatient clinics. VA policy does not require a  permanent security presence at the community-based outpatient clinics,  and medical centers may rely on local police to respond to security  incidents. However, some sites we reviewed use contract guards to  provide a security presence at outpatient clinic locations, and one site  reported completing an effort to staff VA police officers at each of the  outpatient clinics under the medical center director\u2019s authority. In the  absence of system-wide oversight strategy, VA does not know if these  variations in countermeasures are resulting in different levels of security,  which may leave some facilities at risk and not be the most strategic use  of resources at other facilities.", "Tracking security deficiencies: The availability of reliable data is  essential for assessing the effectiveness of policies and programs and for  allowing managers to make sound decisions. In the absence of a VHA- wide strategy and guidance about how to collect data or track  deficiencies, individual sites have established their own processes for  tracking the status of identified security deficiencies. For example, one of  the medical centers in our review reported 15 deficiencies resulting from  its assessment, whereas another medical center reported over 540  deficiencies. In reviewing the data further, we found that the numbers  may be misleading as to the extent of security concerns, because of the  different ways in which the findings were reported. For example, in  reporting the results of inspections of information telecommunication and  data closets, one location identified a recurring deficiency as one issue,  where another location identified a similar deficiency in each closet they  inspected resulting in over 200 identified deficiencies. A system-wide  oversight strategy could help VA identify what information is needed to  assess the effectiveness of its security programs and the impact of  varying practices at its facilities.", "In the past, VA collected system wide information and tracked physical  security across medical centers. When VA first started conducting  vulnerability assessments in 2010, the assessments were done by a  central team directed by OSLE, and the findings were tracked in a central  database. In addition, a work group tracked how facilities were meeting  VA\u2019s standards and requirements and which countermeasures were  getting prioritized and implemented. However, VA officials told us that this  database crashed and that the information is no longer accessible.  Moreover, the central team was dissolved, and medical center directors  became fully responsible for ensuring that vulnerability assessments were  conducted. The collection or assessment of data also became the  responsibility of local medical centers.", "Although OSLE has no current plans to re-establish a database, in 2015  the Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations  Management identified a need for information about the level of security  at its facilities.

Having a process that incorporates ISC standards is critical to  VA and ensuring that it is positioning itself to appropriately protect its  facilities. However, until VA reviews its policies against the ISC standards  to explore areas where it differs from these standards, it will not be able to  ensure that its approach to risk management will yield and has yielded  the appropriate security posture relative to the different risks faced by its  diverse set of facilities. While not currently required, collaboration with the  ISC would be helpful for the VA as it reexamines its risk management  process. Additionally, the decentralized nature of VA\u2019s organizational  structure can help VHA tailor its programs to local situations. But without  a system-wide oversight process, VA cannot assess the overall  performance of its security program and whether medical centers are  adequately protected. Thus, it may be missing opportunities to leverage  resources nationally, or make informed, proactive policy decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following two recommendations to VA:  The Secretary of VA should, in collaboration with ISC, review and revise  VA\u2019s risk management policies for VHA facilities to ensure VA  incorporates ISC standards, as appropriate.

To help inform  our research, we reviewed reports and documentation on physical  security. For example, we reviewed prior reports from GAO on the  security of federal government facilities and effective program  management, as well as documentation from the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s Interagency Security Committee (ISC), including  physical security standards it has developed by the ISC. Our review  focused on security at medical facilities under the custody control of VHA.", "To determine how VA policies for physical security risk management  reflect key elements of federally established risk management standards,  we assessed how VA\u2019s methodologies reflect ISC\u2019s risk management  standards. This included reviewing the Risk Management Process for  Federal Facilities (the ISC Standard) for assessing physical security and  providing recommended countermeasures at federal facilities. We  obtained and analyzed VA\u2019s facility-security policies and procedures for a  risk management methodology. According to the ISC Standard, agencies\u2019  risk management methodologies should determine facility security level (FSL);  identify facility\u2019s baseline countermeasure;  identify and assess risk; determine necessary countermeasures;  implement protective measures and/or accept risk; and  To assess VA\u2019s oversight of risk management of physical security at VHA  facilities, we identified and examined oversight and management  mechanisms at the national, regional, and local levels, including reporting  mechanisms that prioritize or track facility risks or the implementation of  countermeasures at VHA facilities. We also reviewed Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government because internal controls play  a significant role in helping agencies achieve their mission related  responsibilities using proper oversight mechanisms. To help determine if  VA has established an environment in which it can ensure it is achieving  its objectives, we reviewed agency documentation, such as vulnerability  reports, police inspections, and the tracking reports related to security  countermeasure recommendations at a non-generalizable sample of 9 VA  medical centers. At these locations, we also conducted semi-structured  interviews with facility management, VA police, and union representatives  to identify the officials\u2019 approach to physical security. Our findings from  our review of the selected medical centers are not generalizable to all  VHA facilities, but provide insight into and illustrative examples about risk- management and oversight methodologies at selected facilities.", "We selected these sites based on a mix of criteria that included: (1)  geographic location, including medical centers in various Veteran  Integrated Service Networks (VISN), and in cities of different sizes; (2)  patient volume, including medical centers with a mix of different levels of  patient population; (3) reported security incidents, including locations with  high and low levels of reported security incidents ; and (4) patient to  incident ratio, including medical centers with high and low ratios of  incidents per patient, among other considerations. Based on the selection  criteria listed above, the team selected the following nine medical center  locations for our review:  1.  Bedford, MA   2.  Houston, TX   3.  Greater Los Angeles   4.  Bay Pines, FL   5.  Sheridan, WY  6.  Washington, D.C.  7.  Puget Sound, WA  8.  Orlando, FL  9.

Specifically, police officers patrol medical center  campuses in an effort to deter, detect, defend, and respond to threats to  patients and staff. Officers can make arrests for violations of federal law,  can confiscate drugs, alcohol or other contraband, and can conduct  investigations and collect basic evidence to the extent necessary to  determine whether a crime has been committed. In addition, VA police  officers might respond to incidents involving disruptive patient behavior\u2014 a continual concern for staff at VHA facilities, according to officials from  the sites we spoke with. Staff can alert VA police to such incidents  through means such as duress alarm systems at their facilities, and at  some locations we spoke with, police respond as part of multi-disciplinary  teams that try to de-escalate incidents involving disruptive patients. For  example, police can be on the Disruptive Behavior Committees at their  facilities. These multi-disciplinary committees review incidents involving  disruptive patients and can suggest mitigations for future incidents  including placing a \u201cflag\u201d on a patient\u2019s record. These flags alert staff to  prior concerns with a patient\u2019s behavior and may include instructions for  preventative measures such as a requiring the patient to check in with VA  police when arriving on campus or requiring the patient to have a police  escort while at the facility.", "VA police at some sites included in our review described challenges  officers face when responding to incidents. For example, according to VA  police officials, not all incidents involving disruptive patients constitute a  violation of the law, limiting the ability of a police officer to intervene.  Police officials spoke about trying to de-escalate situations first, before  making arrests or physically intervening in an altercation. Furthermore,  VA police officers are limited in their authority to engage in certain actions  such as pursuing non-federal offenses, investigating crimes off-campus,  and carrying service weapons off campus, officials told us. In addition,  some VA police we spoke with stated that the Assistant U.S. Attorney\u2019s  office is reluctant to prosecute veterans, so the VA police do not have  much leeway or leverage in detaining, arresting or pressing charges  against patients or visitors. For example, according to VA police officials  from one site we spoke with, the Assistant U.S. Attorney declined to  prosecute a stabbing incident. As a result the police had to work with the  local police to recharge the case and go through the state court for  prosecution.", "As a part of the policing role, police have various reporting  responsibilities. For example, police officers are expected to report their  daily operational activity into a computerized database called the VA  Police System that: (1) documents all criminal activity at the medical  centers, (2) records daily incident reporting at each facility in a 24-hour  period, and (3) lists all individuals who come into contact with VA police.  VA police chiefs at each location use this data to generate a localized  Unified Crime Report (UCR) for each campus. Each police chief  maintains his or her own UCR, which can include all incidents reported by  officers, from petty theft to homicide. VA police are to conduct predictive  analysis of crime patterns and adjust patrols or investigative activities  accordingly.", "In addition to recording all activities into the database, VA police are  required to report certain incidents (including incidents that are likely to  result in national media or congressional attention), to the VA\u2019s Integrated  Operations Center through a Serious Incident Report. Police officers are  required to report serious incidents as soon as possible, but no later than  2 hours after awareness of the incident. Reportable incidents include,  among others, sexual or aggravated assaults and VA police-involved  shootings. The Integrated Operations Center staff provides reports and  real-time information on these incidents to the Secretary and the VA  administrators for their awareness; however, the staffers do not conduct  their own investigations into incidents. Officials from the Office of Security  and Law Enforcement told us that they have started pulling together  internal, monthly rollups of law-enforcement-related serious incident  reports. These reports are provided to the VA police chiefs to inform them  of serious incidents and provide situational awareness on law  enforcement and criminal activity happening at VHA medical centers  across the nation. These reports contain law-enforcement sensitive  information and are intended for internal VA police use for crime analysis  specific to VA law enforcement matters affecting VA campuses and are  not to be released to the public or individuals or organizations outside law  enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Police Oversight and Management", "paragraphs": ["The Office of Security and Law Enforcement (OSLE) develops and issues  policies and procedures for physical security, law enforcement, and  training activities for VA police.
