To do this, GAO analyzed documents and interviewed officials from the four OSD offices created as a result of the Reform Act, other DOD offices, the military services, and 11 weapon acquisition programs we chose as case studies. Case study programs were selected based on their development status and interaction with the four OSD offices. Results cannot be generalized to all DOD weapon acquisition programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to implement fundamental Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (Reform Act) provisions, including those for approving acquisition strategies and better monitoring weapon acquisition programs. DOD is also continuing to take additional steps to strengthen policies and capabilities. Some provisions, such as issuing guidance for estimating operating and support costs, are being implemented.", "GAO's analysis of 11 weapon acquisition programs showed the Reform Act has reinforced early attention to requirements, cost and schedule estimates, testing, and reliability. For example, prior to starting development, an independent review team raised concerns about the Ground Combat Vehicle program's many requirements and the risks associated with its 7-year schedule. Subsequently, the Army reduced the number of requirements by about 25 percent and prioritized them, giving contractors more flexibility in designing solutions. In addition, the developmental test and evaluation office--resulting from the Reform Act--used test results to help the Joint Light Tactical Vehicle program develop a more realistic reliability goal and a better approach to reach it.", "While DOD has taken steps to implement most of the fundamental Reform Act provisions, some key efforts to date have been primarily focused on DOD's largest weapon acquisition programs. DOD faces five challenges--organizational capability constraints, the need for additional guidance on cost estimating and Reform Act implementation, the uncertainty about the sufficiency of systems engineering and developmental testing resources, limited dissemination of lessons learned, and cultural barriers between the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the military services--that limit its ability to broaden the Reform Act's influence to more programs. Service officials believe additional guidance is needed to improve their cost estimates and other implementation efforts. They also believe that lessons learned from programs that experience significant cost and schedule increases should be shared more broadly within the acquisition community. These challenges seem straightforward to address, but they may require more resources, which have been difficult to obtain. Ensuring the services have key leaders and staff dedicated to systems engineering and developmental testing activities, such as chief engineers at the service level and technical leads on programs, as well as breaking down cultural barriers are more difficult to address. They will require continued monitoring and attention by the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics, service acquisition executives, and offices established as a result of the Reform Act to address."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DOD develop additional cost estimating and Reform Act implementation guidance; make lessons learned available to the acquisition community; and assess the adequacy of the military services' systems engineering and developmental testing workforce.

Many problems can be traced  to a culture where the military services begin programs with inflexible  requirements, immature technologies, and overly optimistic cost and  schedule estimates. Given pressures to reduce spending across the  government, including DOD, finding ways to prevent or mitigate cost  growth is crucial to U.S. national security. A solid program foundation  using good developmental testing and systems engineering, and reliable  cost estimates is needed in order to help avoid cost overruns and  promote better acquisition outcomes. There have been numerous  attempts in the past to improve DOD acquisition outcomes, including the  Packard Commission and the Goldwater-Nichols Act in the 1980s and  Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994. More recently, Congress  passed the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform Act of 2009 (Reform  Act) to improve the way weapon systems are acquired and avoid cost  and schedule overruns.", "In 2009, the Senate Armed Services Committee asked us to begin  reporting on DOD\u2019s implementation of Reform Act provisions and the  impact the Reform Act has had on weapon acquisition programs. This is  our third report addressing these topics. The first report focused on  DOD\u2019s initial efforts to implement Reform Act provisions for systems  engineering and developmental testing, including the placement of new  offices for these activities within the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (OSD). Our second report examined the challenges the services face as  they try to strengthen systems engineering and developmental testing  activities on weapon acquisition programs.

We  focused our review on the offices\u2019 implementation of four fundamental  Reform Act provisions: developing policy and guidance; approving  acquisition documents; monitoring programs and conducting program  assessments; and developing performance measures. We also analyzed  documentation we collected on selected weapon acquisitions. To  determine the Reform Act\u2019s impact on specific defense acquisition  programs, we chose as case studies, 11 weapon systems at various  points in the development process based on recommendations by OSD  officials and GAO\u2019s previous evaluations of these programs. At the time of  our case study selection, all of the weapon systems in our review had  been given Milestone A approval. This approval allows the programs to  start the technology development phase of the acquisition process. Four  of the 11 weapon systems had not yet received Milestone B approval.  This approval signifies the start of engineering and manufacturing  development activities. We believe these four programs offer the best  insight into how the OSD offices and Reform Act policies are influencing  acquisition strategies. The other seven programs were conducting  engineering and manufacturing development activities or had been given  Milestone C approval to begin production and deployment phase  activities. Each of these programs provided different insights in their  interactions with the OSD offices, but some Reform Act provisions, such  as conducting preliminary design reviews prior to Milestone B, may not  apply to these programs since they were beyond development start.

The SE and CAPE offices existed under other  organizational titles prior to the Reform Act. Staffing levels, following the  Reform Act, remained relatively stable for both of these offices, but some  reorganization was necessary to reflect new Reform Act responsibilities.  The DT&E and PARCA offices were newly established. The key roles and  responsibilities of these four offices as outlined in the Reform Act are  explained below:  Each of the offices has varying levels of interaction with defense  acquisition programs. For example, the SE and DT&E offices have  ongoing interaction with acquisition programs throughout development in  the form of program reviews, working group activities, and other program  meetings. They also coordinate program documents in preparation for  major milestone reviews. CAPE issues guidance to programs on how to  conduct an analysis of alternatives at the beginning of the acquisition  process. The office approves the analysis of alternative study plan that is  developed based on its guidance. It then develops independent cost  estimates for major milestone reviews and in the event that an acquisition  program experiences a Nunn-McCurdy breach.  According to PARCA, it  assesses all major defense acquisition programs at least once per quarter  or when requested by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics, and disseminates this information to senior  leaders. The office also interacts with specific programs if they experience  a Nunn-McCurdy breach.

These four areas have been common sources of problems in the past.  For example, the services typically started new weapon acquisition  programs with requirements that were both demanding and inflexible and  planned to use relatively unproven technologies to meet the  requirements\u2014all of which increased program risks. In addition, cost and  schedule estimates were frequently too optimistic based on the proposed  requirements and technologies. Design problems stemming from rigid  requirements and the use of immature technologies to meet them were  often discovered during testing and fixed late in the development cycle  and resulted in cost increases, performance shortfalls, and schedule  delays. Finally, DOD\u2019s inattention to reliability has resulted in a dramatic  increase in the number of systems that have not met suitability  requirements during operational testing. Deficiencies\u2014such as high  failure rates and disappointing improvements in the reliability, availability,  and maintainability of weapon systems\u2014have limited program  performance and increased operation and support costs.

The Reform Act also charges the Joint Requirements  Oversight Council with the responsibility to ensure that cost, schedule,  and performance trade-offs for joint military requirements are considered,  and to include combatant commanders in the process to ensure the  user\u2019s needs are adequately satisfied. The offices established as a result  of the Reform Act have helped programs, such as the Joint Light Tactical  Vehicle and Ground Combat Vehicle, make trade-offs among cost,  schedule, and technical performance requirements.

For example, the  cost analysis improvement group, which was the predecessor to  CAPE, led a multi-functional joint estimating team review of the  program in 2008. This review found problems with the program\u2019s  funding and schedule. In 2010, the Joint Strike Fighter program  notified Congress that its estimated unit costs had increased by more  than 80 percent since the original Milestone B baseline in 2001. This  increase triggered a Nunn-McCurdy unit cost breach and later  prompted the program executive officer to commission a technical  baseline review of the program to help determine the resources  needed to complete development. Officials from the SE office  participated in this technical review. The CAPE office also did an  independent cost estimate of the program as part of the Nunn- McCurdy certification process.

A reliability growth curve is used to track projected and  actual improvements in reliability over time. The Reform Act further  requires that the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Systems Engineering  develop policies and guidance for the inclusion of provisions relating to  systems engineering and reliability growth in requests for proposals. We  observed evidence of this increased emphasis in the Joint Light Tactical  Vehicle, Remote Minehunting System, Gray Eagle, and Global Hawk  programs.", "Joint Light Tactical Vehicle: The DT&E office helped this program  develop a more realistic reliability growth plan prior to Milestone B.  Based on the performance of prototype vehicles, developmental test  officials determined that the program\u2019s reliability growth curve was  unrealistic. For example, officials reported that the program\u2019s initial  reliability growth plan assumed a starting reliability that was almost 60  percent higher than what had actually been demonstrated during  technology development. It also assumed commonality between the  two vehicle variants, a large reliability increase in a short test time,  and two corrective action periods. The DT&E office recommended  that the program eliminate the vehicle commonality assumption, add  more test miles, and add another corrective action period to its test  plan. It also recommended that the program consider lowering the  vehicle\u2019s reliability requirement. Based on this input, the Army revised  its plan by adding two vehicles and 40,000 more test miles to ensure  reliability is adequately addressed for both variants. With approval of  the user, it also reduced the reliability requirement from 3,600 to 2,400  miles mean time between operational mission failures.", "Remote Minehunting System: The SE office worked with program  officials to improve reliability growth planning, which was found to be  one of the key factors leading to the program\u2019s Nunn McCurdy unit  cost breach in 2009. Before the breach, program officials had not  funded a reliability growth program or established a design for  reliability process. The program had a reliability goal of 150 hours  mean time between failures, but program officials stated that testing  demonstrated a reliability of only about 45 hours. Since the breach,  the program has worked closely with the SE office to establish a  reliability program plan and a growth curve to track reliability  improvements. During the Nunn-McCurdy review, the program  developed a three phase reliability growth program to improve the  program\u2019s subsystems, components, and manufacturing processes  that contributed to poor reliability. According to program officials,  phase one of the reliability growth program was completed in 2011,  and reliability has improved by 40 percent, going from 45 hours mean  time between operational mission failures to 63 hours. Although this  improvement is still below the minimum requirement of 75 hours,  program officials stated that phase two of the reliability growth  program is scheduled to be completed in April 2013 and is projected  to achieve the program\u2019s 75 hour minimum requirement.", "Gray Eagle and Global Hawk: The SE office has worked to improve  reliability across the unmanned aircraft portfolio, including the Gray  Eagle and Global Hawk. Prior to the Gray Eagle\u2019s second low rate  initial production decision in 2011, SE officials raised concerns about  the system\u2019s poor reliability. As a result, the Army was directed to  undertake a reliability improvement program. The Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics approved the  program for low rate initial production, but stressed the need to  improve the operational reliability as quickly as possible. SE officials  worked with program officials to establish a reliability working group,  develop reliability growth curves, and develop a reliability  enhancement management plan. According to SE officials, the Gray  Eagle initially improved the reliability of the aircraft by 15 percent and  the ground control station by 30 percent. According to program  officials, the initial reliability goals were overstated and not needed to  meet the program\u2019s overall operational availability requirement. Based  on initial operational test results in August 2012, the program office is  working with the user to redefine the reliability goals without impacting  the system\u2019s ability to meet its overall operational availability  requirement. According to the PARCA office, these efforts have been  informed by a detailed reliability model that they built in consultation  with the Army. This model showed the relationship between the  aircraft\u2019s reliability and its availability to perform operational missions.  SE officials also found similar reliability problems on the Global Hawk  program and worked with program officials to establish a reliability  growth and improvement plan and reliability growth curves. According  to SE officials, the time between unscheduled maintenance on the  Global Hawk has improved on the order of 50 to 80 percent."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges Exist That Could Limit the Reform Act\u2019s Ability to Influence Systemic Change", "paragraphs": ["While DOD has taken steps to implement most of the fundamental  Reform Act provisions, some key efforts to date have been primarily  focused on DOD\u2019s largest major defense acquisition programs.  Expanding the reach of the Reform Act to bring about systemic change to  DOD\u2019s weapons acquisition process so that it influences all programs,  however, still has challenges. Although senior leaders were receptive to  the Reform Act principles, they identified several challenges that currently  limit DOD\u2019s ability to broaden the Reform Act\u2019s influence. We grouped  these challenges into five general categories: (1) organizational capability  constraints; (2) need for additional guidance on cost estimating and  Reform Act implementation; (3) uncertainty about the sufficiency of  service level systems engineering and developmental testing resources;  (4) limited dissemination of lessons learned; and (5) cultural barriers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Organizational Capability Constraints Make It Difficult to Expand Reform Act\u2019s Impact", "paragraphs": ["Leaders of two of the offices established as a result of the Reform Act told  us that even though they have implemented most of the fundamental  Reform Act provisions, they have had to limit their activities to a portion of  acquisition programs in their portfolios due to resource constraints. Thus,  it is doubtful that they could expand the scope of their activities to include  more weapon acquisition programs at current staffing levels. For  example, the DT&E office has had to be selective in its level of oversight  of acquisition programs because the current staff of around 70  government and contractor personnel cannot adequately cover a portfolio  of over 200 acquisition programs, according to its Deputy Assistant  Secretary. The office has dropped virtually all but the largest programs  from its oversight list and eliminated oversight of some major automated  information systems. CAPE officials estimated that its cost assessment  division would need to double in size in order to meet the Reform Act\u2019s  requirements. However, soon after the Reform Act was enacted,  budgetary constraints limited the expansion of the cost estimating  workforce to about 25 percent of the necessary growth. According to  CAPE officials, its current cost analysis staffing is not adequate to meet  its mission of improving the analytical skills of the defense cost estimating  workforce, issuing policy, and providing sound and unbiased cost and  schedule estimates. The office has delegated its independent cost  estimating responsibility for most major automated information systems to  the military services and some guidance has yet to be issued.", "The SE and PARCA offices are also struggling in some regards. For  example, according to its Deputy Assistant Secretary, the SE office is  continuously challenged to maintain the high caliber, qualified personnel  required to provide assistance to and oversight of its portfolio of over 200  acquisition programs. Further, PARCA officials stated that the availability  of government positions, particularly at the senior executive service level,  continues to be a critical issue for the office. The two divisions within the  PARCA office, the performance assessments division and the root cause  division, do not currently have permanent government personnel at the  senior executive level.

In addition, although not specifically required by the Reform  Act, the CAPE office has not issued guidance for the services to use  when developing Milestone A program cost estimates.  As a result, senior  leaders may not have access to realistic cost estimates prior to Milestone  B for decision making purposes. Military service officials told us they are  particularly interested in getting guidance on data that should be included  in the cost analysis requirements description, which forms the basis for  their cost estimates at Milestones B and C. CAPE officials recognize that,  while some progress has been made, they need to complete the  guidance, but have not been able to dedicate resources to do so.", "Some officials also told us that they find the competitive prototyping and  preliminary design review requirements confusing and would like  guidance on how to implement these requirements. DOD policy requires  the technology development strategy for major defense acquisition  programs to provide for prototypes of the system or, if a system prototype  is not feasible, for prototypes of critical subsystems before Milestone B  approval. However, officials from the Ground Combat Vehicle program  were unclear as to when and what type of prototype to use. From a  broader perspective, other military officials questioned the value of  competitive prototyping as a blanket requirement for all programs,  especially for programs that are using mature technologies, given the  cost. For example, senior acquisition officials questioned the necessity of  spending $400 million on competitive prototyping for the Small Diameter  Bomb II program since the program was aware of problems with one  contractor\u2019s design. However, program officials indicated that competitive  prototyping enabled them to identify design issues early in development  and realize a savings of $1 billion. Officials from the Ground Combat  Vehicle program we spoke with also indicated that they struggled with the  timing of when to hold the program\u2019s preliminary design review and what  type of knowledge was required, since better guidance is needed. The  program plans to hold multiple design reviews prior to Milestone B to  consider contractor and government designs of the weapon system and  then hold another review after Milestone B in order to resolve differences  between the government\u2019s and selected contractor\u2019s preliminary designs.", "We spoke with OSD officials to determine which office should be  providing guidance or assistance to program managers on competitive  prototyping and preliminary design review issues.

The Deputy  Assistant Secretary believes maintaining strong systems engineering  leadership at the service level is essential for tying the systems  engineering community together and promoting good systems  engineering practices throughout each respective service. According to  the DT&E and SE office\u2019s March 2012 joint annual report to the  Congress, the Navy abolished its chief engineer position and while the Air  Force recently began to take steps to relocate the systems engineering  function to the headquarters level, the impact of a recent reorganization  on systems engineering activities is not yet known. In addition, the Deputy  Assistant Secretary for Developmental Test and Evaluation expressed  concern that the military services may not be implementing new  legislation that requires each major defense acquisition program be  supported by a chief developmental tester that oversees developmental  test and evaluation activities. He stated that in some cases one person is  serving as the chief developmental tester across multiple programs  instead of having one person dedicated specifically to each program.  The Deputy Assistant Secretary is trying to determine the extent to which  this practice is occurring and then plans to work with the services to get  more focused leadership for each program.", "It is also unclear whether the services have a sufficient number of  qualified personnel to conduct systems engineering and test and  evaluation activities. The services planned to grow these workforces by  over a combined 5,000 people between fiscal years 2009 and 2015 and  had made progress in growing each of these workforces through fiscal  year 2010.

Last year, we recommended that the  Secretary of Defense report the impact budget cuts were having on the  military service workforce and their ability to meet weapon acquisition  program needs in the areas of developmental testing and systems  engineering. In the DT&E and SE offices\u2019 March 2012 joint annual report  to the Congress, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Systems Engineering  reported that the Army has reduced its systems engineering workforce  growth plan as compared to the plan reported in March 2011 joint annual  report, and that contractor-to-civilian conversions have been suspended.  In addition, the Deputy Assistant Secretary believes a prolonged hiring  freeze in the Air Force could potentially create new experience gaps in  the workforce. The Deputy Assistant Secretary for Developmental Test  and Evaluation did not discuss the impact of budget cuts on the services\u2019  test and evaluation workforce growth plan in the March 2012 joint annual  report to the Congress and neither office reported on whether the  services had an adequate workforce to meet the needs of the current  portfolio of weapon acquisition programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Expanded Use of Lessons Learned Would Help Expand Impact across the Acquisition Portfolio", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not taken full advantage of sharing lessons learned obtained  through root cause analyses of programs that experience Nunn-McCurdy  cost and schedule breaches with the acquisition workforce, particularly  program managers.

On the  other hand, OSD officials believe more assistance is needed, as  evidenced by the high number of programs that have experienced Nunn- McCurdy breaches and poor operational testing results. For example,  since it was established in 2009, the DT&E office has assessed whether  15 programs were ready to begin operational testing. The office  recommended that 5 of the programs\u2014Global Hawk Block 20/30,  Standard Missile 6, Joint Tactical Radio System Handheld Manpack  Small Form (HMS) Rifleman Radio, Joint Tactical Radio System HMS  Manpack, and MQ-1C Gray Eagle\u2014not proceed into operational testing.

This was the case for the KC-46 Tanker  program, where program officials were concerned that additional testing  recommended by the developmental test and evaluation, and operational  testing offices, as part of the integrated test team, could have significant  contractual implications during development. In this case, officials  identified additional flight test opportunities without having to renegotiate  the fixed price contract. However, the additional allotted test time is not  equivalent to the 6 to 8 months the developmental testing office felt  should be added. A similar situation occurred on the Ship to Shore  Connector program. The Navy disagreed with a DT&E office  recommendation to conduct full system testing prior to procuring  additional craft during initial production. The DT&E office believed the  program was high risk because the Ship to Shore Connector was a  complete redesign of a previous system with no reuse of any major  component (engines, gearboxes, hydraulics, command and control  software). Navy officials, however, believe the program is low risk since it  is an evolutionary program and has one critical technology, a fire  suppression system, which has already been sufficiently demonstrated  and qualified through test and evaluation. In addition, the Navy estimated  that it would cost $15 million to revise the existing production schedule to  accommodate the full system testing as recommended by the DT&E  office.

Together, the offices and policy  provisions place more attention on requirements, costs, testing, and  reliability as early as Milestone A. The provisions of the act, when  specifically focused on newer programs, are having a positive impact on  the programs and the acquisition process.

This begins with the services identifying key leaders at  the headquarters level and within program offices to guide systems  engineering and developmental testing efforts and then ensuring that  there are enough trained staff to carry out these activities. OSD will need  to continue monitoring the services\u2019 efforts. It will also require an  environment where the services stop proposing new weapon systems  with inflexible requirements, immature technologies, and cost, schedule,  and funding assumptions that are too optimistic at the start of a program.  Breaking down cultural resistance to change will take more cooperation  between the Under Secretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics  and other OSD offices, and service acquisition executives to address, as  well as continuity of leadership. Efforts by the PARCA office to identify  factors that correlate to good or poor acquisition outcomes, particularly as  it relates to program manager tenure, will be beneficial.
