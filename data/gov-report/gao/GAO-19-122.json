This report examines (1) the potential effects of FPS's placement in selected agencies and (2) steps DHS has taken to assess placement options for FPS. GAO identified five key organizational placement criteria based on prior work and identified eight agencies as potential placement options. The agencies were selected because they have the largest number of law enforcement officers or perform physical security, among other reasons.

For example, keeping FPS in DHS's National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) could provide FPS some benefits because FPS and NPPD have missions that include the protection of infrastructure or specific facilities, facility protection responsibilities, and access to and sharing of information related to national homeland security. However, unlike FPS, NPPD does not perform both physical security and law enforcement activities, which is a potential trade-off. In another example, the General Services Administration (GSA) and the United States Marshals Service (Marshals) could provide benefits because they currently coordinate with FPS on facility protection. However, Marshals does not have a mission or goals that explicitly focus on the protection of infrastructure or facilities and GSA does not perform law enforcement, which are potential trade-offs.", "DHS has not taken key steps to fully assess potential placement options. Specifically, DHS has not assessed the organizational structure of FPS, such as its placement in NPPD, even though FPS and NPPD have evolved since FPS was placed in NPPD in 2010. Standards for Internal Control state that agency management should establish an organizational structure to achieve the agency's objectives and that an effective management practice for attaining this outcome includes periodically evaluating the structure to ensure that it has adapted to changes. Additionally, because DHS did not analyze FPS's current placement in NPPD, DHS does not have a benchmark for comparison to other agencies. DHS recently established a working group to assess the placement of FPS. However, the group's planned activities are limited in several ways. For example, the group's draft charter does not indicate that the working group will describe what DHS expects to achieve by changing FPS's placement. Further, the draft charter does not indicate that the working group will evaluate the benefits and trade-offs of placement options. GAO has previously identified these and other steps as key to successful organizational change or analysis of alternatives. These steps would help DHS address the 2018 legislation to review placement options for FPS\u2014including, how DHS considered the results of GAO's review.

The criteria are relevant to our review of FPS\u2019s  organizational placement as Congress considers whether (or where) to  place FPS in various agencies within or outside it. For each criterion, we  also identified elements (i.e., characteristics) that are specific to FPS  based upon our review of FPS documents and our prior work on topics  related to the criteria, our discussions with federal officials, an association  representing federal law enforcement officers, and a former high-ranking  official in NPPD with knowledge of FPS.", "We applied these key criteria to eight agencies that could be potential  organizational placement options for FPS.

For the last criterion\u2014 mission support\u2014we determined that a selected agency met the criterion  if the agency or its subcomponents have mission support similar to FPS  or could provide mission support that FPS needs. Although we used the  key criteria to assess the eight agencies we selected, the criteria can be  used to assess any potential placement option for FPS. Our analysis is  based on the selected agencies\u2019 operations at the time of our review.", "We also obtained views from stakeholders on the alignment between FPS  and the selected agencies as well as on the potential placement options.  These stakeholders include officials from FPS, the selected agencies, as  well as:  representatives from unions that represents NPPD employees,  including FPS employees, and Protective Security Officers (i.e.,  contract guards);   representatives from associations of federal law enforcement officers  and contract guard companies; officials from selected agencies that coordinate with or use FPS for", "Department of Justice for law enforcement coordination;  Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration  as large users of FPS facility protection; officials from DHS\u2019s Interagency Security Committee, which develops  the security standards for non-military federal facilities; and  staff from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).", "We also obtained views from a former high-ranking official in NPPD with  knowledge of FPS. The results of these interviews are non-generalizable  to all of FPS\u2019s stakeholders but provide useful examples of considerations  related to various placement options.", "We also reviewed Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government for relevant management responsibilities, such as  determining if FPS\u2019s current organizational placement in NPPD is optimal  and effectively achieves the agency\u2019s objectives.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["While its core mission of protecting federal facilities has remained  constant as FPS moved from one agency to another, its responsibilities  have changed. While in GSA\u2019s PBS, FPS was responsible for protecting  GSA held-or\u2013leased facilities, providing both physical security and law  enforcement services. To protect buildings, FPS officers developed  physical security risk assessments, installed security equipment, and  oversaw contract guard services. As a part of its law enforcement  services, among other duties, FPS officers enforced laws and regulations  aimed at protecting federal facilities and the persons in such facilities and  conducted criminal investigations. Following the September 11, 2001  attacks, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 was enacted; it created  DHS and moved FPS from GSA to the new department, effective in  March of 2003. Within DHS at ICE, FPS\u2019s responsibilities grew beyond  solely protecting GSA buildings to include homeland security activities  such as implementing homeland security directives and providing law  enforcement, security, and emergency-response services during natural  disasters and special events.", "In 2009, DHS proposed transferring FPS from ICE to NPPD. In explaining  the proposed transfer in DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget justification to  Congress, DHS noted that this move would allow ICE to focus on its law  enforcement mission of protecting the American people by targeting the  people, money, and materials that support terrorist and criminal activities  relating to our nation\u2019s borders. DHS noted that FPS should reside  within NPPD given that both agencies had responsibilities for  implementing the National Infrastructure Protection Plan. DHS further  noted that FPS would be able to gain synergy by working alongside  NPPD\u2019s Office of Infrastructure Protection and that having FPS and the  Office of Infrastructure Protection in the same organization would further  solidify NPPD as DHS\u2019s lead for critical infrastructure protection. The  fiscal year 2010 DHS appropriations act, which was signed into law on  October 28, 2009, funded FPS under NPPD via revenue and collections  of security fees. While in NPPD, FPS continued to lead physical security  and law enforcement services at GSA-held or GSA-leased facilities and  continued its efforts in homeland security activities.", "Throughout FPS\u2019s different organizational placements in DHS, we have  reported that FPS faces persistent challenges meeting its mission to  protect facilities. In 2003, we designated federal real-property  management as a high-risk area, in part, because of physical security  challenges at federal facilities, such as the need for a risk-based  approach to determining the level of security required. In 2011, we  reported on FPS\u2019s challenges in transferring mission support functions  when transitioning from ICE into NPPD. While FPS has been in NPPD,  we also reported on challenges FPS faced, such as in performing risk  assessments, managing and overseeing contract guards, collaborating  with GSA and the Marshals on facility security, and funding its  operations. We made recommendations to help address these  challenges, and FPS has made progress in addressing some of these  recommendations. For example, FPS (1) developed a Modified  Infrastructure Survey Tool to help it more effectively perform risk  assessments, (2) coordinated with GSA and other agencies to reduce  unnecessary duplication in risk assessments, (3) implemented new  procedures to better manage and oversee contract guards, and (4) as of  September 2018, established a formal agreement with GSA on roles and  responsibilities related to facility protection. However, as we discuss later  in this report, challenges related to other aspects of overseeing contract  guards, collaborating with GSA and Marshals, and funding persist.", "In November 2018, legislation was enacted that could result in FPS  moving for a third time, although the location has not been determined.  This legislation\u2014which reorganizes NPPD to an organization that has a  greater statutory focus on managing cyber risks\u2014requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to, within 90 days after the completion of our  review, determine the appropriate placement for FPS within DHS and  begin transfer of FPS to that entity. If the Secretary determines that  DHS is not an appropriate placement for FPS, the Secretary would be  required to submit to the Director of OMB and Congress an explanation  for the reasons of such a determination\u2014including, among other things,  how DHS considered the results of our current review\u2014and a  recommendation on the appropriate placement of FPS within the  executive branch of the federal government.", "When DHS was established, we identified organizational and  accountability criteria for the department. From this prior work, we  identified key criteria that are relevant to assessing potential placement  options for FPS, as shown in table 2.", "In addition, other practices provide valuable insights for agency officials to  consider when evaluating or implementing a reorganization or  transformation. For example, we have previously reported (1) on key  practices and questions for organizational transformations, mergers and  consolidations, and agency reform efforts and (2) on best practices for the  analyses of alternatives. We reported that organizational  transformations, such as a change in organizational placement, can take  many years to fully implement, can result in reduced productivity and  morale in the short-term, and may require up-front investments.  Therefore, we found that these practices and questions offer valuable  insights for agency officials to consider when evaluating or implementing  a reorganization or transformation. For example, in May 2012, we  reported that a key practice in organizational change is for agency  officials to identify and agree on the specific goals of the change\u2014that is,  what the agency expects to achieve by making the change\u2014or the  problems a change will solve. In July 2003, we reported that  implementing a large-scale organizational transformation requires the  concerted efforts of both leadership and employees to accomplish new  organizational goals. In October 2015, we identified best practices for  analyzing alternatives, such as defining criteria to assess alternatives,  identifying a range of alternatives to assess, and analyzing the benefits  and trade-offs of each alternative."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Moving FPS to Any of the Selected Agencies Evaluated Would Result in Both Benefits and Trade- offs", "paragraphs": ["We found that none of the selected agencies met all the organizational  placement criteria; thus, any of the organizational placement options  could result in both benefits and trade-offs. Officials from FPS and some  of the selected agencies as well as representatives from other  stakeholders we interviewed (e.g., an association of federal law  enforcement officers, a union representing FPS employees, and others)  provided us with examples of how those benefits and trade-offs might  affect FPS.", "In instances where selected agencies met organizational placement  criteria (that is, in instances where selected agencies were similar to  FPS), FPS could experience benefits. See table 3 for a summary of how  selected agencies met and did not meet key organizational placement  criteria, and appendix II and III for additional details. For example, for the  mission, goals, and objectives criterion, DHS, NPPD, and Secret Service  could provide benefits to FPS because, like FPS, their mission or goal  statements as noted in their strategic plans include an explicit focus on  the protection of infrastructure or specific facilities. Also, GSA has a  statutory facility protection mission. Our prior work found that placing an  agency into an organization that has a similar mission may help ensure  that the agency\u2019s mission receives adequate funding, attention, visibility,  and support. For the responsibilities criterion, DHS, CBP, Secret  Service, Justice, and the Marshals could provide benefits to FPS,  because all of these agencies, like FPS, perform both physical security  and law enforcement activities. In the past, FPS faced challenges  ensuring that both these activities were prioritized, according to FPS  officials. Officials explained that a parent agency that is able to focus on  both activities could help ensure equal and adequate attention in both  areas. While there are similarities in responsibilities between FPS and  these agencies, there are differences in the extent to which and for what  purpose these agencies perform the responsibilities, some of which we  discuss following table 3.", "Because none of the agencies met all criteria, placing FPS in any of the  selected agencies would require trade-offs. For example:", "While placing FPS in DHS, NPPD, or the Secret Service may provide  FPS benefits in areas related to mission, responsibilities, and  information sharing, there could be some adverse effect on FPS\u2019s law  enforcement operations or other activities. Specifically, as discussed  above, placement in DHS, NPPD, or the Secret Service could provide  FPS benefits because these agencies have similar missions and  facility protection responsibilities, and have access to and share  information related to national homeland security that FPS needs to  carry out its mission. However, NPPD, for example, does not perform  law enforcement activities. Therefore, according to FPS officials,  FPS\u2019s law enforcement activities may not continue to receive full  attention. Further, keeping FPS in NPPD may not address some of  the challenges related to culture, such as morale issues that,  according to an official from the association of law enforcement  officers, stem in part from FPS not being placed in a law enforcement  organization. If placed in the Secret Service, this agency may not  have the administrative capacity to handle the additional FPS human  capital workload. Secret Service officials told us that they have a  staffing shortage, which is exacerbated by the time it takes to vet  applicants and process new staff through background checks and  security clearances.", "As another example, FPS\u2019s placement in GSA or Marshals could  enhance coordination among these agencies, but there could be  some adverse effect on FPS\u2019s ability to carry out its mission or  responsibilities. Specifically, GSA and Marshals could be appropriate  choices as these agencies currently coordinate with FPS on facility  protection. For GSA\u2019s held or leased facilities, FPS is primarily  responsible for protecting federal employees and visitors in those  facilities while GSA, as the federal government\u2019s landlord, performs  some physical security activities, such as funding and repairing  security fixtures. At federal courthouses, FPS is the primary federal  agency responsible for patrolling and protecting the perimeter while  Marshals is responsible for the security of the federal judiciary and as  such provides for security inside the building. However, we have  found challenges FPS has faced in coordinating with these agencies.  In December 2015, for example, we found that FPS and GSA had not  agreed on a common outcome related to facility protection or the roles  and responsibilities to accomplish their missions. Further, in  September 2011, we reported that FPS and Marshals faced  challenges related to coordination, such as in the implementation of  roles and responsibilities and the use or participation in existing  collaboration mechanisms. In September 2018, NPPD and GSA  signed a memorandum of agreement that, among other things,  describes FPS\u2019s and GSA\u2019s roles and responsibilities, and FPS,  Marshals, and other agencies involved in protecting courthouses (i.e.,  GSA and the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts) are working to  finalize a separate agreement for courthouse security. As these  agreements are implemented, coordination between these agencies  should improve as we have previously reported that establishing clear  roles and responsibilities, in agreements or through other  mechanisms, contribute to effective coordination. In addition,  Marshals may be a good placement option for FPS since both  agencies perform physical security and law enforcement activities,  and because both agencies use a large number of contract guards.  However, because FPS does not share mission and goals with  Marshals, it may be less equipped to prioritize FPS\u2019s activities in the  law enforcement and physical security areas. Justice and Marshals  officials said that, in their view, Marshals is different from FPS  because Justice and Marshals perform limited physical security  activities and have an extensive law enforcement mission, while the  opposite is the case for FPS. Further, Marshals officials said that  FPS\u2019s and Marshal\u2019s law enforcement activities support different  purposes\u2014with Marshals supporting a violent-crime reduction mission  and FPS supporting a facility protection mission. As a result, Marshals  officials said that FPS\u2019s facility protection mission may not receive full  attention. Regarding contract guards, Marshal\u2019s guard force is  smaller, performs different activities, and has different requirements  compared to FPS\u2019s guard force. Regarding GSA, while GSA performs  some physical security activities, it does not perform law enforcement,  which is a critical part of FPS\u2019s responsibilities and, according to some  stakeholders we interviewed, a key aspect of FPS\u2019s culture. GSA also  does not have the same access to information related to national  homeland security as FPS currently has, and therefore, FPS\u2019s access  to this information could be affected, according to officials.", "Finally, various placement options could help FPS address some of its  long-standing challenges such as in overseeing contract guards,  collaborating with GSA and the Marshals, and funding. However,  these placements could also affect whether FPS\u2019s needs are  prioritized. For example, placing FPS in GSA or the Marshals may  further help address coordination challenges. Additionally, placing  FPS in GSA could address challenges FPS faces with funding. If  placed in GSA, GSA and FPS could consider whether to use the  Federal Buildings Fund for security projects related to facility  management, such as installing cameras. OMB staff said that there  are limitations with the Federal Buildings Fund, such as the amount of  funding available for security projects. Further, the adverse effect of  placing FPS in either GSA or the Marshals is that Marshals does not  share mission and goals with FPS and that GSA does not have law  enforcement responsibilities; therefore, these agencies may not  prioritize FPS\u2019s needs.", "For additional information on how the various agencies met each  criterion, see appendixes II and III."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Taken Key Steps to Fully Assess Potential Placement Options", "paragraphs": ["When managing an agency or considering an organizational change,  such as that of FPS\u2019s placement within or outside of DHS, our prior work  has stated that an agency can benefit from periodically evaluating its  organizational structure, identifying what a change is expected to achieve,  and analyzing alternatives. Specifically, Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government states that agency management should  establish an organizational structure to achieve the agency\u2019s objectives.  According to the Standards, an effective management practice for  attaining this outcome includes periodically evaluating the organizational  structure to ensure that it meets its objectives and has adapted to  changes. We have also reported that a key practice in organizational  change is to identify and agree on what a change is expected to achieve  or the problems the change will solve. The process of defining such  expected outcomes can help decision makers reach a shared  understanding of what challenges need to be addressed. Furthermore,  we have reported on best practices for analyzing alternatives to help  ensure that agencies select the option that best meets their needs.  These practices can be applied to a wide range of activities or programs  in which an alternative must be selected from a set of possible options.  The practices include assessing the current environment to provide a  basis for comparison with other alternatives and identifying and assessing  benefits and trade-offs of each alternative.", "However, DHS has not taken key steps to fully assess potential  placement options. Specifically, DHS has not assessed the organizational  structure of FPS, such as its placement in NPPD, even though both have  evolved since FPS was placed in NPPD in 2010. For example, NPPD has  increased its focus on protecting the nation\u2019s cyber infrastructure as  threats in this area have grown, and its funding for this purpose has  increased. In light of these changes, in 2015 and 2016, DHS proposed  that NPPD restructure itself to increase its focus on cybersecurity.  However, the proposals did not include an assessment of FPS\u2019s  organizational placement. The November 2018 legislation gave NPPD a  greater statutory focus on cyber risk and may result in additional changes  to the organization\u2019s activities. Additionally, while in NPPD, FPS also  has been increasingly engaged in providing law enforcement for  homeland security, with the establishment of a rapid protection force of  that can respond to heightened threat situations. Given these changes,  without an assessment, DHS cannot be certain that FPS is currently  placed in an agency that enables FPS to meet its mission.", "Additionally, because DHS did not analyze FPS\u2019s current placement in  NPPD, it does not have a benchmark for comparison to other agencies.   Without such an analysis, it is unclear whether FPS needed to be moved  from NPPD. On one hand, FPS made progress while placed in NPPD in  addressing many of our recommendations, and some stakeholders we  spoke with (officials from DHS and NPPD) said that FPS was in the right  place in NPPD. For example, a DHS official stated that from a resource  perspective there was no good reason to move FPS out of NPPD as the  official had not seen a business case to do so. Additionally, an NPPD  official stated that mission alignment and an opportunity to influence the  national facility-security policy were compelling reasons for FPS to stay in  NPPD. Further, NPPD officials said that FPS was meeting its mission and  objectives. On the other hand, FPS continued to experience challenges in  carrying out its mission in NPPD\u2014such as in overseeing contract guards,  collaborating with GSA and the Marshals, and having adequate funding\u2014 such that questions have been raised as to whether placing FPS in NPPD  was successful.", "DHS has recently initiated an effort to evaluate FPS\u2019s placement, but it  lacks several of the elements for a successful evaluation. Specifically, in  August 2018, DHS, NPPD, and FPS established a working group with a  draft charter with the objective of making a recommendation to the  Secretary of Homeland Security on the organizational placement of FPS  within DHS. The working group\u2019s evaluation criteria for FPS placement  consist of mission, command and control, resources, implementation schedule, and workforce and culture. While establishing this group and  identifying criteria are positive steps in assessing FPS\u2019s placement, the  group\u2019s planned activities are limited in several ways. For example, while  the charter is a draft, it does not indicate that the working group will  describe what changing FPS\u2019s placement is expected to achieve. This  factor is particularly important given that each placement option has its  benefits and trade-offs and that stakeholders\u2019 opinions of the options  varied. Changing FPS\u2019s placement could include: addressing one or more of the key criteria previously discussed in this addressing some or all of the challenges that persist, such as in  collaboration or contract guard oversight; or a combination of both.", "Further, the draft charter does not indicate that the working group will  evaluate agencies outside of DHS or incorporate best practices for  analyzing alternatives, such as evaluating FPS\u2019s current placement in  NPPD and the benefits and trade-offs of placement options. Without  conforming to the best practices, DHS will not have assurance that the  working group recommends the alternative that best meets mission  needs.", "DHS\u2019s current approach to evaluating FPS\u2019s placement limits DHS\u2019s  ability to reliably assess the merits of placement options supported by  GSA and FPS. GSA officials said GSA would take FPS and moving FPS  back to GSA could benefit tenants in federal facilities, strengthen security  support, and reduce redundancies because both agencies have federal  facility protection responsibilities. Further, according to GSA, if  consolidated under GSA, FPS could become more efficient, better  manage costs, and leverage acquisition processes by making use of  GSA\u2019s existing services. FPS officials stated that they prefer FPS to be a  standalone entity that reports directly to DHS leadership. According to  FPS, being a standalone agency in DHS would establish the protection of  federal facilities as a critical mission of DHS and provide FPS with the  direct support of DHS leadership. Further, according to FPS officials,  having this support would better enable them to carry out their mission.  However, neither GSA nor FPS has conducted analyses to support their  preferences, and DHS is not planning to look at options outside of DHS at  this time. As a result, DHS cannot fully assess FPS\u2019s or GSA\u2019s positions.", "Once DHS identifies what it expects to achieve by moving FPS, in line  with key practices for organizational change, and establishes an  evaluation approach that reflects best practices for an analysis of  alternatives, it will be in a position to best assess benefits and trade-offs  previously discussed.

We selected these three agencies because they employed the  largest number of law enforcement officers within DHS. Our selection of  agencies with federal law enforcement officers is relevant because FPS  employs such officers. We selected three options (GSA, NPPD, and a  standalone entity in DHS) because FPS was previously organizationally  placed within GSA, is currently placed in NPPD, and because of FPS\u2019s  preference to be a standalone entity reporting directly to the Deputy  Secretary of DHS. We selected our remaining two options (a standalone  entity within Justice and the Marshals) because the duties of the Marshals  include law enforcement and protection of federal courthouses and  because legislation proposed during our review would have, if enacted,  instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security to recommend the  appropriate placement of FPS within the executive branch of the federal  government.

C. We determined that this  security office is a policy office within DHS\u2019s Management Directorate  with its primary mission being the security of DHS employees and a focus  on expanding internal security policy. For the purposes of our review, we  did not include OCSO as a potential placement option for FPS because  the security office does not have a large number of law enforcement  officers, plans to divest operational security responsibilities, and was not  a previous, current or FPS desired placement.

Furthermore, another difference is that the scope of  facilities that the Secret Service protects is smaller and narrower than  FPS, according to FPS and Secret Service officials. FPS protects  about 9,000 facilities throughout the United States, while Secret  Service\u2019s Uniformed Division\u2014which is responsible for protecting  facilities\u2014protects a limited number of facilities in the National Capital  Region (e.g., the White House, the Vice President\u2019s residence).

As  a part of its law enforcement activities, FPS proactively patrols facilities,  responds to incidents, and conducts criminal investigations, among other  things. FPS also provides additional operational law enforcement support,  at the direction of the Secretary of Homeland Security, to address  emerging threats and homeland security incidents. According to FPS  officials, previous placements have focused on physical security or law  enforcement, but not both. For example, FPS officials told us that  because of ICE\u2019s focus on law enforcement, FPS\u2019s physical security  activities took a backseat to ICE\u2019s law enforcement mission.

We have reported on challenges FPS faces in  overseeing contract guards. For example, in August 2012, we reported  that FPS faced challenges ensuring that contract guards have the  necessary training and certifications.

Further, Marshals officials said that FPS\u2019s and  Marshal\u2019s law enforcement activities support different purposes\u2014with  Marshals supporting a violent-crime reduction mission and FPS  supporting a facility protection mission. As a result, Marshals officials said  that FPS\u2019s facility protection mission may not receive full attention.  Further while FPS performs law enforcement activities relevant to federal  facility protection, the Secret Service performs law enforcement relevant  to protecting key individuals, such as the President. Furthermore,  although GSA does not perform law enforcement activities, GSA officials  said that if FPS moved to GSA, its leadership would provide FPS  organizational support that would enable both FPS\u2019s law enforcement and  physical security activities. FPS officials stated that if FPS moved outside  of DHS, the Secretary of Homeland Security\u2014who is responsible for  protecting the nation\u2014may lose protection responsibilities for federal  facilities as well as the ability to use FPS for law enforcement support  when needed for homeland security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contract Guard Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["Like FPS, Marshals also employs a large number of contract guards for  facility protection.

Finally, FPS offers its  own training courses and has access to DHS\u2019s Federal Law Enforcement  Training Centers (FLETC), and therefore it does not need mission support  from a parent agency in this area.", "In table 14 and subsequent paragraphs, we describe how selected  agencies met the mission support criterion\u2014that is, the selected agencies  that had mission support that FPS needs\u2014areas of consideration if FPS  is placed in those agencies, and how the selected agencies did not meet  the criterion.", "Among the agencies we reviewed, GSA has the infrastructure to support  FPS in its funding approach. FPS officials told us that one of the key  challenges they experienced in ICE was that ICE did not have institutional  knowledge on FPS\u2019s funding approach, particularly FPS\u2019s fee structure,  and FPS experienced changes in fees that were not aligned to what was  needed to cover its efforts. FPS funds its operations by collecting security  fees from federal agencies that use FPS for facility protection. GSA is well  positioned to support FPS\u2019s funding approach because it is the only  agency we reviewed that also collects monies from multiple federal  agencies to support some of its operations. According to documentation  we reviewed and interviews with officials from selected agencies, we  found that among the remaining agencies, some do not collect fees  (NPPD, Secret Service) and others collect fees to support operations, but  not from other federal agencies (DHS, CBP, ICE, Justice, Marshals).", "Further, based on our review of FPS\u2019s fiscal year 2019 budget request to  Congress and our past work, we found that FPS faces challenges in  generating enough revenue to cover its operational costs. If placed in  GSA, GSA and FPS could consider whether to use the Federal Buildings  Fund for security projects related to facility management, such as  installing cameras. OMB staff said that there are limitations with the  Federal Buildings Fund, such as the amount of funding available for  security projects. Further, OMB staff said that finding cost-effective ways  for FPS to carry out its operations will help the agency address its funding  challenges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Human Capital", "paragraphs": ["Any of the selected agencies could provide FPS needed human capital  support. FPS performs some human capital activities, such as estimating  the number of staff it needs to perform its mission but does not have  delegated examining authority that allows it to fill competitive civil service  jobs. NPPD\u2014FPS\u2019s current parent agency\u2014has this authority and is  responsible for recruiting, hiring, and performing other human capital  services on behalf of FPS. All the selected agencies we reviewed have  delegated examining authority. Thus, any one of these agencies could  provide human capital services on behalf of FPS. Officials from three of  the selected agencies\u2014ICE, the Secret Service, and Marshals\u2014said that  they already face challenges with hiring enough staff to fulfill their own  missions or may not have the administrative capacity to handle an  additional human capital workload for FPS. For example, officials from the  Secret Service and Marshals said they have staffing shortages, which  negatively affects their ability to fulfil their missions. The shortage is  exacerbated by the time it takes to vet applicants and process new staff  through background checks and security clearances, according to the  officials. Marshals officials said absorbing FPS would not help the agency  address the staffing shortage because FPS employees perform a  different mission, including a different law enforcement mission, which  require different skill sets, training, etc. Further, Marshals officials said  that given the time it takes to vet its own applicants and process its own  staff, it lacks the administrative capacity to take on a new agency. Finally,  Justice officials said that if FPS moved into Marshals, FPS staff would  require ongoing human resources support for such things as performance  management, payroll, personnel action processing, and benefits  counseling. They said that Marshals is not staffed to assume the full  human capital services required of another agency. Separately, an official  from ICE said that the agency\u2019s human capital office is currently  undergoing a major realignment of service functions and that given FPS\u2019s  large workforce, ICE would not have the administrative capacity to take  on the additional human capital workload for FPS.", "NPPD may experience some gaps in providing some human capital  functions if FPS moved out of NPPD. According to NPPD, FPS provides  NPPD 23 staff positions to help NPPD carry out its human capital  activities. If FPS moved out of NPPD, NPPD staff said that 15 of the  positions could be realigned back to FPS. The remaining 8 positions,  which perform major functions including processing pay and managing  information technology systems for human capital needs, would need to  remain in NPPD if they are not replaced by NPPD. According to NPPD  officials, the human capital teams that perform these functions are  already understaffed and the skillsets for these functions are not plentiful  in the workforce. Thus, if NPPD were unable to retain these positions,  NPPD officials said that there may be significant gaps, such as in  processing pay."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Technology (IT)", "paragraphs": ["FPS\u2019s operational and business-related IT systems and applications  would not be greatly affected by a change in FPS\u2019s organizational  placement because FPS owns many of the systems and applications it  needs to carry out its mission. For example, FPS owns a system to help  agency officials conduct and track facility security assessments and  another system to track law enforcement activities (e.g., tracking  investigative cases and incidents). If FPS\u2019s placement changed, the  agency could take its systems with it, though there may be some  transition or integration costs, according to FPS officials.", "FPS uses some IT systems or applications that it does not own and that  would need some consideration if FPS changed its organizational  placement, particularly if FPS moved outside DHS. For example, FPS  uses ICE\u2019s system for managing financial transactions and ICE\u2019s IT  network. If FPS moved outside of DHS, resources would be needed to  remove FPS from this ICE system and network, according to FPS  officials. GSA and Justice have financial management systems that FPS  could use. Marshals do not have its own financial management but uses  Justice\u2019s system. According to Justice and Marshals officials, Justice\u2019s  financial management system is currently not configured to support the  collection of fees that support operations. Any changes to the  configuration of Justice\u2019s financial management system, such as the  inclusion of FPS\u2019s fee-based collections, would require the approval of  Justice and possibly other Justice components that use the system.

For example, FPS provides training to its  inspectors on physical security activities, such as identifying  countermeasures needed at facilities. FPS officials said that there would  be no efficiency gained in merging FPS and these agencies\u2019 training  programs because FPS performs activities that most other law  enforcement agencies do not perform. NPPD and GSA do not perform  law enforcement activities and therefore do not have law enforcement  training programs. If moved to either of these two agencies, FPS could  continue to use its own training courses.", "Furthermore, CBP, ICE, Secret Service, and Marshals are Federal Law  Enforcement Training Centers (FLETC) Partner Organizations, meaning  that they have access to training provided at FLETC training facilities.  FPS is also currently designated as a FLETC Partner Organization and  therefore would not need to rely on these agencies to obtain this  designation. All Partner Organizations, regardless of whether they are  DHS agencies or not, share the same equal privileges at FLETC,  including priority scheduling for basic and advanced law enforcement  training. Nonetheless, Justice and Marshals officials explained that their  FLETC training curriculum, planning, and structure are vastly different  than other Partner Organizations due to the differing mission sets. NPPD  and GSA are not FLETC Partner Organizations.
