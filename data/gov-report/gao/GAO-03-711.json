For example, it has not identified gaps between the number, skills, and locations of its current workforce and the workforce it will need in the future, and the strategies to fill gaps. Such a workforce plan for TEC could be developed by IRS, the Small Business and Self-Employed Division, and/or TEC. Small Business and Self-Employed Division officials said that TEC does not have a strategic workforce plan because they focused on creating the division and units such as TEC to begin addressing taxpayer needs, and because they first wanted to gain some experience with TEC as a new unit. IRS and the Small Business and Self-Employed Division are creating a process for developing a workforce plan for TEC that in broad terms would incorporate the critical elements common to workforce planning. However, it is not yet clear whether the workforce plan for TEC will be developed and implemented consistent with these critical elements. For example, IRS and the Small Business and Self-Employed Division have not analyzed the skills that the TEC workforce will need to meet its program goals or outlined the process and data to be used to do these analyses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In all federal agencies, employees are their most important asset in  accomplishing their missions and achieving their goals. The Government  Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) calls for agencies and their  operating divisions to address human capital in the context of  performance management and requires annual performance plans to  describe how agencies will use resources to accomplish their strategic  direction and program goals. As part of human capital management,  strategic workforce planning helps ensure that organizations have the  right number of staff with the right skills and competencies in the right  locations to fulfill their goals both now and in the future given the  strategies they have adopted to carry out their missions.", "Certain critical elements are common in workforce plans and planning  processes across leading private and public organizations: (1) involving  top management and employees in developing and implementing a  workforce plan, (2) analyzing gaps between the workforce that exists  currently and that will be needed in the future, (3) devising strategies (e.g.,  hiring or training) to fill workforce gaps, and (4) evaluating the strategies  to ensure that they yield the workforce needed and to make revisions as  necessary.", "In an August 2002 report, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax  Administration (TIGTA) voiced specific concerns that the Internal  Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) workforce planning documents do not focus on  long-term planning. IRS has assumed overall responsibility for developing  an IRS-wide workforce plan, which its divisions and units are to support  and can supplement with more detailed plans.", "Within IRS, the Taxpayer Education and Communication (TEC) unit in the  Small Business and Self-Employed Division (SB/SE) were both created in  October 2000 during IRS\u2019s reorganization. TEC is to serve about 45 million  small businesses and self-employed taxpayers primarily through efforts to  better educate them about their tax obligations. Although the other two  units in SB/SE combined many organizations and functions that had  existed prior to IRS\u2019s reorganization, TEC was a new unit with new or  expanded responsibilities. TEC was to have over 1,200 staff by fiscal year  2002 in 15 major field locations and an annual budget of over $60 million.  Since its inception, TEC has (1) not reached its staffing level (it had 718  staff as of March 2003), (2) reduced the number of major field locations to  7, and (3) added priorities and strategies for providing education and  outreach to SB/SE taxpayers.", "Because TEC serves many taxpayers and has had the above changes, you  asked us to determine whether TEC has a workforce plan that conforms to  the critical elements for what should be in a plan and how the plan should  be developed and implemented. To do so, we interviewed IRS officials and  reviewed IRS workforce planning documents, reviewed guidance by  central management agencies such as the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on the critical  elements of workforce planning, and reviewed our reports on human  capital management. We did not evaluate the adequacy of TEC\u2019s program  goals (or operational priorities)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["SB/SE was formed to address various issues affecting small business and  self-employed taxpayers, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes.  SB/SE\u2019s strategic goals include increasing compliance and also reducing  burden among SB/SE taxpayers. As part of SB/SE, TEC is to use various  strategies, including providing education, outreach, assistance, and other  services, to support SB/SE taxpayers in understanding and complying with  tax laws. IRS created TEC in response to concerns that IRS should better  balance such services with its enforcement efforts.", "In serving taxpayers, TEC is to partner with government agencies, small  business groups, tax practitioner groups, and other stakeholders that  could advance its education and outreach efforts. To meet an overall goal  of increasing voluntary compliance, TEC\u2019s four program goals or priorities  are to combat abusive tax schemes, reduce taxpayer burden, promote  electronic filing, and negotiate agreements with SB/SE taxpayers on  specific ways to voluntarily comply with tax laws.", "Recent events underscore the importance of human capital management  and strategic workforce planning. For example, we designated strategic  human capital management as a governmentwide, high-risk area in  January 2001, and it was also placed at the top of the President\u2019s  Management Agenda in August 2001.

Agency  approaches to workforce planning can vary with their particular needs and  missions. Nevertheless, looking across existing successful public and  private organizations, certain critical elements recur as part of a  workforce plan and workforce planning process. Although fluid, this  process starts with setting a strategic direction that includes program  goals and strategies to achieve those goals and flows through the critical  elements to evaluating the workforce plan. Figure 1 uses a simple model to  show these critical elements and their relationships to the agency\u2019s overall  strategic direction and goals.", "Before developing a workforce plan, an agency first needs to set a  strategic direction and program goals. Setting a strategic direction and  program goals is part of the general performance management principles  that Congress expects agencies to follow under GPRA. A workforce plan  should be developed and implemented to help fulfill the strategic direction  and program goals. The critical elements of what this plan should include  and how it should be developed follow.", "Involvement of management and employees: Involving various staff  (from the top to the bottom) cuts across the other critical  elements. Involving staff in all phases of workforce planning can  help improve the quality of the plan because staff are directly  involved with the daily operations. Further, vetting proposed  workforce strategies to management and those most affected by  those decisions can build support for the plan and facilitate  obtaining the resources needed to implement the plan and meet  program goals. Establishing a communication strategy that  involves various staff can create shared expectations and a clear  reporting process about the workforce plan.", "Workforce gap analysis: Analyzing whether gaps exist between the  current and future workforce needed to meet program goals is  critical to ensure proper staffing. The workforce plan should assess  these gaps, to the extent practical, in a fact-based manner. The  absence of fact-based analyses can undermine an agency\u2019s efforts  to identify and respond to current and emerging challenges. Thus,  the characteristics of the future workforce should be based on the  specific skills and numbers of staff that will be needed to handle  the expected workload. The analysis of the current workforce  should identify how many staff members have those skills and how  many are likely to remain with the agency over time given  expected losses due to retirement and other attrition. The  workforce gap analyses can help justify budget and staffing  requests by connecting the program goals and strategies with the  budget and staff resources needed to accomplish them.", "Workforce strategies to fill the gaps: Developing strategies to  address any identified workforce gaps creates the road map to  move from the current to the future workforce needed to achieve  the program goals. Strategies can involve how the workforce is  acquired, developed and trained, deployed, compensated,  motivated, and retained. Agencies need to know their flexibilities  and authorities when developing the strategies, and to  communicate the strategies to all affected parties.", "Evaluation of and revisions to strategies: Evaluating the results of  the workforce strategies and making any needed revisions helps to  ensure that the strategies work as intended. A key step is  developing performance measures as indicators of success in  attaining human capital goals and program goals, both short- and  long-term.  Periodic measurement and evaluation provides data for  identifying shortfalls and opportunities to revise workforce plans  as necessary. For example, an evaluation may indicate whether  the workforce plan adequately considered barriers to achieving the  goals, such as insufficient resources to hire and train the full  complement of staff identified as necessary by the workforce gap  analysis.", "Across the critical elements of a workforce plan, data collection and  analysis provide fundamental building blocks. Having reliable data is  particularly important to doing the workforce gap analysis. Early  development of the data provides a baseline by which agencies can  identify current workforce problems. Regular updating of the data enables  agencies to plan for improvements, manage changes in the programs and  workforce, and track the effects of changes on achieving program goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of Workforce Planning at IRS", "paragraphs": ["IRS issued an Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) section for internal review  and comment in March 2003, and IRS expects to finalize it in June 2003.

Both types of analyses are needed to  determine the gap between the current TEC workforce and the workforce  needed in the future. Nor is it clear how and when these analyses will be  done.
