EOD forces execute a variety of duties during  operations including countering improvised explosive devices and  collecting and evaluating captured explosive-related enemy materiel.  However, demand for EOD forces is not limited to wartime duties.  According to officials, when not deployed to combat or on combat-related  missions, EOD forces also provide support to civil authorities (referred to  as defense support of civil authorities (DSCA) missions). One of these  DSCA missions is to provide support to agencies that protect U.S.  dignitaries worldwide and foreign dignitaries visiting the United States.  These Very Important Person (VIP) support missions can be manpower-  intensive.

We specifically examined the processes  used to provide EOD forces to VIP support missions to understand the  extent to which these missions entail risk to military preparedness.  Additionally, we discussed these processes with the responsible DOD  officials. We reviewed VIP support missions because, according to  officials, it is the most frequently occurring and manpower-intensive EOD  DSCA mission.

DOD policy also states that a formal  validated process is to be used to determine wartime manpower  requirements. Generally, manpower requirements are the amount of  personnel needed to accomplish a job, mission, or program. Joint  doctrine outlines mission tasks associated with EOD units.

According to  a NORTHCOM official, this rise is due to an increase in the different types  and complexity of threats requiring more EOD personnel to sufficiently  support civil authorities. Figure 3 below illustrates the increase in the  amount of time the EOD forces have spent on VIP support missions.", "The military services have a long-standing practice of providing support to  civil authorities, including EOD support. DOD support to civil authorities is  grounded or reflected in statute and DOD guidance. For example, the  Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976 requires executive  agencies, including DOD, to assist the Secret Service on a temporary  basis in protecting the President, the Vice President and other persons\u2014  such as visiting foreign dignitaries (see fig.4). In addition, the National  Military Strategy and current homeland defense strategy prioritize  defending the homeland and providing support to civil authorities.", "Moreover, DOD guidance addresses DSCA generally as well as specific  support to the Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security, and law  enforcement. Further, the Secretary of Defense approved a Joint Staff  standing execute order (EXORD) which is used to execute routine VIP  support missions related to the protection of dignitaries on short notice.  This order authorizes NORTHCOM to provide EOD support to the Secret  Service and U.S. Department of State within the NORTHCOM area of  operations, and to coordinate that support at locations worldwide. Joint  doctrine for EOD also lists DSCA as one of nine military missions that  EOD forces may directly support, and states that the majority of EOD  DSCA missions will be in support of law enforcement or emergency  support agencies.

According to EOD  officials, this is because the primary mission of EOD forces is to conduct  combat missions in support of combatant commanders and meet  operational plans. Service officials stated that DSCA missions are not  priority missions when it comes to sizing their respective forces, and that  they do not routinely increase EOD manpower in order to provide support  to other federal agencies.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should design control activities to achieve objectives and  respond to risks. Specifically, management should ensure policies and  procedures are relevant and effective in achieving an entity\u2019s objectives.

Specifically,  military preparedness is degraded when the services\u2019 EOD forces are  unable to concurrently complete predeployment tasks, such as training for  combat, because the forces are called upon to execute routine VIP  support missions. Officials told us that EOD forces can only conduct  these VIP support missions during the time period when EOD forces are  scheduled to conduct predeployment tasks and accomplish training. As a  result, according to officials, VIP support missions can deleteriously affect  military preparedness for EOD forces.", "In multiple instances, missions supporting civil authorities have stressed  the Army\u2019s EOD capabilities, resulting in missed training and the inability  to participate in exercises and activities supporting combat-related  missions, according to statements and data provided by the Army.  Furthermore, fulfilling VIP support missions can be particularly difficult  because short-notice demand for EOD teams often exceeds the planned  VIP support demand that can be supported. As a result, Army EOD teams  are sometimes dispatched at the expense of military preparedness for  combat-related missions in support of combatant commands, according  to Army officials. Specific details of the effect recent VIP support missions  have had on the Army\u2019s EOD capabilities are included in our July 2019  restricted report.", "Officials from other services also acknowledged that undertaking routine  VIP support missions comes at the expense of training for combat-related  missions because of the high demand for and limited number of EOD  forces. According to a senior Navy official, that service has sometimes  refused mission requests to protect dignitaries because of its inability to  meet operational demands, such as deployments and training for its EOD  forces and support missions to protect dignitaries simultaneously. When  this occurs, however, NORTHCOM will ask another service to accept the  mission, thereby putting increased demand on that other service\u2019s EOD  forces that, in turn, may conflict with their scheduled training and  preparations for combat missions, according to military service officials.  Because NORTHCOM has few permanently assigned forces to conduct  VIP support missions, it must instead rely on EOD forces from each of the  military services that are in-garrison and preparing for but not currently  deployed to a combat-related mission.", "According to DOD guidance, DOD\u2019s ability to grant Secret Service  requests for support is to be evaluated based on a number of factors, one  of which is the effect on military preparedness. For example, DOD  Directive 3025.18, Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA), specifies  that requests from civil authorities for assistance shall be evaluated for  several factors, including the impact on DOD\u2019s ability to perform its other  primary missions.

Additionally, in the context  of evaluating strategic and military risk during joint planning, combatant  commanders and senior DOD leaders work together to reach a common  understanding of risk, decide what risk is acceptable, and minimize the  effects of accepted risk.

As a result, the  military services are not advising the Joint Staff or NORTHCOM when  these VIP support missions are adversely affecting EOD military  preparedness for combat-related missions. Regarding military  preparedness, the absence of a notification requirement precludes  decision makers from understanding the risk to EOD forces\u2019 ability to  perform their primary mission.
