For example, all states conducted data matches with the Social Security Administration but used other sources to a lesser extent. While states\u0092 implementation of an electronic asset verification system (AVS) was required on a rolling basis beginning in 2009, no state had fully implemented an AVS at the time of GAO\u0092s survey. Among the implementation challenges reported by states were lack of resources and getting financial institutions to participate.

For example, 31 states reported requiring less than 60 months of documentation from applicants and financial institutions. The results of GAO\u0092s survey raise questions about states\u0092 implementation of the DRA, but are not conclusive.

Given the complexities involved, it may be reasonable for states to adhere to a risk-based approach and focus their eligibility determination efforts on applicants who appear to be more likely to have assets or to have transferred assets that would make them ineligible. It is too early to assess the effectiveness of the AVS; its utility will ultimately depend on the breadth of the financial institutions participating and the depth of the information obtained.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) concurred with GAO\u0092s findings and commented that GAO\u0092s comprehensive report will serve as a helpful resource for CMS and other interested parties."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Long-term care, particularly nursing home care, can be costly; in 2010,  the average annual cost for care in a nursing home was about $79,000.  Nearly half of the nation\u2019s $263 billion long-term care expenditures in  2010 were paid by Medicaid, a joint federal-state health care financing  program that covers certain categories of low-income individuals. Long- term care expenditures represent a significant portion of total Medicaid  expenditures, comprising over one-quarter of the total $401 billion spent  in fiscal year 2010. As the number of elderly Americans continues to grow  and more individuals are likely to need long-term care, Medicaid spending  for long-term care services is projected to increase. In light of the  increased demand and associated burden that this places on already  strained federal and state resources, it is important to ensure that only  eligible individuals receive Medicaid coverage for long-term care.", "Individuals applying for Medicaid coverage for long-term care must meet  certain financial and functional eligibility criteria. To meet the financial eligibility criteria, individuals must have assets that fall below established  levels, which vary by state, but are within standards set by the federal  government. Within the Medicaid program, assets have two broad  categories: income, which includes any funds received during a calendar  month that are used or could be used to meet food, clothing, or shelter  needs; and resources, which include anything owned, such as savings  accounts, stocks, or property, that can be converted to cash. Not all  assets are counted in determining financial eligibility for Medicaid. For  example, states generally exclude\u2014within specified limits\u2014the value of  an individual\u2019s primary residence, car, and prepaid burial arrangements.  Additionally, federal law includes provisions to discourage individuals  from artificially impoverishing themselves\u2014for example, by transferring  their assets to certain family members\u2014in order to establish financial  eligibility for Medicaid. Specifically, those who transfer assets for less  than fair market value (FMV) during a specified \u201clook-back\u201d period\u2014a  period of time before application in which an individual\u2019s assets are  reviewed\u2014may be deemed ineligible for Medicaid coverage for long-term  care for a period of time. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), which  was enacted in February 2006, amended certain existing provisions  regarding asset transfers for less than FMV and introduced new  requirements related to financial eligibility for Medicaid coverage for long- term care. For example, the DRA extended the look-back period from   36 months to 60 months for transfers occurring on or after its enactment  and introduced new requirements regarding how certain types of assets,  such as an individual\u2019s home, should be considered when determining  Medicaid eligibility.", "As the day-to-day administrators of the Medicaid program, states are  responsible for assessing applicants\u2019 financial eligibility for Medicaid  coverage for long-term care; that is, determining whether an applicant\u2019s  income and resources are below the state-established standards, and  whether an applicant transferred assets for less than FMV during the  look-back period. Our prior work and the work of others found that the  proportion of applicants deemed to be financially eligible for Medicaid  coverage for long-term care varied both across and within states.", "Given the potential for state variation, you asked us for information on  states\u2019 requirements and practices for assessing the financial eligibility of  individuals applying for Medicaid coverage for long-term care, including  states\u2019 implementation of relevant DRA provisions. In this report, we  provide details on the extent to which states: (1) require individuals to  document assets when applying for Medicaid coverage for long-term  care; (2) obtain information from third parties to verify applicants\u2019 assets;  and (3) obtain information about applicants\u2019 assets that could be used to  implement DRA provisions related to eligibility for Medicaid coverage for  long-term care.", "To address all three objectives, from October 2011 through November  2011, we administered a web-based survey to Medicaid officials from  each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.and precision of our survey questions, we interviewed officials from the  Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that oversees  Medicaid; interviewed Medicaid officials from 3 states; reviewed states\u2019  Medicaid applications for long-term care coverage; and pretested the  survey with Medicaid officials from 3 states. The survey requested  information about the types of documentation, if any, that states require  applicants for Medicaid coverage for long-term care to submit for 13 types  of assets: earned income, unearned income, financial and investment  resources, life insurance, primary residence, real property other than  primary residence, vehicles, annuities, burial contracts and prepaid  funeral arrangements, continuing care retirement community (CCRC)", "To ensure the clarity  entrance fees, life estates, promissory notes or loans, and trusts. In  addition, the survey asked about the number of months of documentation  states required for earned income, unearned income, and financial and  investment resources. The survey also asked about states\u2019 practices to  obtain information from third parties to verify applicants\u2019 assets, such as  whether, and to what extent, states conduct data matches with   10 sources, including the Social Security Administration and the Internal  Revenue Service, which primarily allow states to verify applicants\u2019  income. Finally, the survey asked about any additional documentation  states require or additional steps states take to determine whether  applicants transferred assets for less than FMV during the 60-month look- back period. We received survey responses from officials from all   51 states, although not every official responded to every question. We  relied on the data as reported by the state officials who were identified as  the primary contact for states\u2019 documentation requirements and practices  for verifying the financial eligibility of applicants for Medicaid coverage for  long-term care. We did not independently verify these data; however, we  reviewed all responses for reasonableness and internal consistency, and  followed up with state officials for clarification where necessary. On the  basis of these activities, we determined these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our report. In addition to administering a  survey, we collected states\u2019 application forms for Medicaid coverage for  long-term care to assess the types of asset information asked about on  the applications. Finally, we interviewed CMS officials about federal  requirements related to eligibility determinations for Medicaid coverage  for long-term care, including the DRA provisions.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2011 to July 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

To be eligible for  Medicaid coverage for long-term care, individuals must be within certain  eligibility categories\u2014such as those that are aged or disabled\u2014and meet  functional and financial criteria. Within broad federal standards, states  determine whether an individual meets the functional criteria for long-term  care coverage by assessing an individual\u2019s ability to carry out activities of  daily living (ADL), such as eating and getting around the house; and  instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), such as preparing meals and  shopping for groceries.

Income is  something received during a calendar month, paid either in cash or in- kind, that is used or could be used to meet food or shelter needs;  resources are cash or real or personal property that are owned that can  be converted to cash and be used for food or shelter. (See table 1 for  examples of different types of income and resources.) In establishing  policy for determining financial eligibility for Medicaid coverage for long- term care, states can decide, within federal standards, which assets are  countable. For example, states may disregard certain types or amounts of  income, and may elect not to count certain resources. In most states, to  be financially eligible for Medicaid coverage for long-term care, individuals  must have $2,000 or less in countable resources ($3,000 for a married  couple).", "Federal law limits Medicaid payment for long-term care services for  persons who divest themselves of\u2014or \u201ctransfer\u201d\u2014their assets for less  than FMV within a specified time period. As a result, when an individual  applies for Medicaid coverage for long-term care, states conduct a  review, or \u201clook back,\u201d to determine whether the applicant (or his or her  spouse, if married) transferred assets to another person or party. If the  state determines an applicant transferred an asset for less than FMV  during the look-back period, the individual may be ineligible for Medicaid  coverage for long-term care for a period of time, called the penalty period.  The DRA extended the look-back period for transfers made on or after  February 8, 2006, to 60 months; prior to that, it was generally   36 months.", "The DRA also specified circumstances under which the purchase of  certain assets\u2014such as an annuity, promissory note or loan, or life  estate\u2014is considered a transfer for less than FMV, and when entrance  fees for CCRCs are countable for purposes of determining Medicaid  eligibility. Additionally, while an individual\u2019s primary residence is generally  not a countable resource for determining Medicaid eligibility, the DRA  specified when an individual with substantial equity interest in his or her  home is to be excluded from eligibility for Medicaid payment for long-term  care; the amount of allowable equity interest is established by each state  within federal guidelines.

State Medicaid programs may also obtain information from third parties,  such as financial institutions or other government agencies, such as the  Social Security Administration. Such information helps states verify the  accuracy of applicants\u2019 reported assets, as well as determine whether  applicants have assets they failed to report or transferred for less than  FMV during the look-back period. The processing of Medicaid  applications\u2014including the collection of documentation and information  from applicants and third parties\u2014is generally performed by local or  county-based eligibility workers.", "In 2008, Congress passed legislation that required states to implement  electronic asset verification systems (AVS) to verify the assets of aged,  blind, or disabled applicants for Medicaid, including those seeking  Medicaid coverage for long-term care, with financial institutions. An AVS  would provide states with an electronic mechanism to contact multiple  financial institutions, including those not reported by an applicant, to  determine if an applicant has, or had, an account and the value of any  existing accounts. The law provides for states\u2019 implementation of these  systems to occur on a rolling basis; the first systems were to be  implemented by the end of fiscal year 2009, with all states implementing  systems by the end of fiscal year 2013.

On the basis of our survey results, most states\u201446 of   51\u2014reported requiring applicants to provide documentation of CCRC  or life care community entrance fees, such as a copy of the contract  or agreement. Thus, these states should have sufficient information to  determine if, under the DRA, an applicant\u2019s entrance fees should be  countable resources for determining Medicaid eligibility. However, it is  unclear how the remaining 5 states would be able to determine if an  applicant has paid such fees, and whether they should be counted  toward the applicant\u2019s Medicaid long-term care eligibility  determination.", "Promissory Notes. Fifty states reported on our survey that they  require applicants to provide documentation of promissory notes or  loans; such documentation should allow the state to determine if a  note meets the requirements specified in the DRA, such as providing  for payments to be made in equal installments throughout the course  of the loan, or if a note should be treated as a transfer of assets for  less than FMV.", "Annuities. In responding to our survey, all states reported requiring  documentation of annuities and thus should have sufficient  information to determine whether an annuity should be considered a  transfer of assets for less than FMV under the DRA. Additionally, our  review of 49 states\u2019 long-term care application forms found that   45 required the disclosure of any interest the applicant or spouse has  in an annuity and 27 contained statements regarding the state  becoming a remainder beneficiary of such annuities. (See app. VIII.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["As the demand for long-term care services increases and federal and  state resources continue to be strained, it is important to ensure that only  eligible individuals receive Medicaid coverage for long-term care. Since  each state is responsible for day-to-day implementation of its Medicaid  program, variation in policies and practices for determining financial  eligibility is expected. However, some of the variation we found may raise  questions regarding how states determine Medicaid eligibility for long- term care and enforce certain provisions of the DRA.", "States must balance the costs of eligibility determination efforts with the  need to ensure that those efforts provide sufficient information to  implement federal requirements. While third-party verification of  applicants\u2019 financial information likely provides states with the best  assurance of having a complete picture of an applicant\u2019s financial status,  it can be a complex and costly process that requires a significant amount  of information and review. Given the complexities involved, it may be  reasonable for states to adhere to a risk-based approach and focus their  eligibility determination efforts on applicants who appear to be more likely  to have assets or to have transferred assets that would make them  ineligible. The electronic AVS that is required by law may help states  identify some unreported or transferred assets. However, it is too early to  assess its overall effectiveness, which will ultimately depend on the  breadth of the financial institutions participating and the depth of the  information obtained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for its review, and HHS provided  written comments (see app. IX).
