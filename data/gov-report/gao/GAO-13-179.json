The Army's agile process involves seven phases and three decision points to allow officials to quickly evaluate emerging networking technologies to determine if they address capability gaps and can be deployed to the field. However, the network strategy is still evolving and the Army has not yet executed one full cycle of the agile process. The Army's strategy addresses some aspects of cost, technology maturity, security, and readiness, but as implementation is still under way, data for assessing progress are not available at this time. Nevertheless, the Army is beginning to spend billions of dollars netting together dozens of disparate systems to form a network that is intended to enhance warfighter effectiveness and survivability. Specifically, the Army has identified that over $3 billion will be needed each year on an indefinite basis for investments in networking capabilities, potentially making it one of the Army's most costly investments. To help determine that technologies meet prescribed levels of technical maturity, the Army has established a laboratory-based screening process for evaluating technologies, and those that show promise move to evaluations in a realistic environment with soldiers and testers. To help provide security and information assurance, the Army is working with contractors and the National Security Agency to obtain appropriate certifications prior to fielding new networking technologies. Furthermore, the Army is attempting to align the procurement and fielding of networking systems with the relatively fixed schedules for equipping and training units before they are deployed. The challenge will be to ensure that the equipment being sent to the field has been thoroughly demonstrated and that fielding decisions are not made solely to accommodate deployment cycles.", "The overall scope and cost of the Army\u0092s new network strategy, as well as other factors unique to the strategy, present significant risks and challenges and deserve high-level oversight attention by both the Army and the Department of Defense (DOD). For example, the Army wants to field smaller quantities with greater frequency to be able to take advantage of new and improved capabilities as they become available, thus avoiding long-term procurements of outdated technology and potentially helping to realize savings in development, testing, and maintenance costs. However, the Army is still weighing funding and contracting options that would allow it to accomplish this goal while adhering to established acquisition and budget processes that may require long lead time to acquire these technologies. DOD guidance calls for measuring actual contributions of information technology portfolios, which includes the Army network, against established outcome-based performance measures to determine improved capability and allow for adjustments in the mix of portfolio investments. Senior DOD officials provided extensive input on the soundness of individual network components and the schedule for fielding equipment and have offered that future evaluations in an operational environment present a good opportunity to evaluate the overall performance of the network. However, the Army and DOD have not yet fully defined quantifiable network performance measures or plans to periodically review and evaluate the actual effectiveness of new Army network capabilities. Inadequate oversight of the portfolio could put the investment at risk. Finally, budget justification and other planning materials for network equipment\u0097over 50 research and development and procurement budget elements\u0097are not organized to provide insight into the budget for and affordability of the entire network.

GAO also recommends that the Secretary of Defense consolidate Army tactical network budget elements and justifications into a single area of the Army budget submittal.

The  Army is now implementing a new agile process, through which it will seek  to leverage industry solutions with less systems development by the Army  in modernizing its tactical network to give soldiers the exact information  they need, when they need it, in any environment.

The Army wanted the force components\u2014 soldiers, platforms, weapons, and sensors\u2014to be \u201cnet-centric,\u201d that is,  closely linked and able to operate seamlessly together. The Army took  initial steps toward transformation through its Digitization program in the  1990s by installing computers, software, and interfaces to  communications systems on Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, and  other vehicles in selected units that enable both in-theater and higher  commands to share battlefield data with lower-level units.", "About 10 years ago, the Army envisioned the Future Combat System as  the culminating stage in the Army\u2019s ongoing transformation to a lighter,  more agile and capable force. Future Combat System was a large and  complex development effort to provide a networked family of weapons  and other systems for the future force. Ultimately, the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD (AT&L)) issued  an acquisition decision memorandum that canceled the Future Combat  System development effort. Subsequently, the Army established the  Early-Infantry Brigade Combat Team program to demonstrate, among  other things, improved network technology and sensors that had been  part of the Future Combat System. However, faced with disappointing test  results and high costs, DOD directed the Army to cease these  developmental efforts, eventually canceling the program in February  2011.", "Over the last decade, most network improvements fielded by the Army  were focused on supporting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and were  expensive and time consuming. The Army\u2019s development and fielding  efforts for network technologies were not well synchronized. Funding and  timelines for network-related programs were rarely, if ever, aligned.  Capabilities were fielded piecemeal and integration with existing  technology was largely the responsibility of the user. Current battle  command network components were developed to address a range of  capabilities and have resulted in what the Army believes is a loosely  coordinated set of disparate sensors, applications, services, and transport  (i.e., the means of moving information). The decade of conflict also  provided the Army with a set of \u201clessons learned\u201d that have shaped the  adoption of the new approach intended to accelerate the introduction of  advanced information technology capabilities to the warfighter, especially  those engaged at the tactical edge (i.e., the forward battle lines). In  December 2011, Army leaders finalized the Network-enabled Mission  Command Initial Capabilities Document, which serves as a foundational  document in support of Army Network Modernization and describes the  essential network capabilities required. We have included a listing of the  essential network capabilities in appendix II. These capabilities support  an Army mission command capability defined by a coherent network of  command posts, aerial and ground platforms, manned and unmanned  sensors, and dismounted soldiers that are linked by an integrated suite of  mission command systems and connected by a robust transport layer  capable of delivering voice, data, imagery, and video to the tactical edge.  The Initial Capabilities Document also defined scores of capability gaps  that exist with current Army networks. We have included a listing of the  highest priority capability gaps in appendix III.", "The Army\u2019s network modernization strategy focuses on addressing four  factors that Army leaders believe are at the root of the Army\u2019s network  challenges: a lack of common technical standards, unsynchronized acquisition timelines, no visibility at the enterprise (top) level, and  test and acquisition processes that they believe result in the fielding of  outdated technology.", "In response, the Army has fundamentally changed the way it develops,  evaluates, tests, and delivers networked capability to its operating forces.  The Army is shelving its inadequate, disjointed process in favor of an  approach it calls capability set management.", "Under capability set management, the Army evaluates the current  operational environment and then designs a suite of systems and  equipment, a \u201ccapability set,\u201d to answer the projected requirements of a 1- year period. Instead of developing an ultimate capability and buying  enough to cover the entire force, the Army plans to buy only what is  needed for units preparing to deploy. Every year, the Army will integrate  the next capability set, which will reflect any changes or advances in  technology realized since the last set was fielded. The Army is using this  approach to manage network capabilities as a cohesive portfolio and  synchronize all supporting activities. The Army numbers these sets to  coincide with its upcoming training and fielding schedule to give units  ample time to (1) integrate the new capabilities and (2) train with the  systems before deploying to theater. For example, network capabilities  being ready for fielding in 2013 are labeled capability set 13.", "In support of capability sets, the Army has formulated an agile process  that will rely heavily on industry to fill those networking capability gaps  using nondevelopmental items or commercial-off-the-shelf options,  meaning the Army will do less system development. The Army\u2019s agile  process involves seven phases and three decision points intended to  identify proposed solutions that can be evaluated for feasibility to address  an identified need and can be deployed to the field. This approach is also  designed to help the Army cull out network system candidates that either  may not be an appropriate solution or may not be technically ready for  evaluation. Figure 1 illustrates the agile process. The Army believes this  process will allow for both large- and small-scale industry involvement  that could lead to increased competition and lower costs.", "To implement this agile process, the Army sends out sources sought  notices to attract proposed solutions to identified network capability gaps  and evaluates each of the proposed solutions at decision points after key  phases.which systems will proceed further into the process. The Army screens  systems again during a laboratory validation in Phase II. The Army  notifies contractors as to whether their systems will be allowed to  advance to the evaluation phase, where candidate systems are integrated  with existing network capabilities and tested with a full Army brigade. If  the system performs well at the evaluation, the Army decides whether or  not to buy and field it.", "The Army initially screens proposals at Phase I to determine  Equipped with every vehicle platform currently in the Army inventory, the  2nd brigade, 1st armored division assigned to Brigade Modernization  Command leads phases III to V of the process and is responsible for  executing the Network Integration Evaluations (NIE), which are held semi- annually and typically last for approximately 6 weeks. The NIEs are designed to replicate current real-world conditions and include systems  already fielded to the operational theater. Soldiers, combat developers,  training developers, materiel developers, and engineers participate in  each event, providing feedback as the evaluation progresses. NIEs  provide a venue for operational testing of formal acquisition programs and  for demonstrating government and industry provided systems under  evaluation in an operational environment. Army leaders use information  from NIEs to inform decisions on what to send to the field. With this large- scale and centralized testing process, the Army intends to validate new  technology as it becomes available; select the best candidates for quick  insertion into operational units; and refine tactics, techniques, and  procedures very quickly to eventually relieve or reduce the integration  burden of new equipment on operational forces.", "The standard operating procedure for the agile approach states that it is  not a substitute for existing DOD acquisition policy. Rather, the agile  process applies only to the testing, assessment, and evaluation during  NIE events and does not address any subsequent development or  procurement actions. Nevertheless, the standard operating procedures  state that changes to DOD policy may be considered as the Army  develops additional guidance for broader implementation of the agile  process. Further, the Army believes this agile process addresses a  portion of the information technology reform called for in Section 804 of  the Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act, in which  Congress directed DOD to formulate a new approach for acquiring  information technology systems.

Consequently, the Army issued a second, more targeted  sources sought notice for NIE 12.2 that resulted in fewer submissions,  yet they were better targeted to the specific gaps.", "After the fiscal year 2012 NIEs, the Army established a baseline  network architecture, which is essentially the logical and structural  design of the Army\u2019s network and includes capabilities such as on- the-move communications, battle command, and position location.  This baseline architecture incorporates both programs of record and  commercial technologies. This architecture provides the foundation  upon which the Army will add future networking capabilities.

However, the Army seems to  realize that the reprogramming option may not be available in all cases  and that the $25 million procurement fund may not be sufficient.  According to Army officials, a third option would be to allow continued  development of the proposed capability to proceed in conjunction with  similar efforts to develop new technologies under DOD\u2019s science and  technology line of effort. In any event, the Army may face challenges  given the long lead time for getting items in the budget (up to 2 years),  and items the Army wants to buy may not be known at the time the  budget is prepared.", "Finally, the Army is looking at various contracting strategies available  under existing acquisition regulations to enable it to rapidly procure a  capability. If the capability originated from a program of record,  procurement would proceed according to the program\u2019s acquisition  strategy.

The Army believes this Common  Operating Environment (COE) will reduce development time, lower costs,  improve interoperability, and ease system maintenance. The value of  having a COE is that industry will know in advance the standards to which  it must build solutions, cutting acquisition timelines and, possibly, cost.

Yet, this strategy is only in its initial stages  and there are a number of implementation challenges that lie ahead.  Looking ahead, although the Army network strategy is more modest from  a technology standpoint, it is still a huge transformational effort that will  affect all aspects of Army operations.

Effective oversight can reduce risk and improve  outcomes.", "Regarding implementation, DOD and the Army collaborated extensively  on the technical design of capability set 13 and the Army has proceeded  with the procurement and fielding of those capabilities. To facilitate  oversight of the latter phase, it is important for the Army and DOD to  assess the actual contributions of the initial capability set to be fielded in  fiscal year 2013 and use the results to inform future investments.  Establishing outcome-based performance measures will allow the Army  and DOD to assess progress of network development and fielding and be  in a position to determine the cost-effectiveness of their investments in  capability set 13.

Finally, as the NIE process begins to provide  the needed information and insights, DOD oversight would be enhanced  by an Office of the Secretary of Defense-level review of the actual  effectiveness and suitability of capability set 13. Such a review should  consider how capability set 13 actually affected overall network  performance, capability gaps, and essential network capabilities. This  level of review would be part of the intended periodic reviews and be  more targeted than the initial review conducted in 2011 and could help to  ensure that available resources are managed effectively.", "It is important for the Army to take the steps necessary to ensure that the  technologies it procures are fully mature and ready for integration and  fielding; immature technology delivered faster still puts the Army at risk for  less than optimum results. Considering nondevelopmental items or  commercial-off-the-shelf options has the potential benefit of substantially  lower development time and cost. However, those options may not be  available to address all of the capability gaps, and some development  investments may be needed over time. Also, given the realities of the  federal budgeting process and the time commitments associated with full  and open competition, it may not be possible to procure all emerging  technologies immediately. However, if the Army can find a way to procure  and field new technologies within 2 to 3 years, that is still considerably  better than a typical development effort that in the past has taken a  decade or longer.
