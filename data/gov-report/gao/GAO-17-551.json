In four out of the five years of GAO's analysis, small rural and small urban hospitals were more likely to receive a bonus compared to all participating hospitals, while safety net hospitals were more likely to receive a penalty. While a majority of all hospitals received a bonus or a penalty of less than 0.5 percent each year, the percentage of hospitals receiving a bonus greater than 0.5 percent increased from 4 percent to 29 percent from fiscal year 2013 to 2017.

Further, among hospitals that were missing one or more quality scores, the efficiency score had a greater effect on the total performance score because of the methodology used by CMS.

Under HVBP, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), adjusts Medicare payments to hospitals based  on a formula that takes into account each hospital\u2019s performance on a  designated set of quality and efficiency measures. Higher performing  hospitals, relative to other hospitals, receive an increase in future  Medicare payments, while the lower performing hospitals have a  decrease in their payments. HVBP is one example of a range of efforts  initiated under PPACA to induce providers to improve their quality of care  and become more cost efficient.", "PPACA also included a provision that we assess the impact of the HVBP  program on Medicare hospital quality and payments, including the quality  of care among safety net hospitals, which provide a significant amount of  care to the poor, and small rural and small urban hospitals, which have  fewer than 100 acute care beds. The provision called for an interim  report to be issued by October 1, 2015, and a final report by July 1, 2017.  The interim report examined how the financial incentives created under  HVBP may have affected hospitals\u2019 quality of care as well as their efforts  to improve quality in the first years of the program\u2019s implementation from  fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2015, including the effects of the  program on safety net, small rural, and small urban hospitals.", "This final report addresses three questions for the hospitals participating  in the HVBP program:  1.  Relative to all hospitals, how have safety net, small rural, and small  urban hospitals performed in the HVBP quality and efficiency  performance categories used for payment in fiscal years 2013 through  2017?  2.  How have payment adjustments under HVBP changed over time for  safety net, small rural, small urban, and other hospitals?  3.  What effect, if any, has the inclusion of the efficiency score beginning  in 2015 had on payment adjustments?", "To determine how safety net, small rural, and small urban hospitals  performed relative to all participating hospitals in the HVBP quality and  efficiency performance categories used for payment, we analyzed CMS  data on these performance categories, or domains, collected from 2013  through 2017 for approximately 3,000 hospitals. (See app. I for a list of  the measures associated with each domain each year.) Specifically, we  analyzed HVBP hospital domain scores, which, for the purposes of our  reporting, we divided into two groups: (1) quality domains, which include  the clinical processes, patient experiences, patient outcomes, and safety  domains; and (2) an efficiency domain, which contains a single cost  metric\u2014Medicare spending per beneficiary. Not all of the domains were  included in the HVBP program each year, and the individual measures  that make up the domains changed year over year. As a result, we did not  compare the performance scores of hospitals from one year to the next.  We compared the median hospital domain scores and total performance  scores\u2014the sum of the quality and efficiency domains after they are  weighted, which serves as the basis for the HVBP payment  adjustments\u2014for fiscal years 2013 through 2017 for all hospitals  participating in the HVBP program (\u201call hospitals\u201d) with other types of  participating hospitals within a given year. We therefore compared the  median scores of all hospitals to those of safety net, small rural, and small  urban hospitals in each year. We identified safety net hospitals as those  in the top 10 percent of a composite ranking based on Medicare  disproportionate patient percentage\u2014a measure of hospitals\u2019 Medicaid  and low-income Medicare patients\u2014and hospitals\u2019 proportion of  uncompensated care, which we obtained from annual Medicare cost  reports. For this report, we defined small hospitals as those with 100 or  fewer acute care beds using data from an American Hospital Association  survey and identified rural or urban hospitals using CMS data. Because  CMS does not differentiate between hospital types when evaluating  hospitals\u2019 performance, our \u201call hospital\u201d category included each of the  different hospital types as well as hospitals that were not safety net, small  rural, or small urban hospitals. (For information on the number and types  of hospitals participating in the HVBP program each fiscal year of our  review, see app. II.)", "To describe how payment adjustments under the HVBP program have  changed over time for safety net, small rural, small urban, and all  participating hospitals, we analyzed data provided by CMS on payment  adjustments\u2014the hospitals\u2019 bonuses or penalties\u2014which are made prior  to each fiscal year. We examined these adjustments for each of the  hospital types, as described above, during fiscal years 2013 through  2017. We analyzed hospital payment adjustments to determine what  changes, if any, occurred over time and what differences, if any, existed  in payment adjustments for hospitals overall as compared to safety net,  small rural, and small urban hospitals.", "To determine what effect, if any, the inclusion of the efficiency domain  score beginning in fiscal year 2015 had on payment adjustments, we  compared these adjustments, efficiency scores, and weighted composite  quality scores of our different hospital types. We made these  comparisons by specific year for those hospitals that had an efficiency  score during fiscal year 2015, 2016, or 2017. To develop a weighted  composite quality score for each hospital, we subtracted hospitals\u2019  weighted efficiency scores from their total performance scores to  calculate a median composite quality score for all hospitals for fiscal  years 2015 through 2017. Hospitals with composite quality scores above  the median were considered higher quality, while hospitals with  composite quality scores below the median were considered lower  quality. Regardless of hospital type, the all-hospital median was used as  the point of comparison, since CMS does not distinguish by hospital type  when determining payment adjustments. After developing a composite  quality score, we then analyzed the weighted and unweighted efficiency  scores of the hospitals that received a bonus to determine how those  scores may have impacted hospitals\u2019 payment adjustments during fiscal  years 2015 through 2017. Since a complete set of domain scores was not  required to participate in the HVBP program after 2015, we also analyzed  the impact missing domain scores had on weighted composite quality  scores, efficiency scores, total performance scores, and payment  adjustments.", "To determine the reliability of the HVBP data, we reviewed related  documentation including CMS guidance for the program, CMS fact  sheets, CMS reports, and federal register notices, and we interviewed  CMS officials regarding the program and the completeness and accuracy  of the data provided to us. We also reviewed the data for outliers and  compared the data to information in other published reports. For the  American Hospital Association data, we reviewed previous assessments  of these data used for our prior reports.

Prior to the HVBP program, hospitals  received slightly higher Medicare payments for submitting data on  measures within CMS\u2019s public Inpatient Quality Reporting (IQR).  Beginning in fiscal year 2013, the HVBP program provided new bonuses  and penalties that were based on each hospital\u2019s performance on a  subset of these measures.", "Each individual hospital\u2019s performance is calculated for each measure  within a domain using a baseline period and a performance period, both  of which are in prior years. For each of the HVBP measures, CMS  considers both the results of a hospital\u2019s absolute performance\u2014 awarding achievement points if performance on a measure was at or  above the median for all participating hospitals\u2014and improvements in its  performance over time\u2014awarding improvement points if current  performance had improved. CMS uses the higher of these points as the  hospital\u2019s score on each measure. Related measures are grouped into  specific performance categories, called domains. The domain scores are  weighted to develop a total performance score for each hospital. The  measures that constitute each domain, the number of domains, and the  weighting of the domain scores have changed over the years of the  program (see table 1). In fiscal year 2013, HVBP had two quality  domains\u2014clinical processes and patient experience; by 2017, two  additional quality domains\u2014patient outcomes and safety\u2014and one  efficiency domain were added to the program.", "By law, the HVBP program is budget neutral, which means that the total  amount of payment increases, or bonuses, awarded to hospitals deemed  to provide higher quality of care must equal the total amount of payment  reductions, or penalties, applied to hospitals deemed to provide lower  quality of care. To fund the HVBP program, CMS first applies an initial  fixed percentage reduction to the amount of each hospital\u2019s Medicare  reimbursements for its patients that fiscal year. The initial percentage  reduction was 1 percent in fiscal year 2013 and has grown by 0.25  percent each year to the maximum of 2 percent for fiscal year 2017 and  beyond, as specified in PPACA.", "CMS determines each hospital\u2019s payment adjustment based on the  hospital\u2019s total performance score relative to all participating hospitals.  Hospitals with payment adjustments that exceed the initial reduction  receive a net increase, or bonus. Hospitals with a payment adjustment  less than the initial reduction have a net decrease, or a penalty. (For two  hypothetical examples using the initial percentage reduction for fiscal year  2017, see fig. 1.) These payment adjustments are applied to the inpatient  Medicare payment for each discharged patient throughout the upcoming  fiscal year.", "In October 2015, we reported on certain HVBP performance measures  prior to and after the implementation of the HVBP program. We found  that trends in performance for many of these measures were unchanged  since the implementation of the HVBP program. This report included  information from interviews with officials from selected hospitals who  noted that the HVBP program reinforced ongoing quality improvement  efforts but did not lead to major changes in focus. Hospital officials also  indicated that there were patient population and community barriers to  their quality improvement efforts.
