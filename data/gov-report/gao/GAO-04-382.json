Historically, water officials have expressed concern about a lack of water data. At the same time, numerous organizations collect a variety of water data. To address a number of issues concerning the water data that various organization collect, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment, House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, asked GAO to determine (1) the key entities that collect water data, the types of data they collect, how they store the data, and how entities can access the data; and (2) the extent that water quality and water quantity data collection efforts are coordinated."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["At least 15 federal agencies collect a wide variety of water quality data. Most notably, the U.S. Geological Survey operates several large water quality monitoring programs across the nation. States also play a key role in water quality data collection to fulfill their responsibilities under the Clean Water Act. In addition, numerous local watershed groups, volunteer monitoring groups, industries, and academic groups collect water quality data. In contrast, collection of water quantity data is more centralized, with three federal agencies collecting the majority of data available nationwide. While GAO found notable exceptions, officials in almost all of the federal and state agencies contacted said that coordination of water quality data was falling short of its potential. Key barriers frequently identified as impeding better coordination of water quality data collection include (1) the significantly different purposes for which groups collect data, (2) inconsistencies in groups' data collection protocols, (3) an unawareness by data collectors as to which entities collect what types of data, and (4) low priority for data coordination, as shown in a lack of support for councils that promote improved coordination. GAO concluded that designating a lead organization with sufficient authority and resources to coordinate data collection could help alleviate these problems and ensure that watershed managers have better information upon which to base critical decisions. Data collectors strongly agree that coordinating water quantity data collection is considerably less problematic. Reasons include the fact that controversial water allocation decisions require accurate and complete water quantity data; that some of the technologies for measuring water quantity allow for immediate distribution of data; that water quantity data parameters are generally more consistent; and that coordination is simplified in that relatively fewer entities collect these data. Collectors of water quantity data generally agreed that an overall shortage of data was a more serious problem than a lack of coordination of the data that are collected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to your request, this report discusses (1) the key entities that  collect water quality and water quantity data, including the types of data  they collect, how they store their data, and how entities can access the  data; and (2) the extent to which these entities coordinate their water  quality and water quantity data collection efforts. We include a matter for  congressional consideration that the Congress considers formally  designating a lead organization (either an existing water data coordinating  entity or one of the federal agencies with broad water data collection  responsibilities) to enhance and clearly define authority for coordinating  the collection of water data nationwide. Among its responsibilities, the  organization would (1) support the development and continued operation  of regional and state monitoring councils, (2) coordinate the development  of an Internet-based clearinghouse to convey what entities are collecting  what types of data, and (3) coordinate development of clear guidance on  metadata standards so that data users can integrate data from various  sources.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

Similarly, decision makers need  reliable and comprehensive data on the quantity of the nation\u2019s water  resources to support increasingly important\u2014and contentious\u2014decisions  about how to allocate limited water resources among states and among a  variety of competing uses.", "GAO and others, however, have documented shortages in the data available  to make such decisions. At the same time, a large number of public and  private organizations collect this kind of information\u2014raising questions as  to whether more efficient coordination of these data collection efforts can  result in more data available for informed decision making."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Decision Makers Need Complete and Reliable Water Quality Data", "paragraphs": ["Under the Clean Water Act, states have primary responsibility for  implementing programs to manage water quality. Their key responsibilities  include establishing water quality standards to achieve designated uses  (the purposes for which a given body of water is intended to serve),  assessing whether the quality of their waters meets states\u2019 water quality  standards, and developing and implementing cleanup plans for waters that  do not meet standards.", "Monitoring information on water quality is the linchpin that allows states to  perform these responsibilities. States generally monitor water quality  directly, but frequently supplement these data with data collected by  federal agencies, volunteer groups, and other entities. Monitoring data can  include information about the presence of chemicals such as chlorine,  physical characteristics such as temperature, and biological characteristics  such as the health and abundance of fish and other aquatic species. Figure  1 shows how monitoring water quality is essential to identifying water  quality problems and determining whether actions to restore water quality  are successful.", "As shown in figure 1, states compare monitoring data with their water  quality standards. If a state\u2019s assessment of a body of water indicates that it  does not meet the standards\u2014for example, if it has levels of chlorine that  are too high to support aquatic life\u2014then the body of water is considered  as not supporting its intended use of aquatic life. In such cases, states are  required, under section 303(d) of the act, to identify and list waters for  which technology-based effluent limitations are not sufficient to meet  water quality standards and for which pollutants need to be reduced. EPA  must approve or disapprove the states\u2019 lists.", "In developing their lists of impaired waters, states must use all existing and  readily available water quality-related data to determine if a water body is  impaired and identify the specific pollutant(s) causing impairment.  Subsequently, states must develop a total maximum daily load (TMDL), as  necessary, for each of the pollutants affecting each impaired body of water.  TMDLs are used to restore water quality by identifying how much pollution  a body of water can receive and still meet standards and then reducing the  amount of pollution entering the water to that level.", "While states\u2019 use of water quality data is critical to meeting the objectives  of the Clean Water Act, other organizations also rely heavily on water  quality data for a variety of purposes. The Army Corps of Engineers, for  example, uses these data for a variety of reasons, including regulating  water projects and issuing permits under section 404 of the act for the  discharge of dredge and fill materials into navigable waters. Federal land  management agencies such as the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and  Wildlife Service, National Park Service, and Bureau of Land Management  and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service rely upon these data to  fulfill their responsibilities to protect and restore aquatic resources on  federal lands. These agencies also use these data to fulfill their  responsibilities under various laws, such as the protection of critical  habitat for plants and animals under the Endangered Species Act.

States are primarily responsible for  governing the allocation and use of water in accordance with the laws  developed by their state and interstate compacts\u2014agreements that address  water allocation, quality, and other issues on bodies of water that cross  state borders. Key state responsibilities in complying with these compacts  and laws include administering water rights to various users, allocating  water in accordance with these water rights, maintaining instream flow  requirements for habitat purposes, and enforcing the decrees and water  laws of the state. To fulfill these responsibilities, states need water  availability data, such as streamflow and snowpack data, to quantify how  much water is and will be available for allocation, and water use data,  including withdrawal and return flow data, to determine how much water  is being consumed. They obtain these data mostly through the efforts of  others, such as federal agencies and municipalities, although a few states  also conduct their own monitoring.", "Federal agencies support states in their efforts to govern the allocation and  use of water through many activities. Agencies, such as the Department of  the Interior, assist states in developing, implementing, and enforcing  interstate compacts; the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) National Weather Service, and  Natural Resources Conservation Service, among others, collect and share  information such as surface water, rainfall, and snowpack data, which help  forecast water supply; and the Army Corps of Engineers and Bureau of  Reclamation construct, operate, and maintain dams, reservoirs, and water  distribution facilities to help meet the needs of water users, among other  activities.", "Federal agencies also need data to support their own varying objectives on  federal lands. Agencies responsible for managing natural resources\u2014such  as the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife  Service, and National Park Service\u2014construct and/or maintain water  storage and distribution facilities on their lands to provide water for uses  such as visitor services, recreation, habitat, and flood control. These  agencies also often collect water data or conduct water resources  investigations in support of their own responsibilities, such as collection of  supplemental streamgage information to assess habitat and recreational  conditions. Additionally, numerous federal natural resources management  agencies may become involved (e.g., by geography or other factors) in  some aspect(s) of tribal water interests. Federal natural resources  management agency policies generally include provisions to protect and  support tribal water interests, in cooperation with the Bureau of Indian  Affairs and the tribes.", "Other agencies needing water quantity data include local, regional, and  interstate water authorities, as well as private firms that own and operate  water resources systems.

As illustrated in figure 2, a watershed is an area  that drains to a common waterway, such as a stream, lake, estuary,  wetland, or ocean. Watersheds come in all shapes and sizes, and often  cross county, state, and national boundaries. Depending on its scale, a  watershed may refer to large or small river basins, sub-basins, tributary  basins, or smaller hydrological units or drainage areas.", "Many federal agencies have long supported a watershed approach as the  best way to manage the nation\u2019s water resources. Army Corps of Engineers  officials, for example, noted that the agency has been working in the  watershed context and engaged in watershed-level planning and  management for many years. They noted further that watershed analysis  has been the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of planning and environmental review efforts  for major Corps projects. Also, in a December 2002 memorandum, the EPA  Assistant Administrator for Water reaffirmed the agency\u2019s commitment to  the watershed approach, noting that by focusing multistakeholder efforts  within hydrologically defined boundaries to protect and restore our aquatic  resources and ecosystems, the watershed approach \u201coffers the most cost- effective opportunity to tackle today's challenges\u201d in meeting the nation\u2019s  water needs. As the memorandum notes, the value in this approach is in  taking a holistic approach to the water resource in a way that brings in the  full range of federal, state, local, and private parties with a stake in the  resource.", "Importantly, the watershed approach also allows for the identification and  prioritization of problems affecting the resource and steps to address them.  This is important because different watersheds may be affected by  significantly different natural conditions and pollution problems. Moreover,  even where watersheds are affected by similar pollutants, the causes of  their pollution problems\u2014and the steps needed to deal with them\u2014can be  quite different. For example, in the case of two watersheds affected by  excessive levels of nitrogen, one may need to reduce discharges from  wastewater treatment plants and other \u201cpoint\u201d sources, while the other  may need to address nitrogen sources emanating from agricultural use.  Moreover, water officials must also consider water availability issues, since  the amount of water flowing through the watershed affects the ability of  the watershed to assimilate the pollutant.

We also sought opinions on the most useful steps that could be  taken to improve coordination. We supplemented these contacts by  interviewing members of federal and state coordinating organizations,  most notably the National Water Quality Monitoring Council and its state  counterparts in Colorado, Maryland, and Virginia.

Even within the community of federal agencies, significant  diversity in agency missions can lead to vastly different priorities regarding  which data to collect and how to collect and analyze them. For example,  the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) primary interest in water  quality data arises from its responsibility to ensure that waters are in  compliance with states\u2019 water quality standards. Accordingly, its  monitoring approach (and those of the states that conduct monitoring  programs to meet EPA requirements) generally focuses on determining  whether certain thresholds are achieved or exceeded. The degree to which  measurements are on one side or the other of these thresholds is generally  of less consequence. On the other hand, the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s  monitoring program is oriented toward obtaining precise measurements of  water quality and then tracking changes in these values over time.  Accordingly, its monitoring techniques allow for collecting specific  measurements\u2014and those techniques tend to be more expensive. For  example, the U.S. Geological Survey may use relatively expensive meters to  measure water quality parameters such as temperature, dissolved oxygen,  pH, and conductivity. These meters require more calibration and  maintenance to ensure accuracy than the test kits used by others seeking to  determine compliance with state water quality standards.", "State officials have also emphasized how differing missions can affect the  ability to coordinate monitoring strategies and share data. An ASIWPCA  survey found that state officials identified conflicting state and federal data  needs as among the top barriers to the effectiveness of their ambient  monitoring program.", "Finally, some organizations have little incentive to share data, while others  may have strong disincentives to do so.

For example,  according to officials from the Mississippi Department of Environmental  Quality, data collected by Adopt-A-Stream volunteers, one of the volunteer  organizations in Mississippi, are not used by the state because they are not  of sufficient quality to use in identifying waters that do not meet standards,  and because the state believes it has little control over volunteers.  However, the data could potentially be used to target future monitoring. To  address this concern, EPA\u2019s Volunteer Monitor\u2019s Guide to Quality  Assurance Project Plans outlines steps that a volunteer program needs to  take to document the field, lab, analytical, and data management  procedures of its monitoring program. According to EPA officials, many  volunteer programs develop such documentation in the form of Quality  Assurance Project Plans, which are then submitted to the state water  quality agency or the EPA regional office for review and approval.

For example, according to an official from the  Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES),  without metadata, the reliability of data is suspect and, therefore, should  not be used to make watershed management decisions.

For example, an official from the Agricultural Research  Service in Mississippi noted that even though he tries to identify other data  collectors within the state, he is consistently surprised to find out that  there are additional entities collecting water quality data.

This  newer version contains data collected beginning in 1999, along with some  older data that were transferred from legacy STORET. Some of the major  changes between legacy STORET and modernized STORET include the  following:   Storing data in legacy STORET could only be accomplished by someone  with a mainframe user ID and specialized training. In contrast,  modernized STORET is installed on personal computers, and data can  be entered on those personal computers without requiring access to an  EPA computer. Local STORET users then choose if and when to upload  their data into national STORET.", "Unlike legacy STORET, modernized STORET contains metadata on why  the data were gathered; sampling and analytical methods used; the  laboratory used to analyze the samples; the quality control checks used  when sampling, handling the samples, and analyzing the data; and the  personnel responsible for the data.", "EPA considers STORET to be its main repository for water monitoring data  and a cornerstone of its data management activities and water program  integration efforts. And, according to EPA officials, the agency has worked  hard to resolve a number of issues affecting the database\u2019s wider use.", "Nonetheless, officials from many of the entities we interviewed suggested  that further progress is needed before they can effectively use STORET.  They cited the following difficulties: (1) uploading data to STORET, (2)  retrieving data from STORET, and (3) dealing with the system\u2019s large  number of data parameters. The last point in particular was cited by Forest  Service officials, who noted that the large number of data parameters in the  system made it cumbersome to use. Consequently, less than 5 percent of  Forest Service data currently go into STORET, and the agency has yet to  decide whether to consolidate their water quality data into STORET or  expend resources to develop an in-house water quality module.", "Officials in two of the three states we visited held similar views. Officials  from the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality reported that they  have not used STORET since it was updated because of difficulties in  uploading and retrieving data, and the state has instead opted to develop its  own data storage system. Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality  officials similarly reported that they store their data in two state-run  databases. Officials from both states noted that they would prefer to have  their data in STORET, but would need additional assistance from EPA to do  so. On the other hand, one of the states we visited, Colorado, noted success  in using STORET to store its water quality data. In addition, officials from  EPA\u2019s Denver office noted that other states, such as Utah, have also had  success in using STORET.", "Some local government and volunteer monitoring groups also have  encountered challenges using STORET. For example, a watershed group in  Colorado noted that, while their group recognizes that STORET is a  valuable data management system and made the decision to use the system  in 2000, the group had only a limited amount of data in STORET as of fall  2003 because of difficulties uploading their data. The group explained that  unified federal support for the system is lacking, and therefore, limited  funding has been made available to address the difficulties STORET users  encounter. In addition, a volunteer monitoring group from Virginia reported  that while they had tried to put their data into STORET, they had too much  difficulty uploading data into the system, and that EPA\u2019s resources were, at  the time, stretched too thinly to provide sufficient assistance. Moreover,  officials from Big Dry Creek Watershed Association in Colorado reported  that while they recognize the benefits to others of having their data in  STORET, they do not perceive a benefit to their association that warrants  spending the funding or time to do so.", "Many of these issues were echoed by state and interstate agencies in a 2002  ASIWPCA survey. Most survey respondents, for example, indicated that  EPA does not have sufficient resources to support the system. Some also  noted that STORET is incompatible with their internal state systems and  reporting needs, data retrieval is difficult, and a good deal of staff effort  must be spent to manage incompatibilities.", "EPA officials have acknowledged these problems, as well as concerns over  insufficient training and technical support. Nonetheless, the agency has  cited recent successes in dealing with STORET challenges, pointing to  growth in the number of states and other organizations using the system.  As of March 2004, over 120 organizations use STORET, including 31 states,  four EPA offices, interstate organizations such as the Delaware River Basin  Commission, federal agencies, American Indian tribes, watershed groups,  and volunteer monitoring groups.

EPA officials noted that the agency has made efforts  to encourage yet more states, federal agencies, and other groups to make  greater use of the system by (1) working to make the system easier to use  by, for example, releasing revised versions of STORET and a STORET  Import Module which make data upload easier and (2) providing greater  technical assistance. In addition, according to EPA, the agency developed a  new STORET data warehouse in 2003 that has increased data retrieval  speed by 200-fold.

NWIS contains only  U.S. Geological Survey generated data or data the U.S. Geological Survey  has reviewed and ensured that data quality is known and acceptable. In  contrast, STORET accepts data of varying quality from any source,  contains significant metadata, and allows the data owner to change or  delete data.", "According to an EPA official, NWIS was compatible with legacy STORET  and, through an agreement with the U.S. Geological Survey at the time,  NWIS data was regularly copied into legacy STORET. Furthermore, when  EPA modernized STORET, the U.S. Geological Survey and EPA worked  closely to ensure that modernized STORET and an expected modernized  version of NWIS would remain compatible. However, NWIS was not  modernized according to plan, and now the modernized STORET and  NWIS are incompatible. Additionally, according to a U.S. Geological Survey  official, for technical reasons the archived version of legacy STORET no  longer contains NWIS data.", "As a result, according to federal and state agency officials, integrating data  from these two primary water quality databases takes time and a significant  commitment of resources. For example, an official from New Jersey\u2019s  Department of Environmental Protection explained that transferring data  from NWIS into STORET\u2014in order to form a more complete picture of  water quality within the state\u2014takes considerable time and effort from  both state and U.S. Geological Survey staff.

The U.S. Geological Survey  expects funding from cooperators to decline this year and the next due to  current state fiscal constraints, which will likely cause the overall number  of gages to go down in the next couple of years.", "Officials at two federal agencies also identified NOAA\u2019s National Weather  Service rain gauge data as an area with information gaps. According to the  National Weather Service, while currently its observation systems primarily  exist at airports, it is trying to improve coverage, especially in the West  where the biggest gaps exist. According to a National Weather Service  official, studies conducted by the Agricultural Research Service and the  National Weather Service show that improving the coverage of monitoring  sites to a 20 mile by 20 mile grid would improve stage forecasting by 50  percent. If this coverage is realized, the federal government could save $700  million annually through more accurate flood forecasts, according to the  official. To achieve this better coverage, the National Weather Service is  beginning to add 4,000 new sites and to upgrade 4,000 existing sites. As we  previously reported, the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Weather Service stated that a lack of sufficient funding is their primary  barrier to expanding or automating data collection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Efforts to Coordinate Water Quantity Data Collection Have Been Comparatively Successful", "paragraphs": ["While the lack of funds for monitoring water quantity parallels the lack of  funds for monitoring water quality, efforts to coordinate water quantity  data collection have generally been successful and are comparatively  unimpeded by barriers.

While these efforts are cleanly divided,  they also share the common purpose of predicting and measuring the  nation\u2019s water availability and use, which facilitates better coordination,  according to some officials. For example, once NOAA\u2019s National Weather  Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the U.S.  Geological Survey collect their data, they combine them to forecast water  supplies and floods.", "Some officials also cited the common purpose of data collection as a  reason coordinating data collection efforts on water quantity has been  more successful than for water quality. According to the U.S. Geological  Survey, all states participate in its Cooperative Program, in which  nonfederal entities and the U.S. Geological Survey jointly fund water  resources projects that involve water quantity data collection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical and Time-Sensitive Water Quantity Management Decisions Require Accurate and Complete Water Quantity Data", "paragraphs": ["Accurate and complete data are critical in supporting urgent and  controversial water quantity management decisions made by state and  federal agencies. According to many federal and state officials, there is  generally a more critical need for accurate and complete real-time water  quantity data than there is for water quality because important decisions  must be made daily with regard to water allocation, reservoir projects,  flood and drought management, navigation, and evaluation of compliance  with water withdrawal permits.", "According to water quantity officials in Virginia, the critical need for water  quantity data increases as the quantity of available water becomes more  equivalent to the amount of water being used, or where floods occur. In  some of these instances, water quantity decisions must be made quickly  with accurate data. For example, according to an Army Corps of Engineers  official, when floods occur, managers must make critical on-the-spot  decisions, such as which residents need to be evacuated or how much  water should be released from a reservoir to reduce risk and optimize flood  reduction. Similarly, according to a U.S. Geological Survey official in  Virginia, during the state\u2019s drought in 2002, discharge permit holders with  limits on how much they could discharge at various streamflows relied on  hourly streamflow data to be sure that their discharges were not exceeding  permitted levels. Several federal and state officials explained that this  critical need for data has prompted water quantity officials to coordinate  better.", "Numerous officials also noted the need for accurate and complete data for  controversial decisions, especially when they may be challenged in court.  In particular, states need data to, among other things, administer water  rights to various users, establish and maintain in-stream flow requirements  for endangered species and, generally, to comply with interstate compacts.  The need for adequate data for these sensitive decisions is especially  critical in western states, like Colorado, where rising populations  combined with increasing demand for water for recreation, scenic value,  and fish and wildlife habitat, have resulted in conflicts and litigation. An  official in Colorado explained that in his state, there is great emphasis on  keeping track of water because \u201cevery drop of water is owned by  someone.\u201d", "When water is improperly allocated, states can face costly consequences,  which encourages states to coordinate data collection and share results.  For example, according to Colorado water officials, the state may be  required to pay almost $30 million to Kansas as a result of litigation Kansas  initiated when Colorado allegedly withdrew more than its share of water  from the Arkansas River as a result of ground water pumping. The officials  acknowledged that at the time, the state did not have adequate ground  water use data. The state has since decided to focus its resources to bring  high-quality data together to make well-supported decisions instead of  paying for litigation and payments resulting from inadequately supported  decisions. Toward this end, the state has established the Colorado Decision  Support System, a central query-based data system that incorporates data  from various entities in the state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technology Allows for Immediate Distribution of Some Data", "paragraphs": ["Advanced technology within the water quantity field allows for data to be  directly and almost instantaneously delivered to data users, which makes it  easier to share data and facilitates coordination of water quantity data  collection, according to many federal and state officials. Part of the reason  that water quantity data is easier to collect and share is because many of  the water quantity parameters for which groups collect data can be  measured in situ through electronic equipment. This is not true of most  water quality parameters, which require manually intensive sampling and  subsequent lab processing and analysis to obtain the final data values.", "Where data are measured electronically, telemetry systems such as satellite  technology\u2014depicted in figure 11\u2014can relay data from the instrument to  data users almost immediately. For example, much of the U.S. Geological  Survey\u2019s streamflow data, which are collected continuously by electronic  in-stream equipment, are available within 4 hours of collection through use  of satellite systems or other telemetry systems such as phones and radios.", "Since the mid-1980s, the proportion of the U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s  streamgages with telemetry has increased dramatically, as shown in figure  12. The U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s computers also have built-in checking  routines, which provide some quality assurance, according to a Colorado  U.S. Geological Survey official. Satellites, in particular, transmit much of  the hydrologic data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey to data users.  Once data are picked up by satellite, they can be transmitted to users in a  couple of ways. For example, some data collected by the Bureau of  Reclamation can be captured directly by users with their own domestic  satellite receivers, or can be accessed on the Web through NOAA\u2019s National  Geophysical Data Center, a repository for satellite data within the National  Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service.", "Another telemetry system\u2014\u201cmeteor burst\u201d communication technology\u2014 used by the Natural Resources Conservation Service also facilitates timely  sharing of water quantity data. Meteor burst technology (see figure 13) is  the ability to reflect radio signals, sent from remote locations, off of ionized  meteorite trails 50 to 75 miles above the earth's surface. With this  technology, collection sites as far apart as 1,200 miles can communicate  with one another for short time intervals, which are sufficient to \"burst\"  relatively short data messages between sending and receiving stations. This  method of communications is preferable for transmitting snowpack data  because, among other reasons, interference that mountains often cause in  conventional communications is not a problem for a meteor burst system,  long-term costs are lower than they are for satellite technology, and data  transfer reliability is higher for meteor burst. The Natural Resources  Conservation Service operates over 700 automated, high-elevation snow  and climate measurement sites in 12 western states and Alaska; these sites  use advanced radio technology to report data on the Internet about once  each day."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Water Quantity Data Parameters Are Generally More Consistent Nationwide", "paragraphs": ["Water quantity parameters, such as streamflow and precipitation, are  generally more uniform nationwide than water quality parameters,  according to several federal and state officials, making it easier for groups  to integrate data from separate collection efforts. For example, water  withdrawal is measured as a volume of water in gallons, and stage is  measured as the height of water in feet, which can be easily compared.  Water quality parameters, on the other hand, are less uniform. Sediment  concentration in water is one example of a measure that may be described  by multiple parameters\u2014total suspended solids, turbidity, and  transparency\u2014that are not easily integrated.", "According to several federal and state officials, water quantity parameters  are more uniform partly because traditional parameters and the same  methods of measurements have been around for decades. For example, the  U.S. Geological Survey has operated its streamgaging network to measure  streamflow since 1889, and the Army Corps of Engineers has collected  stage data as far back as 1785 on the Mississippi River with more regular  measurements beginning about 1838. Their monitoring methods and  standardized techniques for converting stage data to flow data are  established and relatively uniform among entities, according to an Army  Corps of Engineers official. Many water quality parameters and assessment  methods, on the other hand, are relatively new. For example, an EPA  bioassessment guidance document noted that many natural resource  agencies throughout the country have begun the process of developing and  implementing biological assessment and criteria programs. In part because  these processes are relatively new, sampling methods differ across  agencies, impeding data sharing.", "In addition to water quantity parameters being more uniform, there are also  fewer than for water quality, which lessens the burden of coordination  according to some of the federal and state officials we spoke with. While  water quantity can be characterized by a relatively small number of  parameters (in magnitude of tens) concerning the volume of water  available and the volume that is used, a much larger number of chemical,  physical, and biological parameters (in magnitude of thousands) are  required to provide an accurate picture of water quality. Chemical  measures alone account for a large number of parameters because there  are so many agricultural, industrial, pharmaceutical, and household  chemicals in use today that are found in surface waters. According to a U.S.  Geological Survey official, the agency\u2019s water quantity monitoring largely  concentrates on discharge and water height (stage) measurements. In  contrast, the U.S. Geological Survey alone collects water quality data on  about 500 different chemicals and identifies thousands of biological species  in streams, lakes, and reservoirs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["We found a broad consensus that, for a variety of reasons, water quantity  data collection efforts have relatively been well coordinated.
