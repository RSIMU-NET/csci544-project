The  investor base for online marketplace lenders has expanded to include  institutional investors such as hedge funds and financial institutions.  Additionally, there has been the emergence of a market for securitizations  of marketplace lending loans\u2014both consumer and small business loan- backed offerings. Marketplace lending firms have evolved to offer a wide  variety of loan products and services to consumers and small businesses  and have recently begun to offer mortgages, life insurance, and auto  loans. Although a number of marketplace lending models exist, publications we reviewed highlighted two common models: direct lenders  and platform lenders. Direct lenders, also known as balance sheet  lenders, use capital obtained from outside sources to fund loans and  often hold loans on their balance sheet. Examples of direct lenders  include CAN Capital, Kabbage, and SoFi. Platform lenders partner with  depository institutions to originate loans that are then purchased by the  lender or by an investor through the platform. Examples of platform  lenders include LendingClub Corporation, Prosper, and Upstart. However,  there are various permutations based on these two common models. For  example, direct lenders like OnDeck have developed hybrid models,  selling some whole loans to institutional investors while retaining servicing  responsibilities.", "The marketplace lending process for the two models typically begins with  a prospective borrower filling out an online application on the marketplace  lending platform\u2019s website. Marketplace lenders use traditional and may  use less traditional types of data and credit algorithms to assess  creditworthiness and underwrite loans. Marketplace lenders use  traditional credit data (e.g., credit scores, income, and debt repayment  history) but, according to publications we reviewed, may also use less  traditional data such as monthly cash flow and expenses, educational  history, payment and sales history, and online customer reviews.", "After assessing the creditworthiness and needs of the applicant, the  marketplace lender will approve or deny the borrower\u2019s loan request.  Generally, the loan will include a principal amount, an interest amount,  and the marketplace lender may charge a servicing fee for collecting and  transmitting payments and handling collections in case of a default.", "Funding a borrower\u2019s request depends on the business model of the  marketplace lender. Direct lenders typically originate the loan, hold most  or all of the loans on their own balance sheets, earn interest on the loans,  and carry credit risk for the entire loan (the risk is that the borrower does  not repay), see figure 1. These lenders can raise funds to make loans by  issuing equity to institutional investors (in addition to other means).  Platform lenders match investors (institutional or individual) to loans that a  depository institution, such as a bank, originates (see fig. 2). If the loan is  made and transferred to investors, the platform lender services the  account. Investors have the option of either partially or fully funding a  loan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Who Uses It", "paragraphs": ["Consumers: can use term loans from marketplace lenders to cover  personal expenses (such as home or medical expenses); consolidate  debt; or refinance student loans, among other reasons. According to  Treasury, three marketplace lenders offer consumer loans ranging from  $1,000 to $40,000. Treasury also indicated that marketplace lending  firms generally provide consumer loans to prime and near-prime  borrowers although some marketplace lending firms target subprime  borrowers or applicants without credit scores or with a limited credit  history.", "Small Businesses: can use short and fixed-term loans, lines of credit, and  merchant cash advances from marketplace lenders, among other  products and services, to finance business expenses and expansions,  among other reasons.

According to an SBA Office of Advocacy publication,  LendingClub Corporation advertises that potential applicants can receive  a quote within minutes and that its approval and funding process typically  takes 7 days, Kabbage Inc. can provide same-day approval for small  business loans, and OnDeck can provide funding within 24 hours.

It can be difficult for  small businesses to understand and compare loan terms such as the total  cost of capital or the annual percentage rate. According to a Federal  Reserve 2015 survey, one reason for small business lenders\u2019  dissatisfaction with online lenders was a lack of transparency.", "Small business borrower protections: Current federal laws and  regulations applicable to marketplace lending generally apply to  consumer loans and not small business loans or other commercial  loans. For example, the Truth in Lending Act, which among other things,  requires the lender to show the cost and terms to the borrower, applies to  consumer loans but generally not small business loans. According to  Treasury, small business loans under $100,000 share common  characteristics with consumer loans, yet do not receive the same  protections. However, the report also notes that small business loans may  receive protection under the enforcement of fair lending laws under the  Equal Credit Opportunity Act.", "Use of less traditional data in credit decisions: Unlike traditional lending  companies that look at a person\u2019s credit reports (which include reported  installment credit and revolving credit), publications we reviewed indicate  that some marketplace lenders also take into account or have considered  using less traditional data (e.g., utilities, rent, telephone bills, educational history) during the underwriting process. However, according to  Treasury, data-driven algorithms used by marketplace lenders carry the  risk for potential fair lending violations. According to staff from FTC,  marketplace lenders must ensure that their practices meet fair lending  and credit reporting laws. The use of less traditional data also  introduces the risk that the data used are inaccurate and concerns that  consumers may not have sufficient recourse if the information being used  is incorrect.", "Uncertainty about performance in full credit cycle: According to  publications we reviewed, the marketplace lending subsector experienced  considerable growth following the 2007-2009 economic downturn in an  environment with tightened lending standards and low interest rates. In  addition, little is known about how the industry will perform in other  economic conditions such as a recession, which could lead to  delinquency and defaults of marketplace loans.

According to a CRS  report, in a white label partnership, a traditional bank sets underwriting  standards, originates the loan, and holds the loan once issued. The  bank can integrate a marketplace lending firm\u2019s technology services to  originate the loan. For example, JPMorgan Chase & Co. partnered with  OnDeck to offer small business loans to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  customers. In referral partnerships, banks refer customers who do not  meet a bank\u2019s underwriting standards, or who are seeking products the  bank does not offer, to a marketplace lender. In turn, the bank may collect  a fee from the marketplace lender. Referrals may also allow CDFIs to  reach customers that may otherwise not be served. For example, in 2015,  Regions Bank, Fundation Group LLC (an online small business  marketplace lender), and TruFund (a CDFI) partnered to provide small  loans to underserved small businesses.", "Self-regulatory efforts: A number of self-regulatory marketplace lending  efforts were established with the intent of developing responsible  innovation and mitigating and reporting risks to potential borrowers  seeking marketplace lending products.

Specifically, some marketplace  lenders that originate loans directly to consumers or businesses (e.g., a  direct marketplace lender) are generally required to obtain licenses and  register in each state in which they provide lending services. According  to officials from CSBS, state regulators then have the ability to  supervise these lenders, ensuring that the lender is complying with  state and federal lending laws. CSBS officials noted that the states  leverage the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System (NMLS) to facilitate  compliance with state-by-state licensing mechanisms.

For a transaction to be included,  network participants must validate the transaction. Once a transaction  has been confirmed, details of the transaction are recorded on the  blockchain that can be visible to network participants (see fig. 6).", "DLT solutions can have different types of access control.
