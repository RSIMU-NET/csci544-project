During the last 5 years, we have reported on a number of  programs run by OJP bureaus and offices. An overarching theme of these  reviews is a need for improvements in monitoring and evaluating the  myriad grant programs that OJP oversees. Our work has shown  longstanding problems with OJP grant monitoring and has begun to raise  questions about the methodological rigor of some of OJP\u2019s impact  evaluation studies. Monitoring and evaluation are the activities that  identify whether programs are operating as intended, whether they are  reaching those that should be served, and ultimately whether they are  making a difference in the fight against crime and delinquency. In other  words, these are major elements of assessing results. Our recent work has  focused mostly on discretionary grant programs administered by the  Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), the Violence Against Women Office  (VAWO), the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention  (OJJDP), the Executive Office for Weed and Seed (EOWS), and the Drug  Courts Program Office (DCPO). We have also examined National Institute  of Justice (NIJ) impact evaluations of some of these programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["OJP, the grant making arm of the Department of Justice (DOJ), provides  grants to various organizations, including state and local governments,  universities, and private foundations, that are intended to develop the  nation\u2019s capacity to prevent and control crime, administer justice, and  assist crime victims. OJP\u2019s assistant attorney general is responsible for  overall management and oversight of OJP through setting policy and  ensuring that OJP policies and programs reflect the priorities of the  president, the attorney general, and the Congress. The assistant attorney  general promotes coordination among OJP\u2019s five bureaus\u2014including BJA,  NIJ, and OJJDP\u2014as well as its seven program offices, including VAWO,  the Executive Office for Weed and Seed (EOWS), and the Drug Courts  Program Office.", "OJP bureaus and program offices award two types of grants: formula and  discretionary. Formula grants are awarded to state governments, which  then make subawards to state and local units of government.  Discretionary grants can be awarded on a competitive and non- competitive basis directly to states, local units of government, Indian  tribes and tribal organizations, individuals, educational institutions,  private nonprofit organizations, and private commercial organizations.  Bureaus and program offices, like BJA, VAWO, and OJJDP are, together  with OJP\u2019s Office of the Comptroller, responsible for monitoring OJP\u2019s  discretionary grants to ensure that they are being implemented as  intended, responsive to grant goals and objectives, and compliant with  statutory regulations and other policy guidelines. NIJ is OJP\u2019s principal  research and development agency and awards grants for the research and  evaluation of many of OJP\u2019s grant programs. OJJDP also funds research  and evaluation efforts associated with the juvenile justice system.", "Between fiscal years 1990 and 2000, OJP\u2019s budget grew, in constant fiscal  year 2000 dollars, by 323 percent, from about $916 million in fiscal year  1990 to nearly $3.9 billion in fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OJP\u2019s Efforts to Resolve Continuing Grant Monitoring Problems", "paragraphs": ["The monitoring of grant activities is a key management tool to help ensure  that funds awarded to grantees are being properly spent.

In  November 2001, in response to a request by Senators Sessions and  Grassley, we reported that grant files for discretionary grants awarded by  VAWO and under BJA\u2019s Byrne Program often lacked the documentation  necessary to ensure that required monitoring activities occurred. In  October 2001, at the request of Congressman Schaffer, we cited similar  problems with the monitoring of OJJDP discretionary grants\u2014problems  consistent with the lack of OJJDP monitoring documentation we reported  in May 1996. For example, our review of grant files for a representative  sample of OJJDP, BJA Byrne, and VAWO discretionary grants active in all  of fiscal years 1999 and/or 2000 showed the following:", "BJA and VAWO grant files did not always contain requisite grant  monitoring plans, whereas OJJDP grant files generally did. When  monitoring plans were in the files, grant managers from the three  organizations did not consistently document their monitoring activities,  such as site visits, according to the monitoring plans they developed.", "A substantial number of OJJDP, BJA Byrne, and VAWO grant files did not  contain progress and financial reports sufficient to cover the entire grant  period, contrary to OJP guidelines. Furthermore, Byrne and VAWO grantee  progress and financial reports were often submitted late by grantees.  These reports are an important management tool to help managers and  grant monitors determine if grantees are meeting program objectives and  financial commitments.", "BJA Byrne, VAWO, and OJJDP grant files did not always contain the  required closeout documents\u2014key documents by which OJP ensures that,  among other things, the final accounting of federal funds have been  received.", "We concluded that neither OJP, OJJDP, BJA, VAWO, nor GAO can  determine the level of monitoring performed by grant managers as  required by OJP and the comptroller general\u2019s internal control standards,  which call for documentation of all transactions and other significant  events to ensure that management directives are being carried out. We  recommended that OJJDP, BJA, and VAWO review why documentation  problems occurred and take steps to improve their documentation of grant  monitoring. We also recommended that OJP (1) study and recommend  ways to establish an approach to systematically test or review grant files  to ensure consistent documentation across OJP and (2) explore ways to  electronically compile and maintain documentation of monitoring  activities to facilitate more consistent documentation, more accessible  management oversight, and sound performance measurement.", "Also, in 1999, our report on the management of the Weed and Seed  Program showed similar results. Among other things, EOWS did not  always ensure that local Weed and Seed sites met critical requirements\u2014  almost one half of 177 sites funded in fiscal year 1998 had not submitted all  of the required progress reports. Furthermore, while EOWS was to  conduct site visits at all Weed and Seed sites, EOWS monitors did not  always document the results of these visits. We concluded that EOWS  lacked adequate management controls over its grant monitoring process  and recommended that EOWS improve program monitoring to ensure that  sites meet grant requirements for submitting progress reports and EOWS  document site visits.", "Our work has also shown that others, including OJP itself and the DOJ  Office of the Inspector General, have identified problems with grant  monitoring. Our November 2001 report discussed that, in 1996, an OJP- wide working group reported on various aspects of the grant process,  including grant administration and monitoring. Among other things, the  working group found that grant monitoring was not standardized in OJP;  given available resources, monitoring plans were overly ambitious,  resulting in failure to achieve the level of monitoring articulated; and an  OJP-wide tracking system was needed to facilitate control of the  monitoring process. The working group recommended that OJP establish  another working group to develop detailed operating procedures, giving  special attention to grant monitoring.", "Almost 4 years later, in February 2000, an independent contractor  delivered a report to OJP containing similar findings. The report stated  that OJP lacked consistent procedures and practices for performing grant  management functions, including grant monitoring, across the agency. For  example, the contractor found that (1) no formal guidance had been  provided grant managers about how stringent or flexible they should be  with grantees in enforcing deadlines, due dates, and other grant  requirements and (2) grant files were often not complete or reliable. The  contractor recommended that, among other things, OJP develop an  agencywide, coordinated and integrated monitoring strategy; standardize  procedures for conducting site visits and other monitoring activities; and  mandate the timeliness and filing of monitoring reports.", "Finally, the DOJ Office of the Inspector General has identified and  reported on OJP-wide monitoring problems and has identified grant  management as one of the 10 major management challenges facing DOJ. In  December 2000, the inspector general stated that DOJ\u2019s multibillion-dollar  grant programs are a high risk for fraud, given the amount of money  involved and the tens-of-thousands of grantees. Among other things, the  inspector general said that past reviews determined that many grantees  did not submit the required progress and financial reports and that  program officials\u2019 on-site reviews did not consistently address all grant  conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Too Early to Gauge Effectiveness of OJP\u2019s Efforts to Resolve Grant Monitoring Problems", "paragraphs": ["We reported in November 2001 that OJP had begun to work with bureaus  and offices to resolve some of the problems it and others have identified,  but it was too early to tell how effective these efforts will be in resolving  these issues. In its Fiscal Year 2000 Performance Report and Fiscal Year  2002 Performance Plan developed under the Government Performance  and Results Act of 1993, OJP established a goal to achieve the effective  management of grants. Among other things, DOJ plans to achieve this goal  by continued progress toward full implementation of a new grant  management system as a way of standardizing and streamlining the grant  process. According to the performance report and performance plan, the  grant management system will assist OJP in setting priorities for program  monitoring and facilitate timely program and financial reports from  grantees.", "At the time of our review, the new system covered grants for some  organizations up to the award stage. Since then, OJP has created a chief  information officer position charged with planning and implementing an  agency-side grant management system. According to the assistant attorney  general, the new system is envisioned to produce reports in response to  informational requests, provide information pertaining to grantees and all  resources provided by OJP, and maintain information from the opening to  the closing of a grant award. Although the assistant attorney general said  that OJP will consider the comptroller general\u2019s internal control standards  in taking these steps, it is unclear whether the new system will include the  full range and scope of monitoring activities.", "We also reported that OJP had been working on two other key efforts. One  of these initiatives, \u201cOperation Closeout,\u201d was a pilot project announced in  February 2000 by OJP\u2019s Working Group on Grant Administration that was  to, among other things, accelerate the grant closeout process through  revising closeout guidelines and elevating the importance of the closeout  function as a required procedure in the administration of grants. By  November 2000, OJP reported that this operation closed out 4,136  outstanding grants over a 6-month period, resulting in over $30 million in  deobligated funds. As of September 2001, OJP had plans to initiate another  closeout operation based on the success of the pilot.", "Another OJP initiative involved the issuance of new OJP-wide guidance for  grant administration, including grant monitoring. In January 2001, OJP  released its Grant Management Policies and Procedures Manual to update  and codify OJP\u2019s policies and procedures regarding its business practices. According to OJP officials, the new guidance was developed to reengineer  the grant management process based on the best practices of bureaus and  offices throughout OJP. At the time of our review, OJP had trained over  300 grant managers and had plans to train supervisors about the new  guidance. OJP also had planned to send a similar questionnaire to recently  trained grant managers and supervisors, respectively, to identify any  issues or problems with using the new manual and to identify potential  training interest and topics. However, there were no plans to test or  systematically monitor compliance with the new guidelines to ensure that  grant managers were fulfilling their responsibilities.", "OJP\u2019s bureaus and program offices have told us that they recognize that  they need to take some steps to respond to our recent recommendations,  but it is too early to tell if these actions will be effective. For example, in  response to our November 2001 report on the monitoring of Byrne and  VAWO discretionary grants, BJA said that it had, among other things, (1)  modified its internal grant tracking system to include tracking of events  such as site visits, phone contacts involving staff and grantees, and grant  closeouts and (2) developed more specific guidance for grantees on  completing progress reports to ensure more specific performance data are  obtained. VAWO said it had begun to develop both an internal monitoring  manual that would include procedures for development of monitoring  plans using a risk-based assessment tool and a management information  system that will eventually track the submission of progress and financial  reports.", "Likewise, in response to our October 2001 report on OJJDP grant  monitoring, OJJDP officials said they conducted an internal assessment of  grant monitoring activities and established an OJJDP standard for grant  administration and monitoring; a protocol for adhering to the standard;  and a set of tools for grant administration and monitoring. OJJDP said that  it anticipates OJJDP-wide implementation during fiscal year 2002. Finally,  with respect to our 1999 Weed and Seed report, EOWS said it recognizes  the need to improve program monitoring\u2014citing that it has a chronic  problem of grantees not submitting programmatic progress reports in a  timely manner\u2014and acknowledged the need to document all monitoring  visits. In a July 2000 letter, EOWS officials said that EOWS had taken steps  to improve program monitoring, including documentation of site  monitoring visits."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concerns about Impact Evaluation Studies", "paragraphs": ["We have also issued reports questioning the methodological rigor of  impact evaluation studies of various OJP grant programs. Impact  evaluations are intended to assess the net effect of a program by  comparing program outcomes with an estimate of what would have  happened in the absence of the program.", "Today, we are issuing a report on work undertaken at the request of  Senators Sessions and Grassley concerning the methodological rigor of  impact evaluations of a Byrne grant program and three VAWO  discretionary grant programs. During fiscal years 1995 through 2001, NIJ  awarded about $6 million for 5 Byrne and 5 VAWO discretionary grant  program evaluations. Of the 10 program evaluations, all 5 VAWO  evaluations were intended to measure the impact of the VAWO programs.  One of the 5 Byrne evaluations was designed as an impact evaluation. Our  in-depth review of the 4 impact evaluations that have progressed beyond  the formative stage showed that only 1 of these, the evaluation of the  Byrne Children at Risk (CAR) Program, was methodologically sound.", "The other 3 evaluations, all of which examined VAWO programs, had  methodological problems that raise concerns about whether the  evaluations will produce definitive results. Although program evaluation is  an inherently difficult task, in all 3 VAWO evaluations, the effort is  particularly arduous because of variations across grantee sites in how the  programs are implemented. In addition, VAWO sites participating in the  impact evaluations have not been shown to be representative of their  programs, thereby limiting the evaluators\u2019 ability to generalize results.  Further, the lack of nonprogram participant comparison groups hinders  their ability to minimize the effects of factors that are external to the  program and isolate the impact of the program alone. In some situations,  other means (other than comparison groups) can be effective in isolating  the impact of a program from other factors. However, in these evaluations,  effective alternative methods were not used. In addition, data collection  and analytical problems (e.g. related to statistical tests, assessment of  change) compromise the evaluators\u2019 ability to draw appropriate  conclusions from the results.", "We have made a recommendation in relation to the two VAWO impact  evaluations in the formative stage of development, and for all future  impact evaluations, to ensure that potential methodological design and  implementation problems are mitigated. The assistant attorney general  commented that she agreed with the substance of our recommendations  and has begun or plans to take steps to address them. It is still too early to  tell whether these actions will be effective in preventing or resolving the  problems we identified, but they appear to be steps in the right direction.", "Our in-depth review of 10 of OJJDP\u2019s impact evaluations of its own  programs undertaken since 1995 also raised some concerns about whether  many of the evaluations would produce definitive results. We reported  these concerns in an October 2001 report, requested by Congressman  Schaffer, on OJJDP grantee reporting requirements and evaluation  studies. At the time of our review, all of the 10 evaluations were ongoing,  with 5 in their formative stages and 5 well into implementation. As in the  report cited above, we noted that some of the evaluations we reviewed  were particularly difficult to design because sites varied in how they  implemented the same program. While these variations were intended to  allow communities to tailor programs to meet their unique needs, they will  make it difficult to interpret evaluation results when the studies are  completed. Two of the evaluations that were in their later stages and 3 of  those that were in their formative stages at the time of our review lacked  specific plans for comparison groups, which would aid in isolating the  impacts of the program from the effects of other factors that may have  influenced change. Furthermore, 3 of the 5 evaluations that were well into  implementation at the time of our review had developed data collection  problems.", "We recommended in our report that OJJDP assess the 5 impact  evaluations that were in their formative stages to address potential  comparison group and data collection problems and initiate any needed  interventions to help ensure the evaluations produce definitive results. In  commenting on a draft of our report, the assistant attorney general said  the report is an important tool that OJP would use to improve the quality  of its evaluations and to design programs to achieve greater impact.  Furthermore, OJP will assess the five impact evaluations in their formative  stages, as we recommended. Two months after our report\u2019s issuance, OJP  reported to us on the status of these evaluations. OJP informed us that  OJJDP had decided to discontinue 1 evaluation that had planned to use a  comparison group because of delays and difficulties in identifying a  comparison site. In addition, OJJDP is considering scaling back and  refocusing the scope of another evaluation because the program being  studied did not lend itself to an impact evaluation with comparison  groups.", "We have also reported on problems with evaluation studies of federally  funded drug court programs. In our 1997 report to the House and Senate  Judiciary Committees, we found, among other things, that differences  and methodological limitations in existing drug court evaluation studies  did not permit firm conclusions to be made on the overall impact or  effectiveness of drug court programs. We recommended that future drug  court program impact evaluations, funded by DOJ and others, be required  to include post-program data and comparison groups within their scope.  The preliminary results of our ongoing follow-up work on drug court  programs for Senators Grassley and Sessions indicate that various  administrative and research factors have hampered NIJ\u2019s efforts to  complete a national impact evaluation study, and that alternative plans for  addressing the impact of federally funded drug court programs, if  implemented, are not expected until year 2007. As a result, DOJ will  continue to lack near term information that the Congress, the public, and  other program stakeholders may need to determine the overall impact of  federally funded drug court programs and to assess whether these  programs are an effective use of federal funds. We expect to issue a report  on this issue in April 2002.", "In summary, OJP\u2019s grant programs have grown rapidly during the last  decade, increasing the importance of ensuring that they are achieving  intended results. Yet, repeated GAO reviews of grant monitoring and  impact evaluations across a variety of OJP entities have shown a need for  improvement. OJP itself and the DOJ Office of the Inspector General have  identified a need for improvements in grant management as well.", "Despite past commitments to shore up grant monitoring and better assess  program results, we have still found problems in very recent reports. The  recent reorganization plans and the anticipated management information  system have been cited as the foundation for positive changes in grants  management, including monitoring and evaluation. But, reorganization and  management information systems are only tools and are only as good as  the management that wields them. Commitment to improvement and  oversight are needed to ensure progress. Chairman Smith has recently  requested an assessment of NIJ\u2019s impact evaluation studies. This work  may lead to additional recommendations related to OJP grant evaluations.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
