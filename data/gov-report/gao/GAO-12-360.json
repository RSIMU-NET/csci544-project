Undisbursed balances are funds that  the federal awarding agency has obligated by entering into a grant  agreement, but the grantee has not drawn down, or the federal awarding  agency has not \u201cdisbursed.\u201d Once the grant\u2019s period of availability to the  grantee has expired, the grant can be closed out and the funds  deobligated by the awarding agency. Grant closeout is an important final  point of accountability for grantees that helps to ensure they have met all  financial requirements and have provided final reports, as required.  Closing out of grants also allows agencies to identify and redirect unused  funds to other projects and priorities as authorized or to return unspent  balances to the Treasury. Conversely, failure to close out grants could  allow grantees to draw down funds after the agreed-upon grant end date.  Federal regulations generally require that financial records and other  documents pertinent to a grant are to be retained for a period of 3 years   If a grant account is not  from the date of submission of the final report.closed out within this time frame, there is the risk that agencies may not  be able to obtain the documents needed to make the necessary financial  adjustments and collect any unallowable costs or erroneous payments.", "In 2008, we reported that our and inspectors general (IG) past audits of  federal agencies as well as agencies\u2019 annual performance reports had  suggested that failure to close out grants in a timely manner was a long- standing problem. We also found that when federal agencies made timely  grant closeout a high priority and took corrective actions, there were  improvements in grant closeouts and resolution of undisbursed funding.  In 2008, we recommended that the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) instruct agencies to track undisbursed balances that remain in  grantees\u2019 accounts after the grant funding period has ended and report on  the resolution of this funding in their annual performance reports\u2014 Performance and Accountability Reports (PAR) and Agency Financial  Reports (AFR). We stated that tracking undisbursed funding in expired  grant accounts and including the status of grant closeouts in annual  performance reports could raise the visibility of the problem both within  the agency and governmentwide and lead to improvements in the  timeliness of grant closeouts and a reduction in undisbursed balances.  OMB supported the intent of our recommendations, but it did not favor  having agencies track and report on these balances in their annual  performance reports and therefore did not take action.", "You asked us to update our previous analysis by evaluating: (1) the  amount of undisbursed funding remaining in expired grant accounts,  including the amounts that have remained unspent for at least 5 years or  more and for 10 years or more; (2) issues raised by us and federal IG  related to timely grant closeout by federal agencies; and (3) what actions  OMB and agencies have taken to track undisbursed balances in grants  eligible for closeout.", "To determine the amount of undisbursed balances in expired accounts,  we analyzed data from the quarterly closeout reports provided to users of  the largest civilian federal payment system\u2014the Payment Management  System (PMS) administered by the Department of Health and Human  Services\u2019 (HHS) Program Support Center (PSC)\u2014at the end of fiscal year   Closeout reports list all grant accounts that remain open more than  2011.3 months past the grant end date and for which there has been no  disbursement in the preceding 9 months.

While there can be significant  variation among different grant programs, most federal grants share a  common life cycle for administering the grants: pre-award, award,  implementation, and closeout (see fig. 1). During the award stage, the  federal awarding agency enters into an agreement with grantees  stipulating the terms and conditions for the use of grant funds including  the period of time funds are available for the grantee\u2019s use. Also in the  award stage, the awarding agency opens accounts in one of several  payment management systems through which grantees receive  payments. During the post-award stage, the grantee carries out the  requirements of the agreement and requests payments, while the  awarding agency approves payments and oversees the grantee. Once  the grantee has completed all the work associated with a grant  agreement or the end date for the grant has arrived, or both, the awarding  agency and grantee close out the grant. Closeout procedures ensure that  grantees have met all financial requirements, provided their final reports,  and returned any unspent balances.", "Grant closeout procedures, like other stages of the grant cycle, are  subject to a wide range of requirements derived from a combination of  OMB guidance, agency regulations, agency policy, and program-specific  statutes. OMB Circular No. A-110, Uniform Administrative Requirements  for Grants and Agreements with Institutions of Higher Education,  Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations, and OMB Circular No.   A-102, Grants and Cooperative Agreements with State and Local  Governments, provide OMB guidance to federal agencies on grant  administration. These circulars apply only to federal awarding agencies;  they do not apply directly to grantees. Each federal agency that awards  and administers grants and agreements that are subject to the guidance  in Circulars A-110 and A-102 is responsible for issuing regulations, with  which grantees must comply, that are consistent with the circulars, unless  different provisions are required by federal statute or are approved by  OMB.", "Agency regulations issued under the circulars typically impose closeout  procedures upon both the awarding agency and the grantee. Generally,  within 90 days after the completion of the award, grantees must submit all  financial, performance, and other reports as required by the terms and  conditions of the award. Also within this 90-day period, grantees  generally are to liquidate all obligations incurred under the award.  Grantees then are to promptly refund any remaining cash balances to the  awarding agency. Awarding agencies must make prompt payments, often  defined as within 90 days, to grantees for allowable reimbursable costs  under the award being closed out.conditions of the award, the awarding agency must make a settlement for  any upward or downward adjustment to the federal share of costs after  the closeout reports are received.

Expired appropriations accounts remain  available for 5 years to make adjustments, after which, the undisbursed  balances are canceled and returned to the Treasury.

Therefore, based on the information in PMS, these  expired grant accounts should be considered for grant closeout. Failure to  close out a grant in the payment system and deobligate any unspent  balances can allow grantees to continue to draw down federal funds in  the payment system even after the grant\u2019s period of availability to the  grantee has ended, making these funds more susceptible to waste, fraud,  or mismanagement.", "As figure 3 shows, we found that undisbursed balances remained in grant  accounts several years past their expiration date.

The risk increases after several years that  grantees will not have retained the financial documents and other  information for these grants that are needed by federal agencies to  properly reconcile financial information and make the necessary  adjustments to the grant award amount and the amount of federal funds  paid to the recipient, potentially resulting in the payment of unnecessary  and unallowable costs.", "While the amount of funds remaining in individual expired grant accounts  ranged from less than $1 to more than $19 million, a small percentage (a  little more than 1 percent) of grant accounts with undisbursed balances of  $1 million or more accounted for more than a third of the total  undisbursed funds in expired grant accounts. Overall, 123 accounts from  eight different federal agencies had more than $1 million in undisbursed  balances at the end of fiscal year 2011. These expired grant accounts  had a combined total of roughly $316 million in undisbursed balances, or  40 percent of the total undisbursed funding in expired grant accounts as  of September 30, 2011 (see fig. 4). Accounts with undisbursed balances  remaining at the end of the agreed-upon grant end date can indicate a  potential grant management problem. Data showing grantees that have  not expended large amounts of funding such as $1 million or more by the  specified grant end date raise concern that grantees have not fully met  the program objectives for the intended beneficiaries within the agreed- upon time frames.", "Roughly three-fourths of all undisbursed balances in expired grant  accounts ($594.7 million) in PMS as of September 30, 2011, were from  8,262 HHS-issued grants. HHS is the largest grant-making agency in the  federal government in terms of total dollars awarded and disbursed.

Since that time, we have issued additional reports identifying challenges  related to timely closeout of grants, and the Inspectors General at the  Departments of Agriculture (USDA), Education, Energy (DOE), HHS,  Homeland Security (DHS), and Labor (Labor) have all issued reports  identifying similar challenges in offices or programs within their respective  agencies. These reports identified a lack of adequate systems or policies  in place to properly monitor grant closeout and inadequacies in awarding  agencies\u2019 grant management processes, in part because closeouts are a  low management priority. While they focused on expired grants in specific  offices or grant programs, when taken together, these report findings  indicate that the timely closeout of grants continues to be an issue for  multiple programs and grant-making agencies across the federal  government.", "We found that agencies did not have adequate systems and policies in  place to properly monitor grant closeout. For example, in 2011, we  reported that USDA\u2019s draft grant closeout policies for the McGovern-Dole  Food for Education Program did not include time frames for when grant  agreements should be closed. As a result, this put USDA at risk that  grant agreements will not be closed out in a timely fashion, preventing  USDA from ensuring that grantees of the McGovern-Dole Food for  Education Program have met all financial requirements and that unused  or misused funds are promptly reimbursed to USDA. We recommended  that the Secretary of Agriculture formalize policies and procedures for  closing out grant agreements and establishing guidance to determine  when agreements should be closed. USDA agreed with our  recommendations and said it will take steps to address them. Similarly, in  2011 we found that roughly $24 million in Farm Labor Housing program  loan and grant obligations remained undisbursed more than 5 years after  the funds were obligated and that the Rural Housing Service had no  guidelines for deobligation in force.since issued guidance, as we had recommended.", "The Rural Housing Service has  We also found that agencies did not deobligate funds from grants eligible  for closeout in a timely manner. For example, in 2012, we reported that  Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Bulletproof Vest Partnership program had  not deobligated about $27 million in balances from grants awarded from  fiscal years 2002 through 2009 whose terms have ended and whose  grantees are no longer eligible for reimbursement. DOJ agreed with our recommendation that the department deobligate undisbursed funds from  Bulletproof Vest Partnership program grants that have closed and said  that in the absence of statutory restrictions stating otherwise, it intends to  use the deobligated, undisbursed funds to supplement appropriations in  fiscal years 2012 and 2013. In another example, we reported in 2010 that  recipients of 58 percent of Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Insular  Affairs project grants failed to submit final closeout reports on time, which  can delay the deobligation of any unspent grant funds from the project  account. The Department of Interior agreed with our recommendations  to improve the Office of Insular Affairs\u2019 ability to manage grants.", "Federal IGs identified similar issues at their agencies. For example, in  September 2009 the Inspector General at Labor reported that funds were  not deobligated when a grant expired because of delays in grant  closeouts. Also, grants from the Employment and Training Administration  and the Veteran\u2019s Employment and Training Service were not closed  within 12 months of their expiration because of a large backlog of grants  in need of close out. Service reported in April 2009 that it deobligated the $2.75 million in  response to a finding from the department\u2019s inspector general, making the  funds available for other research projects and preventing the potential  misuse of funds.

Lack of attention and staffing contribute to  delays in grant closeout and the timely deobligation of funds. For  example, DOE\u2019s Inspector General found that one of DOE\u2019s regional  offices was not closing out Small Business Innovation and Research  Phase II grants in a timely manner in part because staff focused their  attention instead on active awards. The Inspector General found expired  grants had been completed for more than 3 years but had not been  closed out. In addition, the Inspector General found questionable or  unallowable costs during their review of grant closeout. Because grantees  are only required to maintain annual audit and expense reports to support  progress on projects and costs incurred and other information for 3 years,  the supporting cost data may not be available for review, resulting in the  payment of unnecessary and unallowable costs.", "These findings are consistent with the results of a survey of IGs and other  investigative agencies by the National Procurement Fraud Task Force\u2019s  Grant Fraud Committee, a committee chaired by the Inspector General  for DOJ, which aims to detect and prevent grant fraud. Many respondents  to the survey suggested that grant awarding agencies are often focused  on awarding grant money and do not devote sufficient resources to the  oversight of how those funds are spent.

DOC reported  undisbursed balances, but could not confirm whether all of its grant- making bureaus reported expired appropriations or grant accounts. NASA  officials said that the number reported in their 2011 PAR represented the  amount of undisbursed balances in grant accounts that have reached  their end date and are eligible for closeout. Based on this understanding  of the guidance, NASA reported in its 2011 PAR that in 2009 there were  about 1,650 expired grants with $18 million in undisbursed balances.

In our 2008 report, we found that agencies can  improve their grant closeout process when they direct their attention to  the issue and make timely grant closeout a high priority. Since this time,  HHS has increased attention on grant closeout, and both the agency and  its independent auditor have reported that progress has been made  toward addressing the agency\u2019s existing backlog of grant accounts in  PMS eligible for closeout.

The definition included  in guidance issued by OMB equates \u201cexpired grant accounts\u201d with grants  funded with expired appropriations and therefore includes active grant  agreements still in the implementation phase for which the agency would  have valid reasons to make future disbursements.

Federal payment  systems facilitate the transfer of cash payments from federal awarding  agencies to grantees. Some agencies make grant payments directly to  grantees using their own proprietary payment systems, while others enter  into arrangements with payment systems that serve multiple agencies to  make payments on their behalf. The PMS and ASAP systems were  selected for review based on the following criteria:  1.  These payment systems provide payment services to other federal  departments and entities. In 2011, offices from 13 federal  departments and other federal entities used PMS for making grant  disbursements, and offices from 9 federal departments and other  federal entities used ASAP for grant disbursements.

Agencies use their accounting systems to send authorization  transactions to PMS. If an agency\u2019s authorization transaction will  create an overadvanced account in PMS, the transaction is sent to an  exception file for review.

For illustrative purposes, we multiplied the monthly fees for these  accounts by 12 to obtain a rough approximation of what the total annual  fees charged for these accounts would be assuming that all accounts with  no undisbursed balances remaining balance as of September 30, 2011,  had a zero dollar balance for the entire fiscal year.", "To test the reliability of PMS closeout data, we (1) reviewed existing  documentation related to PMS, including the most recent audit of the  design and operating effectiveness of the system\u2019s controls, (2)  interviewed officials responsible for administration of the database on  data entry and editing procedures and the production of closeout reports,  and (3) conducted electronic testing for obvious errors in completeness  and accuracy. An independent auditor assessed internal controls for PMS  in 2011 and reported that, with one exception, the controls were suitably  designed to provide reasonable assurance the control objectives would  be achieved if the controls operated effectively. We discussed with HHS  officials data entry and editing procedures, the production of closeout  reports, and any known limitations associated with the data. According to  HHS officials, no-cost extensions that extend the grant period without  changing the authorized amount of funding may not be reflected in PMS  data. As a result, PMS closeout reports may include grants that have  received an extension and are therefore not eligible for closeout. No  obvious errors in completeness and accuracy were identified during  electronic testing. After conducting these assessment steps, we found  that the PMS closeout data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Analysis of Dormant Grant Account Data from ASAP", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Description of ASAP System", "paragraphs": ["ASAP is an electronic payment system implemented jointly by the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Financial Management Service  (FMS) and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. ASAP allows grantee  organizations receiving federal funds to draw from accounts  preauthorized by federal agencies. In addition to grants, ASAP is also  used to make payments to financial agents that are performing financial  services for FMS and other federal agencies. For example, ASAP can be  used for reimbursing financial institutions for payments made by federal  agencies through debit cards. Agencies establish and maintain accounts  in ASAP to facilitate the flow of funds to organizations. Unlike PMS grant  accounts, which represent an individual grant agreement between a  federal agency and grantee, accounts in ASAP can represent multiple  grant agreements between an awarding agency and a grantee. Individual  grant agreements within these accounts may have reached their grant  end date, while others may not have. Therefore, the ASAP system cannot  be used to determine which individual grants are eligible for closeout.", "FMS officials began issuing \u201cdormant account reports\u201d to all ASAP users  in 2009 as a response, Treasury officials told us, to the findings in our  2008 report that using federal payment systems to track undisbursed  balances in grant accounts can help reduce unused funding. Dormant  account reports provide information on all inactive ASAP accounts,  including accounts for nongrant programs. For the purposes of this report,  our focus was on accounts for grant programs only. The first dormant  account report focused only on undisbursed balances in accounts where  the grantee had not drawn down funds for a prolonged period of time.  However, the criteria used by FMS for generating dormant account  reports have evolved over time to improve the usability of the reports. For  the dormant account report provided to us for the end of fiscal year 2011,  accounts with undisbursed balances were included if: (1) the grantee had  not drawn down funds for at least 2 years, and (2) the awarding agency  had made no changes to the authorized amount of funding available for at  least 2 years. For each grant account, the report includes information  such as the identification number, the account balance, the cumulative  amount of funding authorized to the grantee, and the date of the last  payment request. The grant account end date is an optional field  completed by the awarding agency. FMS did not include accounts with no  balance remaining on this report, but has encouraged agencies to close  these accounts if they are no longer active. FMS does not charge users  for these accounts or for other payment system services provided by the  ASAP system and instead receives appropriations to cover the cost of its  operations.", "According to FMS officials, dormant account reports are generally  provided twice a year, allowing agencies to track progress on addressing  inactive accounts. The first report lists all of the dormant accounts as of a  specific date, and the second report shows agencies\u2019 progress toward  addressing dormant accounts included on the first report. For this report,  we reviewed the most recently available dormant account report for the  end of fiscal year 2011. This report listed all ASAP accounts that have  not had any activity (i.e., no payment requests and no funding added or  removed) since September 30, 2009.", "To test the reliability of ASAP dormant account report data, we:   (1) reviewed existing documentation related to the ASAP system,   (2) interviewed officials responsible for administration of the database on  data entry and editing procedures and the production of dormant account  reports, and (3) conducted electronic testing for obvious errors in  completeness and accuracy. We discussed with FMS officials internal  control testing and other quality review procedures for the ASAP system  as well as dormant account reports. We also discussed missing data in  certain fields on the dormant account report identified during electronic  testing to ensure that omissions did not indicate potential errors.

Based on our  review for this report, we identified IG reports on HHS, Departments of  Energy and Homeland Security, and the Environmental Protection  Agency with findings of weaknesses related to undisbursed grant  balance, or grant closeout. We then interviewed IG officials at these four  agencies to discuss their findings and any plans to conduct future audits  on undisbursed grant funds.
