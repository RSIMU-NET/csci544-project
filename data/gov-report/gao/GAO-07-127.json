Due to the significance of the federal debt held by the public to the governmentwide financial statements, GAO has also been auditing the Bureau of the Public Debt's (BPD) Schedules of Federal Debt annually. The audit of these schedules is done to determine whether, in all material respects, (1) the schedules are reliable and (2) BPD management maintained effective internal control relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt. Further, we test compliance with selected provisions of significant laws related to the Schedule of Federal Debt. Federal debt managed by BPD consists of Treasury securities held by the public and by certain federal government accounts, referred to as intragovernmental debt holdings. The level of debt held by the public reflects how much of the nation's wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance prior federal spending in excess of federal revenues. Intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of Treasury securities held by federal government accounts, primarily federal trust funds such as Social Security, that typically have an obligation to invest their excess annual receipts over disbursements in federal securities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In GAO's opinion, BPD's Schedules of Federal Debt for fiscal years 2006 and 2005 were fairly presented in all material respects and BPD maintained effective internal control relevant to the Schedule of Federal Debt as of September 30, 2006. GAO also found no instances of noncompliance in fiscal year 2006 with selected provisions of the statutory debt limit and debt issuance suspension period laws we tested. As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, federal debt managed by BPD totaled about $8,493 billion and $7,918 billion, respectively. At the end of fiscal year 2006, debt held by the public as a percentage of the U.S. economy is estimated at 36.9 percent, compared to 34.1 percent at the end of fiscal year 2002. Further, certain trust funds (e.g., Social Security) continue to run surpluses, resulting in increased intragovernmental debt holdings. These debt holdings are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and represent a priority call on budgetary resources. As a result, total gross federal debt has increased 37 percent between the end of fiscal years 2002 and 2006. During fiscal year 2006, a debt issuance suspension period was invoked to avoid breaching the statutory debt limit. On March 20, 2006, legislation was enacted to raise the debt limit by $781 billion to $8,965 billion. This was the fourth occurrence since 2002 that the statutory debt limit had to be raised to avoid breaching the statutory debt limit. During that time, the debt limit has increased more than $3 trillion, from $5,950 billion in 2002 to the current limit of $8,965 billion. Total federal debt increased over each of the last 4 fiscal years. Debt held by the public increased during this 4-year period primarily as a result of annual unified budget deficits. Intragovernmental debt holdings steadily increased during this 4-year period primarily due to excess receipts over disbursements in federal trust funds (e.g., Social Security)."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The accompanying auditor\u2019s report presents the results of our audits of the  Schedules of Federal Debt Managed by the Bureau of the Public Debt for  the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005.  The Schedules of  Federal Debt present the beginning balances, increases and decreases, and  ending balances for (1) Federal Debt Held by the Public and  Intragovernmental Debt Holdings, (2) the related Accrued Interest  Payables, and (3) the related Net Unamortized Premiums and Discounts  managed by the bureau.", "The auditor\u2019s report contains our (1) opinion on the Schedules of Federal  Debt for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2006 and 2005, (2) opinion on  the effectiveness of relevant internal control as of September 30, 2006,   (3) conclusion on the bureau\u2019s compliance in fiscal year 2006 with selected  provisions of laws we tested, and (4) conclusion on the consistency  between information in the Schedules of Federal Debt and the  accompanying Overview on Federal Debt Managed by the Bureau of the  Public Debt.", "As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, federal debt managed by the bureau  totaled about $8,493 billion and $7,918 billion, respectively, for moneys  borrowed to fund the federal government\u2019s operations.  As shown on the  Schedules of Federal Debt, these balances consisted of approximately   (1) $4,843 billion as of September 30, 2006, and $4,601 billion as of  September 30, 2005, of debt held by the public and about (2) $3,650 billion  as of September 30, 2006, and $3,317 billion as of September 30, 2005, of  intragovernmental debt holdings.", "The level of debt held by the public reflects how much of the nation\u2019s  wealth has been absorbed by the federal government to finance prior  federal spending in excess of federal revenues.  It best represents the  cumulative effect of past federal borrowing on today\u2019s economy and the  federal budget.  To finance a cash deficit, the federal government borrows  from the public. When a cash surplus occurs, the annual excess funds can  then be used to reduce debt held by the public.  In other words, annual cash  deficits or surpluses generally approximate the annual net change in the  amount of federal government borrowing from the public.", "Intragovernmental debt holdings represent balances of Treasury securities  held by federal government accounts, primarily federal trust funds (e.g.,  Social Security), that typically have an obligation to invest their excess  annual receipts over disbursements in federal securities.  Most federal trust  funds invest in special U.S. Treasury securities that are guaranteed for  principal and interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.   The transactions relating to the use of the federal government accounts\u2019  surpluses net out on the federal government\u2019s consolidated financial  statements because, in effect, they represent loans from one part of the  federal government to another.  These securities are nonmarketable;  however, they represent a priority call on future budgetary resources.", "While both are important, debt held by the public and intragovernmental  debt holdings are very different.  Debt held by the public approximates the  federal government\u2019s competition with other sectors in the credit markets.   Federal borrowing absorbs resources that would otherwise be available for  private investment and may put upward pressure on interest rates.  In  addition, interest on debt held by the public is paid in cash and represents a  burden on current taxpayers.  It reflects the amount the federal  government pays to its outside creditors.  In contrast, intragovernmental  debt holdings perform an accounting function but typically do not require  cash payments from the current budget or represent a burden on the  current economy.  In addition, from the perspective of the budget as a  whole, interest payments to federal government accounts by the Treasury  are entirely offset by the income received by such accounts. This  intragovernmental debt and the interest on it represents a claim on future  resources and hence a burden on future taxpayers and the future economy.   Specifically, when trust funds redeem Treasury securities to obtain cash to  fund expenditures, and Treasury borrows from the public to finance these  redemptions, there is competition with the private sector and thus an effect  on the economy.", "Over the past decade that we have audited the Schedule of Federal Debt,  managing the federal debt has been a challenge as evidenced by the growth  of total federal debt by $3,283 billion, or 63 percent, during this period,  from $5,210 billion as of October 1, 1996, to $8,493 billion as of September  30, 2006. As a result of the increasing debt, again this past year, Congress  had to enact legislation to increase the debt limit to avoid breaching the  statutory debt limit. On March 20, 2006, Congress increased the statutory  debt limit from $8,184 billion to $8,965 billion. This was the fourth  occurrence since 2002 that Congress has raised the statutory debt limit,  with the debt limit increasing over $3 trillion, from $5,950 billion to $8,965  billion, over that period.", "Over the last several years, we have noted a trend in the amount of  Treasury securities held by foreign and international investors. According  to amounts reported in the September 2006 Treasury Bulletin, Treasury  estimates that the amount of Treasury securities held by foreign and  international investors has increased $957 billion, from $1,135 billion as of  June 30, 2002, to $2,092 billion as of June 30, 2006.  As of June 30, 2006, this  represents an estimated 44 percent of debt held by the public, up from  about 33 percent as of June 30, 2002. The United States benefits from  foreign purchases of Treasury securities because foreign investors fill part  of the U.S. government\u2019s borrowing needs. However, to service this foreign- held debt, the U.S. government must send interest payments abroad, which  adds to the incomes of residents of other countries rather than to the  incomes of U.S. residents. In addition, this increasing reliance on foreign  investors to finance the deficits of the U.S. government presents potential  risk to the U.S. economy, especially since the U.S. gross national saving  rate is low by U.S. historical standards.", "The challenge of managing the federal debt is not likely to diminish any  time soon.  At the end of fiscal year 2006, debt held by the public as a share  of gross domestic product (GDP) is estimated at 36.9 percent, down from  37.5 percent last year but well above the 34.1 percent at the end of fiscal  year 2002.  In addition, gross federal debt has increased 37 percent during  the same period, from $6,213 billion, as of September 30, 2002, to $8,493  billion, as of September 30, 2006.  This increase represents an additional  burden on future generations and the future economy.  Further, interest  expense on debt held by the public continued to grow rapidly, rising about  22 percent above the fiscal year 2005 level.  As federal debt is expected to  continue rising in both the near and long term, the amount the government  pays to finance that debt will grow as well and place increasing pressure on  the federal budget.", "The pending retirement of the Baby Boom generation and rising health care  costs will soon place unprecedented and long-lasting stress on the federal  budget, raising debt held by the public to unprecedented levels as a share  of GDP.   GAO\u2019s long-range fiscal policy simulations show that the nation\u2019s  current fiscal condition is but a prelude to a much more daunting long-term  fiscal challenge.  Absent significant changes on the spending or revenue  sides of the budget, or both, these long-term deficits will encumber a  growing share of federal resources and test the capacity of current and  future generations to afford both today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s commitments.   Continuing on this unsustainable path will gradually erode, if not suddenly  damage, our economy, our standard of living, and ultimately our national  security.", "As discussed earlier, federal debt managed by the bureau totaled about $8.5  trillion at the end of fiscal year 2006.  However, that number excludes many  items, including the gap between scheduled and funded Social Security and  Medicare benefits, veterans\u2019 health care, and a range of other commitments  and contingencies that the federal government has pledged to support.  If  these items are factored in, the present value of the total burden is  estimated to be about $50 trillion.  Stated differently, the estimated current  total burden for every American is more than $160,000\u2014and every day that  burden becomes larger.", "Addressing the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal imbalance constitutes a major  transformational challenge that may take a generation or more to resolve.

As of September 30, 2006 and 2005, outstanding gross federal debt managed by the bureau totaled $8,493 and $7,918 billion, respectively.  The increase in gross federal  debt of $575 billion during fiscal year 2006 was due to an increase in gross intragovernmental debt holdings of $333 billion and an  increase in gross debt held by the public of $242 billion.  As Figure 1 illustrates, both intragovernmental debt holdings and debt held  by the public have steadily increased since fiscal year 2002.  The primary reason for the increases in intragovernmental debt holdings  is the annual surpluses in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and Military Retirement Fund.  The increases in debt  held by the public are due primarily to total federal spending exceeding total federal revenues.  As of September 30, 2006, gross debt  held by the public totaled $4,843 billion and gross intragovernmental debt holdings totaled $3,650 billion.

The  primary components of interest expense are interest paid on the debt held by the public and interest credited to federal government  trust funds and other federal government accounts that hold Treasury securities.  The interest paid on the debt held by the public  affects the current spending of the federal government and represents the burden in servicing its debt (i.e., payments to outside creditors).  Interest credited to federal government trust funds and other federal government accounts, on the other hand, does not  result in an immediate outlay of the federal government because one part of the government pays the interest and another part  receives it.  However, this interest represents a claim on future budgetary resources and hence an obligation on future taxpayers.  This  interest, when reinvested by the trust funds and other federal government accounts, is included in the programs\u2019 excess funds not  currently needed in operations, which are invested in federal securities.  During fiscal year 2006, interest expense incurred totaled  $404 billion, interest expense on debt held by the public was $221 billion, and $183 billion was interest incurred for  intragovernmental debt holdings.  As Figure 2 illustrates, total interest expense decreased from fiscal year 2002 to 2003, but increased  in fiscal years 2004 through 2006.
