Thus, strategic human capital management at the Department of Defense (DOD) can help it marshal, manage, and maintain the people and skills needed to meet its critical mission. In November 2003, Congress provided DOD with significant flexibility to design a modern human resources management system. On November 1, 2005, DOD and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) jointly released the final regulations on DOD's new human resources management system, known as the National Security Personnel System (NSPS). Several months ago, with the release of the proposed regulations, GAO observed that some parts of the human resources management system raised questions for DOD, OPM, and Congress to consider in the areas of pay and performance management, adverse actions and appeals, and labor management relations. GAO also identified multiple implementation challenges for DOD once the final regulations for the new system were issued. This testimony provides GAO's overall observations on selected provisions of the final regulations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO believes that DOD's final NSPS regulations contain many of the basic principles that are consistent with proven approaches to strategic human capital management. For instance, the final regulations provide for (1) a flexible, contemporary, market-based and performance-oriented compensation system--such as pay bands and pay for performance; (2) giving greater priority to employee performance in its retention decisions in connection with workforce rightsizing and reductions-in-force; and (3) involvement of employee representatives throughout the implementation process, such as having opportunities to participate in developing the implementing issuances. However, future actions will determine whether such labor relations efforts will be meaningful and credible. Despite these positive aspects of the regulations, GAO has several areas of concern. First, DOD has considerable work ahead to define the important details for implementing its system--such as how employee performance expectations will be aligned with the department's overall mission and goals and other measures of performance, and how DOD would promote consistency and provide general oversight of the performance management system to ensure it is administered in a fair, credible, transparent manner. These and other critically important details must be defined in conjunction with applicable stakeholders. Second, the regulations merely allow, rather than require, the use of core competencies that can help to provide consistency and clearly communicate to employees what is expected of them. Third, although the regulations do provide for continuing collaboration with employee representatives, they do not identify a process for the continuing involvement of individual employees in the implementation of NSPS. Going forward, GAO believes that (1) DOD would benefit from developing a comprehensive communications strategy, (2) DOD must ensure that it has the necessary institutional infrastructure in place to make effective use of its new authorities, (3) a chief management officer or similar position is essential to effectively provide sustained and committed leadership to the department's overall business transformation effort, including NSPS, and (4) DOD should develop procedures and methods to initiate implementation efforts relating to NSPS. While GAO strongly supports human capital reform in the federal government, how it is done, when it is done, and the basis on which it is done can make all the difference in whether such efforts are successful. DOD's regulations are especially critical and need to be implemented properly because of their potential implications for related governmentwide reform. In this regard, in our view, classification, compensation, critical hiring, and workforce restructuring reforms should be pursued on a governmentwide basis before and separate from any broad-based labor-management or due process reforms."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to provide our observations  on the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) final National Security Personnel  System (NSPS) regulations, which the Secretary of Defense and the  Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) published earlier  this month. NSPS will not only affect the roughly 700,000 DOD civilian  employees, but it could have far-reaching implications for civil service  reform across the federal government.", "As I have previously testified, we support moving forward with  appropriate human capital reform, but how it is done, when it is done, and  the basis on which it is done can make all the difference in whether such  efforts are successful. Human capital reforms to date recognize that the  \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach is not appropriate to all agencies\u2019 demands,  challenges, and missions. However, we have reported that a reasonable  degree of consistency across the government is desirable and that broader  reforms should be guided by a common framework consisting of  principles, criteria, and processes. The final NSPS regulations, if  implemented properly, could go a long way in the area of helping to shape  such a framework and serve, along with GAO\u2019s, the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s, and other reform efforts, as a potential model for  governmentwide reform in the area of human capital management."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Observations on DOD\u2019s Final Human Capital Regulations", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s final NSPS regulations establish a new human resources  management system within the department that is intended to ensure its  ability to attract, retain, and reward a workforce that is able to meet its  critical mission.

We have  reported that individuals inevitably worry during any change management  initiative because of uncertainty over new policies and procedures. A key  practice to help address this worry is to involve employees and their  representatives to obtain their ideas and gain their ownership for the  initiative throughout the development process and related implementation  effort.", "We continue to believe that many of the basic principles underlying DOD\u2019s  final regulations are generally consistent with proven approaches to  strategic human capital management.

To this end, DOD\u2019s final  regulations take another valuable step toward a modern performance  management system that provides for elements of a more market-based  and performance-oriented pay system. For instance, the final regulations  provide for the creation of pay bands for most of DOD\u2019s civilian workforce  that would replace the 15-grade General Schedule (GS) system now in  place for most civil service employees. Specifically, DOD, after  coordination with OPM, may define occupational career groups and levels  of work within each career group that are tailored to the department\u2019s  missions and components. The final regulations also give DOD  considerable discretion, after coordination with OPM, to set and annually  adjust the minimum and maximum rates of pay for each of those career  groups or bands, based on national and local labor market factors and  other conditions such as availability of funds. In addition, the regulations  provide that DOD may, after coordination with OPM, set and annually  adjust local market supplements for different career groups or for  different bands within the same career group. We strongly support the  need to expand pay reform in the federal government and believe that  implementing more market-based and performance-oriented pay systems  is both doable and desirable. The federal government\u2019s current pay system  is heavily weighted toward rewarding length of service rather than  individual performance and contributions, including requiring across-the- board annual pay increases, even to poor performers. It also compensates  employees living in various localities without adequately considering the  local labor market rates applicable to the diverse types of occupations in  the area.", "Regarding performance management issues, we identified several issues in  earlier testimonies that DOD will need to continue to address as it moves  forward with the implementation of the system. These include aligning  individual performance to organizational goals, using competencies to  provide a fuller assessment of employee performance, making meaningful  distinctions in employee performance, and continuing to incorporate  adequate safeguards to ensure fairness and guard against abuse."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Aligning Individual Performance to Organizational Goals", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with leading practices, the DOD final regulations stipulate that  the performance management system will, among other things, align  individual performance expectations with the department\u2019s overall  mission and strategic goals, organizational program and policy objectives,  annual performance plans, and other measures of performance. DOD\u2019s  performance management system can be a vital tool for aligning the  organization with desired results and creating a \u201cline of sight\u201d showing  how team, unit, and individual performance can contribute to overall  organizational results. To this end, an explicit alignment of daily activities  with broader results is one of the defining features of effective  performance management systems in high-performing organizations. In  our previous testimony on DOD proposed NSPS regulations, we testified  that the regulations did not detail how DOD was to achieve such an  alignment. The final regulations were not modified to provide such details.

These include, among others, goals or objectives that set  general or specific performance targets at the individual, team, or  organizational level; a particular work assignment, including  characteristics such as quality, quantity, accuracy, or timeliness; core  competencies that an employee is expected to demonstrate on the job; or  the contributions that an employee is expected to make. In a previous  testimony, we reported that DOD needed to define, in more detail than  was provided in the proposed regulations, how performance expectations  will be set. In addition, public comments to the proposed regulations  expressed concerns about the variety of forms that performance  expectations could take. In response to public comments to its proposed  regulations and feedback obtained during the meet and confer process  with employee representatives, DOD modified the proposed regulations,  so that the final regulations state that the basic performance expectations  should be provided to employees in writing.", "As DOD develops its implementing issuances, the experiences of leading  organizations suggest that DOD should reconsider its position of merely  allowing, rather than requiring, the use of core competencies as a central  feature of its performance management system. Based on our review of  others\u2019 efforts and our own experience at GAO, core competencies can  help reinforce employee behaviors and actions that support the  department\u2019s mission, goals, and values and can provide a consistent  message to employees about how they are expected to achieve results.  By including competencies such as change management, achieving results,  teamwork and collaboration, cultural sensitivity, and information sharing,  DOD could create a shared responsibility for organizational success and  help ensure accountability for the transformation process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Making Meaningful Distinctions in Employee Performance", "paragraphs": ["High-performing organizations make meaningful distinctions between  acceptable and outstanding performance of individuals and appropriately  reward those who perform at the highest level. These organizations seek  to create pay, incentive, and reward systems that clearly link employee  knowledge, skills, and contributions to organizational results. As in the  proposed regulations, DOD\u2019s final regulations stated that DOD supervisors  and managers are to be held accountable for making meaningful  distinctions among employees based on performance and contribution,  fostering and rewarding excellent performance, and addressing poor  performance.", "Consistent with the proposed regulations, the final regulations provide for  a multilevel rating system for evaluating employee performance. However,  the final regulations do not specify exactly how many rating levels will be  used. We urge DOD to consider using at least four summary rating levels  to allow for greater performance-rating and pay differentiation. This  approach is in the spirit of the new governmentwide performance-based  pay system for the Senior Executive Service (SES), which requires at least  four rating levels to provide a clear and direct link between SES  performance and pay as well as to make meaningful distinctions based on  relative performance. Cascading this approach to other levels of  employees can help DOD recognize and reward employee contributions  and achieve the highest levels of individual performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Adequate Safeguards to Ensure Fairness and Guard Against Abuse", "paragraphs": ["As DOD develops its implementing issuances, it needs to continue building  safeguards into its performance management system to ensure fairness  and guard against abuse. A concern that employees often express about  any pay for performance system is supervisors\u2019 ability and willingness to  assess performance fairly. Using safeguards, such as having an  independent body to conduct reasonableness reviews of performance  management decisions, can help allay these concerns and build a fair,  credible, and transparent system. In our previous testimonies, we noted  that although DOD\u2019s proposed regulations provided for some safeguards,  additional safeguards should be developed. However, the final regulations  do not offer details on how DOD would, among other things, (1) promote  consistency and provide general oversight of the performance  management system to ensure it is administered in a fair, credible, and  transparent manner; and (2) incorporate predecisional internal safeguards  to achieve consistency and equity, and ensure nondiscrimination and  nonpoliticization of the performance management process. As DOD moves  forward, it will need to commit itself to define, in more detail than is  currently provided, how it plans to review such matters as the  establishment and implementation of the performance appraisal system\u2014 and, subsequently, performance rating decisions, pay determinations, and  promotion actions\u2014before these actions are finalized, to ensure they are  merit based."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Staffing and Employment", "paragraphs": ["The authorizing legislation allows DOD to implement additional hiring  flexibilities that would allow it to (1) determine that there is a severe  shortage of candidates or a critical hiring need and (2) use direct-hire  procedures for these positions. Under current law, OPM, rather than the  agency, determines whether there is a severe shortage of candidates or a  critical hiring need. Direct-hire authority allows an agency to appoint  candidates to positions without adherence to certain competitive  examining requirements (such as veterans\u2019 preference or numerically  rating candidates based on experience, training, and education) when  there is a severe shortage of qualified candidates or a critical hiring need.", "In our previous testimonies, we noted that while we strongly endorse  providing agencies with additional tools and flexibilities to attract and  retain needed talent, additional analysis may be needed to ensure that any  new hiring authorities are consistent with a focus on merit principles, the  protection of employee rights, and results. Hiring flexibilities alone will  not enable federal agencies to acquire the personnel necessary to  accomplish their missions. Agencies must first conduct gap analyses of the  critical skills and competencies needed in their workforces now and in the  future, or they may not be able to effectively design strategies to hire,  develop, and retain the best possible workforces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Workforce Shaping", "paragraphs": ["Similar to the proposed regulations, the final NSPS regulations allow DOD  to reduce, realign, and reorganize the department\u2019s workforce through  revised reduction-in-force (RIF) procedures. For example, employees  would be placed on a retention list in the following order: tenure group  (i.e., a career employee, including an employee serving an initial  probationary period and an employee serving on a term appointment),  veterans\u2019 preference eligibility (disabled veterans will be given additional  priority), level of performance, and length of service. In a change from the  proposed regulations, employees serving in an initial probationary period  have a lower retention standing than career employees (i.e., permanent  will be listed first, followed by employees serving an initial probationary  period, and then followed by employees on temporary appointments). In  another change, the final regulations reflect the use of more than one  year\u2019s performance ratings in placing employees on the retention list.  Under current regulations, length of service is considered ahead of level of  performance. I have previously testified, prior to the enactment of NSPS,  in support of revised RIF procedures that would require much greater  consideration of an employee\u2019s performance.", "DOD\u2019s approach to reducing, realigning, and reorganizing should be  oriented toward strategically shaping the makeup of its workforce if it is to  ensure the orderly transfer of institutional knowledge and achieve mission  results. DOD\u2019s final regulations include some changes that would allow  DOD to rightsize the workforce more carefully through greater precision  in defining competitive areas, and by reducing the disruption associated  with RIF orders as their affect ripples through an organization. Under the  current regulations, the minimum RIF competitive area is broadly defined  as an organization under separate administration in a local commuting  area. Under the final NSPS regulations, DOD would be able to establish a  minimum RIF competitive area on a more targeted basis, using one or  more of the following factors: geographical location, line of business,  product line, organizational unit, and funding line. The final regulations  also provide DOD with the flexibility to develop additional competitive  groupings on the basis of career group, occupational series or specialty,  and pay band. Under the current GS system, DOD can establish  competitive groups based only on employees (1) in the excepted and  competitive service, (2) under different excepted service appointment  authorities, (3) with different work schedules, (4) in the same pay  schedule, or (5) in trainee status. The new reforms could help DOD  approach rightsizing more carefully; however, as I have stated, agencies  first need to identify the critical skills and competencies needed in their  workforce if they are to effectively implement their new human capital  flexibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Adverse Actions and Appeals", "paragraphs": ["Similar to DOD\u2019s proposed regulations, the final regulations are intended  to streamline the employee adverse action process. While the final  regulations contain some features meant to ensure that employees receive  due process, such as advance written notice of a proposed adverse action,  they do not require DOD managers to provide employees with  performance improvement periods, as is required under existing law for  other federal employees. It is too early to tell what affect, if any, these final  regulations will have on DOD\u2019s operations and employees or on other  entities involved in the adverse action process, such as the Merit Systems  Protection Board (MSPB). Close monitoring of any unintended  consequences, such as on the MSPB and its ability to manage adverse  action cases from DOD and other federal agencies, is warranted.", "Similar to the proposed regulations, DOD\u2019s final regulations also modify  the current federal system by providing the Secretary of Defense with the  sole, exclusive, and unreviewable authority to identify specific offenses for  which removal is mandatory. In our previous testimonies, we noted that  DOD\u2019s proposed regulations only indicated that its employees would be  made aware of the mandatory removal offenses. We also noted that the  process for determining and communicating which types of offenses  require mandatory removal should be explicit and transparent, and involve  relevant congressional stakeholders, employees, and employee  representatives. Moreover, we suggested that DOD exercise caution when  identifying specific removable offenses and the associated punishment,  and noted that careful drafting of each removable offense is critical to  ensure that the provision does not have unintended consequences. In a  change from the proposed regulations, DOD\u2019s final regulations explicitly  provide for publishing a list of the mandatory removal offenses in the  Federal Register.", "Similar to its proposed regulations, DOD\u2019s final regulations generally  preserve the employee\u2019s basic right to appeal mandatory removal offenses  and other adverse action decisions to an independent body\u2014the MSPB\u2014 but retain the provision to permit an internal DOD review of the initial  decisions issued by MSPB adjudicating officials. Under this internal  review, DOD can modify or reverse an initial decision or remand the  matter back to the adjudicating official for further consideration. Unlike  other criteria for review of initial decisions, DOD can modify or reverse an  initial MSPB adjudicating official\u2019s decision where the department  determines that the decision has a direct and substantial adverse effect on  the department\u2019s national security mission. In our previous testimonies  on the proposed regulations, we expressed some concern about the  department\u2019s internal review process and pointed out that the proposed  regulations do not offer additional details on the department\u2019s internal  review process, such as how the review will be conducted and who will  conduct it. We noted that an internal agency review process this important  should be addressed in the regulations rather than in an implementing  directive to ensure adequate transparency and employee confidence in the  process. However, the final regulations were not modified to include such  details.", "Similar to DOD\u2019s proposed regulations, the final regulations shorten the  notification period before an adverse action can become effective, provide  an accelerated MSPB adjudication process, and continue to give the MSPB  administrative judges (AJs) and arbitrators less latitude to modify DOD- imposed penalties than under current practice. Under the current system,  MSPB reviews penalties during the course of a disciplinary action against  an employee to ensure that the agency considered relevant prescribed  factors and exercised management discretion within tolerable limits of  reasonableness. MSPB may mitigate or modify a penalty if the agency did  not consider prescribed factors. In a change from the proposed  regulations, which precluded the MSPB from modifying a penalty imposed  on an employee by DOD for an adverse action unless such a penalty was  so disproportionate to the basis of the action as to be \u201cwholly without  justification,\u201d under the final regulations the MSPB AJs and arbitrators will  be able to mitigate a penalty only if it is \u201ctotally unwarranted in light of the  pertinent circumstances\u201d while the full MSPB Board may mitigate  penalties in accordance with the standard prescribed in the NSPS  authorizing legislation. As stated by DOD in the supplementary  information to the final regulations, the \u201ctotally unwarranted in light of all  pertinent circumstances\u201d standard is similar to that recognized by the  federal courts and is intended to limit mitigation of penalties by providing  deference to an agency\u2019s penalty determination.", "The final regulations continue to encourage the use of alternative dispute  resolution (ADR) and provide that this approach be subject to collective  bargaining to the extent permitted by the final labor relations regulations.  To resolve disputes in a more efficient, timely, and less adversarial  manner, federal agencies have been expanding their human capital  programs to include ADR approaches, including the use of ombudsmen as  an informal alternative to addressing conflicts. As we have reported, ADR  helps lessen the time and the cost burdens associated with the federal  redress system and has the advantage of employing techniques that focus  on understanding the disputants\u2019 underlying interests rather than  techniques that focus on the validity of their positions. For these and other  reasons, we believe that it is important to continue to promote ADR  throughout the process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor-Management Relations", "paragraphs": ["The final regulations recognize the right of employees to organize and  bargain collectively.

However, in  a departure from the proposed regulations, the final regulations provide  that the Secretary of Defense may authorize bargaining on these  management rights if the Secretary in his or her sole, exclusive, and  unreviewable discretion determines that bargaining would be necessary to  advance the department\u2019s mission or promote organizational  effectiveness.", "Our previous work on individual agencies\u2019 human capital systems has not  directly addressed the scope of specific issues that should or should not  be subject to collective bargaining and negotiations.

According to DOD, almost two-thirds of its 700,000 civilian  employees are represented by 41 different labor unions, including over  1,500 separate bargaining units. Consistent with DOD\u2019s proposed  regulations, its final NSPS regulations about the collaboration process,  among other things, would permit the Secretary of Defense to determine  (1) the number of employee representatives allowed to engage in the  collaboration process, and (2) the extent to which employee  representatives are given an opportunity to discuss their views with and  submit written comments to DOD officials.

In our July 2005 report on DOD\u2019s efforts to design  NSPS, we recommended that DOD develop procedures for evaluating  NSPS that contain results-oriented performance measures and reporting  requirements. We also recommended that these evaluation procedures  could be broadly modeled on the evaluation requirements of the OPM  demonstration projects. Under the demonstration project authority,  agencies must evaluate and periodically report on results, implementation  of the demonstration project, cost and benefits, effects on veterans and  other equal employment opportunity groups, adherence to merit system  principles, and the extent to which the lessons from the project can be  applied governmentwide. A set of balanced measures addressing a range  of results and customer, employee, and external partner issues may also  prove beneficial.

The human capital environment in the federal government is  changing, illustrated by the fact that DOD\u2019s new human capital authority  joins that given to several other federal departments and agencies\u2014such  as the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), GAO, the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Federal Aviation  Administration\u2014to help them strategically manage their human resources  management system to achieve results.", "To help advance the discussion concerning how governmentwide human  capital reform should proceed, we and the National Commission on the  Public Service Implementation Initiative co-hosted a forum on whether  there should be a governmentwide framework for human capital reform  and, if so, what this framework should include. While there was  widespread recognition among the forum participants that a one-size-fits- all approach to human capital management is not appropriate for the  challenges and demands faced by government, there was equally broad  agreement that there should be a governmentwide framework to guide  human capital reform. Further, a governmentwide framework should  balance the need for consistency across the federal government with the  desire for flexibility so that individual agencies can tailor human capital  systems to best meet their needs. Striking this balance would not be easy  to achieve, but is important for maintaining a governmentwide system that  is responsive enough to adapt to agencies\u2019 diverse missions, cultures, and  workforces.", "While there were divergent views among the forum participants, there was  general agreement on a set of principles, criteria, and processes that could  serve as a starting point for further discussion in developing a  governmentwide framework in advancing human capital reform, as shown  in figure 1.

One option may be to  provide agencies one-time, targeted investments that are not built into  agencies\u2019 bases for future year budget requests. For example, Congress  established the Human Capital Performance Fund to reward agencies\u2019  highest performing and most valuable employees. However, the  Administration\u2019s draft proposed \u201cWorking for America Act\u201d proposes to  repeal the Human Capital Performance Fund. According to OPM, the  provision was never implemented, due to lack of sufficient funding. We  believe that a central fund has merit and can help agencies build the  infrastructure needed to implement a more market-based and  performance-oriented pay system. To be eligible, agencies would submit  plans for approval by OPM that incorporate features such as a link  between pay for performance and the agency\u2019s strategic plan, employee  involvement, ongoing performance feedback, and effective safeguards to  ensure fair management of the system. In the first year of implementation,  up to 10 percent of the amount appropriated for the fund would be  available to train employees who are involved in making meaningful  distinctions in performance. These features are similar to those cited in  the draft proposal as the basis for OPM\u2019s certification for agencies to  implement their new pay and performance management systems.", "In addition, as agencies develop their pay for performance systems, they  will need to consider the appropriate mix between pay awarded as base  pay increases versus one-time cash bonuses, while still maintaining fiscally  sustainable compensation systems that reward performance. A key  question to consider is how the government can make an increasing  percentage of federal compensation dependent on achieving individual  and organizational results by, for example, providing more compensation  as one-time cash bonuses rather than as permanent salary increases.  However, agencies\u2019 use of cash bonuses or other monetary incentives has  an effect on employees\u2019 retirement calculations since they are not included  in calculating retirement benefits. Congress should consider potential  legislative changes to allow cash bonuses that would otherwise be  included as base pay increases to be calculated toward retirement and  thrift savings benefits by specifically factoring bonuses into the  employee\u2019s base pay for purposes of making contributions to the thrift  savings plan and calculating the employee\u2019s \u201chigh-three\u201d for retirement  benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with our observations earlier this year, DOD\u2019s final NSPS  regulations take another valuable step toward a modern performance  management system that provides for a more market-based and  performance-oriented pay system.

This could also serve to  severely set back the legitimate need to move to a more performance- and  results-based system for the federal government as a whole.  Thus, while it is  imperative that we take steps to better link employee pay and other personnel  decisions to performance across the federal government, how it is done, when it  is done, and the basis on which it is done, can make all the difference in whether  or not we are successful.  One key need is to modernize performance  management systems in executive agencies so that they are capable of  supporting more performance-based pay and other personnel decisions.

The federal personnel system is  clearly broken in critical respects\u2014designed for a time and workforce of an  earlier era and not able to meet the needs and challenges of our current rapidly  changing and knowledge-based environment.  DOD\u2019s proposal recognizes that,  as GAO has stated and the experiences of leading public sector organizations  here and abroad have found strategic human capital management must be the  centerpiece of any serious government transformation effort.", "More generally, from a conceptual standpoint, GAO strongly supports the need  to expand broad banding and pay for performance-based systems in the federal  government.  However, moving too quickly or prematurely at DOD or elsewhere,  can significantly raise the risk of doing it wrong.  This could also serve to  severely set back the legitimate need to move to a more performance and  results- based system for the federal government as a whole.  Thus, while it is  imperative that we take steps to better link employee pay and other personnel  decisions to performance across the federal government, how it is done, when it  is done, and the basis on which it is done, can make all the difference in whether  or not we are successful.  In our view, one key need is to modernize  performance management systems in executive agencies so that they are  capable of supporting more performance-based pay and other personnel  decisions.  Unfortunately, based on GAO\u2019s past work, most existing federal  performance appraisal systems, including a vast majority of DOD\u2019s systems, are  not currently designed to support a meaningful performance-based pay system.", "The critical questions to consider are: should DOD and/or other agencies be  granted broad-based exemptions from existing law, and if so, on what basis; and  whether they have the institutional infrastructure in place to make effective use  of the new authorities.  This institutional infrastructure includes, at a minimum,  a human capital planning process that integrates the agency\u2019s human capital  policies, strategies, and programs with its program goals and mission, and  desired outcomes; the capabilities to effectively develop and implement a new  human capital system; and, importantly, a set of adequate safeguards, including  reasonable transparency and appropriate accountability mechanisms to ensure  the fair, effective, and credible implementation of a new system. www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-03-717T.", "To view the full report, including the scope  and methodology, click on the link above.

Congress should also consider establishing a governmentwide fund  whereby agencies, based on a sound business case, could apply for funding to  modernize their performance management systems and ensure that those  systems have adequate safeguards to prevent abuse.  This approach would serve  as a positive step to promote high-performing organizations throughout the  federal government while avoiding fragmentation within the executive branch in  the critical human capital area.", "People are at the heart of an  organization\u2019s ability to perform its  mission.  Yet, a key challenge for  the Department of Defense (DOD),  as for many federal agencies, is to  strategically manage its human  capital. With about 700,000 civilian  employees on its payroll, DOD is  the second largest federal employer  of civilians in the nation.  Although  downsized 38 percent between  fiscal years 1989 and 2002, this  workforce has taken on greater  roles as a result of DOD\u2019s  restructuring and transformation.   DOD\u2019s proposed National Security  Personnel System (NSPS) would  provide for wide-ranging changes  in DOD\u2019s civilian personnel pay and  performance management,  collective bargaining, rightsizing,  and other human capital areas. The  NSPS would enable DOD to  develop and implement a  consistent DOD-wide civilian  personnel system.  Given the  massive size of DOD, the proposal  has important precedent-setting  implications for federal human  capital management and OPM.", "DOD\u2019s lack of attention to force shaping during its downsizing in the early 1990s  has resulted in a workforce that is not balanced by age or experience and that  puts at risk the orderly transfer of institutional knowledge. Human capital  challenges are severe in certain areas.  For example, DOD has downsized its  acquisition workforce by almost half.  More than 50 percent of the workforce  will be eligible to retire by 2005.  In addition, DOD faces major succession  planning challenges at various levels within the department.  Also, since 1987,  the industrial workforce, such as depot maintenance, has been reduced by about  56 percent, with many of the remaining employees nearing retirement, calling  into question the longer-term viability of the workforce.  DOD is one of the  agencies that has begun to address human capital challenges through strategic  human capital planning.  For example, in April 2002, DOD published a  department wide strategic plan for civilians. Although a positive step toward  fostering a more strategic approach toward human capital management, the plan  is not fully aligned with the overall mission of the department or results  oriented.  In addition, it was not integrated with the military and contractor  personnel planning.", "We strongly support the concept of modernizing federal human capital policies  within DOD and the federal government at large.  Providing reasonable  flexibility to management in this critical area is appropriate provided adequate  safeguards are in place to prevent abuse.  We believe that Congress should  consider both governmentwide and selected agency, including DOD, changes to  address the pressing human capital issues confronting the federal government.   In this regard, many of the basic principles underlying DOD\u2019s civilian human  capital proposals have merit and deserve serious consideration. At the same  time, many are not unique to DOD and deserve broader consideration.", "This testimony provides GAO\u2019s  preliminary observations on  aspects of DOD\u2019s proposal to make  changes to its civilian personnel  system and discusses the  implications of such changes for  governmentwide human capital  reform.  Past reports have  contained GAO\u2019s views on what  remains to be done to bring about  lasting solutions for DOD to  strategically manage its human  capital.  DOD has not always  concurred with our  recommendations.    www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-03-493T.  To view the full testimony, including the scope  and methodology, click on the link above.

Several of the proposed DOD  reforms meet this test.  At the same time, we believe that Congress should  consider incorporating additional safeguards in connection with several of  DOD\u2019s proposed reforms.  In our view, it would be preferable to employ a  government-wide approach to address certain flexibilities that have broad-based  application and serious potential implications for the civil service system, in  general, and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), in particular.  We  believe that several of the reforms that DOD is proposing fall into this category  (e.g., broad-banding, pay for performance, re-employment and pension offset  waivers).  In these situations, it may be prudent and preferable for the Congress  to provide such authorities on a governmentwide basis and in a manner that  assures that appropriate performance management systems and safeguards are  in place before the new authorities are implemented by the respective agency.", "However, in all cases whether from a governmentwide authority or agency  specific legislation, in our view, such additional authorities should be  implemented (or operationalized) only when an agency has the institutional  infrastructure in place to make effective use of the new authorities.  Based on  our experience, while the DOD leadership has the intent and the ability to  implement the needed infrastructure, it is not consistently in place within the  vast majority of DOD at the present time.", "The Department of Defense\u2019s  (DOD) civilian employees play key  roles in such areas as defense  policy, intelligence, finance,  acquisitions, and weapon systems  maintenance.  Although downsized  38 percent between fiscal years  1989 and 2002, this workforce has  taken on greater roles as a result of  DOD\u2019s restructuring and  transformation. Responding to  congressional concerns about the  quality and quantity of, and the  strategic planning for the civilian  workforce, GAO determined the  following for DOD, the military  services, and selected defense  agencies: (1) the extent of top-level  leadership involvement in civilian  strategic planning; (2) whether  elements in civilian strategic plans  are aligned to the overall mission,  focused on results, and based on  current and future civilian  workforce data; and (3) whether  civilian and military personnel  strategic plans or sourcing  initiatives were integrated.", "Generally, civilian personnel issues appear to be an emerging priority among  top leaders in DOD and the defense components.  Although DOD began  downsizing its civilian workforce more than a decade ago, it did not take  action to strategically address challenges affecting the civilian workforce  until it issued its civilian human capital strategic plan in April 2002.    Top-level leaders in the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Defense Contract  Management Agency, and the Defense Finance Accounting Service have  initiated planning efforts and are working in partnership with their civilian  human capital professionals to develop and implement civilian strategic  plans; such leadership, however, was increasing in the Army and not as  evident in the Navy.  Also, DOD has not provided guidance on how to  integrate the components\u2019 plans with the department-level plan.  High-level  leadership is critical to directing reforms and obtaining resources for  successful implementation.", "The human capital strategic plans GAO reviewed for the most part lacked  key elements found in fully developed plans.  Most of the civilian human  capital goals, objectives, and initiatives were not explicitly aligned with the  overarching missions of the organizations.  Consequently, DOD and the  components cannot be sure that strategic goals are properly focused on  mission achievement.  Also, none of the plans contained results-oriented  performance measures to assess the impact of their civilian human capital  initiatives (i.e., programs, policies, and processes).  Thus, DOD and the  components cannot gauge the extent to which their human capital initiatives  contribute to achieving their organizations\u2019 mission.  Finally, the plans did  not contain data on the skills and competencies needed to successfully  accomplish future missions; therefore, DOD and the components risk not  being able to put the right people, in the right place, and at the right time,  which can result in diminished accomplishment of the overall defense  mission.", "Moreover, the civilian strategic plans did not address how the civilian  workforce will be integrated with their military counterparts or sourcing  initiatives.  DOD\u2019s three human capital strategic plans-- two military and one  civilian--were prepared separately and were not integrated to form a  seamless and comprehensive strategy and did not address how DOD plans to  link its human capital initiatives with its sourcing plans, such as efforts to  outsource non-core responsibilities.  The components\u2019 civilian plans  acknowledge a need to integrate planning for civilian and military  personnel\u2014taking into consideration contractors\u2014but have not yet done so.  Without an integrated strategy, DOD may not effectively and efficiently  allocate its scarce resources for optimal readiness.", "Between 1987 and 2002, the  Department of Defense (DOD)  downsized the civilian workforce in 27 key industrial facilities by about  56 percent. Many of the remaining  72,000 workers are nearing  retirement. In recent years GAO  has identified shortcomings in  DOD\u2019s strategic planning and was  asked to determine (1) whether  DOD has implemented our prior  recommendation to develop and  implement a depot maintenance  strategic plan, (2) the extent to  which the services have developed  and implemented comprehensive  strategic workforce plans, and  (3) what challenges adversely  affect DOD\u2019s workforce planning.", "DOD has not implemented our October 2001 recommendation to develop  and implement a DOD depot strategic plan that would delineate workloads  to be accomplished in each of the services\u2019 depots. The DOD depot system  has been a key part of the department\u2019s plan to support military systems in  the past, but the increased use of the private sector to perform this work has  decreased the role of these activities. While title 10 of the U.S. code requires  DOD to retain core capability and also requires that at least 50 percent of  depot maintenance funds be spent for public-sector performance, questions  remain about the future role of DOD depots. Absent a DOD depot strategic  plan, the services have in varying degrees, laid out a framework for strategic  depot planning, but this planning is not comprehensive. Questions also  remain about the future of arsenals and ammunition plants. GAO reviewed  workforce planning efforts for 22 maintenance depots, 3 arsenals, and  2 ammunition plants, which employed about 72,000 civilian workers in fiscal  year 2002.", "GAO recommends that the DOD  complete revisions to core policy,  promulgate a schedule for  completing core computations, and  complete depot strategic planning;  develop a plan for arsenals and  ammunition plants; develop  strategic workforce plans; and  coordinate the implementation  of initiatives to address various  workforce challenges. DOD  concurred with 7 of our 9  recommendations; nonconcurring  with two because it believes the  proposed National Security  Personnel System, which was  submitted to Congress as a part of  the DOD transformation legislation,  will take care of these problems.  We believe it is premature to  assume this system will (1) be  approved by Congress as proposed  and (2) resolve these issues.", "The services have not developed and implemented strategic workforce plans  to position the civilian workforce in DOD industrial activities to meet future  requirements. While workforce planning is done for each of the industrial  activities, generally it is short-term rather than strategic. Further, workforce  planning is lacking in other areas that OPM guidance and high-performing  organizations identify as key to successful workforce planning. Service  workforce planning efforts (1) usually do not assess the competencies;  (2) do not develop comprehensive retention plans; and (3) sometimes do not  develop performance measures and evaluate workforce plans.", "Several challenges adversely affect DOD\u2019s workforce planning for the  viability of its civilian depot workforce. First, given the aging depot  workforce and the retirement eligibility of over 40 percent of the workforce  over the next 5 to 7 years, the services may have difficulty maintaining the  depots\u2019 viability. Second, the services are having difficulty implementing  multiskilling\u2014an industry and government best practice for improving the  flexibility and productivity of the workforce\u2014even though this technique  could help depot planners do more with fewer employees. Finally, increased  training funding and innovation in the training program will be essential for  revitalizing the aging depot workforce.", "Staffing Levels, Age, and Retirement Eligibility of Civilian Personnel in Industrial Facilities  Percent eligible  to retire by 2009  www.gao.gov/cgi-bin/getrpt?GAO-03-472.", "To view the full report, including the scope  and methodology, click on the link above.
