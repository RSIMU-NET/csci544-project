CNMI's economy depends heavily on two industries, garment manufacturing and tourism. However, recent changes in U.S. trade law have increased foreign competition for CNMI's garment industry, while other external events have negatively affected its tourism sector. CNMI's garment industry has declined in recent years with factory closings and reduced production. The value of garment shipments to the United States dropped by more than 16 percent between 2004 and 2005 and by an estimated 25 percent in 2006. Tourism in CNMI declined sharply in the late 1990s as a result of a series of external events, including the Asian financial crisis; cancellation of Korean Air service; and fears of international crises such as the SARS epidemic, terrorism, and the Iraq war. In 2005, Japan Airlines withdrew direct flights to the capital. The fiscal condition of CNMI's government has steadily weakened from fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2005, as government spending has exceeded revenues each year since 2002. CNMI ended fiscal year 2005 with a deficit of $84.1 million in its governmental fund balance. CNMI's liabilities also exceed its assets for its primary government. Indicators point to a severe financial crisis in fiscal year 2006. In response, the CNMI government has implemented cost-cutting and restructuring measures, including \"austerity holidays,\" consisting of biweekly furloughs during which government workers are not paid and many government operations are closed to reduce personnel and operating costs. CNMI's long-standing financial accountability problems include the late submission of financial audit reports, inability to achieve \"clean\" opinions in its financial statements by the independent financial auditors, and reports showing serious internal control weaknesses over financial reporting. Many of the auditors' findings are longstanding, going back in some cases to 1987. Federal agencies and CNMI have sponsored and participated in conferences, training sessions, technical assistance, and other programs to improve CNMI's economy, fiscal condition, and accountability. During 2006, the CNMI government took steps to reverse its prior patterns of deficit spending. It will need to continue to work toward long-term sustainable solutions, with concentrated attention on the challenges facing the islands and feedback mechanisms for continuing improvement. Leadership on the part of the CNMI government and the Department of the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs is critical to providing long-term stability and prosperity for this U.S. insular area."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Commonwealth of the  Northern Mariana Islands\u2019 (CNMI) serious challenges in strengthening its  economy, fiscal condition, and financial accountability.

The United States exercises  sovereignty over CNMI, and, in general, federal laws apply to CNMI.  However, federal minimum wage provisions and federal immigration laws  do not apply. CNMI immigration policies and the demands for labor by the  garment manufacturing industry and tourism sector have resulted in rapid  population growth since 1980 such that the majority of the population are  non-U.S. citizens. (See fig. 1.) According to U.S. Census Bureau data for  2000, the most recent census data available, about 56 percent of the CNMI  population of 69,221 were not U.S. citizens.", "According to U.S. Census Bureau data for 2000, the median household  income in CNMI was $22,898, a little more than half of the U.S. median  household income of almost $42,000 for 2000. The percentage of  individuals in poverty in 2000 was 46 percent, nearly four times the  continental U.S. rate of 12 percent in that same year.", "CNMI\u2019s economy depends on two industries, garment manufacturing and  tourism, for its employment, production, and exports. These two  industries rely heavily on a noncitizen workforce. This workforce  represents more than three quarters of the labor pool that are subject to  the CNMI minimum wage, which is lower than the U.S. minimum wage.  The garment industry, for example, uses textiles and labor imported  mostly from China. A 1999 study found that garment manufacturing and  tourism accounted for about 85 percent of CNMI\u2019s total economic activity  and 96 percent of its exports. A 2005 estimate of CNMI\u2019s gross domestic  product (GDP) suggest that, in 2002, the garment industry contributed to  roughly 40 percent of CNMI\u2019s GDP and 47 percent of payroll. However,  recent changes in trade laws have increased foreign competition for  CNMI\u2019s garment industry, while other external events have negatively  impacted its tourism sector."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Decline in Garment Industry Tied to Trade Law Changes", "paragraphs": ["Recent developments in international trade laws have reduced CNMI\u2019s  trade advantages, and the garment industry has declined in recent years.  Historically, while garment exporters from other countries faced quotas  and duties in shipping to the U.S. market, CNMI\u2019s garment industry  benefited from quota-free and duty-free access to U.S. markets for  shipments of goods in which 50 percent of the value was added in CNMI.  In recent years, however, U.S. agreements with other textile-producing  countries have liberalized the textile and apparel trade. For example, in  January 2005, in accordance with one of the 1994 World Trade  Organization (WTO) Uruguay Round agreements, the United States  eliminated quotas on textile and apparel imports from other textile- producing countries, leaving CNMI\u2019s apparel industry to operate under  stiffer competition, especially from low-wage countries such as China.  According to a DOI official, more than 3,800 garment jobs were lost  between April 2004 and the end of July 2006, with 10 out of 27 garment  factories closing. U.S. Department of Commerce data show that the value  of CNMI shipments of garments to the United States dropped by more than  16 percent between 2004 and 2005, from about $807 million to $677  million, and down from a peak of $1 billion in 1998--2000. In 2006, reported  garment exports to the United States fell further, by an estimated 25  percent compared to 2005, with exports declining to an estimated $497  million. The reported level of shipments to the United States in 2006 was  comparable to levels of sales in 1995--1996, prior to the significant build-up  of the industry. (See fig. 2.) In December 2006, the largest and oldest  garment factory closed. Given that the garment industry is significant to  CNMI\u2019s economy, these developments will likely have a negative financial  effect on government revenue. For example, reported fees collected by the  government on garment exports fell 37 percent from $38.6 million in 2000  to $24.4 million in 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "External Events Affect Tourism", "paragraphs": ["CNMI\u2019s tourism sector experienced a sharp decline in the late 1990s, and a  series of external events have further hampered the sector. Tourism  became a significant sector of economic activity in CNMI by the mid-1980s  and continued to grow into the 1990s. Due to its proximity to Asia, Asian  economic trends and other events have a direct effect on CNMI\u2019s  economy. For example, tourism in CNMI experienced a sharp decline in  the late 1990s with the Asian financial crisis and due to the cancellation of  Korean Air service to CNMI following an airplane crash on Guam in  August 1997. (See fig. 3.) Visitors from Korea, the second largest source of  tourists, decreased by 85 percent from 1996 to 1998. After a modest  recovery in 2000, tourism faltered again with the September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks on the United States. In 2003, according to CNMI officials,  tourism slowed\u2014with a double-digit decline in arrivals for several  months\u2014in reaction to the SARS epidemic and to the war in Iraq.", "Tourism in CNMI is also subject to changes in airline practices. For  example, Japan Airlines (JAL) withdrew its direct flights between Tokyo  and Saipan in October 2005, raising concerns because roughly 30 percent  of all tourists and 40 percent of Japanese tourists arrive in CNMI on JAL  flights, according to CNMI and DOI officials. The Marianas Visitors  Authority\u2019s June 2006 data show that the downward trend in Japanese  arrivals is not being offset by the growth in arrivals from other markets  such as China and South Korea, with the total number of foreign visitors  dropping from 43,115 in June 2005 to 38,510 a year later. At the same  time, CNMI has experienced increased Chinese tourists in recent years,  which offer the potential to reenergize the industry."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CNMI\u2019s Reported Fiscal Condition Continues to Weaken", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal condition of CNMI\u2019s government has steadily weakened from  fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2005, the most recent year for which  audited financial statements for CNMI were available. In addition, several  indicators point to a severe financial crisis in fiscal year 2006. As shown in  figure 4, CNMI\u2019s reported governmental fund balance declined from a  positive $3.5 million at the beginning of fiscal year 2001 to a deficit of $84.1  million by the end of fiscal year 2005, as CNMI\u2019s expenditures for its  governmental activities consistently exceeded revenues in each year since  fiscal year 2002. Most of CNMI\u2019s governmental activities, which include  basic services such as public safety, health care, general administration,  streets and parks, and security and safety, are reported in its governmental  activities, or government funds. The fund balance (or deficit) for these  activities reflects the amount of funds available at the end of the year for  spending. A significant contributing factor to the gap between  expenditures and revenues is that actual expenditures have exceeded  budgeted expenditures each fiscal year during the period 2001 through  2005.", "Another measure of fiscal health is the measure of net assets for  governmental activities, which represents total assets minus total  liabilities. As shown in table 1, CNMI has experienced a negative trend in  its balance of net assets for governmental activities, going from a reported  positive $40.6 million balance at the end of fiscal year 2001 to a negative  $38 million balance at the end of fiscal year 2005. The primary difference  between the fund balance measure and net assets is that the net assets  include capital assets and long-term liabilities, whereas the fund balance  figure focuses on assets available for current period expenditures and  liabilities that are due and payable in the current period.", "In order to finance its government activities in an environment where  expenditures have exceeded revenues, CNMI has increased its debt and  has not made the required contributions to its retirement fund. CNMI\u2019s  reported balance of notes and bonds payable has increased from $83  million in fiscal year 2002 to $113 million in fiscal year 2005, representing  an increase of 36 percent. CNMI\u2019s balance owed to its pension fund has  increased from $72 million in 2002 to $120 million in 2005, representing an  increase of 67 percent. CNMI has also been incurring penalties on the  unpaid liabilities to the pension fund. The total amount of assessed  penalties was $24 million as of September 30, 2005.", "As shown in figure 5, CNMI\u2019s reported debt to assets ratio has increased  significantly, from 89.8 percent in fiscal year 2002 to 113.5 percent in 2005.  In other words, at the end of fiscal year 2005, CNMI owed $1.14 for every  $1.00 in assets that it held.", "Although CNMI\u2019s audited fiscal year 2006 financial statements are not yet  available, indicators point to a severe fiscal crisis during fiscal year 2006.  In a May 5, 2006 letter to the CNMI Legislative leaders, Governor Benigno  R. Fitial stated that \u201cthe Commonwealth is facing an unsustainable  economic emergency. . . . I regret to say that the nature and extent of these  financial problems are such that there is no simple or painless solution.\u201d  CNMI has implemented several significant cost-cutting and restructuring  measures during fiscal year 2006. For instance, in August 2006, CNMI  enacted its Public Law No. 15-24 to implement \u201causterity holidays\u201d  consisting of bi-weekly furloughs, during which government employees  are not paid and many government operations are closed. This measure  was taken to help alleviate the financial crisis by saving millions of dollars  in both personnel and operational costs. The measure declared unpaid  holidays once per pay period for the remainder of fiscal years 2006 and  2007, reducing the government\u2019s normal pay period to 72 hours every 2  weeks. In June of 2006, CNMI enacted Public Law No. 15-15 to authorize  the CNMI government to suspend the government\u2019s employer  contributions to the retirement fund for the remainder of fiscal years 2006  and 2007. In addition, CNMI has passed laws to restructure loans among  its component units, reform the rate of compensation for members of  boards and commissions, increase the governor\u2019s authority to reprogram  funds, extend the date for full funding of the retirement fund\u2019s defined  benefit plan, and create a defined contribution retirement plan for  government employees hired on or after January 1, 2007.

CNMI\u2019s late submission of single audit reports means that  the federal agencies overseeing federal grants to CNMI did not have  current audited information about CNMI\u2019s use of federal grant funds. As  shown in table 2, CNMI\u2019s single audit submissions were significantly late  for fiscal years 1997 through 2004.

However, some of the issues continued to exist in 2004 and  2005. The auditors identified the following issues in fiscal year 2005 that  resulted in the most recent qualified audit opinion: (1) inadequacies in the  accounting records regarding taxes receivable, advances, accounts  payable, tax rebates payable, other liabilities and accruals, and the reserve  for continuing appropriations, (2) inadequacies in accounting records and  internal controls regarding the capital assets of the Northern Marianas  College, and (3) the lack of audited financial statements for the  Commonwealth Utilities Corporation, which represents a significant  component unit of CNMI.", "Auditors for CNMI also rendered qualified opinions on CNMI\u2019s compliance  with the requirements for major federal award programs from 1997  through 2005.

Table 3 shows the number of material weaknesses and reportable  conditions for CNMI for fiscal years 2001 through 2005. The large number  and the significance of reported internal control weaknesses raise serious  questions about the integrity and reliability of CNMI\u2019s financial statements  and its compliance with requirements of major federal programs.  Furthermore, the lack of reliable financial information hampers CNMI\u2019s  ability to monitor programs and financial information such as revenues  and expenses and to make timely, informed decisions.", "CNMI\u2019s 13 internal control reportable conditions for fiscal year 2005, 9 of  which were material weaknesses, indicate a lack of sound internal  control over financial reporting needed to provide adequate assurance that  transactions are properly recorded, assets are properly safeguarded, and  controls are adequate to prevent or detect fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement. For example, one of the material internal control  weaknesses that the auditors reported for CNMI\u2019s government for fiscal  year 2005 was the lack of audited fiscal year 2005 financial statements of  the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation (Corporation), a significant  component unit of CNMI. Because the Corporation\u2019s financial statements  were unaudited, the auditors could not determine the propriety of account  balances presented in the financial statements that would affect CNMI\u2019s  basic financial statements. CNMI\u2019s auditors also reported other significant  material internal control weaknesses that have continued from previous  years, such as improper tracking and lack of support for advances to  vendors, travel advances to employees, liabilities recorded in the General  Fund, and tax rebates payable. Due to the lack of detailed subsidiary  ledgers and other supporting evidence, the auditors could not determine  the propriety of these account balances. According to the auditors, the  effect of these weaknesses is a possible misstatement of expenditures and  related advances and liabilities, which also resulted in a qualification of  the opinion on the fiscal year 2005 CNMI financial statements.  Consequently, CNMI\u2019s financial statements may not be reliable.", "As shown in table 3, auditors also reported 38 reportable conditions in  CNMI\u2019s compliance with requirements for major federal programs and the  internal controls intended to ensure compliance with these requirements.  Two of these reportable conditions were considered material  weaknesses.", "One of the two material internal control weaknesses affecting compliance  with federal programs reported for CNMI\u2019s government for fiscal year 2005  included the failure to record expenditures for the Medical Assistance  Program when they were incurred. Specifically, the auditors identified  expenditures in fiscal year 2005 for billings from service providers for  services rendered in previous years. The effect of this weakness is that  expenditures reported to the grantor agency, the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services, are based on the paid date and not, as  required, the service date. In addition, actual expenditures incurred during  the year are not properly recorded and, therefore, current year  expenditures and unrecorded liabilities are understated. The other  material weakness affecting compliance related to the lack of adherence  to established policies and procedures for managing and tracking property  and equipment purchased with federal grant funds. As a result, CNMI\u2019s  government was not in compliance with federal property standards and its  own property management policies and procedures. The other 36  reportable conditions concerned compliance with requirements regarding  allowable costs; cash management; eligibility; equipment and property  management; matching, level of effort, and earmarking; procurement and  suspensions and debarment; reporting; subrecipient monitoring; and  special tests and provisions that are applicable to CNMI\u2019s major federal  programs.", "In CNMI\u2019s corrective action plan for fiscal year 2005, CNMI officials agreed  with almost all of the auditors\u2019 findings. According to its fiscal year 2005  corrective action plan, CNMI is working to get a current audit of its  component unit, the Commonwealth Utilities Corporation. Other planned  actions include properly reconciling advances to vendors; reviewing travel  advance balances and making adjustments as needed, including making  payroll deductions if expense vouchers are not filed timely; implementing  procurement receiving procedures for prepaid items; making necessary  corrections to its automated tax system to enable auditors to better review  tax returns; determining the correct balances for construction projects;  implementing controls over verifying eligibility for Medicaid and  restricting access to the related data; and ensuring proper completion of  inventories. The plan provides that most of the findings will be addressed  by the end of fiscal year 2007.
