A major aim of the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) is to balance the burden of these collections with their public benefit. Under the act, agencies' Chief Information Officers (CIO) are responsible for reviewing information collections before they are submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for approval. As part of this review, CIOs must certify that the collections meet 10 standards set forth in the act. GAO was asked to assess, among other things, this review and certification process, including agencies' efforts to consult with the public. To do this, GAO reviewed a governmentwide sample of collections, reviewed processes and collections at four agencies that account for a large proportion of burden, and performed case studies of 12 approved collections."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Governmentwide, agency CIOs generally reviewed information collections and certified that they met the standards in the act. However, GAO's analysis of 12 case studies at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Labor showed that CIOs certified collections even though support was often missing or partial. For example, in nine of the case studies, agencies did not provide support, as the law requires, for the standard that the collection was developed by an office with a plan and resources to use the information effectively. Because OMB instructions do not ask explicitly for this support, agencies generally did not address it. Further, although the law requires agencies both to publish notices in the Federal Register and to otherwise consult with the public, agencies governmentwide generally limited consultation to the publication of notices, which generated little public comment. Without appropriate support and public consultation, agencies have reduced assurance that collections satisfy the standards in the act. Processes outside the PRA review process, which are more rigorous and involve greater public outreach, have been set up by IRS and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), whose missions involve numerous information collections and whose management is focused on minimizing burden. For example, each year, IRS subjects a few forms to highly detailed, in-depth analyses, including extensive outreach to the public affected and the information users. IRS reports that this process--performed on forms that have undergone CIO review and received OMB approval--has reduced burden by over 200 million hours since 2002. In contrast, for the 12 case studies, the CIO review process did not reduce burden. Without rigorous evaluative processes, agencies are unlikely to achieve the PRA goal of minimizing burden while maximizing utility."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year, nearly every adult American and every business fills out at least  one federally sponsored form, survey, or questionnaire that agencies need  to carry out their missions.

Governmentwide, agencies maintain about 8,000 information collections covered by the act. Each year, agencies submit about 3,000 of  these to be approved or reapproved by OMB.", "In an effort to strengthen the act, the Congress amended the act in 1995 to  establish, among other things, more detailed agency clearance  requirements.

To help the Congress  assess whether the act is achieving its purposes and provide information to  help the Congress in considering reauthorization, you asked us to assess  the extent to which, before information collections are submitted to  OMB for approval, agencies have (1) established effective processes for  CIOs to review information collections and certify that the 10 standards  in the act were met and (2) complied with the requirements to consult  with the public on such collections;  the extent to which agencies ensure that collection forms on agency  Web sites are properly approved by OMB and included in an inventory of  approved collections; and  the extent to which agencies ensure that collection forms on agency  Web sites disclose certain information that the public needs to exercise  scrutiny of agency activities, as required by the act.", "To determine the extent to which agencies have established effective  processes, we performed detailed reviews of paperwork clearance  processes and collections at four agencies: the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA), the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD),  the Department of Labor, and IRS. Together, these four agencies represent  a broad range of paperwork burdens, and in 2003, they accounted for about  83 percent of the 8.1 billion hours that is the estimated paperwork burden  for all federal agencies. Of this total, IRS alone accounted for over 80  percent. We also selected 12 approved collections as case studies (three at  each of the four agencies) to determine how effective agency processes  were.", "In addition, we analyzed a random sample (343) of all OMB-approved  collections governmentwide as of May 2004 (8,211 collections at 68  agencies) to determine compliance with the act\u2019s requirements that the  agency (1) certify to OMB that the 10 standards in the act had been met,  (2) provide a 60-day public comment period in the Federal Register, and  (3) consult with the public and affected agencies on ways to minimize  burden and other issues associated with information collections.

The Federal Reports Act of 1942 first  established a review process whereby the Bureau of the Budget\u2014which  became OMB in 1970\u2014determined whether the collection of information  by a federal agency was necessary for the agency\u2019s proper performance or  for any other proper purpose.", "In 1977, the Commission on Federal Paperwork reported that  notwithstanding the Federal Reports Act process, the federal paperwork  burden had continued to grow and that legislative exemptions over the  years had exempted as much as 80 percent of the federal paperwork  burden from the 1942 act\u2019s clearance process. The Commission  recommended reform of the old paperwork clearance process, along with  addressing information collection as part of a broader approach to federal  information resources management (IRM). In 1980, the Congress enacted  the Paperwork Reduction Act, which largely followed the Commission\u2019s  recommendations. The act supplanted the Federal Reports Act, made  virtually all federal agency information collection activities subject to OMB  review, and established broad objectives for OMB oversight of the  management of federal information resources. To achieve these objectives,  the 1980 act established the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs  (OIRA) within OMB and gave this office a variety of oversight  responsibilities over federal information functions, including general  information policy, reduction of paperwork burden, federal statistical  policy, records management, information privacy, disclosure and security,  and the acquisition and use of information technology (then described as  automatic data processing and telecommunications functions)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Paperwork Reduction under the Act", "paragraphs": ["The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 had three major purposes with  regard to information collection:  minimize the federal paperwork burden for individuals, small  businesses, state and local governments, and other persons;  minimize the cost to the federal government of collecting, maintaining,  using, and disseminating information; and  maximize the usefulness of information collected by the federal  government.", "To achieve these purposes, the 1980 act required that federal agencies not  conduct or sponsor the collection of information unless approved by  OMB. Under the law, OMB is required to determine that the agency  collection of information is necessary for the proper performance of the  functions of the agency, including whether the information will have  practical utility. Consistent with the act\u2019s requirements, OMB established  a process whereby its OIRA desk officers review proposals by executive  branch agencies, including independent regulatory agencies, to collect  information from 10 or more persons, whether the collections are  voluntary or mandatory. The act gave OMB 60 days to approve or  disapprove any collection request. If it approves the collection, OMB  assigns a control number and an expiration date, which is limited to no  more than 3 years.", "To assist agencies in fulfilling their responsibilities under the act, OMB took  various steps. It issued a regulation, and it also provided agencies with  instructions on filling out a standard form for submissions and providing  supporting statements. Further, it developed guidance, which, while  remaining in draft, is widely used as a handbook for agencies on  compliance with the law, according to OMB officials. For example, the  Department of Labor cited the handbook in responding to our questions  about its PRA collections.", "Finally, in addition to the agency and OMB clearance process, the act  encouraged public participation by requiring the solicitation of public  comment on proposed collections and, through its \u201cpublic protection  clause,\u201d by providing that individuals could not be penalized for failing to  respond to an information collection request that either does not display a  valid OMB control number or does not state that the request is exempt  from the act.", "Implementation of the Paperwork Reduction Act has not been without  controversy. Congressional hearings and reports, as well as our reports,  have identified issues of concern, including the following:  Reduction of paperwork burdens. Despite the act\u2019s requirements,  including specific percentage paperwork reduction goals, the federal  paperwork burden has not declined over the life of the act but has  generally continued to increase.", "Regulatory review. OMB\u2019s conduct of paperwork clearance in close  alignment with its review of agency regulations under presidential  executive orders has periodically raised questions about the extent to  which OMB review should affect the policies and substantive  requirements of agency decisions.", "Public participation. The ability of the public to contribute to and be  informed about agency and OMB paperwork clearance decisions has  been a concern of those who questioned the extent to which the process  affects the substance of agency program decisions, as well as those who  argued that the process has not been sensitive enough to the burdens  placed on respondents.", "Information resources management. OMB and agencies have been  criticized for inadequate attention to the other information resources  management requirements of the act, ranging from overall IRM strategic  planning to specific functions such as information security and the  management of information technology.", "The Congress addressed these and other issues when reauthorizing the act  in 1986 and 1995.

This official is to be sufficiently independent of  program responsibility to evaluate fairly whether information collections  should be approved.

For example, the instrument must explain the reasons for the  collection and provide an estimate of the burden of the collection. In  addition, the agency is to provide an initial 60-day notice period (in addition  to the notice period that was already required after the collection is  forwarded to OMB for approval) and otherwise consult with members of  the public and affected agencies to solicit comments on (1) whether the  proposed collection is necessary for the proper performance of the  agency\u2019s functions, (2) the accuracy of the agency\u2019s burden estimate,  (3) ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the information to be  collected, and (4) ways to minimize the burden on respondents, including  through the use of automated collection techniques or other forms of  information technology.

According to our sample of all collections at the four agencies  reviewed, the number of notices receiving at least one comment ranged  from an estimated 15 percent at Labor to an estimated 6 percent at IRS.", "A key reason that agencies do not comply with the PRA requirement to  \u201cotherwise consult\u201d is the OMB guidance giving agencies discretion not to  consult with the public other than through the Federal Register. Other  means of consultation may also require additional time and effort, and  agency PRA reviewers indicated that program offices are often interested  in minimizing the time required for PRA approvals.", "If agencies do not actively consult with the public, they limit their ability to  determine whether proposed collections adequately satisfy the act\u2019s  standards that focus on impact on potential respondents, such as the  standards on burden, clarity, and recordkeeping.

This office chooses a few forms each  year that are judged to have the greatest potential for burden reduction  (these forms have already been reviewed and approved through the  conventional PRA process). The office evaluates and prioritizes burden  reduction initiatives by   determining the number of taxpayers impacted;   quantifying the total time and out-of-pocket savings for taxpayers;   evaluating any adverse impact on IRS\u2019s voluntary compliance efforts;   assessing the feasibility of the initiative, given IRS resource limitations;   tying the initiative into IRS objectives.", "Once the forms are chosen, the office performs highly detailed, in-depth  analyses, including extensive outreach to the public affected, the users of  the information within and outside the agency, and other stakeholders. This  analysis includes an examination of the need for each data element  requested. In addition, the office thoroughly reviews form design.", "The office\u2019s Director reports to the IRS Commissioner for the Small  Business and Self-Employed Division. The Director also heads a Taxpayer  Burden Reduction Council, which serves as a forum for achieving taxpayer  burden reduction throughout IRS. The work of the council may involve all  IRS divisions and functions, as well as outside stakeholders, including  other federal agencies, state agencies, tax practitioner groups, taxpayer  advocacy panels, and groups representing the small business community.  IRS reports that as many as 100 staff across IRS and other agencies can be  involved in burden reduction initiatives.", "The council directs its efforts in five major areas:   simplifying forms and publications;   streamlining internal policies, processes, and procedures;   promoting consideration of burden reductions in rulings, regulations,   assisting in the development of burden reduction measurement   partnering with internal and external stakeholders to identify areas of  potential burden reduction.", "IRS reports that this targeted, resource-intensive process has achieved  significant reductions in burden: over 200 million burden hours since 2002.  For example, it reports that about 95 million hours of taxpayer burden  were reduced through increases in the income-reporting threshold on  various IRS schedules. Another burden reduction initiative includes a  review of the forms that 15 million taxpayers use to request an extension to  the date for filing their tax returns.  (We did not verify the accuracy of IRS\u2019s reported burden hour savings. We  have previously reported that the estimation model that IRS uses for  compliance burden ignores important components of burden and has  limited capabilities for analyzing the determinants of burden. Moreover,  IRS has an effort under way to revise the methodology used to compute  burden. That new methodology, when completed, may result in different  estimates of reduced burden hours.)", "Similarly, EPA officials stated that they have established processes for  reviewing information collections that supplement the standard PRA  review process. These processes are highly detailed and evaluative, with a  focus on burden reduction, avoiding duplication, and ensuring compliance  with PRA. According to EPA officials, the impetus for establishing these  processes was the high visibility of the agency\u2019s information collections  and the recognition, among other things, that the success of EPA\u2019s  enforcement mission depended on information collections being properly  justified and approved: in the words of one official, information collections  are the \u201clife blood\u201d of the agency.", "According to these officials, the CIO staff are not generally closely involved  in burden reduction initiatives, because they do not have sufficient  technical program expertise and cannot devote the extensive time  required. Instead, these officials said that the CIO staff\u2019s focus is on  fostering high awareness within the agency of the requirements associated  with information collections, educating and training the program office  staff on the need to minimize burden and the impact on respondents,  providing an agencywide perspective on information collections to help  avoid duplication, managing the clearance process for agency information  collections, and acting as liaison between program offices and OMB during  the clearance process. To help program offices consider PRA requirements  such as burden reduction and avoiding duplication as they are developing  new information collections or working on reauthorizing existing  collections, the CIO staff also developed a handbook to help program  staff understand what they need to do to comply with PRA and gain OMB  approval.", "In addition, program offices at EPA have taken on burden reduction  initiatives that are highly detailed and lengthy (sometimes lasting years)  and that involve extensive consultation with stakeholders (including  entities that supply the information, citizens groups, information users and  technical experts in the agency and elsewhere, and state and local  governments). For example, EPA reports that it amended its regulations to  reduce the paperwork burden imposed under the Resource Conservation  and Recovery Act. One burden reduction method EPA used was to  establish higher thresholds for small businesses to report information  required under the act. EPA estimates that the initiative will reduce burden  by 350,000 hours and save $22 million annually. Another EPA program  office reports that it is proposing a significant reduction in burden for its  Toxic Release Inventory program.", "Overall, EPA and IRS reported that they produced significant reductions in  burden by making a commitment to this goal and dedicating resources to it.  In contrast, for the 12 information collections we examined, the CIO review  process resulted in no reduction in burden. Further, the Department of  Labor reported that its PRA reviews of 175 proposed collections over  nearly 2 years did not reduce burden.

For  example, IRS\u2019s position was that the forms in question were in a category of  inquiry that does not fall under PRA. This category of inquiry, which is  considered routine and not burdensome to the respondent, includes  affidavits, oaths, affirmations, certifications, receipts, change of address,  consents, and acknowledgments. According to OMB\u2019s regulation, this  category is limited to those disclosures that require persons to provide or  display only facts necessary to identify themselves, e.g., they entail no  burden other than that necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the  respondent\u2019s address, and the nature of the instrument.

The additional comment period added  in 1995 appears to have had limited effectiveness in obtaining the views of  the public, and agencies are not directly consulting with affected parties as  the act requires. Many factors have contributed to the current state of  agency review processes, including lack of management support,  weaknesses in OMB guidance, and insufficient agency attention to the  requirements of the PRA and related guidance. Until these factors are  addressed, OMB, federal agencies, and the public lack adequate assurance  that government information collections are necessary and that they  appropriately balance the resulting burden with the benefits of using the  information collected.", "The targeted approaches to burden reduction used by IRS and EPA  represent a promising alternative to the current process outlined in the  PRA.

The Treasury CIO stated that the PRA does not  specify when agencies are to consult and that the notices on IRS\u2019s forms  satisfy the requirement to consult (these are the standard PRA notices  that, among other things, solicit public comments). The Department of  Labor\u2019s CIO stated that publication of the Federal Register notice is  sufficient (particularly for routine renewals of collections), that to do  more would not be a good use of agency resources, and that the  rulemaking process involves \u201cgive and take\u201d with the regulated  community that \u201cmeets the practical purposes intended by the PRA  requirements for consultation.\u201d The CIO of HUD agreed that more  efforts could be made to seek public comment, but stated that extensive  public outreach on all information collection submissions is  impracticable (particularly for approval renewals and for small and  short-term collections).", "We disagree with the agencies\u2019 positions on public consultation. The  language of the act clearly requires consultation to occur on every  collection: agencies shall \u201cprovide 60-day notice in the Federal Register,  and otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies  concerning each proposed collection\u2026\u201d Given this unambiguous  statutory language, we believe that OMB should direct agencies to consult  on every collection, as the law requires. However, we are also concerned  that public consultation be efficient and effective; accordingly, among the  matters that we propose for congressional consideration is the mandating  of pilot projects to test and review alternative approaches to achieving the  PRA\u2019s goals. We disagree with the position of OMB and the Treasury that  asking the public to comment on approved forms satisfies the law\u2019s  requirement. OMB\u2019s regulation requires that forms include a request that  the public direct to the agency any comments concerning the accuracy of  burden estimates and suggestions for reducing burden. This requirement,  however, is separate from the PRA requirement that agencies consult with  the public. We also disagree with the Treasury that the act does not specify  when agencies are to consult. The act states that an agency \u201cshall not  conduct or sponsor the collection of information unless in advance of the  adoption or revision of the collection of information (1) the agency has \u2026  evaluated the public comments received under section 3506(c)(2),\u201d which  is the section establishing the public consultation requirement cited above.  We disagree with the Labor CIO that the give and take of the rulemaking  process with the regulated community meets the purposes intended by the  PRA\u2019s consultation requirement. Although some information collections are  associated with rulemaking, many are not. The act\u2019s requirements for  consultation apply to all information collections.", "OMB, the Treasury, and HUD disagreed with our finding that certain  forms have been improperly treated as certifications and elections that  are not subject to the PRA.", "We continue to believe that the forms in question do not properly fall into  this category, because they entail significant burden.

For example, the IRS forms  include requirements for respondents to report income or expense  information, apply for a Social Security number if needed, read various IRS  publications, submit additional IRS forms, obtain multiple signatures,  become familiar with various Internal Revenue Code sections, submit  copies of the completed forms to various IRS offices, and retain a copy for  their records.", "OMB and the Treasury disagreed with our position that IRS\u2019s reference  to \u201cthe Internal Revenue laws of the United States\u201d on its forms does not  satisfy OMB\u2019s regulation requiring the specific legal authority to be  cited. In addition, the Treasury CIO stated that the references in  instructions and other IRS information products to specific sections of  the tax code are sufficient to provide taxpayers with the knowledge of  what law requires them to report their information.", "OMB\u2019s regulation states that agencies are to cite the specific legal authority  whenever the collection of information is required to obtain or retain a  benefit or is mandatory. OMB\u2019s guidance explains the reason for this  requirement as follows: \u201cThis should ensure a higher response rate and  help the respondent understand the benefit and/or need to respond in an  accurate, complete manner.\u201d If OMB determines that IRS\u2019s circumstances  are such that the requirement should be modified in this case, it may decide  to alter its regulation. We also disagree that references in instructions and  information products to specific sections of the tax code serve to provide  taxpayers with the knowledge of what law requires them to report their  information; many of these references are not related to the law requiring  persons to report the specific information asked for on the form, but rather  explain how to fill out the form.", "OMB disagreed with our conclusion, stated in various forms throughout  the draft report, that without appropriate support and public  consultation, agencies have little assurance that collections satisfy the  standards in the act.

Our review was aimed at  examining compliance with the overall framework the Congress enacted to  minimize public burden and maximize utility. Accordingly, we believe that  agencies\u2019 not complying with that framework reduces the assurance that  these goals have been met. Analyzing specific collections for their burden  and utility was not part of the scope of our work.", "The Treasury CIO disagrees with the \u201cimplied conclusion\u201d in our draft  report that CIO and OMB reviews were inadequate because they did not  produce reductions in burden similar to those of IRS\u2019s Office of  Taxpayer Burden Reduction (OTBR). OMB similarly disagrees with our  conclusion that \u201cthe standard PRA review process resulted in no  reduction in burden\u201d in the 12 case studies, because we did not  demonstrate that burden reduction would have been feasible if the CIO  review of these collections had been more rigorous. According to the  Treasury CIO, it is unrealistic to expect the Treasury CIO (or OMB) to  have the resources and expertise to undertake complex burden  reduction initiatives, as OTBR does, involving as many as 100 staff, and  that charging an agency\u2019s CIO with carrying out PRA responsibilities is  not particularly suited for an agency with separate bureaus with distinct  missions, like the Treasury. The CIO suggests that burden reduction  reviews may benefit from responsibility being transferred to an  organizational level with the requisite program knowledge and  expertise.", "We make no such \u201cimplied conclusion.\u201d Instead, our report concludes that  CIO reviews were inadequate because they were not fully compliant with  the requirements of the PRA.

Consequently, our report  highlights the OTBR process\u2014as well as a similar EPA effort\u2014as  promising alternatives to the current process.", "Our statement that the review process resulted in no reduction in burden is  a factual statement, rather than a conclusion. Furthermore, the reported  success of OTBR reviews suggests the feasibility of further burden  reduction.

As a result, we are recommending that OMB and agencies improve the  current process and suggesting that the Congress consider exploring  promising alternative approaches.", "The Treasury CIO takes issue with our finding that IRS\u2019s support was  often absent or incomplete in certifying that the 10 standards in PRA  had been met (particularly those involving the elimination of  unnecessary duplication, reducing burdens on small business, and its  ability to effectively use the information collected). With respect to  eliminating unnecessary duplication, for example, the CIO stated that no  other agency collects tax information collected by the IRS.

 the extent to which agencies ensure that collection forms on agency  Web sites are properly approved by OMB and included in an inventory of  approved collections; and  the extent to which agencies ensure that collection forms on agency  Web sites disclose certain required information that the public needs to  exercise scrutiny of agency activities.", "To determine the extent that federal agencies have established effective  processes to review proposed information collections, we performed two  levels of work: (1) a governmentwide analysis of collections from OMB\u2019s  database of over 8,200 approved collections and (2) detailed audit work  including case study reviews and applicable internal controls at four  agencies that represented about 83 percent of the PRA burden hours at 68  agencies governmentwide.", "At the governmentwide level, we selected a stratified random probability  sample of 343 collections from a population of 8,211 OMB-approved  collections as of May 2004 to estimate the percentage of collections in  compliance with the act\u2019s requirements   to issue a notice in the Federal Register providing a 60-day public   for the CIO to certify that the 10 information management standards in  the act had been met;

Disposition of sampled collections is provided in table 5.", "With this probability sample, each collection in the population had a known  and nonzero probability of being selected. Each sampled collection was  subsequently weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all the  members of the population, including those that were not selected.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random selections,  each sample is only one of a large number of samples that we might have  drawn. Since each sample could have provided a different estimate, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample results as  a 95 percent confidence interval. This is the interval that would contain the  actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have drawn.  As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence  intervals in this report will include the true values in the sample population.", "At the detailed agency audit level, we compared the act\u2019s requirements with  the paperwork clearance processes used at three departments and one  agency: the Departments of Veterans Affairs (VA), Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), and Labor, as well as the Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) in the Department of the Treasury. Together, these departments and  agencies represented a broad range of paperwork collections and  accounted for about 83 percent of all 68 agencies\u2019 8.1 billion hours of  paperwork burden in 2003\u2014with IRS alone accounting for over 80 percent.  In addition, these agencies represent a mixture of regulatory agencies (IRS  and Labor) and benefit-focused agencies (HUD and VA). We also examined  these agencies\u2019 written directives and orders for reviewing proposed  collections for compliance with the act\u2019s requirements.", "We also selected for detailed case reviews 12 OMB-approved collections (3  at each agency) using the following criteria: a mixture of new and existing  collections, burden hours that exceeded 4,000 hours, and collections that  originated in more than one agency program office. For example, at VA, we  examined collections from both the benefit and health program offices. We  compared the agencies\u2019 processes and practices in these case studies with  the (1) act\u2019s requirements, (2) OMB\u2019s regulation and draft guidance to  agencies, and (3) agencies\u2019 written directives and orders. For each of the 10  certifications, we determined the extent to which the support provided in  the case study files met each of these requirements and classified them as  meeting all elements of the requirement (yes), not meeting any of the  elements of the requirement (no), or meeting some but not all elements of  the requirement (partial). Finally, we interviewed agency officials about  their processes to review proposed information collections.", "To determine the extent to which the four agencies ensure that all  collections were reviewed, included in an inventory, and disclose required  information, we first identified the population of forms available via the  agency\u2019s Web site that were subject to PRA. Because of the design of  agencies\u2019 Web sites, it is possible that we did not identify all forms subject  to PRA. Conversely, some forms we initially had identified as subject to  PRA were subsequently removed from our review when agencies provided  additional information that showed the forms were exempt under the act.  Next, we examined for compliance all of the forms that we could locate on  the VA and Labor Web sites and examined a stratified random probability  sample of forms on the IRS and HUD Web sites. We randomly selected 119  forms from the 492 on the IRS Web site and selected a stratified random  sample of 253 forms from the 423 on the HUD Web site. With these  probability samples, each form in the population had a known and nonzero  probability of being selected. Each sampled form was subsequently  weighted in the analysis to account statistically for all the members of the  population, including those that were not selected.", "We used the results of our analyses to estimate the percentages of the  following five categories of PRA violations: collections that had never been sent to OMB for approval (these were in  total violation of the act\u2019s paperwork clearance requirements, including  the requirement to issue a Federal Register notice providing a 60-day  comment period); expired collections, where OMB\u2019s approval had lapsed;  collections that did not properly display the expiration date (which  indicates when OMB\u2019s approval to collect the information ends);  collections that did not properly display the OMB control number, which  indicates that the agency has been authorized to collect the information  (this category includes forms that were not on the agency\u2019s inventory of  approved collections that OMB maintains on its Web site); and  collections that did not inform respondents of one or more of the five  required notifications (e.g., the right not to respond if a valid OMB  control number is not displayed).", "We did not analyze the information collections or the rate of violations  based on the different purposes for which the information is requested  (e.g., program planning, research).", "Finally, we asked agencies to confirm or refute our findings. This included  sending each of the four agencies a listing of those collections that we  identified as having PRA violations that fell into one or more of the five  categories noted above and requesting that the agencies indicate whether  or not they concurred with our determination. When warranted by the  agency material provided in response to our request, we revised our  determination that a collection was in violation of the PRA.", "All percentage estimates from the samples have margins of error of plus or  minus 10 percent or less, unless otherwise noted.", "After updating our review records as a result of agency responses, we  checked the reliability of our review determinations and data entry by  having a second reviewer check random samples of records drawn from  the data sets we created to contain our review results. A second reviewer  checked 25 percent of the records from our sample of 343 collections  drawn from OMB\u2019s approved collections database and 10 percent of the  records from our four agency Web site forms data set. In both data sets,  individual data element errors were around 1 percent of all data elements  examined, and all identified errors were corrected. We also performed  automated error checks and analyses to detect problems with the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.", "In accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, we  also determined that the computer-generated data in OMB\u2019s database of  information collections that we relied on for this report was sufficiently  accurate and complete for our purposes.

We disagree with OMB\u2019s overall comment that the information in the  draft report does not support our conclusion. We continue to believe  that without improved compliance on the act\u2019s major provisions, the  government has reduced assurance that the goals of the act will be  achieved. Our review was aimed at examining compliance with these  provisions, which the Congress enacted as part of an overall framework  to minimize public burden and maximize utility. Accordingly, we  believe that agencies\u2019 not complying reduces the assurance that these  goals have been met.  2. We agree that we did not cite specific examples of increased burden  and reduced utility. However, analyzing specific collections for their  burden and utility was not part of the scope of our work. See  comment 1. 3. We disagree with OMB\u2019s implication that our suggestion regarding  eliminating the 60-day notice is incongruous with our interest in  increasing public consultation. Our suggestion is not aimed at reducing  opportunities for public consultation, but rather at recognizing that this  approach to consultation appears not to be effective. 4. We disagree with OMB\u2019s characterization of our review as a \u201climited  study.\u201d We compared the act\u2019s requirements with the paperwork  clearance processes used at four agencies that, together, represent a  broad range of paperwork collections and accounted for about 83  percent of all 68 agencies\u2019 8.1 billion hours of paperwork burden in  2003. We also interviewed agency officials about their processes for  reviewing proposed information collections. In addition, for each of the  12 case studies (3 cases at each of the four agencies), we compared the  agencies\u2019 processes and practices in these case studies with (1) the  act\u2019s requirements, (2) OMB\u2019s regulation and draft guidance to  agencies, and (3) agencies\u2019 written directives and orders. For each of  the act\u2019s 10 certifications, we determined the extent to which the  support provided in the case-study files met each of these  requirements.", "In addition to the 12 case studies, we randomly selected 343 cases from  over 8,200 collections at 68 agencies that we used to determine  compliance levels at the four agencies and governmentwide with the  act\u2019s requirements to issue a notice in the Federal Register providing a  60-day public comment period; for the CIO to certify that the 10  information management standards in the act had been met; and for the  agency to consult with the public and affected agencies on ways to  minimize burden.  5. We disagree with OMB\u2019s implication that our finding regarding support  for certifications is not a matter of concern. The Administrator states  that OMB is unsurprised that we found variation in degrees of detail  and the volume of documentation, and that OMB is confident that its  approvals of collections are based on sufficient evidence. However, our  concern is not based on variation in degrees of detail or volume, but on  the adequacy of the support provided. The law requires the CIO to  provide a record supporting the certifications. Our analysis of these  records concluded that the support provided was often missing or  partial. We did not review OMB\u2019s processes for approving information  collections.  6. We disagree with OMB\u2019s position that in order to conclude that \u201cthe  standard PRA review process resulted in no reduction in burden\u201d in the  12 case studies, we would have to demonstrate that burden reduction  would have been feasible if the CIO review of these collections had  been more rigorous. It is a fact, rather than a conclusion, that we found  no burden reduction resulting from any agency\u2019s CIO review of the  collections in our review; similarly, the Department of Labor found no  burden reduction for 175 of its reviews. In addition, OTBR\u2019s reported  success in reducing burden for collections already approved by both  the CIO and OMB suggests that additional reductions are feasible.  However, we are unable to determine the magnitude of reductions  possible under the current CIO review process because none of the  agencies we reviewed have processes that fully comply with PRA  requirements. By implementing our recommendations to improve the  current review process and make it fully compliant, OMB and  agencies\u2014and the Congress\u2014should then have the means to measure  the results of this process and compare these with the results of  alternative approaches. In addition, we agree that the program offices  often have the expertise to identify burden reduction activities\u2014a  position wholly consistent with the PRA. Under the act, program  offices\u2014rather than the CIO\u2014have the responsibility for justifying  their proposed information collections. 7. We disagree with OMB\u2019s position on public consultation. The language  of the act clearly requires consultation to occur on every collection:  agencies shall \u201cprovide 60-day notice in the Federal Register, and  otherwise consult with members of the public and affected agencies  concerning each proposed collection\u2026\u201d Given this unambiguous  statutory language, we believe that OMB should direct agencies to  consult on every collection, as we recommended. We disagree that  asking the public to comment on approved forms satisfies that  requirement. OMB\u2019s regulation does require that forms include a  request that the public direct to the agency any comments concerning  the accuracy of burden estimates and suggestions for reducing burden.  This requirement, however, is separate from the PRA requirement that  agencies consult with the public.  8. We do not agree that our report is of limited scope because it does not  provide concrete evidence of unnecessary burden or reduced utility  with respect to individual collections. See comment 4. 9. See comment 3. 10. We do not agree with OMB\u2019s opinion that IRS forms do not need to cite  specific legal authority requiring the information to be collected. OMB\u2019s  regulation states that agencies are to cite the specific legal authority  whenever the collection of information is required to obtain or retain a  benefit or is mandatory. OMB\u2019s guidance explains the reason for this  requirement as follows: \u201cThis should ensure a higher response rate and  help the respondent understand the benefit and/or need to respond in  an accurate, complete manner.\u201d If OMB determines that IRS\u2019s  circumstances are such that the requirement should be modified for  IRS, it may decide to alter its regulation. 11. We disagree with OMB\u2019s position that the IRS forms we discussed fall  into the category of certification and election not subject to the PRA.  OMB\u2019s regulation states that the certifications and elections exemption  only applies \u201cprovided that  entail no burden other than that  necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the respondent\u2019s  address, and the nature of the instrument\u2026\u201d In contrast, these forms  contain multiple requirements that go beyond this threshold. For  example, the IRS forms include requirements for respondents to report  income or expense information, apply for a Social Security number if  needed, read various IRS publications, submit additional IRS forms,  obtain multiple signatures, become familiar with various Internal  Revenue Code sections, submit copies of the completed forms to  various IRS offices, and retain a copy for their records.  12. We disagree with OMB that before it can determine to implement our  recommendation on public consultation, it should wait for additional  evidence on its cost-effectiveness. It is our position that the act\u2019s  language currently requires consultation to occur on each collection.  We do suggest, however, that the Congress may wish to consider  mandating the development of pilot projects to test and review the  value of alternative approaches to the current process; such pilot  projects could help OMB develop evidence regarding the cost- effectiveness of a number of different options for achieving the goals of  the PRA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Housing and Urban Development", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Housing and  Urban Development\u2019s letter dated April 20, 2005."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.

Although the HUD CIO believes that extensive public outreach on all  collections is impracticable, PRA clearly requires public consultation to  occur on every collection: agencies shall \u201cprovide 60-day notice in the  Federal Register, and otherwise consult with members of the public  and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection\u2026\u201d  Approval renewals and small and short-term collections are not exempt  from this requirement.

We disagree with the CIO\u2019s position that the 15 forms under discussion  were properly treated as certifications and elections that are not  subject to the PRA. We continue to believe that the forms in question do  not properly fall into this category, because they entail significant  burden. OMB\u2019s regulation states that the certifications and elections  exemption only applies \u201cprovided that  entail no burden other  than that necessary to identify the respondent, the date, the  respondent\u2019s address, and the nature of the instrument\u2026\u201d In contrast,  these forms contain multiple requirements that go beyond this  threshold.

We disagree with the CIO\u2019s position that IRS\u2019s general reference to the  Internal Revenue laws of the United States provides enough  information for respondents to know what specific law requires their  information to be reported. OMB\u2019s regulation states that agencies are to  cite the specific legal authority whenever the collection of information  is required to obtain or retain a benefit or is mandatory. OMB\u2019s  guidance explains the reason for this requirement as follows: \u201cThis  should ensure a higher response rate and help the respondent  understand the benefit and/or need to respond in an accurate, complete  manner.\u201d If OMB determines that IRS\u2019s circumstances are such that the  requirement should be modified for IRS, it may decide to alter its  regulation. 3. We disagree that the references in instructions and other IRS  information products to specific sections of the tax code are sufficient  to provide taxpayers with the knowledge of what law requires them to  report their information. Many of these references are not related to the  law requiring persons to report the specific information asked for on  the form, but rather explain how to fill out the form.  4. We disagree with the Treasury CIO\u2019s statement that the PRA does not  specify when agencies are to consult and that the notices on IRS\u2019s  forms satisfy the requirement to consult. The act states that an agency  \u201cshall not conduct or sponsor the collection of information unless in  advance of the adoption or revision of the collection of information (1)  the agency has \u2026 evaluated the public comments received under  section 3506(c)(2),\u201d which is the section establishing the public  consultation requirement. Asking the public to comment on approved  forms does not satisfy that requirement. OMB\u2019s regulation directs  agencies to ask for comments on forms, but this requirement is in  addition to the PRA public consultation requirement.  5. We disagree with the position of the Treasury CIO (and OMB) on public  consultation. The language of the act clearly requires consultation to  occur on every collection: agencies shall \u201cprovide 60-day notice in the  Federal Register, and otherwise consult with members of the public  and affected agencies concerning each proposed collection\u2026\u201d (See  also comment 4.) We believe that agencies should comply with current  law. However, we are also concerned that public consultation be  efficient and effective; accordingly, among the matters that we propose  for congressional consideration is the mandating of pilot projects to  test and review alternative approaches to achieving the PRA\u2019s goals.  6. Our report does not contain the \u201cimplied conclusion\u201d cited by the  Treasury CIO. Instead, our report concludes that CIO reviews were  inadequate because they failed to fully comply with PRA requirements.  Further, we are not suggesting that the CIO\u2019s office conduct efforts  similar to those of OTBR. Instead, our report highlights the OTBR  process\u2014as well as an EPA effort\u2014as promising alternatives to the  current process. 7. We agree that there may be benefit in having burden reduction  initiatives performed by those with the requisite program knowledge  and expertise (regardless of who has the ultimate responsibility for  these initiatives). This position is consistent with the current process in  which program offices, rather than the CIO, have responsibility for  justifying their proposed information collections. 8. Regarding the draft report\u2019s finding that IRS\u2019s support was often absent  or incomplete in certifying that the 10 standards in the PRA had been  met, our draft report did not conclude that IRS was not in compliance  with the act\u2019s 10 standards or that any of its collections involved  unnecessary duplication, failed to reduce burdens on small business, or  did not use the information it collected. Rather, we reported that the  PRA requires agencies to have support for its certifications, and we  found such support was often absent or incomplete in the IRS  collections we reviewed.  9. Although the Treasury CIO indicates that the IRS\u2019s information  collections do not involve unnecessary duplication, the IRS collections  we reviewed did not consistently provide support for the agency\u2019s  certification of this position. Without information in the submission  describing actions taken to avoid unnecessary duplication, decision  makers and the public would have reduced assurance that a proposed  collection satisfied this standard.  10. The Treasury CIO cites various IRS initiatives that reduced burden on  small business, all of which were the result of OTBR efforts. We point  out in our report, however, that the standard on reducing burden is not  limited to small business and that our review was aimed at determining  whether CIO review files on IRS collections provided adequate support  for this standard.  11. The act requires the CIO to certify that the collection was developed by  an office that has plans to use the information. The Congress did not  exempt IRS from this requirement despite its functional organizational  structure. 12. We have revised our recommendation to clarify that the Secretary of  Treasury should direct the responsible CIO to ensure that consulting  with potential respondents occurs, as the act requires.  13. The PRA prohibits the head of an agency from collecting information  from respondents without prior OMB approval of the collection,  taxpayer confusion notwithstanding. Accordingly, IRS should comply  with the law.  14. We have deleted the reference to the IRS Commissioner in the final  report recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
