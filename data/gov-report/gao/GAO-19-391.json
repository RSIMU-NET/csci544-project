GAO reviewed federal reports on FLW; analyzed agency documents; interviewed officials from EPA, FDA, USDA, and states and representatives of nonfederal stakeholders, such as academic institutions, industry, international organizations, nonprofit organizations, and a tribal organization, based on their demonstrated expertise on FLW; and attended conferences on FLW."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified three key areas in which challenges exist to reducing food loss and waste (FLW) in the United States: (1) limited data and information about FLW; (2) a lack of awareness and education about FLW; and (3) limited infrastructure and capacity. For example, the causes of FLW vary across the stages of the food supply chain (see figure), but the share of total FLW due to each of these causes is currently unknown, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) report. GAO identified these challenges through interviews with selected stakeholders.", "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and USDA have taken initial actions to address key challenges to reducing FLW in the United States since announcing a national FLW reduction goal in 2015. These actions include conducting a study to identify gaps in information about farm-level FLW and building public awareness about ways to reduce FLW.", "EPA, USDA, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have taken some actions to plan and organize their efforts toward achieving the national FLW reduction goal. For example, EPA developed an internal plan that established action areas, goals, and activities for reducing FLW, and USDA designated an individual to guide USDA's FLW efforts. In October 2018, EPA, USDA, and FDA signed an interagency agreement committing them to developing a strategic plan to improve their collaboration and coordination in reducing FLW. In April 2019, the agencies announced an interagency strategic plan with prioritized action areas to reduce FLW, but this strategic plan does not address how it will incorporate key practices for interagency collaboration that GAO identified, including (1) agreeing on roles and responsibilities; (2) developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and report on results; (3) clearly defining short- and long-term outcomes; (4) identifying how leadership commitment will be sustained; and (5) ensuring that the relevant stakeholders have been included in the collaborative effort.

In  addition, in 2016, Rethink Food Waste Through Economics and Data  (ReFED) reported that more than $218 billion\u20141.3 percent of the U.S.  gross domestic product\u2014is spent each year on growing, processing,  transporting, and disposing of food that is not eaten. For the purposes of  this report, we refer to food loss and waste (FLW) as any food originally  meant for human consumption that leaves the human food supply chain,  even if it is directed to other uses, such as animal feed or bioenergy.  FLW may occur across the entire food supply chain and has significant  economic, environmental, or social effects on various stakeholders,  including businesses and consumers. For example, in 2014, the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported that FLW costs consumers  $371 per person each year.", "According to a 2017 study, the environmental effects of FLW include  biodiversity loss and the use of resources, such as cropland, fertilizers,  and water, to grow food that is never eaten. In addition, in 2018 the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that, based on 2015  data, food constituted 22 percent of all waste in landfills. Due to the lack  of oxygen, as food decays in landfills it produces methane, a greenhouse  gas that contributes to climate change. Furthermore, according to a 2018  USDA report, 40 million Americans lived in households that were food  insecure at some point during the previous year. Recovering edible food  is an opportunity to help feed people. For example, in 2016, ReFED  estimated that by increasing food recovery through food donations, food  businesses could feasibly provide an additional 1.8 billion meals over the  next decade.", "FLW has been an issue of concern for decades. For example, we  reviewed USDA\u2019s FLW reduction efforts in 1977. In September 2015,  EPA, which oversees municipal solid-waste management, and USDA,  which has overarching objectives related to reducing food insecurity and  improving food safety, among other things, announced a national goal to  reduce FLW in the United States by 50 percent by 2030, which aligns  with Target 12.3 of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.  EPA and USDA each has its own definition and baseline estimate of FLW  that it intends to use to measure progress in reaching the 50 percent FLW  reduction goal based on their agency missions. In October 2018, EPA,  USDA, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has food  safety responsibilities, among other things, signed a formal agreement  aimed at increasing collaboration and coordination on FLW reduction  efforts among these agencies. Furthermore, in the Agriculture  Improvement Act of 2018, also known as the 2018 Farm Bill, Congress  tasked the Secretary of Agriculture with taking a number of actions to  address FLW, including conducting studies, and working with local  governments, among other things. Nonfederal stakeholders, such as  states and municipalities, tribes, international and nonprofit organizations,  the food industry, and academic institutions, are also involved with efforts  to study and reduce FLW. For example, the Massachusetts Department  of Environmental Protection supports residential FLW reduction efforts  through grants to cities and towns to promote residential composting, and  it implemented a regulation in 2014 that bans commercial entities from  disposing of or incinerating food waste at solid waste disposal facilities. In  addition, academic institutions, such as Harvard Law School\u2019s Food Law  and Policy Clinic, have studied FLW issues and worked with stakeholders  to identify potential solutions, including working with various states to  develop legal fact sheets to help businesses and nonprofit organizations  understand the legal liability issues related to food donations.", "You asked us to examine the actions federal agencies are taking to  address FLW.

For example, we interviewed  representatives of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization  (FAO) about the challenges it faces in developing a methodology for  measuring FLW at the national and food supply-chain stage levels.", "We identified representatives of these nonfederal stakeholders through  interviews with agency officials and through a snowball approach, in  which we reviewed stakeholder documents to identify other key  stakeholders and asked stakeholders to recommend other key  stakeholders for possible inclusion in this review. We selected a  nongeneralizable sample of 26 nonfederal stakeholders based on  whether the stakeholders had demonstrated expertise on FLW by  conducting research or drafting reports about FLW issues at one or more  of the food supply-chain stages or by participating in FLW reduction  activities. Nonfederal stakeholders that met these selection criteria but  were not selected were excluded only due to time and resource  limitations. We conducted a thematic analysis of our interviews to identify  common patterns of challenges. Specifically, we reviewed nonfederal  stakeholder responses to our interview questions and grouped them into  categories of challenges that EPA, FDA, and USDA may be able to  address. Because this is a nongeneralizable sample, the views of these  nonfederal stakeholders do not represent the views of all stakeholders  who study FLW or who have made efforts to reduce FLW, but they  provide illustrative examples of challenges to reducing FLW and ways in  which federal agencies could address these challenges.", "We also conducted site visits to businesses and institutions in  Massachusetts that are taking steps to reduce FLW. These site visits  were selected and organized by the Center for EcoTechnology, a  nonfederal stakeholder that we had previously interviewed, to provide  illustrative examples of ongoing FLW reduction efforts at the different  stages of the food supply chain. For example, we visited a farm in  Massachusetts that had collaborated with an energy company to develop  an anaerobic digestion facility to process FLW from local farms and other  sources. In addition, we toured a grocery store, hospital, university, and  restaurant that are each taking steps to reduce FLW through efforts such  as more efficient ordering, food donations to charitable organizations, and  composting.", "We also attended various conferences and workshops dealing with  FLW. During these events, we used convenience sampling (i.e.,  interviewing attendees that were available for discussions) to capture a  broad range of perspectives across actors and sectors of the food supply  chain. These discussions were included for contextual sophistication, but  not for evidentiary purposes.", "To examine actions EPA and USDA have taken to address the  challenges with reducing FLW in the United States, we reviewed EPA and  USDA reports, such as EPA\u2019s Advancing Sustainable Materials  Management Fact Sheet reports and a 2014 USDA report on food loss  estimates. We also reviewed relevant legislative documents, such as  the Committee on Appropriations House Report 115-232 accompanying  H.R. 3268, which directs USDA\u2019s Economic Research Service to conduct  a study that describes the quantity and types of produce wasted on farms,  barriers to recovering that produce, and new market opportunities to  increase recovery and farmers\u2019 income.

We also interviewed the selected  nonfederal stakeholders to determine the extent to which they have  collaborated with EPA, USDA, and FDA on FLW issues. We focused on  EPA, USDA, and FDA because these agencies made a commitment to  coordinate federal efforts to achieve the national FLW reduction goal. In  addition, we compared EPA, USDA, and FDA\u2019s collaborative efforts for  planning to achieve the national FLW reduction goal to practices for  enhancing interagency collaboration that we identified in prior work.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2017 to June 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In May 2018, Executive Order  13693 was revoked and replaced by Executive Order 13834, \u201cEfficient  Federal Operations,\u201d which directed federal agencies to implement waste  prevention and recycling measures but no longer included the specific  direction to divert at least 50 percent of nonhazardous solid waste,  including food and compostable material, annually or to pursue  opportunities for net-zero waste or additional diversion opportunities.  CEQ and OMB are responsible for implementing and tracking progress  for these executive orders.", "Among its duties, EPA oversees municipal solid-waste management. For  example, EPA regulates the management of household, industrial, and  manufacturing solid and hazardous wastes under the Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act. The objectives of the act include  protecting the United States from the hazards of waste disposal, to  conserve energy and natural resources by recycling and recovery, and to  minimize the generation of hazardous waste. However, the management  of nonhazardous solid waste, such as food waste, is left primarily to the  states and local governments. Under the act, EPA established solid- waste management guidelines for municipalities that encouraged  recycling, including composting food and yard waste. EPA\u2019s Sustainable  Materials Management Program, including the Sustainable Management  of Food strategic priority area, seeks to reduce the environmental impact  of materials through their entire life cycle. Furthermore, available landfill  space is decreasing in various parts of the United States; EPA\u2019s FLW  activities may help extend the life of those existing landfills and provide  opportunities for energy generation.", "According to USDA officials, USDA has developed a broad range of  programs and policies to reduce FLW as a means to support its  overarching objectives related to reducing food insecurity, improving food  safety, increasing market efficiencies, and enhancing farmer income  and rural development. USDA also conducts education and outreach  through its network of state and local offices, the Cooperative Extension  Service, state Departments of Agriculture, land-grant university partners,  and nongovernmental, nonprofit, community, and faith-based  organizations. Additionally, the 2018 Farm Bill requires the Secretary of  Agriculture to take a number of actions to address FLW: (1) create a FLW  Reduction Liaison to coordinate federal, state, local, and  nongovernmental programs, and other efforts, to measure and reduce the  incidence of FLW; (2) conduct a study on food waste in consultation with  the FLW Reduction Liaison and report data collected on food waste and  efforts to reduce and prevent such waste; (3) issue guidance outlining the  best practices to minimize food waste for donated commodities; (4) enter  into cooperative agreements with local or municipal governments to  develop and test strategies for planning and implementing municipal  compost plans and food waste reduction plans; (5) establish a milk  donation program to encourage the donation of milk products produced  and processed in the United States, assist individuals in low-income  groups, and reduce food waste; and (6) establish a Local Agriculture  Market Program to, among other things, promote new business  opportunities and marketing strategies to reduce on-farm food waste.", "Finally, FDA, which is responsible for, among other things, overseeing the  safety of about 80 percent of the nation\u2019s food supply, has a limited  mission related to FLW. FDA was not involved with establishing the  national FLW reduction goal in 2015 but, according to agency officials,  has become more engaged in consumer education and outreach to the  food industry, hunger relief and food rescue organizations, state and local  governments, academia, and other stakeholders on issues related to  FLW.

For example, consistent  with its focus on advancing the sustainable use of materials, including  food, throughout their life cycle to minimize waste and environmental  impacts, EPA uses the term \u201cwasted food\u201d instead of \u201cfood waste\u201d for  food that is not used for its intended purpose because it conveys that a  resource with value is being wasted, whereas \u201cfood waste\u201d implies that  the food no longer has value and needs to be managed as waste. EPA  states that \u201cwasted food\u201d is managed in a variety of ways, including  through donations to food banks, conversion to animal feed, composting,  anaerobic digestion, or sending it to landfills. In contrast, USDA\u2019s  Economic Research Service (ERS) defines food loss as edible food that  is available for human consumption but that is not eaten. According to  ERS, food losses may occur for any number of reasons, including  cooking loss and natural shrinkage; loss from mold, pests, or inadequate  climate control; and plate waste, which refers to edible food that is served  but discarded. In addition, ERS defines food waste as a component of  food loss that refers to food discarded by retailers and consumers due to  quality concerns, such as blemished food.

For example, there are limited data about whether produce that goes unsold is tilled back into the farmland, composted, or sent to a landfill. This nonprofit organization reported the limitations of its estimate of FLW across the food supply chain in the United States. For example, the nonprofit organization documented in its FLW estimate methodology that its farm-production FLW data analysis focused on estimating imperfect-produce rates, but noted that FLW may occur at this stage for a variety of reasons, including inclement weather, pests, or overproduction. It also documented that future research efforts could assess actual produce imperfection and loss rates for each produce type using geographical differences to improve estimate accuracy.", "Representatives from another nonprofit organization that has published an estimate of FLW told us there are data gaps about FLW along the food supply chain.

This official also told us that implementing organic waste (e.g., food waste or other plant and animal materials) bans, which prohibit specified waste generators from sending food waste to landfills, as several states are doing to reduce FLW, tends to promote FLW reduction activities further down on EPA\u2019s Food Recovery Hierarchy. As a result, organic waste bans may contribute relatively little to reducing FLW or maximizing the benefits of such reductions.

Additionally, ERS officials told us that USDA could use the final study to inform USDA\u2019s policy approaches to reducing FLW. For example, the report may inform USDA\u2019s efforts to assist farmers in implementing best practices in reducing FLW and expanding market opportunities for imperfect fruits and vegetables or excess harvest.", "USDA\u2019s National Institute for Food and Agriculture has provided grant funding to projects related to FLW. For example, the institute awarded a grant in 2018 to an academic institution to study the effect of secondary markets as alternative channels for usable food.", "To advance the research mission of the agency, among other reasons, USDA has a memorandum of understanding with the Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, an organization that Congress authorized as part of the 2014 Farm Bill.

For example, EPA published its Sustainable  Materials Management Program Strategic Plan, Fiscal Years 2017-2022  in October 2015. One of the plan\u2019s three strategic priority areas is  Sustainable Food Management, which includes an action area of  promoting opportunities to reduce wasted food and the food\u2019s associated  effects over the entire food supply-chain life cycle with a preference for  using approaches that are higher on the agency\u2019s Food Recovery  Hierarchy. EPA\u2019s strategic plan describes delivering tools and education;  working with states and local communities to help provide regional or  sector-based support; and sharing best practices on wasted-food  reduction efforts. In addition to the planned actions identified in the  Sustainable Food Management area, EPA has also provided the following  FLW education and awareness tools, among others:  Food: Too Good to Waste. This community-based social marketing campaign, implementation guide, and toolkit aim to reduce wasteful household food management practices and keep FLW out of landfills. The toolkit is designed for community organizations, local governments, households, and others interested in reducing wasteful household food management practices. The implementation guide is designed to teach local governments and community organizations how to implement a Food Too Good to Waste campaign in their community using the toolkit. In a 2016 report, EPA listed 17 communities in various states, including Rhode Island and Vermont, that had implemented Food Too Good to Waste campaigns and, as part of this implementation, could use outreach and engagement tools adaptable to the needs of their communities based on their available resources. The campaigns focused on helping households make small shifts in how they shop, prepare, and store food to prevent it from being wasted.", "Waste Reduction Model. According to the agency\u2019s website, EPA created this tool to help solid-waste planners and organizations track greenhouse gas emissions reductions from several different waste- management practices, including source reduction, recycling, anaerobic digestion, combustion, composting, and landfilling. For example, a food service establishment can use the tool to create an estimate of the greenhouse gas savings associated with decreasing  the amount of bread and produce landfilled.", "Tip sheets. EPA developed tip sheets about reducing FLW for different sectors involved in the food supply chain, including manufacturers and restaurants, to emphasize FLW prevention options. EPA officials told us that they make these tip sheets available online on the agency\u2019s website and attend conferences to disseminate information. For example, the officials said that they attended the Midwest Food Recovery Summit in September 2018 and provided these tip sheets at the EPA information booth during the conference.", "In addition, USDA has been involved in the following FLW reduction  efforts to raise awareness and educate various stakeholders along the  food supply chain:  FLW roundtable meeting. In May 2018, the Secretary of Agriculture hosted a roundtable meeting with members of Congress, food industry representatives, and nonprofit groups to raise awareness about FLW and discuss potential solutions.", "FoodKeeper application. In 2015, USDA, in partnership with Cornell University and the Food Marketing Institute, launched the FoodKeeper application, a tool to provide consumers with specific storage advice, including storage timelines for the refrigerator and freezer for food and beverage items. USDA officials stated that the agency updated the application in October 2018 to include various features including searching for food and beverages in Spanish and increasing the number of food items with storage information. USDA has continued to highlight the FoodKeeper application as part of USDA and EPA\u2019s Food Waste Challenge effort to help educate consumers to reduce FLW.", "Infographic. Also in 2015, the USDA Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion issued an infographic, \u201cLet\u2019s Talk Trash,\u201d to help inform American consumers about the benefits of reducing FLW, as shown in figure 4. USDA made the infographic available on its  www.choosemyplate.gov website, which includes additional resources  to help consumers think about the amount of FLW at home.", "Strategies for schools. In 2015, USDA\u2019s Food and Nutrition Service issued a summary of strategies for schools to reduce FLW that included a list of resources to encourage FLW diversion by donating uneaten food to nonprofit institutions and information about composting. The Food and Nutrition Service also recommended that schools introduce \u201cshare tables\u201d into cafeterias so that students could exchange unwanted but otherwise edible food items. In June 2016, USDA issued a memorandum to remind states\u2019 Child Nutrition  Program directors of the opportunities to use share tables to reduce  FLW in a number of Child Nutrition Programs, such as the National  School Lunch Program. In July 2016, the Food and Nutrition Service  issued guidance directed at school staff members and students,  among others, with tips to prevent FLW, including encouraging  students to use share tables.", "To further provide information, raise awareness, and educate different  stakeholders along the food supply chain, EPA and USDA have  collaborated on the following FLW reduction efforts:", "A Guide to Conducting Student Food Waste Audits. In 2017, EPA, USDA, and the University of Arkansas collaborated to create this guide for students and school personnel about the amount of FLW in their cafeterias. The guide provides information on why and how to do a food waste audit and what to do with the data collected. It also offers FLW prevention ideas.", "Public/private partnerships. EPA and USDA support public/private partnerships to provide key information, solutions, and best practices to reduce FLW across the food supply chain. For example, EPA and USDA established the U.S. Food Loss and Waste 2030 Champions initiative in November 2016 as a way to increase efforts to meet the national FLW reduction goal. This 2030 Champions initiative recognizes organizations that have committed to cutting FLW in their own operations in half by 2030 and encourages Champions to report on their progress. In May 2018, EPA hosted a public webinar to highlight the actions of three 2030 Champions to share best practices, tools, and resources these organizations created to prevent food from going to waste. In March 2019, USDA officials told us that eight additional businesses have joined the 15 Champions involved in the initiative since its launch. In addition, EPA and USDA also support Further With Food, an online hub developed by EPA, USDA, and 10 other organizations that provides information and solutions to raise  public awareness and reduce FLW.", "Participation in external conferences. EPA and USDA have conducted outreach, including through participation in conferences and seminars, and have disseminated resources related to FLW. For example, EPA and USDA each sent an official to attend and present at the National Academies of Science\u2019s Reducing Food Loss and Waste: A Workshop on Impacts in October 2018. USDA officials told us they helped fund this workshop and helped develop the workshop\u2019s objectives, which were to explore the effects of reducing FLW on food availability and other factors; to examine the role of governments, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector in adopting best practices to improve the benefits and reduce the costs of reducing FLW; and to discuss opportunities for partnerships to address FLW.", "USDA has also collaborated with FDA to address FLW. For example,  USDA and FDA are both on the Executive Board of the Conference for  Food Protection, an organization that brings together representatives  from the food industry, government, academia, and consumer  organizations to identify and address emerging problems of food safety.  In April 2016, this group released a Comprehensive Resource for Food  Recovery Programs to reduce FLW through the recovery of consumable  food. This report is intended to assist stakeholders involved in the  recovery, distribution, or service of food to people who are food insecure.  The report references the national food standards at the retail level, as  expressed in the FDA Food Code, to minimize the occurrence of risk  factors that contribute to foodborne illness. FDA contributed to the  submission of an issue to the 2018 Biennial Meeting of the Conference  for Food Protection that sought to promote uniformity in the way in which  state and local governments regulate food donation and recovery  operations in retail and foodservice establishments. In addition, FDA  has disseminated information to the public about strategies to reduce  FLW while maintaining food safety and has referred to USDA\u2019s  FoodKeeper application as a resource for learning how to store  perishable food and employ safe storage practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA and USDA Have Taken Some Actions to Increase Infrastructure and Capacity to Support Efforts to Reduce FLW", "paragraphs": ["EPA and USDA have each taken some actions to increase infrastructure  and capacity to support efforts to reduce FLW in the United States.", "EPA has taken some actions to increase infrastructure and capacity to  reduce FLW in the United States.

EPA\u2019s Excess Food Opportunities Map displays the locations of more than 500,000 industrial, commercial, and institutional food generators that may potentially produce excess food and more than 4,000 potential recipients of that excess food. The map also provides information at the specific establishment\u2013level, including estimates of excess food generation that may help users identify alternatives to sending excess food to landfills. The map helps users identify potential infrastructure gaps for managing excess food, inform FLW management decisions at the local level, and identify potential sources of food for rescue and reuse, among other purposes. An EPA official told us that the communication plan for the launch of the Excess Food Opportunities Map included a webinar announcing the map in July 2018 and providing presentations about the map at various conferences, including during the National Academies Reducing Food Loss and Waste Workshop in October 2018. The official also stated that emails about the map were sent to over 13,000 people and approximately 700 people attended the  webinar EPA hosted in July 2018.", "Recycling infrastructure. EPA\u2019s Sustainable Materials Management program\u2019s strategic plan describes EPA\u2019s role in providing states, businesses, and other stakeholders with, among other things, tools, guidelines, and technical support to more effectively manage waste, including by helping increase recycling infrastructure. In May 2018, EPA cohosted a recycling infrastructure workshop to identify solutions for creating infrastructure for anaerobic digestion and composting. In addition, EPA officials told us that the agency is in the process of updating its recycling guide for state and local governments and they anticipate completing it by the end of 2020.", "USDA also has taken some actions to increase infrastructure and  capacity to reduce FLW in the United States. For example:  Food programs. USDA officials told us that USDA food programs, such as The Emergency Food Assistance Program, support efforts to feed people and to provide access to affordable and nutritious food. For example, food donation organizations that are recipients of program funds may use these funds to pay the direct expenses associated with the distribution of USDA foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and beans.", "New FLW-reduction technologies. USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service has various research programs, including one to enhance the quality and utilization of agricultural products. Potential benefits listed as part of this research program are minimizing food product losses and reducing FLW through the development of farm production technologies, such as the development of an apple-sorting system that will help reduce apple harvest losses. According to USDA officials, most of the innovations of this research program involve creating value-added products from \u201cugly produce\u201d or from food processing byproducts, such as orange peel or mushroom-stalk waste, or creating new technologies to prolong the shelf life of food products.", "Meat and poultry donation rules. USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service issued a directive that outlines procedures for donating certain meat and poultry products to nonprofit organizations. The Food Safety and Inspection Service has also  begun, under certain circumstances, to recognize food banks as  \u201cretail-type\u201d establishments, which allows food banks to break down  bulk shipments of federally inspected meat or poultry products, wrap  or rewrap those products, and label the products for distribution to  consumers. In one case, this recognition enabled a nonprofit  organization engaged in food donations to gain 2.6 million pounds of  food donations from manufacturers in 2016, according to USDA  documents.", "Grant funding. USDA\u2019s Rural Utilities Service has provided some funding to support FLW reduction infrastructure in rural communities. For example, USDA awarded a 2016 USDA Rural Utilities Service Solid Waste Management grant to the University of Iowa\u2019s Waste Reduction Center, which has worked toward addressing the issue of FLW disposal. More recently, in 2018, USDA awarded a solid-waste management grant to the Center for EcoTechnology, a nonprofit that provides technical assistance to implement FLW diversion programs.", "Low-interest loans. USDA\u2019s Farm Storage Facility Loan Program provides low-interest loans for producers to store, handle, and transport the food they produce. The loans are designed to assist a diverse range of farming operations, including small and midsized businesses and operations supplying local food and farmers markets. The program helps keep food from being damaged by pests or inclement weather, among other things, so that more food can reach store shelves.", "Funding for renewable energy systems. USDA\u2019s Rural Energy for America Program provides grants and loan guarantees to farmers, ranchers, and eligible small businesses to install renewable energy and energy-efficiency systems. For example, according to a Rural Energy for America Program Fact Sheet, funds may be used for the purchase, installation, and construction of renewable energy systems, such as anaerobic digesters.

EPA, USDA, and FDA only recently initiated  their interagency collaboration on FLW reduction efforts toward achieving  the national FLW reduction goal, but have not yet taken certain steps that  align with key practices for interagency collaboration.", "EPA has taken actions to guide its own efforts toward achieving the  national FLW reduction goal. For example, in 2015, EPA issued a  strategic plan that included a strategic priority area of sustainable food  management. Subsequently, EPA developed an internal planning  document (U.S. EPA Sustainable Management of Food Strategy, Fiscal  Year 2018-2022). This planning document established action areas,  goals, and activities for reducing FLW to achieve the national FLW  reduction goal. For example, the plan identified five action areas,  including addressing data and measurement issues, collaboration and  partnerships, technical assistance, infrastructure and capacity, and  communication and outreach. According to EPA officials, the agency  intends to use the plan to track its progress and measure results towards  the national FLW reduction goal.", "USDA has also taken actions to guide its own efforts toward achieving the  national FLW reduction goal. For example, according to USDA officials,  the department established a FLW working group in 2015 that currently  meets on a monthly basis. According to officials from the Office of the  Chief Economist and ERS, the department also designated an individual  within the Office of the Chief Economist to guide USDA\u2019s FLW efforts. In  addition, in March 2016, the National Institute for Food and Agriculture\u2019s  Pilot Science Outcome Committee on Environmental Sustainability  identified FLW as a top science priority area to address environmental  sustainability. According to the committee, FLW is an integral  component of environmental sustainability, and mitigating FLW has the  potential to create economic, environmental, and social benefits while  contributing to food security, resource conservation, and the mitigation of  climate change.", "Furthermore, EPA and USDA have contributed to the work of the  Commission for Environmental Cooperation, an intergovernmental  organization established by the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the  United States to facilitate effective cooperation on the conservation,  protection, and enhancement of the environment in their territories. The  organization has an initiative to identify challenges, opportunities, and  solutions related to increasing organic waste diversion and processing  capacity in North America. This organization issued a report in 2017  about, among other things, the management of organic waste and best  practices for reducing FLW and diverting other organic waste materials  away from landfills. EPA is on the steering committee for this effort.  According to an EPA announcement in March 2019, the commission  issued a practical guide and technical report on FLW measurement.", "Moreover, in October 2018, the Secretary of Agriculture hosted a public  meeting to promote FLW reduction. During this meeting, EPA, USDA, and  FDA signed a formal interagency agreement referred to by the agencies  as the Winning on Reducing Food Waste initiative. Under this 2-year  agreement, the agencies committed to developing an interagency  strategic plan to increase collaboration and coordination among the  agencies on their FLW reduction efforts. According to the agreement, this  additional collaboration is intended to strategically align each agency\u2019s  efforts to better educate Americans on the impacts of reducing FLW. The  agencies also agreed to, where appropriate, educate actors throughout  the supply chain on the best practices to reduce FLW in the growing,  manufacturing, transporting, selling, and disposing of food and the  handling, preparation, and storage of food, as well as creating new uses  for excess food. The formal agreement mentions public-private  partnerships and, according to EPA officials, the agencies intend to use  the views of stakeholders in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors to  inform their strategic plan. According to EPA officials, the agencies intend  to discuss common goals and to identify additional initiatives as  appropriate to achieve the national FLW reduction goal. In announcing  this initiative, the Secretary of Agriculture affirmed the importance of  reducing FLW by saying that \u201can unacceptable percentage of our food  supply is lost or wasted\u201d and that \u201cas the world\u2019s population continues to  grow and the food systems continue to evolve, now is the time for action  to educate consumers and businesses alike on the need for food waste  reduction.\u201d In addition, the FDA Commissioner stated that \u201cby taking  steps to address obstacles that food donation and recovery programs  may face in giving unsold foods a second opportunity and helping food  producers find ways to recondition their products so that they can be  safely sold or donated, our aim is to both reduce food waste and nourish  Americans in need.\u201d", "In April 2019, the agencies held a public event to announce their Winning  on Reducing Food Waste Federal Interagency Strategy. This strategic  plan identified six prioritized action areas for activities to reduce FLW. For  example, the agencies plan to, among other things, increase consumer  education and outreach efforts; increase coordination and guidance on  FLW measurement; and clarify and communicate information on food  safety, food date labels, and food donations. In addition, the agencies  signed a formal agreement with ReFED to, among other things, better  evaluate and improve upon strategies to reduce FLW. For example,  according to the 2019 agreement, the agencies and ReFED intend to  leverage existing partnerships to advance data-collection and  measurement activities related to FLW. Finally, EPA announced that it  had selected three recipients to receive EPA funding to support  infrastructure projects to help reduce FLW and divert FLW from landfills.", "In our prior work, we have found that key practices to enhance and  sustain interagency collaboration include agreeing on roles and  responsibilities and developing mechanisms to monitor, evaluate, and  report on results. In addition, we have found that key practices for  agency collaboration call for clearly defining short- and long-term  outcomes. Furthermore, such interagency efforts benefit from identifying  how leadership commitment will be sustained. Lastly, we identified a  key practice that calls for ensuring that the relevant stakeholders have  been included in the collaborative effort. This collaboration can include  other federal agencies, state and local entities, and private and nonprofit  organizations.", "According to the strategic plan, the agencies built on information from  several sources, including prior GAO work on implementing interagency  collaborative mechanisms, to develop the Winning on Reducing Food  Waste Federal Interagency Strategy. However, this strategic plan does  not align with certain key practices for interagency collaboration. For  example, the first priority area identified in the strategic plan is to enhance  interagency collaboration, and the strategic plan states that an  interagency, collaborative mechanism will be established to reduce  programmatic redundancies and leverage complementary activities.  However, the strategic plan does not identify how this mechanism will be  used to monitor, evaluate, or report on results, establish a time frame for  developing this collaborative mechanism, or describe how the agencies  will engage relevant stakeholders, such as other federal, state, and local  agencies, nonprofit organizations, academic institutions, food industry  entities, international organizations, and tribal organizations. In addition,  several of the strategic plan\u2019s priority areas address specific aspects of  reducing FLW, such as encouraging FLW reduction by federal agencies  in their respective facilities. However, the strategic plan does not identify  the roles and responsibilities of the respective agencies for taking action  in these areas and it does not clearly define what specific short- and long- term outcomes the agencies intend to achieve. Furthermore, the agencies  have not identified how they intend to sustain leadership commitment to  this goal. For example, the Winning on Reducing Food Waste formal  interagency collaborative agreement is a 2-year agreement among the  agencies, but the national FLW reduction goal calls for reducing FLW by  half by 2030, which falls well beyond this 2-year time frame. According to  a USDA official, the agencies do not have plans for how they will continue  their interagency collaboration beyond the life of the current agreement.  This official noted that the agencies do not intend to update the strategic  plan for the duration of the 2-year agreement and that the agencies will  release more information to the public about specific actions and  timelines as it becomes available.
