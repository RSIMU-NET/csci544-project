Of these 39 contractors, 7 had been convicted of a crime in federal court; 5 had a federal court judgment in a civil case brought by the federal government rendered against them, and 27 had an adverse decision by a federal Administration Law Judge, board, or commission indicating a violation of law. We did not identify any contractors that were found by a federal court or adjudicated administrative decision to have violated consumer protection or tax laws. We also identified another 3,403 contractors that were involved in enforcement agencies' cases covered by our review and closed during this 3-year period. However, most of these cases that involved alleged law violations were resolved before a decision by a court or administrative adjudicator was reached as to whether a violation of law had occurred. In most instances, these cases were resolved through some form of \"administrative agreement\" or \"settlement\" with the government in which the contractor typically did not admit--and sometimes specifically denied--the violation charged and which did not constitute a judgment or adjudicated administrative decision that a violation had actually occurred. We identified several FAR rule implementation issues through our work in determining the incidence of contractor violations in response to the first question. First, the FAR rule's contractor certification requirement focused on only certain types of law violations. As a result--on the basis of our conceptual application of the certification criteria specified in the revoked FAR rule--only 7 of the 39 contractors we identified as being found by a court or administrative decision to have violated the law would have been required to report the violations in their certifications if they were prospective contractors submitting an offer. The remaining 32 contractors with violations found by a court or administrative decision, as well the 3,403 contractors whose cases were otherwise resolved, would not have been required to report any noncompliance with the law. Further, although many cases were resolved through administrative agreements--and the FAR rule stated that contracting officers should take such information into consideration--the FAR rule did not require prospective contractors to report such agreements. Second, we found that contracting officers would face significant difficulties in verifying or obtaining contractor compliance history information. Third, the FAR rule may have required additional record keeping for some prospective contractors in order for them to track their companies' compliance with applicable laws and accurately certify as to their compliance when submitting their offers. Of the 43 federal contractors who provided us information on the issue of tracking their compliance history, 18 told us that they did not have the capability to identify or track all of the various types of enforcement actions that may have been taken against them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year the federal government awards billions of dollars in contracts for  goods and services. By statute, federal agencies are required to award  contracts to \u201cresponsible sources.\u201d This statutory requirement has been  implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which requires  that government purchases be made from, and government contracts be  awarded to, responsible prospective contractors only.   In accordance with  the statutory definition of \u201cresponsible source,\u201d the FAR establishes \u201ca  satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics\u201d as one of the general  standards a prospective contractor must meet to be responsible. In  December 2000, amidst considerable controversy, a revision to the FAR  (\u201cthe FAR rule\u201d) was promulgated through the regulatory rulemaking  process to clarify what constituted \u201ca satisfactory record of integrity and  business ethics.\u201d This now-revoked FAR rule stated that a satisfactory  record of integrity and business ethics includes a record of satisfactory  compliance with the law, specifically environmental, labor and  employment, antitrust, consumer protection, and tax laws. It also required  prospective contractors to certify in their bids or proposals submitted in  response to government contract solicitations as to their compliance with  these laws within the past 3 years. Specifically, for federal government  contracts expected to exceed $100,000, prospective contractors were to  certify whether, relative to these areas of law, they have been convicted of a  felony (or have felony indictments pending against them), have had a  federal court judgment in a civil case brought by the United States rendered  against them, or have had an adverse decision by a federal administrative  law judge (ALJ), board, or commission indicating a willful violation of law.  The FAR rule also provided guidance to agency contracting officers when  considering a prospective contractor\u2019s compliance history.", "Although the FAR rule was revoked in December 2001, prospective  contractors are still required by statute and the FAR to be responsible  sources (including having a satisfactory record of business ethics and  integrity). As a result of the FAR rule revocation, the FAR itself does not  provide specific guidance to contracting officers on applying the standard  for a satisfactory record of business ethics and integrity (bid protest  decisions from courts and our Office that address the standard do,  however, continue to provide guidance). Also, prospective contractors no  longer have to certify, as they did under the FAR rule, as to their  compliance with environmental, labor and employment, antitrust,  consumer protection, and tax laws.", "Because of your interest in this area, you asked that we address the  following questions:   To what extent have federal contractors violated federal environmental,  labor and employment, antitrust, consumer protection, and tax laws  (the areas of law specified in the FAR rule)?", "What FAR rule implementation issues were identified in our work in  response to the first question?", "To determine the extent of contractor violations, we gathered information  on contractors that were awarded new federal contracts of at least  $100,000 in fiscal year 2000 and federal enforcement agency cases closed  during fiscal years 1997 through 1999 (October 1996 through September  1999). These were the types of contracts and cases that would have been  covered by the FAR rule\u2019s contractor certification requirement had it been  applied beginning with fiscal year 2000, the last full fiscal year for which  contractor data were available at the start of our work.", "We then matched the names of contractors listed in the Federal  Procurement Data System (FPDS)\u2014which is maintained by the General  Services Administration (GSA)\u2014shown as having new federal contracts  awarded in fiscal year 2000 to names in enforcement agency cases closed  during fiscal years 1997 to 1999. These names were in the databases  maintained by seven federal agencies responsible for enforcing or  administering many federal environmental, labor and employment,  antitrust, consumer protection, or tax laws. However, the name-matching  process was sometimes imprecise because contractor names can vary  widely due to such factors as spelling, name combinations, and  parent/subsidiary relationships. Nevertheless, this was generally the only  viable method available for identifying contractors involved in these cases  because, usually, common numeric identifiers were not available.  Therefore, due to name variations, we likely did not identify all of the  contractors involved in the cases in the databases maintained by the  enforcement agencies we examined. Conversely, we found some false  matches\u2014companies with similar names involved in the cases but which  were not the same companies as the contractors. Where we detected false  matches, we eliminated them. See appendix I for further information about  the accuracy of the matches.", "When we matched a name associated with a closed case involving a federal  enforcement agency with the name of a contractor, we reviewed the  disposition of the case as characterized by the agency in its database.  Where a case resulted in an actual decision by a court or an administrative  adjudicator finding that a violation (including convictions and plea  agreements in criminal cases) had occurred, we reported the numbers of  such cases under the \u201cviolation found\u201d column in tables 2 through 5 of this  report corresponding to the areas of law for which the enforcement  agencies are responsible. Adjudicated violations were the type of  information on violations of laws that contracting officers were instructed  by the FAR rule to give the greatest weight in making their responsibility  determinations. For cases that did not result in an actual decision (such as  those that were dismissed, withdrawn, or settled) or for cases that  generally could not have resulted in a determination of a law violation  (such as Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \u201cSuperfund\u201d cases  involving the assessment of liability for cleanup costs), we reported the  total number of such cases under the \u201cother/resolved before decision\u201d  column of the respective tables because such cases were resolved either  through a process that did not involve a law violation determination or  without an actual adjudicated determination of a law violation.", "To identify FAR rule implementation issues from our work in response to  the first objective, we analyzed information from the enforcement agency  cases we matched to federal contractors and considered what information  the contractors would have had to certify under the FAR rule\u2019s certification  requirement. Additionally, we discussed FAR rule implementation issues  and concerns with (1) contracting officers and other officials from the  federal agencies included in our review and (2) contractors involved in the  cases we selected for detailed review. Finally, we requested comments on  the results of our work from officials from the seven federal agencies,  DOD, NASA, and GSA, and the Administrator for Federal Procurement  Policy. We conducted our work from July 2000 through October 2002 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. A  more detailed description of our scope and methodology is included in  appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Prior to January 2001, the FAR had not provided any elaboration on what it  means for a prospective contractor to have \u201ca satisfactory record of  integrity and business ethics.\u201d The FAR simply restated the statutory  language that a \u201cresponsible source\u201d is one that has a \u201csatisfactory record  of integrity and business ethics.\u201d In December 2000, the FAR Council  issued a final rule, effective January 19, 2001, to clarify what constituted \u201ca  satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics\u201d in making contractor  responsibility determinations, including satisfactory compliance with the  law, specifically environmental, labor and employment, antitrust, consumer  protection, and tax laws. According to the FAR Council, the lack of  guidance in the FAR as to what constitutes a satisfactory record of integrity  and business ethics had caused contracting officers to be extremely  reluctant to exercise their discretion in making this determination; and, as  a result, the government continued to award contracts to firms that have  violated procurement and other federal laws, in some cases repeatedly. In  promulgating the FAR rule, the FAR Council surmised that by giving  contracting officers a clearer basis for declining to contract with such  businesses, the government could improve the integrity of the contracting  process, reduce the risk of fraud or noncompliance, and encourage  standards of integrity and compliance with the law. According to the FAR  Council, by ensuring that its contractors possess a satisfactory record of  compliance with the law, the government increases its confidence that a  contractor is a responsible, reliable company that will perform the contract  in an efficient, responsible, and timely manner and should also reduce the  risk that compliance issues will interfere with performance of the contract.", "The FAR rule provided guidance to contracting officers on the application  of the integrity and business ethics standard. Specifically, the FAR rule  stated that a contracting officer\u2019s determination that a prospective  contractor has a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics in  order to receive a government contract \u201ccan be made by examining a  prospective contractor\u2019s record of compliance with the law.\u201d The guidance  further stated that in making a responsibility determination based upon  integrity and business ethics, contracting officers \u201cmust consider all  relevant credible information\u201d but should give the greatest weight to  violations of laws that have been adjudicated within the last 3 years  preceding the prospective contractor\u2019s offer. The guidance stated that  normally, a single violation of law will not give rise to a determination of  nonresponsibility, but evidence of repeated, pervasive, or significant  violations of the law may indicate an unsatisfactory record of integrity and  business ethics. The guidance instructed contracting officers to give  consideration to any administrative agreements entered into with  prospective contractors who take corrective action after disclosure of law  violations by an enforcement agency (i.e., after an initial charge or  complaint is filed against the contractor by the agency alleging a law  violation). The FAR rule specified that these prospective contractors,  despite findings of law violations by the enforcement agency, may continue  to be responsible contractors because they had corrected the conditions  that led to the alleged misconduct. On the other hand, according to the FAR  rule, failure of a prospective contractor to have complied with the terms of  an administrative agreement is evidence of a lack of integrity and business  ethics.", "The FAR rule required contracting officers to consider information based  on the following, in descending order of importance.", "Convictions of and civil judgments rendered against the prospective   commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with  obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public (federal, state,  or local) contract or subcontract;  violation of federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the  submission of offers; or  commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or  destruction of records, making false statements, tax evasion, or  receipt of stolen property.", "Indictments for the above offenses.", "Relative to tax, labor and employment, environmental, antitrust, or   federal or state felony convictions;  adverse federal court judgments in civil cases brought by the United   adverse decisions by a federal ALJ, board, or commission indicating  violations of law; or  federal or state felony indictments.", "Finally, the FAR rule stated that contracting officers might consider other  relevant information, such as civil or administrative complaints or similar  actions filed by or on behalf of a federal agency, board, or commission, if  such action reflects an adjudicated determination by the agency.", "To provide a mechanism for contracting officers to consider a prospective  contractor\u2019s compliance history, the FAR rule amended existing  certifications required to be included in solicitations where the contract  value is expected to exceed the simplified acquisition threshold ($100,000). Specifically, under the existing certification, the prospective  contractor is to certify, by checking the appropriate box on the form,  whether, to the best of its knowledge and belief, it or its principals are or are not presently debarred, suspended, proposed for debarment,  or declared ineligible for the award of contracts by any federal agency;  have or have not, within the preceding 3 years, been convicted of or had  a civil judgment rendered against them for   commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection with  obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a federal, state, or  local government contract or subcontract;  violation of federal or state antitrust statutes relating to the  submission of offers; or  commission of embezzlement, theft, forgery, bribery, falsification or  destruction of records, making a false statement, tax evasion, or  receiving stolen property;  are or are not presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or civilly  charged by a government entity with commission of any of these  offenses.", "The FAR rule added to this existing certification whether the prospective  contractor or its principals have, relative to tax, labor and employment,  environmental, antitrust, or consumer protection laws:  been convicted of a federal or state felony (or have federal or state  felony indictments pending against them);  had a federal court judgment in a civil case brought by the United States  rendered against them; or   had an adverse decision by a federal ALJ, board, or commission  indicating a willful violation of law.", "The FAR rule specified that a contractor needed to provide additional  detailed information only upon request of the contracting officer and  generally only when that contractor was the apparent successful offeror.", "In January 2001, immediately after its effective date, several agencies  suspended their implementation of the FAR rule under an authorized FAR  \u201cclass deviation\u201d procedure. After further review, the FAR Council  temporarily set aside the rule in April 2001 because the 30-day effective  date did not give contractors and the government sufficient time to meet  the new obligations and responsibilities imposed by the rule. Specifically,  the FAR Council stated that government contracting officers had not had  sufficient training, and prospective contractors had not had sufficient time  to establish a system to track compliance with applicable laws and keep it  current in order to properly fill out the certification. The FAR Council  recognized that it would take more time than it had anticipated for  businesses to put the systems in place. After further consideration and  public comment, the FAR Council revoked the FAR rule in December  2001. According to the FAR Council, the benefits of the FAR rule were  outweighed by the burdens imposed. The FAR Council stated that it was  not clear that there is a justification for including the added categories of  covered laws in the rule and its implementing certification, that the rule  provided sufficient guidelines to contracting officers to prevent arbitrary or  abusive implementation, or that the rule was justified from a cost-benefit  perspective.", "In revoking the FAR rule, the FAR Council stated that it fully supports the  proposition that government contracts should be awarded to law-abiding  entities and that the government should do business only with those  entities willing and able to comply with the laws enumerated in the FAR  rule. According to the FAR Council, the problem lies in the means for  ensuring that the entities with which the government conducts business are  good corporate citizens and adhere to the myriad of regulations and laws.  The FAR Council determined that the existing suspension and debarment  process is the proper vehicle to accomplish this goal. Specifically, the FAR  Council noted that the suspension and debarment rules contain well  established and defined decision-making criteria and due process  safeguards, which have evolved through case law precedent and agency  practices. The FAR Council noted that an agency debarring official is  authorized to consider a company\u2019s responsibility at any time whether the  company is a current competitor for a government contract or not; and if  the debarring official should determine that the company is not  responsible, the official may impose a debarment of the company. This  debarment is effective with regard to all federal agencies as well as to many  state and local governments that choose to use a debarment list of their  own. According to the FAR Council, when a question of a company\u2019s  honesty and integrity is raised, reliance on debarment and suspension  remedies provides effective intervention.", "While the decision to debar or suspend a contractor is made within the  discretion of the agency involved, the determination of a contractor\u2019s  responsibility (including whether it has a satisfactory record of business  ethics and integrity) continues to be mandatory for each contract award.  Although the FAR rule was revoked, the statutory standard of a satisfactory  record of business ethics and integrity remains one of the standards  required for a prospective contractor to be considered a responsible source  for the award of a government contract. This standard continues to be  implemented in the FAR. However, as a result of the FAR rule revocation,  the FAR itself no longer provides specific guidance to contracting officers  on applying the standard. Nonetheless, contracting officers are not entirely  without guidance since they do have available legal interpretations from  the courts and the Comptroller General as to the application of the  standard. These interpretations are in the context of bid protest decisions  addressing challenges to responsibility determinations in the award of  government contracts. Also, while prospective contractors no longer (as a  result of the FAR rule revocation) have to specifically certify as to their  compliance with environmental, labor and employment, antitrust,  consumer protection, and tax laws, prospective contractors must still  certify as to debarment, suspension, and the offenses listed in the existing  certifications. A contracting officer must still check whether a prospective  contractor is suspended or debarred before awarding a contract.", "We issued two reports several years ago that addressed the issue of federal  contractors who had violated nonprocurement-related laws. Our October  1995 report identified federal contractors found by the NLRB to have  violated the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and our August 1996  report identified contractors charged with Occupational Safety and Health  Act violations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA). In the first report, we found that 80 firms with over 4,400 federal  contracts valued at over $23 billion in fiscal year 1993 had violated the  NLRA as determined in adjudicated decisions of the NLRB. These  contractors accounted for 2 percent of the nearly 200,000 federal contracts  in effect in fiscal year 1993 that were being performed by over 57,000  parent firms. However, 6 of the 80 firms with NLRA violations accounted  for almost 90 percent of the $23 billion in contracts. In the second report,  we identified 261 firms that had federal contracts in effect in fiscal year  1994 that had been \u201cinitially charged\u201d with OSHA violations that carried a  possible fine or penalty of more than $15,000 for noncompliance with  health or safety regulations.

As table 1  shows, 7 of these 39 contractors had been convicted of a crime in federal  court; 5 had a judgment in a civil case brought by the federal government  in federal court rendered against them; and 27 had an adverse decision by a  federal ALJ, board, or commission finding a violation of law. These 39  contractors had 39 different contracts of $100,000 or more totaling  approximately $855 million. We did not identify any contractors that were  found by a federal court or adjudicated administrative decision to have  violated consumer protection or tax laws during this time frame.", "In addition, we identified another 3,403 contractors involved in another  6,705 cases closed during the 3-year period covered by our review and  listed in the databases of one or more of the agencies responsible for  enforcing or administering federal environmental, labor and employment,  antitrust, consumer protection, or tax laws (not including IRS tax penalty  assessments, which are discussed below). However, most of these cases  that involved alleged law violations were resolved before a court or  adjudicated administrative decision was made as to whether a violation of  law had occurred. The resolution usually involved some kind of  \u201cadministrative agreement\u201d (settlement). Although the agreements reflect  that the enforcement agency charged the contractor with a violation, the  contractor typically did not admit (or deny) any wrongdoing, and  sometimes the agreement actually contained language whereby the  contractor specifically denied any violation. In these cases, the parties  reached some alternate resolution, usually involving the contractor taking  corrective action, assuring compliance with the law, and agreeing to make  some form of payment to the government. Many of these agreements also  provided for penalties and remedies if the contractor did not abide by the  agreement. Even though a federal court or an administrative adjudicator,  such as an ALJ, typically approved the agreement (i.e., through a consent  order) and the case was considered \u201cadjudicated\u201d on that basis, this  approval did not constitute an adjudicated decision that a violation had  actually occurred. We recognize, of course, that enforcement agencies  often attempt to reach agreements with alleged violators to achieve  compliance instead of litigating cases to the point of an adjudicated  decision.

By law, IRS imposes penalties against  taxpayers for such things as failure to properly deposit employment taxes,  failure to pay tax by the applicable due date, failure to file a tax return, and  underpaying quarterly estimated taxes. Taxpayers may choose to pay the  penalty, challenge the penalty assessment within IRS, negotiate a  compromise, or await enforcement action through the judicial process.

We found that few contractors in  our review would have actually had to report past violations in the FAR rule  certification accompanying their offers. Additionally, contracting officers  would face significant difficulties in verifying or obtaining contractor  compliance history information. Moreover, the FAR rule may have created  the need for additional record keeping by contractors in order to monitor  their compliance histories.", "As described earlier, the objective of the FAR rule was to provide clarifying  revisions to the existing regulatory language in the FAR about what  constitutes a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics. The FAR  rule stated that a satisfactory record was one that included satisfactory  compliance with the law, specifically environmental, labor and  employment, antitrust, consumer protection, and tax laws. The FAR rule  also instructed contracting officers to consider all relevant credible  information, giving the greatest weight to violations that have been  adjudicated within the last 3 years preceding the prospective contractor\u2019s  offer. To provide this information to contracting officers, the FAR rule  included a certification requirement that required prospective contractors  to indicate whether they had or had not, within the past 3 years, relative to  environmental, labor and employment, antitrust, consumer protection, or  tax laws:  been convicted of a federal or state felony (or had any federal or state  indictments currently pending against them); or   had a federal court judgment in a civil case brought by the United States  rendered against them; or   had an adverse decision by an ALJ, board, or commission indicating a  willful violation of law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Few Certifications Would Have Indicated Law Violations", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier in this report, 6,752 enforcement agency cases that  were closed during fiscal years 1997 through 1999 involved federal  contractors that were awarded new federal contracts of at least $100,000 in  fiscal year 2000. From these cases, we identified 39 contractors that were  found by a court or ALJ, board, or commission decision to have violated  federal law in the areas specified by the FAR rule. However, most of these  contractors would not have been required to report the law violations to  the contracting officer in the certification in their offers (that is, by  checking the box in the certification indicating that the prospective  contractor or its principals have had a violation) if they had been  prospective contractors. As shown in table 6, based on our conceptual  application of the revoked FAR rule\u2019s certification criteria, 7 of the 39  contractors would have been required to report their violations in the  certification accompanying their offers. The violations by the other 32  contractors did not meet the FAR rule criteria for reporting and thus would  not have been required to be reported. For example, misdemeanor criminal  convictions would not have been reported because the FAR rule required  only felony convictions and indictments to be reported. Similarly, most of  the adjudicated decisions by an ALJ, board, or commission would not have  been reported because the decisions did not find a \u201cwillful\u201d violation of the  law, the criterion in the FAR rule certification. Willfulness is a specific legal  standard that excludes less serious or inadvertent violations of law. For  example, in 30 of the 34 NLRB cases we matched to contractors, NLRB  determined that there were violations of law, yet none of these violations  were specifically determined to be \u201cwillful\u201d violations. Indeed, our review  indicated that in the majority of the enforcement agencies\u2019 administrative  cases, the determination of \u201cwillfulness\u201d was not involved at all.", "In addition, administrative agreements or settlements resolving cases were  not reportable under the FAR rule\u2019s certification requirement. Even if such  agreements were incorporated into a judicial or administrative order, they  did not constitute a decision rendered against the contractor by a court or  administrative adjudicator finding a violation of law; rather, they  constituted the contractor\u2019s and the government\u2019s agreement on resolving  the matter\u2014typically without an admission of wrongdoing by the  contractor. Although the FAR rule guidance stated that contracting officers  should give consideration to any administrative agreements entered into  with prospective contractors who take corrective action after disclosure of  an alleged law violation (in the initial charge or complaint filed by the  enforcement agency), the FAR rule did not specifically require prospective  contractors to report such agreements. Thus, it is unclear how contracting  officers would have become aware of such agreements in making their  responsibility determinations.", "The FAR Council indicated that the certification intentionally was not as  broad as the FAR\u2019s responsibility standard of \u201ca satisfactory record of  integrity and business ethics.\u201d The FAR Council considered the  certification as an implementation measure designed to provide the  contracting officer with the information that the FAR Council anticipated  would be most useful in making the responsibility determination.

Some compliance information is accessible by the public on  the World Wide Web (Web) sites maintained by some enforcement  agencies, such as EPA, NLRB, OSHA, CPSC, and FTC. Although we were  able to use some of these Web sites, few of the contracting officers  reported that they routinely used such sites.

From  this review, along with discussions with officials at each agency, we  determined the records and types of variables needed from each  database for fiscal years 1997 through 1999, including the following:  variables to aid in matching names of parties in enforcement agency  cases to the contractor database (i.e., name, address, taxpayer  identification number (TIN) or data universal numbering system  (DUNS) number);   variables to aid in identifying the particular case in question for  further review (i.e., case identification number, court docket number,  case opening and closing dates); and   variables to aid in describing the nature and severity of the case (i.e.,  type of alleged violation, outcome of case, penalties or fines  assessed, any available narrative description of the alleged violation  and case).", "We clarified any uncertainties about appropriate processing of the  databases and interpretation of the variables through discussions with  agency and division contacts. For agencies without appropriate electronic  data available, we obtained case information through agency Web sites or  from hard copies of reports.", "To assess the reliability of the data used for matching purposes in our  report, including the FPDS, we (1) reviewed existing documentation  related to the data sources and (2) electronically tested the data to identify  obvious problems with completeness or accuracy. We determined that the  data were reliable enough for the purposes of this report. GSA has stated  that the figures produced from the FPDS are only as accurate, timely, and  complete as the data provided by the reporting agencies.", "The matching process: In an effort to determine the number of  contractors with adjudicated violations of federal environmental, labor,  antitrust, consumer protection, and tax laws in fiscal years 1997 through  1999 and that received a federal contract in fiscal year 2000, we matched  each enforcement agency\u2019s case data for fiscal years 1997 through 1999  against the FPDS fiscal year 2000 contractor data. The fiscal year 2000  FPDS data maintained by GSA consisted of 162,212 unique contracts;  82,622 unique contractor names; 58,711 TINs and 67,275 DUNS numbers.  From the database received, we selected new contracts awarded in  fiscal year 2000 that had total obligations of at least $100,000 during the  fiscal year by summing the dollar amounts for all such records having  the same contract number. This database contained 29,032 unique  contracts; 16,819 unique contractor names; 14,318 unique TINs; and  16,506 unique DUNS numbers.", "Before matching, we checked agency data to ensure the case closed dates  were within the period fiscal years 1997 through 1999 and checked the  validity of certain fields, such as the fields containing the TINs, DUNS, or  closed dates. We further examined the agencies\u2019 data and had additional  discussions with agencies\u2019 officials to determine which variable(s) should  be used to perform the matches and manipulated the databases as needed  to obtain final databases with one name or identifier per record.", "When available in an agency database, we matched on numeric identifiers,  that is, TINs, DUNS, or both.", "When matching contractors\u2019 names, we found a wide variation in the way  names were spelled and abbreviated across databases. To compensate for  these variations, we developed computer programs aimed at making these  names as standard as possible by removing words\u2014such as \u201cInc.,\u201d \u201cCo.,\u201d  \u201cCompany,\u201d \u201cJr.,\u201d \u201cLTD,\u201d etc.\u2014at the end of a field for all databases in the  name-matching process. Removing such words increased the chance of a  match between FPDS and agency data.   Specifically, matches resulted  when a name in the FPDS database was spelled exactly like the name in the  agency database. If the company name was not spelled identically in both  databases, it would not have been identified as a match. For example, if  one database contained the name \u201cABC\u201d and another contained \u201cA Better  Company,\u201d a match would not have been identified. Due to time and  resource limitations, we could not correct inconsistencies, misspellings or  abbreviations to improve the matching process.", "For each agency we determined the base numbers of identifiers used for  matching: the number of unique names (i.e., companies\u2019 names) in federal  enforcement agency cases after our standardization process, the number of  unique DUNS numbers, and the number of unique TINs. For agencies that  tracked criminal, civil, and/or administrative cases separately (EPA, DOL\u2019s  Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, DOJ\u2019s Environment and  Natural Resources Division, and the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys),  we processed these case types separately. After the matching process, we  determined the number of matches with a unique identifier (name or  number) and the number of unique contractor/case matches. Databases  often contained more than one name considered to be part of one case; in  those instances, we determined the number of matches on the case level.  Within the agencies or divisions that tracked criminal, civil, and/or  administrative cases separately, we added the matches found. Therefore,  for these agencies or divisions, there could be duplicate contractors within  the matched cases.", "Verifying the accuracy of selected matches: For most agency databases  used in this analysis, there was no common numeric identifier available  for matching federal contractors to names in enforcement agency cases.  The matching process therefore was often limited to attempting name  matches. Due to the imprecise nature of name matching, we know that  we have errors, both in missing true matches that are likely in the  database, and in calling two companies a match when in fact they are  not the same company. This latter error can occur for a variety of  reasons as well, such as two distinct companies actually having the  same name, or abbreviations or misspellings of one company name  making it look identical to another when in fact it is not. Even when we  were able to match using numbers, such as DUNS or TIN, errors in data  entry\u2014for either agency or FPDS data\u2014could lead to missing true  matches or identifying false matches. Although there is no way to  determine how many true matches we missed\u2014if we could determine  them, we would then be able to call them matches\u2014it is possible, and  perhaps useful, to make some kind of assessment of our \u201cfalse  positives,\u201d that is, name matches that were in fact not the same  company.", "Although verification of a representative sample of the matches would be  desirable, this approach was untenable, given the time and resources  available. However, we looked at the false positive cases we found in doing  our case file reviews (see below for methodology details of this review).  For all cases in which it appeared that the contractor was found by an  federal court or adjudicated administrative decision to have violated the  law, as well as for a selection of the remaining enforcement agency cases  (involving compliance actions) chosen on the basis of the highest dollar  contract award amounts for fiscal year 2000, we determined whether we  had made a valid match between contractor and enforcement agency case  by contacting the named contractor. This match rate, however, cannot be  viewed as an unbiased estimate because the selection of cases was not  randomly chosen and, for most agencies, was not a large enough selection  of cases. The rate, however, does provide some information for  understanding how successful our matching process was. Table 7  summarizes the number of false matches found in these case file reviews.", "Detailed case review: For a selection of the federal contractors matched  with enforcement agency cases during the time frame, we contacted  matched contractors in order to verify the match, request information  regarding the case, and gather information regarding implementation  issues surrounding the FAR rule as it would have applied to federal  contractors. We also requested information about the cases from each  enforcement agency. Within the matched cases from each agency\u2019s  database, we reviewed (1) all cases where it appeared that the  contractor would have been required to certify to its noncompliance  with the law under the FAR rule and (2) a selection of at least 10  contractor cases chosen on the basis of the highest dollar contract  award amounts during fiscal year 2000. Contract award amounts  reflected the total dollars obligated for a new contract awarded to a  contractor in fiscal year 2000, based on the FPDS database. For those  databases where there were only a small number of matches, such as in  the case of the DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division, all cases were reviewed rather  than those showing the highest total dollars obligated.", "We also attempted to verify enforcement agency case information with  contractors and to obtain more detailed information about the case  characteristics from them. We called the company and asked for the  contracting and/or procurement office. In some cases, we were  referred to the company\u2019s legal department. After explaining our  mission, we set up an appointment with the cognizant official from  each company that agreed to discuss the matter with us. To prepare the  official for the interview we faxed a list of questions, and, upon request,  a copy of the Federal Register notice of the FAR rule. We then  interviewed each official via telephone and in some cases received  written responses. During the telephone interviews, we verified the  company\u2019s information, including its address and DUNS number, the  contract information we had obtained from the FPDS, and the case  information we had obtained from our respective enforcement  agencies.
