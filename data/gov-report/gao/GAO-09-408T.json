The U.S. Census Bureau has since strengthened its risk management efforts and made other improvements; however, the Bureau curtailed a dress rehearsal scheduled for 2008 and was unable to test key operations under census-like conditions. This testimony discusses the Bureau's readiness for 2010 and covers: (1) the importance of reliable cost estimates; (2) building a complete and accurate address list; (3) following up on missing and conflicting responses to ensure accuracy; (4) targeting outreach to undercounted populations; and (5) designing, testing, and implementing technology for the census. The testimony is based on previously issued and ongoing GAO work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Bureau estimates the 2010 Census will cost more than $14 billion over its life-cycle, making it the most expensive census in the nation's history, even after adjusting for inflation. Accurate cost estimates help ensure that the Bureau has adequate funds, and that Congress, the administration, and the Bureau itself have reliable information on which to base advice and decisions. However, as GAO has reported before, the Bureau has insufficient policies and procedures and inadequately trained staff for conducting high-quality cost estimation for the decennial census. A successful census requires a complete and accurate address list. The Bureau sends thousands of census workers (listers) into the field to collect and verify address information, and this year for the first time, listers will use handheld computers to collect data. During the dress rehearsal, there were significant technical problems. A small-scale field test showed that these problems appear to have been addressed; however, the test was not carried out under full census-like conditions and did not validate all address canvassing requirements. Nonresponse follow-up, the Bureau's largest and most costly field operation, was initially planned to be conducted using the handheld computers, but was recently changed to a paper-based system due to technology issues. The Bureau has not yet developed a detailed road map for monitoring the development and implementation of nonresponse follow-up under the new design. Such a plan is essential to conducting a successful nonresponse follow-up. Furthermore, the system that manages the flow of work in field offices is not yet developed. Lacking plans for the development of both nonresponse follow-up and this management system, the Bureau faces the risk of not having them developed and fully tested in time for the 2010 Census. In an effort to reduce the undercount, the Bureau is implementing a program of paid advertising integrated with other communications strategies, such as partnerships with state, local, and tribal governments and community organizations. Moving toward 2010, the Bureau faces long-standing challenges with the nation's linguistic diversity and privacy concerns, which can contribute to the undercounting of some groups. Since 2005, we have reported concerns with the Bureau's management and testing of key IT systems. We have reviewed the status and plans for the testing of key 2010 Census systems. The Bureau has made progress in conducting systems, integration, and end-to-end testing, but critical testing still remains to be performed before systems will be ready to support the 2010 Census, and the planning for the testing needs much improvement. In short, while the Bureau has made some noteworthy progress in gearing up for the enumeration, with just over a year remaining until Census Day, uncertainties surround the Bureau's overall readiness for 2010."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss the Census Bureau\u2019s readiness  for conducting the decennial census. Today\u2019s hearing is particularly timely  because in 2009 the Bureau transitions from planning the 2010 Census to  implementing early activities and operations. The Bureau has already  initiated large-block canvassing\u2014an operation where temporary field staff  validate address lists and maps for census blocks with more than 1,000  housing units in them. Next month, the Bureau is scheduled to conduct  address canvassing for remaining census blocks when about 140,000  temporary employees will walk every known street in the country trying to  update and verify the Bureau\u2019s address list and maps for the country. Later  in the year, in a separate effort, the Bureau is scheduled to update the  locations of approximately 200,000 \u201cgroup quarters\u201d including homeless  shelters, college residence halls, and group homes. The Bureau will also be  opening hundreds of local census offices and refining plans for later  operations.", "Although the Bureau has made considerable progress in gearing up for the  2010 Census, the path to the decennial has been a difficult one. For  example, in April 2008, technical problems with handheld computers used  to collect data led the Bureau to redesign its approach to taking the  census. While the Bureau had initially planned to use the handheld  computers for address canvassing and to collect data from the millions of  households that fail to mail back their census questionnaires (an operation  called nonresponse follow-up), the handheld computers now will only be  used for address canvassing, and the Bureau will instead rely on paper  forms to conduct nonresponse follow-up.", "Today is the first anniversary of when we designated the 2010 Census to  be on our high-risk list because of (1) long-standing weaknesses in the  Bureau\u2019s information technology (IT) acquisition and contract  management function, (2) problems with the performance of handheld  computers used to collect data, and (3) uncertainty over the ultimate cost  of the census, currently estimated at more than $14 billion. In the past  year, the Bureau has strengthened its risk management efforts and made  other improvements. Still, the 2010 Census remains high risk, in part  because the poor performance of the handheld computers drove the  Bureau to curtail a critical risk management exercise planned for 2008\u2014a  \u201cdress rehearsal\u201d of all census operations. As a result, the Bureau missed  its only opportunity to demonstrate that the full complement of census- taking activities will work in concert with one another under near-census- like conditions.", "In light of this difficult operational environment, effective stewardship of  the Bureau is essential to help ensure the census stays on track and the  agency continues to embrace a culture of performance and accountability.  Key to this will be the timely appointment of a Census Director who is an  efficient administrator, a respected technical professional, a strategic  leader, and capable of working constructively with Congress, officials at  all levels of government, as well as nongovernmental organizations and the  statistical community.", "At your request, we will discuss the state of the census, paying particular  attention to the following:  the importance of using reliable cost estimates and justifications for  spending on census activities;    building a complete and accurate address list to know where to count  people;  following up on missing and conflicting responses to ensure  completeness and accuracy;  targeting communications and outreach efforts to reduce the  differential undercount; and    designing, testing, and implementing technology to support the census.", "Our testimony today is based on our ongoing and recently completed  work. See the last page of this statement for a list of our recently issued  census reports. To determine the readiness of the Bureau to conduct the  2010 Census, we reviewed and analyzed scheduling, design, operational  and testing plans for the various census operations, data from the dress  rehearsal sites, and documents related to the December 2008 field test of  the handheld computers in Fayetteville, North Carolina, and we  interviewed Bureau staff. At the field test, we observed the handheld  computers\u2019 ability to collect and transmit address data by accompanying  census workers as they went door-to-door. In February 2009, we also  observed census workers conduct large-block canvassing using laptop  computers. This work was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions.", "In summary, the Bureau has made commendable progress in rolling out  key components of the census, making improvements to the handheld  computers, certain risk management efforts, and how it will print the 80  million maps needed by temporary field staff to carry out the enumeration.  Nevertheless, at a time when planning activities should be reaching  completion, major testing should be winding down, and there should be  confidence in the functionality of census-taking activities, the Bureau  instead finds itself lacking sufficient policies, procedures, and trained staff  to develop high-quality cost estimates, and a number of operations and  support systems still need to be designed, planned, or tested. In the 13  months leading up to Census Day, the Bureau will be challenged to  implement early operations, complete the final preparations for various  activities, make refinements, and address any glitches that arise. With little  time remaining, uncertainties surround the Bureau\u2019s readiness for 2010."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As you know, Mr. Chairman, the decennial census is a critical national  effort mandated by the Constitution.

In order to meet legally mandated reporting requirements,  census activities need to take place at specific times and in the proper  sequence. For example, the group quarters validation operation, where  census workers verify the location of group quarters, such as nursing  homes and college dormitories, needs to be completed after the address  canvassing operation. As a result, it is absolutely critical for the Bureau to  stay on schedule. Figure 1 shows some dates for selected decennial  events.", "The Bureau estimates that the 2010 Census will cost more than $14 billion  over its life-cycle, making it the most expensive census in our nation\u2019s  history. According to the Bureau, the increasing cost of the census is  caused in part by various societal trends\u2014such as increasing privacy  concerns, more non-English speakers, and people residing in makeshift  and other nontraditional living arrangements\u2014making it harder to find  people and get them to participate in the census.", "Automation and IT will play a critical role in the success of the 2010  Census by supporting data collection, analysis, and dissemination.  According to the Bureau\u2019s estimates, it is spending more than $3 billion on  IT acquisitions for the census. The Bureau is relying on both the  acquisition of new systems and the enhancement of existing legacy  systems for conducting operations for the 2010 Census. These systems are  to play important roles with regard to different aspects of the process,  such as providing geographic information to establish where to count,  capturing and integrating census responses, supporting field operations  such as address canvassing, and tabulating and publicly disseminating  census data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providing Reliable Cost Estimates and Justifications for Spending as 2010 Approaches Presents a Major Challenge for the Bureau", "paragraphs": ["Accurate cost estimates are essential to a successful census because they  help ensure that the Bureau has adequate funds, and so that Congress, the  administration, and the Bureau itself can have reliable information on  which to base or advise decisions. However, as we have reported before,  the Bureau has insufficient policies and procedures and inadequately  trained staff for conducting high-quality cost estimation for the decennial  census. The Bureau does not have cost estimation guidance and  procedures in place or staff that is certified in cost estimation techniques.  The Bureau is developing a new budget management tool that will support  the cost estimation process beyond 2010. As part of that, the Bureau will  need to establish rigorous cost estimation policies and procedures and use  skilled estimators to ensure that future cost estimates are reliable and of  high quality.", "For example, to help manage the 2010 census and contain costs, over 5  years ago we recommended that the Bureau develop a comprehensive,  integrated project plan for the 2010 Census that should include the  itemized, estimated costs of each component and a sensitivity analysis  and an explanation of significant changes in the assumptions on which  these costs were based. In response, the Bureau provided us with the  2010 Census Operations and Systems Plan, dated August 2007. This plan  represented an important step forward by including operational inputs and  outputs and describing linkages among operations and systems. However,  that document did not include itemized cost estimates of each component  or sensitivity analysis, and thus did not provide a valid baseline or range of  estimates for the Bureau and Congress. The Bureau has provided annual  cost updates as part of its budget submission process, but these too have  lacked cost analyses to support them. As the Bureau approaches the final  surge in the current decade-long decennial spending cycle, providing  reliable cost estimates accompanied by sound justification, as we have  recommended, will be important if Congress is to make informed  decisions about the levels at which to fund the remainder of the 2010  Census."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Address Canvassing Is Essential for a Complete and Accurate Count", "paragraphs": ["A complete and accurate list of all addresses where people live in the  country is the cornerstone of a successful census because it identifies all  households that are to receive a census questionnaire and serves as the  control mechanism for following up with households that fail to respond.  The Bureau goes to great lengths to develop a quality address list and  maps, working with the U.S. Postal Service; federal agencies; state, local,  and tribal governments; local planning organizations; the private sector;  and nongovernmental entities. For example, under the Local Update of  Census Addresses (LUCA) program, the Bureau is authorized to partner  with state, local, and tribal governments, tapping into their knowledge of  local populations and housing conditions in order to secure a more  complete count. Between November 2007 and March 2008, over 8,000  state, local, and tribal governments provided approximately 8 million  address updates through the LUCA program. The Bureau will send  thousands of temporary census workers, known as listers, into the field to  collect and verify address information and update maps on-site, including  verifying address updates provided through the LUCA program.", "Despite the Bureau\u2019s efforts, an inherent challenge is locating  unconventional and hidden housing units, such as converted basements  and attics. For example, as shown in figure 2, what appears to be a small,  single-family house could contain an apartment, as suggested by its two  doorbells. The Bureau has trained listers to look for extra mailboxes,  utility meters, and other signs of hidden housing units and is developing  training guides for 2010 to help listers locate hidden housing. Nonetheless,  decisions on what is a habitable dwelling are often difficult to make\u2014what  is habitable to one worker may seem uninhabitable to another. According  to Bureau estimates, approximately 1.4 million housing units were missed  in the 2000 Census.

Listers will add addresses that do  not already appear on the Bureau\u2019s list and mark for deletion any that they  cannot verify according to the rules and guidance developed by the  Bureau.", "When the handheld computers were tested during the dress rehearsal of  the address canvassing operation, the devices experienced such problems  as slow or inconsistent data transmission, freeze-ups, and difficulties  collecting mapping coordinates. The software that managers used to  review worker productivity and assign work was also troublesome. For  example, management reports were unreliable because they pulled data  from incorrect sources, and Bureau staff had difficulty using the work  management software to reassign work.", "The Bureau took steps to fix these issues and, in December 2008,  conducted a limited field test in Fayetteville, North Carolina, to test the  functionality and usability of the handheld computer, including whether  the handheld computer problems encountered earlier had been resolved.  Although the Bureau\u2019s final evaluation of the field test was due by the end  of February 2009, we were not able to review it for this testimony. From  our observations of the December 2008 field test and interviews with  Bureau officials, the Bureau appears to have addressed many of the  handheld computer performance issues, as well as the problems with the  work management software, observed during the dress rehearsal. This is  an important and noteworthy development.", "Nonetheless, more information is needed to determine the Bureau\u2019s  overall readiness for address canvassing as the field test was not an end- to-end systems evaluation, did not validate all address canvassing  requirements, such as training and help desk support, and did not include  urban areas. Additionally, the scale of the field test was a fraction of that  of the address canvassing operation. The Bureau was to conduct a review  of the readiness of the handheld computers in January 2009 but has not yet  reported the results of that review. Finally, the Bureau\u2019s actual workload  for address canvassing\u2014about 144.7 million addresses\u2014is 11 million  addresses more than the Bureau had planned for, leaving the Bureau with  too few handheld computers to complete the workload in the time  originally scheduled. In response, the Bureau will be extending the amount  of time listers will be working in the field in affected areas, although not  extending the end date of the operation, to compensate for the larger  workload.", "During the dress rehearsal, listers also experienced problems when  collecting address data for large blocks having more than 1,000 housing  units. According to the Bureau, the handheld computer did not have the  capacity to efficiently collect data for large blocks. The Bureau has taken  steps to mitigate this problem. Specifically, in January 2009, the Bureau  began using laptop computers and software already used in other  operations to canvass the 2,086 blocks it identified as large blocks, and by  the end of February 2009, the Bureau had completed approximately 80  percent of large-block canvassing. In February 2009 we observed large- block canvassing in Atlanta, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts; New York,  New York; San Francisco, California; and Washington, D.C. From our  preliminary observations, the laptops appear to work well, and listers  reported their training was satisfactory.

On April 3, 2008, the  Bureau announced that it would no longer use handheld computers for  nonresponse follow-up and would instead change to a paper-based  nonresponse follow-up operation. According to the Bureau, this change  added between $2.2 billion to $3 billion to the total cost of the census.", "In May 2008, the Bureau issued a plan that covered major components of  the paper-based nonresponse follow-up. Bureau officials said that they are  developing a more detailed plan that would describe 2010 nonresponse  follow-up operations and systems, workflow, major milestones, and roles  and responsibilities of different census divisions. Although the plan was  due in January 2009, it has yet to be completed. Because this plan serves  as a road map for monitoring the development and implementation of  nonresponse follow-up, it will be important for the Bureau to complete  this plan.", "The Bureau has changed plans for many aspects of nonresponse follow-up,  and officials are determining which activities and interfaces will be tested  and when that testing will occur. Although the Bureau has carried out a  paper-based follow-up operation in past decennials, the 2010 Census  includes new procedures and system interfaces that have not been tested  under census-like conditions because they were dropped from the dress  rehearsal. Bureau officials acknowledged the importance of testing new  and modified nonresponse follow-up activities and system interfaces in  order to reduce risk but have not yet developed detailed testing plans.  Given the number of tasks at hand and the increasingly shorter time frame  in which to accomplish them, it will be important for the Bureau to  monitor the development of these testing plans, coordinate this testing  with other activities, and ensure that testing occurs in time to take  corrective actions, if needed.", "In our previous work, we have highlighted the importance of sound risk  management in planning for the decennial census. The Bureau has  strengthened aspects of its risk management process. For example, in July  2008, the Bureau identified 31 nonresponse follow-up risks, such as lower  than expected enumerator productivity. However, it has not developed  mitigation plans for these risks. Officials said that they are reevaluating  these risks and plan to develop mitigation plans for high- and medium- priority nonresponse follow-up risks starting in spring 2009.

In such instances, the Bureau attempts to  reconcile the data during the coverage follow-up operation. For 2010, the  Bureau plans to expand the scope of this operation and include two  questions\u2014known as coverage probes\u2014on the census form to help  identify households where someone may have been missed or counted  incorrectly (see fig. 3).", "However, after testing the probes earlier in the decade, the Bureau found  one of the probes was problematic in identifying persons potentially  missing from the count. Although these probes were included on the forms  mailed out during the dress rehearsal, the coverage follow-up operation  did not include cases from nonresponse follow-up, which was cancelled  from the dress rehearsal.

Further,  the Bureau has not yet fully defined how OCS will work together with  other systems. According to Bureau officials, the lack of detailed plans for  operations, such as nonresponse follow-up, makes it difficult to finalize  requirements for OCS or its testing plans.

In addition, many map production and printing  activities must be conducted in sequence with no time to spare, putting at  risk the Bureau\u2019s ability to print its maps on time. The Bureau has taken  positive steps to meet its requirements for map production and printing for  2010. For example, in June 2008, the Bureau decided to produce a generic  map type in lieu of several operation-specific versions to reduce the  number of map files to be produced. Furthermore, the Bureau is preparing  to print most of its maps at the local census offices rather than at the  regional offices, reducing the need to coordinate map delivery to the local  census offices.

Overall, the Bureau estimates it will spend  around $410 million on its communication efforts for the 2010 Census.
