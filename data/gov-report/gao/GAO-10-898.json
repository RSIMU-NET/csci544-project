Recent terrorist attacks on these systems around the world--such as in Moscow, Russia in 2010--highlight the vulnerability of these systems. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is the primary federal entity responsible for securing passenger rail systems. In response to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2008, GAO conducted a technology assessment that reviews 1) the availability of explosives detection technologies and their ability to help secure the passenger rail environment, and 2) key operational and policy factors that impact the role of explosives detection technologies in the passenger rail environment. GAO analyzed test reports on various explosives detection technologies and convened a panel of experts comprised of a broad mix of federal, technology, and passenger rail industry officials. GAO also interviewed officials from DHS and the Departments of Defense, Energy, Transportation, and Justice to discuss the effectiveness of these technologies and their applicability to passenger rail. GAO provided a draft of this report these departments for comment. Four departments provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A variety of explosives detection technologies are available or in development that could help secure passenger rail systems. While these technologies show promise in certain environments, their potential limitations in the rail environment need to be considered and their use tailored to individual rail systems. The established technologies, such as handheld, desktop, and kitbased trace detection systems, and x-ray imaging systems, as well as canines, have demonstrated good detection capability with many conventional explosive threats and some are in use in passenger rail today. Newer technologies, such as explosive trace portals, advanced imaging technology, and standoff detection systems, while available, are in various stages of maturity and more operational experience would be required to determine their likely performance if deployed in passenger rail. When deploying any of these technologies to secure passenger rail, it is important to take into account the inherent limitations of the underlying technologies as well as other considerations such as screening throughput, mobility, and durability, and physical space limitations in stations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations, but is raising various policy considerations. For example, in addition to how well technologies detect explosives, GAO's work, in consultation with rail and technology experts, identified several key operational and policy considerations impacting the role that these technologies can play in securing the passenger rail environment. Specifically, while there is a shared responsibility for securing the passenger rail environment, the federal government, including TSA, and passenger rail operators have differing roles, which could complicate decisions to fund and implement explosives detection technologies. For example, TSA provides guidance and some funding for passenger rail security, but rail operators themselves provide day-to-day-security of their systems. In addition, risk management principles could be used to guide decision-making related to technology and other security measures and target limited resources to those areas at greatest risk. Moreover, securing passenger rail involves multiple security measures, with explosives detection technologies just one of several components that policymakers can consider as part of the overall security environment. Furthermore, developing a concept of operations for using these technologies and responding to threats that they may identify would help balance security with the need to maintain the efficient and free flowing movement of people. A concept of operations could include a response plan for how rail employees should react to an alarm when a particular technology detects an explosive. Lastly, in determining whether and how to implement these technologies, federal agencies and rail operators will likely be confronted with challenges related to the costs and potential privacy and legal implications of using explosives detection technologies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Passenger rail systems are vital components of the nation\u2019s transportation  infrastructure, encompassing rail transit (heavy rail, commuter rail, and  light rail), and intercity rail. In the United States, passenger rail systems  provide approximately 14 million passenger trips each weekday, and  commuters rely on these systems to provide efficient, reliable, and safe  transportation. Terrorist attacks on passenger rail systems around the  world\u2014such as the March 2010 Moscow, Russia subway bombings, and  the July 2006 passenger train bombing in Mumbai, India that resulted in  209 fatalities\u2014highlight the vulnerability of these systems. Additionally,  the administration\u2019s Transborder Security Interagency Policy Committee,  Surface Transportation Subcommittee\u2019s recently issued Surface  Transportation Security Priority Assessment stated that the nation\u2019s  transportation network was at an elevated risk of attack and that recent  plots against passenger rail highlight the lengths terrorists will go to defeat  security measures put in place after September 11, 2001. Another threat  facing passenger rail systems are chemical and biological weapons. While  there have been no terrorist attacks against U.S. passenger rail systems to  date, the systems are vulnerable to attack in part because they rely on an  open architecture that is difficult to monitor and secure due to its multiple  access points, hubs serving multiple carriers, and, in some cases, no  barriers to access. Further, an attack on these systems could potentially  lead to casualties due to the high number of daily passengers, especially  during peak commuting hours, and result in serious economic disruption  and psychological impact.", "Day-to-day responsibility for securing passenger rail systems falls on  passenger rail operators, local law enforcement, and state and local  governments that own portions of the infrastructure. While several entities  play a role in helping to fund and secure U.S. passenger rail systems, the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s (DHS) Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) is the primary federal agency responsible for  overseeing security for these systems and for developing a national  strategy and implementing programs to enhance their security. The  Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Federal Transit Administration  (FTA) and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) also provide support to  rail operators by providing technical assistance in conducting threat and  vulnerability assessments and developing and providing training courses  for rail operators. Additionally, several other DHS components conduct  threat and vulnerability assessments of passenger rail systems, research  and develop security technologies for these systems, and develop security  training programs for passenger rail employees. We have previously  reported, most recently in June 2009, on federal and industry efforts to  secure passenger rail systems and have made recommendations for  strengthening these efforts. DHS generally agreed with these  recommendations and is taking action to implement them.", "A variety of security measures, including technological measures, have  been and are being considered by federal policymakers and rail operators  as part of a layered approach to strengthening the security of passenger  rail systems, particularly in the area of protecting against the threat of  explosives. Explosives detection technologies have been tested and  implemented for screening passengers and baggage in aviation and  building security. Further, the U.S. military uses some of these  technologies to, among other things, detect the presence of improvised  explosive devices (IED) in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, these  technologies have been tested and implemented less frequently in  passenger rail systems. This is due in part to the open nature of passenger  rail systems, which does not lend itself to people and baggage screening.  Also, there is relatively less funding available to support the purchase and  maintenance of such equipment compared to the funding available for  commercial aviation security in which the federal government plays a  larger role. Because of the potential impact of implementation of  explosives detection technology on the open nature of passenger rail  systems, weighing rail operator needs and technological effectiveness of  explosives detection technology against the relative costs and impact on  rail operations is important. Additionally, because these explosives  detection technologies tend to be expensive, rail operators may look to  other funding sources, such as the federal government, to assist in  implementing these technologies.", "In the Senate report accompanying the proposed bill for the legislative  branch fiscal year 2008 appropriation, the Senate Committee on  Appropriations recommended the establishment of a permanent  technology assessment function within GAO. In the 2008 Consolidated  Appropriations Act, Congress authorized GAO to use up to $2.5 million of  amounts appropriated for salaries and expenses for technology  assessment studies. After consultation with congressional committees,  GAO agreed to conduct a technology assessment on the use of explosives  detection technologies to secure passenger rail systems. Specifically, this  report addresses the following questions:  1.  What is the availability of explosives detection technologies and what  is their ability to help secure the passenger rail environment?  2.  What key operational and policy factors could have an impact on the  role of explosives detection technologies in the passenger rail  environment?", "This report is a public version of the restricted report (GAO-10-590SU) that  we provided to you on May 28, 2010. DHS deemed some of the information  in the restricted report as sensitive security information, which must be  protected from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits this  information. Although the information provided in this report is more  limited in scope, it addresses the same questions as the restricted report.  Also, the overall methodology used for both reports is the same.", "To determine what explosives detection technologies are available and  their ability to help secure the passenger rail environment, we met with  experts and officials on explosives detection research, development, and  testing, and reviewed test, evaluation, and pilot reports and other  documentation from DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate, including  the Transportation Security Laboratory; TSA; several Department of  Defense (DOD) components, including the Naval Explosive Ordnance  Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV), the Technical Support  Working Group (TSWG), and the Joint Improvised Explosive Device  Defeat Organization (JIEDDO); several Department of Energy (DOE)  National Laboratories involved in explosives detection testing, research,  and development including Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL),  Sandia National Laboratories (SNL), and Oak Ridge National Laboratory  (ORNL); and the Department of Justice (DOJ) because of its expertise in  explosives detection. We also observed a TSA pilot test of a standoff  explosives detection system at a rail station within the Port Authority  Trans-Hudson passenger rail system. In addition, we interviewed several  manufacturers of explosives detection technologies and attended  government-sponsored demonstrations, a conference, and an academic  workshop on explosives detection technologies. We also interviewed  government officials involved with securing passenger rail in the United  Kingdom. We visited six domestic passenger rail locations, two of which  were involved in testing various types of explosives detection technologies  to either observe the testing or discuss the results of these tests with  operators. The specific locations we visited are listed in appendix I.", "In determining which explosives detection technologies were available  and able to secure the passenger rail environment, we considered those  technologies available today or deployable within 5 years, technologies  which could be used to screen either passengers or their carry-on items,  and technologies which were safe to use when deployed in public areas. In  determining the capabilities and limitations of explosives detection  technologies we evaluated their detection and screening throughput  performance, reliability, availability, cost, operational specifications, and  possible use in passenger rail. We also restricted our evaluation to those  technologies which have been demonstrated to detect explosives when  tested against performance parameters as established by government and  military users of the technologies.", "We also obtained the views of various experts and stakeholders during a  panel discussion we convened with the assistance of the National  Research Council (NRC) in August 2009 (hereafter referred to as the  expert panel). Panel attendees included 23 experts and officials from  academia, the federal government, domestic and foreign passenger rail  industry organizations, technology manufacturers, national laboratories,  and passenger rail industry stakeholders such as local law enforcement  officials and domestic and foreign passenger rail operators. During this  meeting, we discussed the availability and applicability of explosives  detection technologies for the passenger rail environment and the  operational and policy impacts associated with implementing these  technologies in the rail environment. While the views expressed during  this panel are not generalizable across all fields represented by officials in  attendance, they did provide an overall summary of the current availability  and effectiveness of explosives detection technologies and industry views  on their applicability to passenger rail.", "To determine what key operational and policy factors could have an  impact in determining the role of explosives detection technologies in the  passenger rail environment, we reviewed documentation related to the  federal strategy for securing passenger rail, including TSA\u2019s Mass Transit  Modal Annex to the Transportation Systems Sector Specific Plan, and  other documentation, including DHS reports summarizing explosives  detection technology tests conducted in passenger rail to better  understand the role and impact that these technologies have in the  passenger rail environment. We reviewed relevant laws and regulations  governing the security of the transportation sector as a whole and  passenger rail specifically, including the Implementing Recommendations  of the 9/11 Commission Act. We also reviewed our prior reports on  passenger rail security and studies and reports conducted by outside  organizations related to passenger rail or the use of technology to secure  passenger rail, such as the National Academies, Congressional Research  Service, and others to better understand the existing security measures  used in passenger rail and operational and policy issues. During our  interviews and expert panel mentioned above, we also discussed and  identified officials\u2019 views related to the key operational and policy issues  of using explosives detection technologies to secure passenger rail. While  these views are not generalizeable to all industries represented by these  officials, they provided a snapshot of the key operational and policy views.", "During our visits to 6 rail operator locations involved in explosives  detection testing, we interviewed officials regarding operational and policy  issues related to technology and observed passenger rail operations. We  selected these locations because they had completed or were currently  conducting testing of the use of explosives detection technology in the rail  environment and to provide the views of a cross-section of heavy rail,  commuter rail, and light rail operators. While these locations and officials\u2019  views are not generalizeable to the entire passenger rail industry, they  provided us with a general understanding of the operational and policy  issues associated with using such technologies in the rail environment. In  addition, we utilized information obtained and presented in our June 2009  report on passenger rail security. For that work, we conducted site visits,  or interviewed security and management officials from 30 passenger rail  agencies across the United States and met with officials from two regional  transit authorities and Amtrak.

They are usually space constrained and located either  underground or on an elevated platform and serviced by heavy rail. Entry  to the stations is usually controlled by turnstiles and other chokepoints.  Many of the subway stations in New York City and elevated stations in  Chicago are examples of these types of stations. See figure 2 for an  example of a typical heavy rail station.", "Large intermodal station. These stations are also heavily traveled and  service multiple types of rail including heavy rail, commuter rail, and  intercity passenger rail (such as Amtrak).

The military explosives include, among others, the  high explosives PETN and RDX, and the plastic explosives C-4 and  Semtex. The military uses these materials for a variety of purposes, such  as the explosive component of land mines, shells, or warheads. They also  have commercial uses such as for demolition, oil well perforation, and as  the explosive filler of detonation cords. Military explosives can only be  purchased domestically by legitimate buyers through explosives  distributors and typically terrorists have to resort to stealing or smuggling  to acquire them. RDX was used in the Mumbai passenger rail bombings of  July 2006. PETN was used by Richard Reid, the \u201cshoe bomber\u201d in his 2001  attempt to blow up an aircraft over the Atlantic Ocean, and was also a  component involved in the attempted bombing incident on board  Northwest Airline Flight 253 over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009.", "Commercial explosives, with the exception of black and smokeless  powders, also can only be purchased domestically by legitimate buyers  through explosives distributors.

Also, HMEs using  TATP and concentrated hydrogen peroxide, for example, were used in the  July 2005 London railway bombing. TATP can be synthesized from  hydrogen peroxide, a strong acid such as sulfuric acid, and acetone, a  chemical available in hardware stores and found in nail polish remover,  and HMTD can be synthesized from hydrogen peroxide, a weak acid such  as citric acid, and hexamine solid fuel tablets such as those used to fuel  some types of camp stoves and that can be purchased in many outdoor  recreational stores.

Explosive systems are typically composed of a  control system, a detonator, a booster, and a main charge. The control  system is usually more mechanical or electrical in nature. The detonator  usually contains a small quantity of a primary or extremely sensitive  explosive. The booster and main charges are usually secondary explosives  which will not detonate without a strong shock, for example from a  detonator. IEDs will also have some type of packaging or, in the case of  suicide bombers, some type of harness or belt to attach the IED to the  body. Often, an IED will also contain packs of metal\u2014such as nails, bolts,  or screws\u2014or nonmetallic material which are intended to act as shrapnel  or fragmentation, increasing the IED\u2019s lethality.

The primary  charge and the main charge are often different types and categories of  explosives. For example, in the attempted shoe bombing incident in 2001,  the detonator was a common fuse and paper-wrapped TATP, while PETN  was the main charge.

These systems, while they may be used to  detect explosive material, are also often used to detect other parts of a  bomb. Although some automated detection assistance is usually included,  imaging based detection systems currently depend heavily on trained  operators in identifying the anomalies indicative of a bomb.", "Trace detection technologies, on the other hand, involve taking a physical  sample from a likely source and then analyzing it with any one of several  different techniques for the presence of trace particles of explosive  material. Importantly, a positive detection does not necessarily indicate  the presence of a bomb because the trace particles may just be  contamination from someone having handled or having been near  explosives material. Explosives trace detection systems can often identify  the individual type of explosives trace particles present.", "Bulk and trace detection technology generally serve different functions  and can sometimes be paired to provide a more complete screening of a  person and their belongings. Typically that screening occurs in two stages.  First, an initial screening is done to separate suspicious persons or carry- on baggage from the rest of the passenger flow quickly. In almost all cases,  any anomalies detected in initial screening will trigger the need for a  person or baggage to undergo a secondary inspection, via different  methods, and typically aside from the main screening flow to confirm or  dismiss the anomaly as a threat. Technology need not be used in either  inspection stage. For example, behavioral assessment is sometimes used  to provide an initial screening. In addition, secondary inspection can be a  physical pat-down of a person or hand inspection of carry-on baggage  although explosives detection technology can also be used. Screening can  be done on 100 percent of passengers or on a subset of passengers chosen  at random or by some selection method.", "Different types of bulk and trace explosives detection technology have  been developed over the years to handle both the screening of people and  the screening of carry-on baggage. Generally, equipment falls into certain  typical configurations\u2014handheld, desktop, kit-based systems, carry-on  baggage inspection systems, explosive trace portals, AIT portals, standoff  detection systems, and explosives detection canines. Certain equipment  has been designed for the screening of people, some for the screening of  carry-on baggage, and some equipment can be used for both. (See figure  6.)", "To be effective, equipment in each of these configurations is generally  evaluated across several different technical characteristics. The first  important technical characteristic of an explosives detection system is  how good it is at detecting a threat. Several different parameters are  considered to fully express a system\u2019s ability to detect a threat. They are  used to express how often the system gets the detection right, and how  often\u2014and in which ways\u2014it gets the detection wrong. The system can  get the detection right when it alarms in the presence of a threat and the  percentage of times it does under a given set of conditions is called the  probability of detection.", "However, other important parameters measure the percentage of times the  system gets the detection wrong. This can occur in two ways. First, the  system can alarm even though a threat is not present. This is called a false  positive and the percentage of times it occurs in a given number of trials is  called the false positive rate. It is also called the false alarm rate or  probability of false alarm. Second, the system can fail to alarm even  though a threat is present. This is called a false negative and the  percentage of times it occurs in a given number of trials is called the false  negative rate.", "A second key technical characteristic for explosives detection systems is  screening throughput, which is a measure of how fast a person or item can  be processed through the system before the system is ready to accept  another person or item. Screening throughput is an important  characteristic to know because it directly impacts passenger delay, an  important consideration when using technology in passenger rail. The  higher the throughput, the less delay is imposed on passenger flow.", "Other important technical characteristics to consider when assessing  applicability of explosives detection systems for use in passenger rail are  the system\u2019s size and weight, which will impact its mobility, the physical  space needed to operate the system, and the system\u2019s susceptibility to  harsh environmental conditions. Understanding the system\u2019s cost is also  important."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Handheld, Desktop, and Kit Explosives Detection Systems", "paragraphs": ["Handheld, desktop, and kit explosives detection systems are portable  systems that are designed to detect traces of explosive particles.

The sample is transferred into  the system and typically heated to vaporize the trace particles, which are  then drawn into the detector where they are analyzed for the presence of  substances indicative of explosives. The results of sample analysis are  typically displayed on a readout screen.", "Handheld and desktop systems encompass a variety of detection  techniques to analyze the sample and determine if it contains particles of  explosive compounds. The various underlying techniques include ion  mobility spectrometry (IMS), amplifying fluorescent polymer (AFP),  chemiluminescence, and colorimetric. Many handheld and desktop  systems are generally based on IMS technology, a mature and well- understood method of chemical analysis. This technique consists of  ionizing the sample vapors and then measuring the mobility of the ions as  they drift in an electric field. Each sample ion possesses a unique  mobility\u2014based on its mass, size, and shape\u2014which allows for its  identification.", "The AFP technique utilizes compounds that fluoresce when exposed to  ultraviolet light. However, the fluorescence intensity decreases in the  presence of vapors of certain nitrogen-containing explosives, such as TNT.  Detection methods based on this principle look for a decrease in intensity  that is indicative of specific explosives. AFP has been shown to have a  high level of sensitivity to TNT. The chemiluminiscence principle is based  on the detection of light emissions coming from nitro groups that are  found in many conventional military and commercial explosives such as  TNT, RDX, PETN, black powder, and smokeless powder. However,  chemiluminiscence by itself cannot identify any specific explosives  because these nitro compounds are present not only in a number of  commercial and military explosives, but also in many nonexplosive  substances such as fertilizers and some perfumes. Therefore, this  technique is often used in conjunction with other techniques, such as gas  chromatography, to positively identify specific explosives.", "Kit-based explosives detection systems generally use colorimetric  techniques. In this method, the detection is based on the fact that a  specific compound, when treated by an appropriate color reagent,  produces a color that is characteristic of this compound. The sample is  taken by swiping the target object, typically with a paper, and then the  colorimetric reagents are applied by spraying or dropping them on the  paper. The operator deposits chemical reagents in a series and observes  color changes with each reagent added. This process of adding reagents is  stopped when a visible color change is observed by the operator. The  operator decides whether there are any trace explosives present by  visually matching the color change observed to a standardized sheet of  colors.", "Table 1 describes some of the trace explosives detection methods  described above.", "In comparative studies over the last 8 years, the Naval Explosive  Ordinance Disposal Technology Division showed that IMS-based handheld  and desktop systems are capable of detecting many conventional military  and commercial explosives that are nitrogen-based, such as TNT, PETN,  and RDX. Non-IMS based techniques such as amplifying fluorescent  polymer and chemiluminescence based techniques are able to additionally  detect ANFO, smokeless powder, and urea nitrate. However, a report  sponsored by DOD\u2019s Technical Support Working Group shows that most  of these systems had difficulty in detecting certain other types of  explosives.", "Preliminary results from an ongoing comparative study of kit-based  detection systems sponsored by the Transportation Security Laboratory  have shown that these systems can detect the presence of nitrogen when  there is sufficient quantity of explosive sample (in small-bulk or visible  amounts) available for analysis. For example, kit-based systems were able  to correctly identify the presence of nitrogen in a variety of different threat  materials. Additionally, kit-based systems have been shown to be  susceptible to false alarms when challenged with substances such as soaps  and perfumes, among others.", "The open and often dirty air environment of passenger rail presents  certain operational issues for trace detection.

Screening  systems incorporating the technology have been used in commercial  aviation for more than 30 years, in part, because they serve a dual purpose;  images are analyzed for guns and other weapons at the same time they are  analyzed for the presence of materials that may be explosives. Because  these images do not uniquely identify explosive materials, secondary  screening is required to positively identify the materials as explosives.", "Single-energy x-ray systems are useful for detecting some bomb  components. They are, however, not as useful for the detection of  explosive material itself.

Systems with one or more advanced techniques, multiple  views; dual energies, and backscatter, but not CT, are called advanced  technology (AT) systems to distinguish them from CT. AT systems enable  more accurate identification of explosives without the additional expense  of CT. Further, the additional information can be used to automatically  detect explosive materials. Carry-on baggage explosive detection  technology used in commercial aviation is a mature technology.

Phase I of this  pilot evaluated the effectiveness of off-the-shelf explosives detection  capabilities that were adapted from current airport checkpoint screening  technologies and procedures. The carry-on baggage explosive detection  equipment was operated in the automated threat detection mode to  minimize passenger delay. System effectiveness was tested by the use of a  red team, an adversary team that attempted to circumvent the security  measures. While the results were highly sensitive and not discussed in the  pilot program report, the false alarm rate was found to be low.", "Carry-on baggage explosive detection technologies have operational issues  that limit their usefulness in passenger rail security. These systems are  used in checkpoints and their acceptability will depend upon the tolerance  for passenger delay. At checkpoints, 100 percent screening is possible up  to the throughput capacity of the screening equipment; beyond that rate,  additional screening equipment and personnel or selective (less than 100  percent) screening is required. During S&T\u2019s screening in the PATH  system passenger rail pilot, a maximum single system throughput of 400  bags per hour was measured with carry-on baggage explosive detection  systems operating in automatic explosive detection mode at threat levels  appropriate to passenger rail, as described above. The 400 bags per hour  single system throughput had a corresponding passenger throughput of  2336 passengers per hour. With this throughput, the pilot was able to  perform 100 percent screening of large bags and computer bags (see  below) during the peak rush hour using two carry-on baggage explosive  detection systems.", "Another closely related challenge associated with checkpoint screening is  passenger delay. The S&T pilot in the PATH system measured median  passenger delays of 17 seconds and 47.5 seconds respectively depending  on whether or not a passenger\u2019s bags set off automated explosive  detection alarms. These delays can be compared to the 13 second median  time for an unscreened passenger to walk through the screening area. The  longer delay, when bags set off alarms, was caused by secondary  screening required to confirm or deny the presence of explosives.  Maximum passenger throughput was achieved when screening only bags  large enough and heavy enough to contain sufficient explosives to damage  passenger rail infrastructure. When 100 percent screening exceeded the  capacity of the system, the pilot used queue-based selection to maximize  throughput. In queue-based selection, a traffic director selects passengers  for screening as long as there is room in the queue for the screening  process. Using this procedure, the pilot was able to accommodate PATH\u2019s  desire to keep queue lengths below five passengers.", "Acquisition costs range from $25,000 to $50,000 for AT systems to more  than $500,000 for CT systems.

The portal then blows short puffs of air onto the  individual being screened to help displace particles and attempts to collect  these particles with a vacuum system. The particle sample is then  preconcentrated and fed into the detector for analysis. The results are  displayed to the operator as either positive or negative for the detection of  explosives. Positive results can display the detected explosives and trigger  an audible alarm.", "Currently tested and deployed ETPs use IMS analytical techniques for  chemical analysis to detect traces of explosives, similar to those used for  handheld and desktop detectors. These techniques are relatively mature  but the operation of IMS-based ETPs in an open air environment, such as  that of passenger rail, is subject to interference from ambient agents, such  as moisture and contaminants, that can impact a detector\u2019s performance  by interfering with its internal analysis process resulting in false readings.", "Regardless of the detection technique used, sampling is a major issue for  trace detection. Generally, factors such as the explosives\u2019 vapor pressure  and packaging, as well as how much contamination is present on an  individual from handling the explosive, affect the amount of material  available for sampling. Particular to trace portals, factors such as the  systems\u2019 puffer jets and timing, clothing, the location of explosive  contamination on the body, and human variability impact the effectiveness  of sampling. For example, if the puffer jets produce too little pressure,  they have little impact in improving the trace explosive signal, while too  much pressure results in trace explosive particles becoming lost in a large  volume of air that is difficult to sample effectively. In addition, clothing  material and layering can reduce the available trace explosive signal. The  location of the explosive trace on the body also impacts the amount of  trace explosives that the system will collect.", "In laboratory testing of ETPs in 2004, the Naval Explosive Ordnance  Disposal Technology Division tested three ETP systems\u2019 basic ability to  detect trace amounts of certain explosives within the required detection  threshold when deposited on the systems\u2019 collection sites.

Several different technologies have been incorporated into  standoff explosives detection systems, but those suitable for use today in a  public setting such as passenger rail are passive or active imaging systems  using typically either the millimeter wave or terahertz (THz) portion of  the electromagnetic spectrum. Radiation in these portions of the spectrum  are naturally emitted or reflected from everyday objects, including the  human body, and have the added feature that clothing is often transparent  to them. Therefore, they can be used to safely screen people for hidden  threat objects. Systems available on the market today claim to detect  person-borne objects across a range of distances.", "In several laboratory and field studies since 2006 looking at passive  standoff imaging systems, organizations including Naval Explosive  Ordnance Disposal Technology Division, Transportation Security  Laboratory, S&T, and TSA have demonstrated the technology\u2019s basic  ability, under the right conditions, to detect hidden person-borne threat  objects. Because the detection technique relies on a temperature  differential between the warmer human body and the colder threat object  next to it and not on the metallic content of the object, it also has the  potential to detect non-metallic threats. This capability gives these  standoff imaging systems a distinct advantage over walk-through metal  detectors\u2014the conventional person screening tool\u2014which can only detect  objects with sufficient metallic content.", "DHS has also evaluated several standoff detection systems in operational  rail environments. For example, as part of Phase II of the 2006 Rail  Security Pilot looking at advanced imaging technologies, S&T found that  such systems, in general, had some ability to detect threat objects  indicative of suicide bombs on passengers and, overall, were developing  into potentially useful technologies for passenger rail. Follow-on tests in  2007 and 2009 conducted by TSA at operational passenger rail or other  mass transit locations provided further support for the technologies  potential in addressing the screening needs of these systems. In the July  2009 pilot, for instance, screening throughput for a passive millimeter  wave system was tested by TSA during rush hour at the PATH Exchange  Place subway station in New Jersey, a key entry point for commuters  entering lower Manhattan. Two systems were used with each positioned 8  to 10 meters from a group of passenger turnstiles which provided a  chokepoint for commuters entering the station. At several periods during  rush hour, the systems demonstrated the ability to scan at or near 100  percent screening\u2014in one case, more than 900 people per hour\u2014without  disrupting the flow of passengers.", "Those pilots also demonstrated another attractive feature of these systems  important for their use in passenger rail; they can be built to be relatively  portable. For the PATH pilot, TSA broke down, moved and re-configured  multiple standoff devices four times a day. The ability for screening  systems to be deployed and easily re-deployed to another location  encourages their use for random deployment, a recommended protective  measure for mass transit systems. In addition, this allows rail operators a  way to provide screening to a much wider percentage of their system with  fewer units than it would if they had to use fixed systems, which might  prove cost prohibitive for the larger rail systems.", "While promising, several factors limit the more widespread use of current  standoff detection technologies to just detection of objects carried on a  person\u2019s body. They cannot provide a complete screening of a passenger  and their belongings. They could, however, be used in tandem with other  technologies or methods to handle accompanying articles.", "Another limiting factor of current standoff technologies is the inability to  discriminate between a potential threat object and a real one. Because the  current state of the technology is based on imaging alone, explosives  material identification is generally not possible. Use of radiation in the  weaker, nonionizing millimeter wave and THz bands is attractive because  it presents no danger to humans, but it also means that there is not enough  information in the energy received by the sensor to more positively  identify the threat as explosives material, as is routinely done, for  example, by the higher energy CT systems used to screen checked baggage  in aviation. Therefore, secondary screening will often be needed to  completely resolve an alarm. In a standoff configuration, this raises  logistical and manpower issues. At a minimum, for example, since the  system is operating at a distance and passengers are not queuing up, it is  not obvious how a person showing up as a potential threat could be easily  intercepted and directed out from the normal flow of passengers.", "In addition, although recent TSA testing in 2009 on an advanced standoff  system showed good performance detecting hidden threat objects\u2014 including nonmetallic objects\u2014on moving people in controlled situations,  consistent detection under actual operating conditions in heavy passenger  volume scenarios will be challenging. The TSA tests showed good  probability of detection rates and low false alarm rates for indoors and  outdoors screening. Unlike the use of similar technology in a portal  configuration (such as AIT) where a passenger can be asked to pause, turn  around, or, for example, lift their arms to provide the sensor a better view,  in a standoff configuration passenger, movement is uncontrolled. Although  some systems allow tracking, the length of time a person can be  maintained within the required line of sight is minimal in a fast-moving,  large density crowd.", "Finally, at up to several hundred thousand dollars per unit, a deployment  of standoff technology in passenger rail could be costly and manpower  intensive. Based on their operational pilots over the last several years, TSA  told us that a likely implementation for a standoff detection system at a  rail site would consist of multiple detectors, and a 3 to 4 person team  including one operator per system, an assistant, and probably two  Behavioral Detection Officers to focus special attention on persons of  interest. A good implementation would also have a canine team ready to  inspect the passenger or accompanying articles, if the system detected an  anomaly. Also, since some of the systems produce images susceptible to  the same privacy concerns as the recent deployment of AIT in airports, a  remote imaging station might also need to be configured and staffed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Explosives Detection Canines", "paragraphs": ["Explosives detection canines (EDC) are currently used in passenger rail  systems for both random screening of passengers and their belongings and  as a deterrent to criminal and terrorist activity.

These  operators also viewed canines as the most effective method currently  available for detecting explosives in the rail environment because of their  detection capability as well as the deterrent effect that they provide. More  specifically, operators noted EDCs\u2019 ability to rapidly move to various  locations throughout a rail system, their minimum impact on passenger  flow and rail operations, and their ability to detect explosives they are  trained to detect. Operators and experts on our panel also noted that  canines are generally accepted by members of the public that use these  systems. In addition to passenger rail operators, canines have been  deployed by federal agencies such as the U.S. Secret Service; Bureau of  Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF); and U.S. Customs and  Border Protection.

These standards  vary based on which entity is certifying the canine. A guiding document on  the training of canines is the Scientific Working Group on Dog and  Orthogonal Detectors Guidelines that specifies recommended best  practices for canine explosives detection. These standards call for an EDC  to detect explosives a certain percent of the time and a probability of false  alarms less than a certain rate. Certifying entities, however, may have  more stringent standards. For example, ATF requires that its canines  detect all explosives that are presented to them, and have limited false  alarms in its tests. TSA requires that their certified canines find a specified  percent of explosives in a variety of scenarios, such as onboard an aircraft,  mass transit rail, and mass transit buses. Homeland Security Presidential  Directive-19 tasks the Attorney General, in coordination with DHS and  other agencies, with assessing the effectiveness of, and, as necessary,  making recommendations for improving federal government training and  education initiatives related to explosive attack detection, including  canine training and performance standards. According to ATF officials,  TSA, in coordination with ATF, is developing standards for EDCs, which  are nearly complete and are similar to the standards that ATF uses.", "EDCs have a limited period of endurance at which they can maintain  effective detection capabilities. According to ATF officials and other  experts that attended our panel, canines can typically operate between 20  and 45 minutes before requiring a break with a total of 3 to 4 hours of time  spent detecting per day. Additionally, members of our expert panel told us  that aspects of the rail environment such as dirt, cleaning chemicals, and  metal fragments from trains, may reduce canines\u2019 optimum operating time  in this environment. As a result, one rail operator told us that their EDCs  are stored in the back of police cars throughout the day unless they are  needed and are not available for use as a deterrent. TSA advocates using  explosive detection canines on patrols as visible deterrents in an effort to  reduce crime and prevent the introduction of explosives into the rail  environment.", "Canines have a history of being trained to detect items and in recent years  have been trained to detect, among other things, explosives, fire  accelerants used in arson investigations, and drugs. While training  methods differ among canine training schools, these methods typically  train canines by rewarding them for locating certain items. Rewards  include toys, a food treat, or the canine\u2019s food itself. In turn, these canines  are trained to alert their handlers if they detect an item of interest, usually  by sitting down next to the item. EDCs used in rail are generally deployed  to screen passenger baggage, either on a primary basis by inspecting  baggage as passengers enter a system or on a secondary basis to screen an  item of interest, such as an unattended package. Additionally, EDCs are to  receive training on a regular basis to ensure that they are capable of  detecting explosives. Recurrent training requirements vary based on the  training method used with the canine. For instance, one training regime  we reviewed calls for 4 hours per week of recurrent training for EDCs,  while other training regimes, such as those used by ATF, require daily  training. The amount of recurrent training necessary for EDCs has not  been determined according to the experts we spoke with, but they agree  that the training is necessary to ensure the canine accurately detects  explosives. As such, passenger rail operators who employ EDCs are to  incorporate the training regime specified by the training method used to  produce the EDC to ensure the canine operates effectively. Additionally,  TSA and ATF both require their trained EDCs to be recertified on an  annual basis whereby the canine and handler must demonstrate that they  can detect explosives and meet required performance standards.", "The quality of an EDC\u2019s search for explosives is dependent on the handler  correctly interpreting behavioral changes of the canine. As the canine is  capable of giving a positive or negative response as to the presence of an  explosive odor emanating from an item, the handler must interpret the  canine\u2019s response and respond appropriately in keeping with a pre- determined concept of operations because the canine cannot indicate the  type of explosive it has detected. Moreover, according to ATF officials, a  canine is only capable of detecting the explosives it has been trained to  detect and there are tens of thousands of explosive compounds. To  address this issue, ATF separates explosives into six categories with  similar characteristics that the canines are trained and required to identify.", "According to TSA, the total initial cost to acquire and train an EDC and  handler is about $31,000. In addition, there are also ongoing maintenance  costs including food, veterinary services, and other maintenance expenses,  as well as the ongoing expense of the handler\u2019s salary. TSGP grant funding  can often be used to offset the initial acquisition cost of the canine, but  cannot typically be used to pay for ongoing maintenance throughout the  canines\u2019 duty life. According to ATF officials, an EDC typically has an  operational life of about 7 years, having completed training around age 2  and entering retirement at age 9.", "Vapor Wake Canines are an emerging use of EDCs that may be applicable  to the passenger rail environment. Vapor Wake Canines differ from more  traditional EDCs in that the canine does not directly sniff individual  passengers and their belongings and instead the canine may remain in a  stationary location sniffing multiple passengers as they pass by the canine,  thus allowing more passengers and their belongings to be screened. These  canines are trained to alert if they detect any explosives in the air and  follow the explosive to its source. Vapor Wake Canines were piloted by  DHS S&T in 2006 in the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority with  generally positive results. Specifically, these canines were able to detect  explosives under the concept of operations developed by DHS S&T. DHS  S&T officials told us that they will soon begin additional research on  Vapor Wake Canines to determine their probability of detection and to  better understand factors behind their performance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limitations in Available Explosives Detection Technologies Restrict Their More Widespread or More Effective Use in Passenger Rail", "paragraphs": ["The ability of explosives detection technologies to help protect the  passenger rail environment depends both upon their detection  performance and how effectively the technologies can be deployed in that  environment.

However, all of the technologies face key challenges, and most will  struggle in passenger rail stations to screen passengers without undue  delays.

In many cases, this is  because they have been designed specifically to focus on specific  characteristics of nitro-based conventional explosives. Similarly, the more  mature bulk detection techniques\u2014carry-on baggage x-ray systems, for  example\u2014have been widely used for many years and, when used by  trained operators, have shown good detection performance.", "However, some of the newer detection technologies\u2014ETPs, AIT, and  standoff detection systems, for example\u2014are in varying stages of maturity  and more extensive testing would be required to determine their likely  performance if deployed in passenger rail. For example, ETPs performed  poorly in laboratory testing even though those devices incorporated  mature analytical detection techniques. In this case, the variation in  performance might be the result of how those techniques are integrated by  specific manufacturers into a portal configuration. AIT is currently being  deployed in airports nationwide, and laboratory testing has shown it has  some ability to detect explosives. While standoff detection systems have  demonstrated good performance detecting hidden threat objects on  people in controlled testing, consistent detection under actual operating  conditions in heavy passenger volume scenarios will be challenging.", "With all the technologies, certain factors underlie their ability to achieve  adequate performance and often these depend on the human operator. For  example, in a trace detection system the human operator plays a key part  in preparing the sample and delivering it to the trace detection machine. In  addition, trace detection is an indirect method of detection, relying on the  presence of trace signatures that may, in fact, not exist or exist in  insufficient quantities to be detected even though the threat object is  present, or are present in the absence of a threat object.", "Similarly, image based detection schemes are all dependent on successful  image interpretation. Human operator image interpretation is a difficult  task and performance is largely a function of adequate and persistent  training. To help address this issue, DHS has initiated efforts looking at  enhancing automated image processing algorithms to provide for better  detection and lower false alarm rates. As part of this, DHS is creating a  database of raw image data from commercially available systems\u2014for  example, x-ray and millimeter wave image data\u2014which can be made  available to researchers to help them develop better automated detection  algorithms to improve processing across a range of imaging technologies  including carry-on baggage x-ray technologies such as AT-based systems,  AIT, and some of the standoff detection technologies. With the goal of  increasing the probability of detection and reducing the number of false  alarms these systems generate when operating in automated mode, such  enhancements could help with the challenge of screening large volumes of  people by increasing system throughput. While an outgrowth of research  and development to support aviation security, this could benefit the use of  imaging technologies in passenger rail settings as well.", "Finally, adequate detection performance of explosives detection  technologies can depend on other factors, such as maintenance, system  calibration, and proper setup. For example, performance can be affected  by the operator\u2019s preferences regarding sensitivity of the equipment. With  many of the technologies there are tradeoffs that can be made between the  sensitivity of the device and the operator\u2019s tolerance for false alarms. In  cases where a trace detector is highly sensitive to contaminants in the air,  for instance, decreasing the sensitivity may reduce the number of false  alarms but will also increase the possibility for missed detections.", "One of the issues in implementing explosives detection technologies  effectively in passenger rail is in identifying the explosive materials and  amounts that constitute the threat to that environment. While  requirements and standards for explosives threat amounts and detection  levels, for example, have been defined for the aviation environment and  for DOD\u2019s counter IED mission, threat amounts have not been determined  for rail for either the conventional explosives threat or the threat from  HMEs.

Although passenger volumes in the heavier trafficked rail stations may  preclude 100 percent screening of passengers in an overly intrusive way,  lighter volume stations may allow for such intrusive screening if an  adequate screening throughput speed can be maintained. Decisions  regarding screening modes will vary by systems, stations, and the  tolerance for passenger delay.", "Two important system characteristics when considering the use of  explosives detection technologies in passenger rail are screening  throughput and system mobility. The higher the throughput, the less delay  is imposed on passenger flow. The more portable a detection system is,  the more it lends itself for use in random deployment, a known deterrent  and cost effective option for rail operators.", "Screening throughput and system mobility varied across the different  explosives detection technologies we examined, but many had screening  times that would be difficult to accommodate in situations with heavy  passenger volume. In airport security checkpoints, for example, using  similar equipment and working toward a goal of 10 minute or less wait  times, the TSA staffing allocation model for screening operations requires  individual screening lanes to be able to process 200 passengers per hour.   However, during the 2006 S&T pilot testing in PATH, passenger flow rates  on the order of 4,000 passengers per hour was measured during the  afternoon rush at just the main entrance turnstiles at one station. Even  under TSA\u2019s aviation wait time goal this would require the purchase,  staffing, and physical space for 20 screening lanes.", "These technologies, however, might be considered for use in lower volume  rail stations, for example, or in other areas of passenger rail where  passenger queues could be supported without unduly impacting passenger  flow. However, they are generally large, bulky and not easily moved from  place to place and therefore impractical for use in any highly mobile way.", "In general, most passenger rail operators that have deployed explosives  detection technologies have done so on a less intrusive basis, using, for  example, mobile explosives detection canine teams as a deterrent in  stations or, alternatively, setting up temporary, portable stations for the  screening of selected passengers who are pulled out of the normal  passenger flow randomly, via some selection method, or as a result of  behavioral cues. In this mode, for example, they have used handheld  detectors for primary screening.", "Standoff detection systems, which minimize the impact of screening on  passenger flow, are the only explosives detection technology that  currently could be considered for helping to address the 100 percent  screening scenario at heavy volume stations, generally, for passenger rail.  As noted, some of these systems demonstrated the ability to scan at or  near 100 percent of passengers even in heavy rail stations for periods of  time. In addition, many are portable and are designed so that system  installations could be shifted from site to site. However, while attractive  from a throughput point of view, standoff systems are developing in terms  of their detection performance and general concept of operations.", "In addition to limitations imposed by the technologies, rail stations  themselves have constraints that will influence the applicability of certain  technology for certain purposes. These include environmental issues, such  as the relatively high level of contaminants found in passenger rail  environments like steel dust and soot that can disrupt the operation of  sensitive equipment, and raise the potential for false alarms, and the lack  of controlled temperature and humidity levels in many stations and the  potential for extremes of those levels in outdoor stations. Some DOD  research and development efforts are looking at hardened versions of  some explosives detection technologies.", "The general openness of many rail stations is another important  consideration in deciding on the use of explosives detection technologies  in rail. In commuter or light rail systems, for example, many stations may  be unmanned, outdoor platforms without barriers between pubic areas  and the train and with few natural locations to place technologies to be  able to screen passengers. With limited existing chokepoints,  implementation of certain technologies may require station infrastructure  modifications to aid in funneling passengers for screening.", "Finally, physical space constraints in many stations are an important  consideration. For example, many rail stations have limited space in which  to install large equipment, accommodate any passenger queues that might  build up, or add multiple screening lanes as a way of dealing with long  lines.

Even if a technology works in the passenger rail  environment, our work, in consultation with rail experts, identified several  critical operational and policy factors that arise when these technologies  are being considered for deployment.

While federal grant funding for security has  increased in recent years, decision making for funding these measures,  including technology, is likely to continue to be shared between the rail  operators and the federal government moving forward. In addition, as  federal agencies implement their own rail security measures and  operations, which could include the use of explosives detection  technology, decisions of how to implement and coordinate these measures  will likely be shared with operators.", "Regarding the federal role, TSA defines and implements federal policies  and actions for securing passenger rail systems in their role as the lead  federal agency responsible for transportation security. TSA\u2019s strategy for  securing passenger rail is identified in the Mass Transit Modal Annex to  the Transportation Systems- Sector Specific Plan, including its role in  developing and procuring technologies for securing rail systems. To date,  TSA\u2019s primary approach to securing passenger rail, defined in the Modal  Annex, has been to assess the risk facing rail systems, develop security  guidance for rail operators, and to provide funding to operators to make  security improvements to their systems, including the purchase of security  technologies. Specifically, TSA\u2019s stated objectives for using technology in  passenger rail is to bolster the use of technologies to screen passengers  and their bags on a random basis in partnership with rail operators.  According to the Modal Annex, these objectives are to be achieved  through the use of explosives detection technology to screen passengers  during TSA Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response (VIPR)  operations and screening programs introduced by passenger rail operators  themselves. In addition, through its National Explosives Detection  Canine Team Program (NEDCTP), TSA procures, trains, and certifies  explosives detection canine teams and provides training and the canines  to passenger rail operators.", "TSA also supports the use of technology by providing funding to rail  operators to purchase screening technologies and train their employees  through TSGP. To date, TSGP has provided funding for various security- related technologies; including handheld explosive trace detection  equipment, closed-circuit television, intrusion detection devices, and  others. In June 2009, we reported that the TSGP faces a number of  challenges, such as lack of clear roles and responsibilities in the program  and delays in approving projects and making funds available to operators,  and as of February 2009, of the $755 million that had been awarded by  TSGP for fiscal years 2006 through 2008, approximately $334 million had  been made available to transit agencies, and transit agencies had spent  about $21 million. We further reported that these delays were caused  largely by TSA\u2019s lengthy cooperative agreement process with transit  agencies, a backlog in required environmental reviews, and delays in  receiving disbursement approvals from FEMA. As such, rail operators  have spent a small percentage of the resources available to fund security  investments. We recommended that DHS establish and communicate to  rail operators time frames for releasing funds after the projects receive  approval from TSA. DHS agreed with this recommendation and indicated  that it would establish and communicate timeframes for releasing funds to  TSGP grantees and try to release funds shortly after they have received all  required documentation from grant recipients.", "Additionally, in a March 2010 report, the administration\u2019s Surface  Transportation Security Priority Assessment recommended that TSA  adopt a multi-year, multi-phase approach for grant funding based on a  long-term strategy for transportation security. This approach calls for  segmenting larger projects into smaller components to both complete the  projects quicker and also to provide strategic planning for future grant  funding needs and provide closer alignment of federal and stakeholder  long-term priorities. Moreover, during our expert panel, rail operators  stated that they would prefer the federal government to procure and  provide security technologies to them, instead of providing cash awards to  directly procure the technologies by the operators. These operators  indicated that their local procurement regulations can often make the  process of procuring security technologies slow and cumbersome.", "In addition to providing funding for technology, the Modal Annex also  identifies TSA\u2019s role in providing resources for research, development,  testing, and evaluation of technology. TSA, like other DHS components, is  responsible for articulating the technology needs of all transportation  sector stakeholders\u2014including passenger rail operators\u2014to DHS S&T for  development.

As we reported in June 2009,  the information on HSIN is in an early state of development and contains  limited information that would be useful to rail operators. For example,  for a given security technology, TSA\u2019s list of technologies provides a  categorical definition (such as video motion analysis), a subcategory (such  as day or night camera), and the names of products within those  categories. We also reported that the list on HSIN neither provides nor  indicates how rail operators can obtain information beyond the product\u2019s  name and function and does not provide information on the product\u2019s  capabilities, maintenance, ease of use, and suitability in a rail  environment. We recommended that TSA explore the feasibility of  expanding the security technology information in HSIN, including adding  information on cost, maintenance, and other information to support  passenger rail agencies\u2019 purchases and deployment of these technologies.  TSA concurred with this recommendation and stated that it would provide  information on HSIN about specifications, performance criteria, and  evaluations of security technologies used in or adaptable to the passenger  rail environment. In January 2010, TSA officials told us that they were still  planning to provide this information on the HSIN some time in 2010, but  had not done so yet.", "TSA officials told us that in addition to the QPL for aviation there is  another list that is administered by FEMA called the Authorized  Equipment List, which provides a list of technologies for which TSGP  grant recipients can use grant funding.

While the operators have responsibility  for securing their systems, the operators that attended our panel  expressed to us that their limited resources often limit their ability to  directly invest in security, including technology, and instead they look to  the federal government to provide financial assistance. For example, rail  operators that we spoke to and that attended our expert panel noted that  they often do not collect sufficient revenue from their fares to cover  operational expenses.", "In June 2009, we reported that while the majority of rail operator actions  to secure passenger rail have been taken on a voluntary basis, the pending  9/11 Commission Act regulations outline a new approach that sets forth  mandatory requirements, such as, among others, requirements for  employee training, vulnerability assessments, and security plans, the  implementation of which may create challenges for TSA and industry  stakeholders. In general, TSA has a collaborative approach in  encouraging passenger rail systems to voluntarily participate and address  security gaps. We also reported that with TSA\u2019s pending issuance of  regulations required by the 9/11 Commission Act, TSA will fundamentally  shift this approach, and establish new regulatory requirements for  passenger rail security. TSA officials stated that they do not see the 9/11  Commission Act requirements impacting TSA\u2019s current role as it relates to  technologies in the passenger rail environments. Because of the unique  characteristics of the rail environment and the fact that the 9/11  Commission Act does not impose specific requirements related to  technologies, TSA officials stated that the agency\u2019s role will continue to be  to assist rail operators in conducting random deployments of explosives  detection technologies and inspections, as stated in the Modal Annex."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Management Could be Used to Effectively Guide the Decision to Fund or Implement Explosives Detection Technologies", "paragraphs": ["As passenger rail operators consider the use of explosives detection  technologies, it is not only important to select technologies capable of  detecting explosives and that can be used in the passenger rail  environment, but it is also important to select technologies that will  address identified risks. We have recommended that a risk management  approach be used to guide the investment of security funding, particularly  for passenger rail systems, where security funding and rail operator  budgets are limited. As such, the decision as to whether or not to deploy  explosives detection technologies should be made consistent with a risk  management framework to ensure that limited security budgets are  expended to address the greatest risks. We reported in June 2009 that  officials from 26 of 30 transit and passenger rail systems we visited stated  that they had conducted their own assessments of their systems, including  risk assessments. Additionally, Amtrak officials stated that they conducted  a risk assessment of all of their systems. As part of the assessment,  Amtrak contracted with a private consulting firm to provide a scientific  basis for identifying critical points at stations that might be vulnerable to  IED attacks or that are structurally weak. We also reported that other  transit agencies indicated that they have received assistance in the form of  either guidance or risk assessments from federal and industry  stakeholders. For example, FTA provided on-site technical assistance to  the nation\u2019s 50 largest transit agencies (i.e., those transit agencies with the  highest ridership) on how to conduct threat and vulnerability assessments,  among other technical assistance needs, through its Security and  Emergency Management Technical Assistance Program (SEMTAP).  According to FTA officials, although FTA continues providing technical  assistance to transit agencies, the on-site SEMTAP program concluded in  July 2006.

Further,  TSA\u2019s Modal Annex advocates using risk-based principles to secure  passenger rail systems and we have previously reported that TSA has used  various threat, vulnerability, and consequence assessments to inform its  security strategy for passenger rail. In June 2009, we reported that TSA  had not completed a risk assessment of the entire passenger rail system  and recommended that, by doing so, TSA would be able to better prioritize  risks as well as more confidently assure that its programs are directed  toward the highest priority risks. TSA concurred with this  recommendation and stated that it is developing a Transportation Systems  Security Risk Assessment that aims to provide TSA with a comprehensive  risk assessment for use in passenger rail. To this end, TSA told us that it  has developed a Transportation Systems Sector Risk Assessment report,  which is to evaluate threat, vulnerability, and consequence in more than  200 terrorist attack scenarios on passenger rail.

For example,  one rail operator who attended our expert panel told us that they used  deployments of explosives detection technologies along with customer  awareness campaigns and CCTV as layers of security in their security  posture. In addition to explosives detection technology, other layers of  security that rail operators have used or are considering using to secure  passenger rail include:    Customer awareness campaigns. Rail operators use signage and  announcements to encourage riders to alert train staff if they observe  suspicious packages, persons, or behavior.

Further, these operators stated that  increasing the visibility of security is as important as increasing the  number of personnel. For example, several U.S. rail operators we spoke  with had instituted policies such as requiring their security staff, wearing  brightly colored vests, to patrol trains or stations more frequently, so they  are more visible to customers and potential terrorists or criminals. These  policies make it easier for customers to contact security personnel in an  emergency or potential emergency.", "Employee training.

This CONOPS for passenger rail would include specific plans to  respond to threats without unacceptable impacts on the flow of  passengers through the system. There are multiple components of a  CONOPS. First, operators identify likely threats to rail systems and choose  layers of security to mitigate these threats. Since each rail system in the  United States faces different risks, rail systems perform their own risk  assessment in consultation with federal partners to identify their risks.  Using the results of the risk assessment, each system crafts a strategy to  respond to the threat and to mitigate the risks by acquiring different layers  of security. Rail systems typically make use of multiple security layers\u2014 which may or may not include the use of an explosives detection  technology component\u2014based on the risks each system faces.", "The CONOPS is a plan to respond to threats identified by one of the layers  of security. Developing a CONOPS for responding to explosives detection  technology is challenging because of the potential for false alarms. For  example, two rail operators with whom we spoke and that were using  explosives detection technologies to screen passengers and their  belongings stated that a CONOPS was critical for ensuring that actions  taken in response to an alarm are appropriate and are followed correctly.  For example, should the person be questioned or searched further or  should the person be moved to another location on the chance that the  threat is real. These are questions that would be answered in developing a  CONOPS and before implementing explosives detection technology in the  passenger rail environment. Two of the rail operators and one of the  experts that attended our panel also expressed concern about the  potential for false alarms when using explosives detection technologies  and the potential impacts on rail operations. For example, operators were  concerned about a false alarm stopping service. As a result, it is important  to carefully consider the CONOPS of using a particular technology, such  as how to respond to false alarms, in addition to the security benefits  before implementation. For instance, one major rail operator\u2019s CONOPS  involves using handheld explosives detection technology to screen  passengers\u2019 baggage randomly by a law enforcement officer. The  frequency in which bags are selected is determined in advance by  someone other than the law enforcement officer\u2014such as a supervisor\u2014 based on a number of factors such as the number of passengers entering a  station and resources available for screening. The baggage is then  screened by the officer with the explosives detection equipment; if there is  no alarm, the passenger is free to continue.

An official from the industry association representing passenger rail and  mass transit systems that attended our expert panel stated that when it  comes to security investments, security often becomes less of a priority  than operational investments as they often operate with budgets deficits.  In addition, another rail operator that attended our expert panel raised  concern that TSGP often will not provide funding for ongoing maintenance  of capital purchases, additional staff needed to deploy these technologies,  and disposable items required to operate the technology, such as swabs  for explosive trace detection devices. For example, while rail operators  can use TSGP grant funds to purchase explosives detection equipment,  funding for the operation and maintenance of this technology is only  provided for a 36 month period. One major rail operator that attended our  expert panel stated that the cost of deploying a random baggage check  with a handheld explosive trace detector costs between $700 and $1,000  per hour, including the costs of staffs\u2019 salaries and disposable items. Given  the cost of operating and maintaining these security technologies, it would  be important for policymakers to consider all associated costs of these  technologies before implementing new security measures or encouraging  their use.", "Legal implications with regard to constitutional and tort law would also be  important for passenger rail operators to consider when determining  whether and how explosives detection technologies are applied in the  passenger rail environment. The Fourth Amendment of the U.S.  Constitution protects individuals against unreasonable governmental  searches, and state constitutional law may provide additional protections  against searches. In recent years, federal courts have heard several  challenges to new passenger inspection programs implemented in  passenger rail environments. In these cases, in order to assess the  constitutionality of the programs, the courts considered factors such as  the intrusiveness of the searches, the government interest in the program,  and the effectiveness of the program. In addition to constitutional  concerns, taking actions to mitigate potential tort liability is another  important consideration for rail operators. For example, state law may  allow individuals to bring tort claims against transit agencies, such as  claims related to invasion of privacy and health hazards posed by scanning  equipment. Also, operators using explosives detection canines should be  conscious of potential claims related to dog bites.", "There are also privacy considerations associated with subjecting  passengers to certain types of screening technologies. Because explosives  detection technologies generally do not collect personally identifiable  information, they pose fewer privacy concerns than other screening  techniques may. However, a number of advocacy groups have raised  concerns about the use of AITs which produce an image of a person  without clothing. To protect passengers\u2019 privacy, however, ways have  been introduced to blur the passengers\u2019 images with privacy settings.", "Concerns also exist about the impact that certain technologies could have  on the health of passengers. For example, certain types of explosives  detection screening equipment may expose individuals to mild radiation.  Specifically, technologies such as backscatter x-ray AIT expose the  passenger to minute amounts of radiation. While this radiation exposure is  smaller than the radiation a person receives by a normal medical x-ray, the  public may have concerns about being exposed to any radiation or may  misjudge the amount of radiation they receive. For example, according to  TSA, a person would require more than 1,000 backscatter scans in a year  to reach the effective dose equal to one standard chest x-ray. Additionally,  some forms of IMS technology make use of radiation in their operation  and some people may be concerned with having any radiation source in a  rail network.", "Finally, some passenger rail systems operate across multiple city, county,  and other jurisdictions and must coordinate with local governments and  law enforcement across these areas. For example, the Washington  Metropolitan Area Transit Authority was established by an interstate  compact between Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia. The  authority has its own police force and must coordinate with not only the  police force of the District of Columbia, but also the surrounding  communities through which its trains pass. This pattern is common across  the country where public transportation systems cross state and local  boundaries. As such, the use of explosives detection equipment  throughout these networks involves coordination across many levels of  government and may potentially invoke the laws of multiple jurisdictions  and come under the scrutiny of different governments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Securing passenger rail systems is a daunting challenge for several  reasons, including the open nature of these systems and the relative ease  and the number of locations in which these systems can be accessed by  those wishing to cause harm. While there are some explosives detection  technologies available or currently in development that could be used to  help secure passenger rail, there are several technical, operational, and  policy factors that are important to consider when determining the role  that these technologies can play in passenger rail security. There are  various stakeholders responsible for securing passenger rail systems and  all may need to be involved when making decisions to fund, implement,  and operate explosives detection technologies. It is also important that the  need for explosives detection technologies be based on a consideration of  the risks posed by the threat of an explosives attack on passenger rail  systems. Such a risk assessment would help define the detection needs,  including what explosives materials need to be detected and in what  quantities.", "Explosives detection technologies are just one of many layers of security  and cannot, by themselves, secure passenger rail systems. While  explosives detection technologies can play a role in securing passenger  rail systems, certain aspects of these technologies will likely limit their  immediate use. All of the technologies face key challenges, including the  ability to screen passengers without undue delays. In some cases, the  ability to detect more conventional explosives is also limited. The ability  of these technologies to effectively detect explosives on people and their  belongings, as well as the expectations of the public for openness and  speed when using rail, will likely be key drivers in decisions about which  technologies should be applied, and in what capacity. Other important  characteristics of the technologies, including the mobility, durability, and  the size of the equipment, may limit deployment options for explosives  detection technologies in passenger rail. The ability of these technologies  to effectively detect explosives often depends on a human operator and  the development of a strong concept of operations that defines the  processes used to screen passengers and their belongings and the roles  that people and technology play in that process will be critical.", "When considering the options for securing passenger rail, it is important  that policymakers also take into account the cost and legal implications of  securing systems that are so open and widely used by the public. The lack  of funding from passenger rail operator budgets means that the purchase  and maintenance of explosives detection technologies would likely  originate from or be highly subsidized by the federal government.  Moreover, the wide scale use and reliance on these systems by the public  means that individuals and advocacy groups may raise concerns about any  technology that screens passengers or their belongings. An effective risk  management process that continuously examines the risks posed by  explosives to the passenger rail environment and considers the various  technical, operational, and policy considerations when determining  alternative solutions to address the explosives risk should result in an  effective identification of the role that explosives detection technologies  can play in securing passenger rail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided draft copies of this report to the Secretaries of Homeland  Security, Defense, Transportation, Justice, and Energy for review and  comment.
