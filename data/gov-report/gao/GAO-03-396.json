In August  2001, the President\u2019s Management Agenda directed all agencies to  \u201crightsize\u201d their overseas presence to the minimum necessary to meet U.S.  foreign policy goals. To support the long-standing need for a successful  rightsizing initiative, in 2002 we developed a framework that identifies  critical elements of embassy operations\u2014physical security, mission  priorities and requirements, and cost\u2014and also includes rightsizing  options for consideration. Each element contains a set of corresponding  questions for rightsizing the overseas workforce. The questions provide a  basis for decision makers to systematically link the elements of security,  mission, and cost to embassy staffing levels and requirements. The  framework also includes questions on rightsizing options, including  relocating staff to the United States or to regional centers, and  competitively sourcing certain functions. (See app. II for the rightsizing  framework and corresponding questions.) After responding to the  questions, decision makers should then be in a position to determine  whether rightsizing actions are needed to add, reduce, or change the staff  mix at an embassy, and to consider rightsizing options.", "Our July 2002 report recommended that the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) use our framework to support the administration\u2019s  rightsizing initiatives, starting with its assessments of staffing levels and  rightsizing options at posts in Europe and Eurasia.

To accomplish this objective, we applied the questions to each  post in West Africa by reviewing embassy planning and requirements  documents and by interviewing embassy managers and officials in the  Department of State\u2019s Bureau of African Affairs regarding each embassy\u2019s  security, mission, cost, and rightsizing options. We also discussed security  issues at those posts with officials in State\u2019s Bureau of Diplomatic  Security.

Other reviews  reached similar conclusions. In early 1999, the Accountability Review  Boards that investigated the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East  Africa concluded that the United States should consider adjusting the size  of its embassies and consulates to reduce security vulnerabilities. Later  that year, the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel (OPAP) recommended  that rightsizing be a key strategy to improve security and reduce operating  costs. In August 2001, President Bush announced that achieving a  rightsized overseas presence was one of his 14 management priorities. The  September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States added impetus for  this initiative. In May 2002, we testified before the Subcommittee on  National Security, Veterans Affairs, and International Relations, House  Committee on Government Reform, on a proposed framework for  determining the appropriate number of staff to be assigned to a U.S.  embassy.", "To further assess the applicability of GAO\u2019s rightsizing framework, we  selected the embassies in Dakar, Senegal; Banjul, The Gambia; and  Nouakchott, Mauritania. We selected these embassies based on OMB\u2019s  questions about whether our framework can be uniformly applied at all  posts, and because experts suggest that rightsizing in Africa is a significant  challenge. The embassy in Dakar is a medium-sized post that provides  regional support to several embassies including Cape Verde, Guinea, The  Gambia, Mali, Mauritania, and Sierra Leone. Embassy Dakar has about 90  direct-hire Americans and 350 local hires working in seven U.S. agencies.", "Embassy Banjul is a special embassy program post with 7 American  direct hires and about 65 local hires.

Our security questions  address a broad range of issues, including the security of embassy  buildings, the use of existing secure space, and the vulnerabilities of staff  to terrorist attack. Officials at the embassies in Dakar, Banjul, and  Nouakchott agreed that security vulnerability should be a key concern in  determining the size and composition of staffing levels at the posts and  should be addressed in conjunction with the other rightsizing elements of  mission and cost.", "Each post has undergone security upgrades since the 1998 embassy  bombings to address deficiencies and ensure better security. However,  until facilities are replaced as part of the long-term construction plan, most  will not meet security standards. For example, many buildings at overseas  posts do not meet the security setback requirement. At the Dakar post,  responses to the framework\u2019s security questions identified significant  limitations in facility security and office space that likely limit the number  of additional staff that could be adequately protected in the embassy  compound. This is a significant issue for the embassy in Dakar given its  expanding regional role and projected increases in staffing to  accommodate visa workload and increasing personnel at non-State  agencies, as well as because planned construction of a new secure  embassy compound will not be completed until at least 2007. In contrast,  Embassy Banjul has unused office space that could accommodate  additional staff within the embassy compound. Although U.S. interests are  limited in The Gambia, a staff increase could be accommodated if decision  makers determine that additional staff are needed as a result of answering  the framework\u2019s questions.

Questions in this section of our  framework include assessing the overall justification of agency staffing  levels in relation to embassy priorities and the extent to which it is  necessary for each agency to maintain or change its presence in a country,  given the scope of its responsibilities and its mission. Related questions  include asking if each agency\u2019s mission reinforces embassy priorities and  if an agency\u2019s mission could be pursued in other ways. Responses to the  questions showed that there are key management systems for controlling  and planning staffing levels currently in use at overseas posts, but they are  not designed or used to systematically address these staffing, priority, and  mission issues.", "One such management system is the National Security Decision Directive- 38 (NSDD-38). NSDD-38 is a long-standing directive that requires non-State  agencies to seek approval by chiefs of missions on any proposed changes  in staff. NSDD-38 does not, however, direct the Chief of Mission to  initiate an assessment of an agency\u2019s overall presence. The Overseas  Presence Advisory Panel reported that the directive is not designed to  enable ambassadors to make decisions on each new agency position in a  coordinated, interagency plan for U.S. operations at a post. Post officials  agreed that the NSDD-38 system has only limited usefulness for controlling  staffing levels and achieving rightsizing objectives.", "Another management system is the Department of State\u2019s Mission  Performance Plan (MPP). The MPP is the primary planning document for  each overseas post. State\u2019s MPP process has been strengthened  significantly to require each embassy to set its top priorities and link  staffing and workload requirements to those priorities. However, the MPP  does not address rightsizing as a management issue or provide full  guidance to posts for assessing overall staffing levels, by agency, in  relation to a post\u2019s mission. At the three posts we visited, staffing requests  were addressed in the MPPs in the context of each post\u2019s mission  performance goals; however, these documents did not address the security  and cost trade-offs associated with making such staffing changes. In  addition, Embassy Dakar has an increasing regional role, which is not  sufficiently addressed in the MPP.", "Finally, the Department of State\u2019s Overseas Staffing Model provides  guidance for State in assigning its full-time American direct hire staff to  posts, but it does not include comprehensive guidance on linking staffing  levels to security, workload requirements, cost, and other elements of  rightsizing. It also does not provide guidance on staffing levels for foreign  service nationals or for other agencies at a post.", "Using various methods for addressing staffing and other key resource  requirements is not effective in planning for or controlling growth. The  Deputy Chief of Mission at Embassy Dakar agreed, as this has resulted in  growth beyond the post\u2019s capacity. Specifically, The Department of State  has added at least seven American direct-hire positions to the post, and  non-State agencies operating in Dakar have added another six positions  over the last year. In addition, post officials project more increases in  personnel by fiscal year 2004 to accommodate other agencies interested in  working out of Dakar. Post officials agreed that a more systematic and  comprehensive approach might improve the post\u2019s ability to plan for and  control growth.", "Responses to the framework\u2019s questions by Banjul and Dakar consular  officers also indicated that they could further explore processing all  nonimmigrant visas from the Dakar post, particularly since Dakar has  done so in the past on a temporary basis. Neither post\u2019s MPP discussed the  possibility of covering these functions on a regional basis from Dakar, yet  doing so would relieve Banjul\u2019s consular officer from processing  nonimmigrant visas, thereby allowing more time for political and  economic reporting. Thus, the post might not need to request a junior  officer to handle such reporting. However, Banjul post officials said this  arrangement would not be feasible for a variety of reasons. Nevertheless,  their assessment illustrates the importance of weighing the benefits and  trade-offs of exercising rightsizing options.

For example, complete budget data  that reflect the cost of employee salaries and benefits and certain  information management expenses for each agency at post were not  available. Further, we found that embassy profile reports maintained by  State\u2019s Bureau of Administration contained incomplete and inaccurate  information for each embassy\u2019s funding levels and sources. Officials at  each post agreed that it is difficult to discern overall costs because data  are incomplete and fragmented across funding sources, thereby making it  difficult for decision makers to justify staffing levels in relation to overall  post costs.", "In view of Embassy Dakar\u2019s plans to expand its regional responsibilities,  embassy officials said it would be beneficial to document and justify the  cost effectiveness of providing support to posts in the region. The type of  support can be substantial and can have significant implications for  planning future staffing and other resource requirements.

If Embassy Dakar used our  framework to complete a full and comprehensive analysis of its regional  capabilities, in conjunction with analyses of mission priorities and  requirements of other embassies in West Africa, then staffing levels could  be adjusted at some of the posts in the region. One rightsizing option  includes having Embassy Banjul\u2019s visa services handled from Dakar.", "The general services officers at the Dakar and Banjul posts agreed that our  framework could be used to identify competitive sourcing opportunities in  their locations. One rightsizing option includes assessing the feasibility of  competitively sourcing the work of currently employed painters,  upholsterers, electricians, and others to yield cost savings and reduce staff  requirements. This could have a particularly significant impact at the  Dakar post, which employs more than 70 staff who are working in these  types of positions.", "The Dakar and Banjul embassies operate substantial warehousing and  maintenance complexes. Post officials said that operations and staffing  requirements at these government-owned facilities could be potentially  streamlined in a number of areas. The Department of State and other  agencies maintain separate nonexpendable properties, such as furniture  and appliances in Dakar, while the Department of State and Peace Corps  maintain their own warehouses in the same compound in Banjul.

At the three embassies we visited in West Africa, we found that rightsizing  issues have not been systematically assessed as part of the embassy  management and planning process. However, The Department of State has  taken several steps that help lay the groundwork for such a process by  refining its overseas post MPP guidance. That guidance, applicable to  posts in all countries, was recently strengthened and now directs each  embassy to set five top priorities and link staffing and workload  requirements to fulfilling those priorities. Chiefs of Mission also certify  that the performance goals in their MPPs accurately reflect the highest  priorities of their embassies. This is consistent with questions in our  framework addressing program priorities. The guidance does not,  however, identify rightsizing as a management goal or explicitly discuss  how rightsizing issues of security, mission, cost, and options should be  addressed.
