Failure to reach any agreement at the last WTO ministerial meeting in Cancun, Mexico, in September 2003, put the talks behind schedule and threatened the outcome; however, talks resumed in 2004, and a new ministerial conference will convene in Hong Kong in December 2005.

Since this breakthrough, negotiations are picking up momentum, as WTO members are working toward deadlines for more detailed agreements at the December 2005 Hong Kong ministerial conference. Yet despite the improved negotiating atmosphere, the talks are behind schedule, and considerable work remains on the numerous issues that must constitute a final agreement. Progress has been uneven on the six negotiating issues identified as central to the Hong Kong meeting--agriculture, trade facilitation (customs reforms), industrial market access, services, WTO rules, and development issues. The United States has particular reform interests in the first four of these issues. Progress has occurred on two of them: in agriculture, based on agreements in the July framework, and trade facilitation, for which talks have finally been started. However, little progress has been made on industrial market access and services, two other issues of interest to the United States. Several factors could affect progress in the critical period leading up to the December 2005 Hong Kong ministerial. Achieving consensus among the WTO's 148 members is a challenging task, and diverse economic incentives and competing visions add complexity to the negotiations. Cooperation by the United States, the European Union, and some of the developing countries is also seen as key to a successful conclusion before U.S. Trade Promotion Authority expires in mid-2007, an implicit deadline for the talks."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. trade with members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) totaled  $2.1 trillion in 2004, accounting for almost one-fifth of U.S. gross domestic  product.

Officially known as the Doha  Development Agenda, the talks are being conducted under the auspices of  the WTO and are the latest in a series of negotiating \u201crounds\u201d among its  members, which now number 148 nations and customs territories. Past  GAO reports have highlighted the ambitious list of 19 substantive issues  being addressed in what is now known as the Doha Round and the  challenges WTO members have faced in making progress. Notably, the  failure of the September 2003 meeting of trade ministers at Cancun,  Mexico, set back the talks and made meeting the original January 2005  deadline for conclusion impossible. The President recently requested a 2-year extension of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) from Congress,  which streamlines congressional approval of trade agreements, for  purposes of pursuing a final Doha Round agreement, among others. TPA  legislation allows for such an extension unless a disapproval resolution is  passed by either House of Congress by June 30, 2005.

We also reviewed international tariff and trade  data from the WTO and the United Nations. We determined that these data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our analysis.

Based in Geneva, Switzerland, the  WTO administers agreed-upon rules for international trade, provides a  mechanism for settling disputes, and serves as a forum for conducting  trade negotiations. There are currently 148 WTO members, up from 90  GATT members when the Uruguay Round was launched in 1986 and from  128 members in 1995.", "The highest decision-making authority in the WTO is the ministerial  conference, which consists of trade ministers from all WTO members and  occurs every 2 years. The outcome of ministerial conferences is a  ministerial declaration that guides future work. The WTO General Council,  which consists of representatives from all WTO members, is empowered to  make decisions between ministerial conferences. Decisions in the WTO are  made by consensus\u2014or absence of dissent\u2014among all members rather  than a simple majority.", "At the fourth ministerial conference in Doha, Qatar, in November 2001,  WTO members reached consensus to launch a comprehensive negotiating  round, the Doha Development Agenda or Doha Round. The Doha Round is  the ninth round of trade liberalizing negotiations since the trading system\u2019s  founding in 1947. These rounds result in legally binding international  obligations on members both in terms of the trade barriers they are allowed  to maintain, such as tariffs (import taxes), and the trade rules (disciplines)  they are to abide by. Failure to comply is subject to binding dispute  settlement and possible trade retaliation. In the Doha ministerial  declaration, WTO members set a number of overall objectives for the  round, such as the need to ensure that developing countries, particularly  the least-developed, secure growth of world trade commensurate with their  needs for economic development (see fig. 1 for a list of the overall Doha  objectives). The declaration sets forth a work program that covers 19  negotiating areas, including agriculture, services, and market access for  nonagricultural goods (also known as industrial market access). Within  each of those areas, WTO members set specific goals. WTO members also  established a Trade Negotiations Committee, chaired by the WTO Director  General, to oversee the round\u2019s progress. Because the Doha Round is a  package, or \u201csingle undertaking\u201d in WTO parlance, simultaneous agreement  on all issues is required to finalize an agreement.", "In negotiating the Doha Round on behalf of the United States, the Office of  the United States Trade Representative (USTR) is also guided by certain  goals, notably the goals outlined by the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)  granted by Congress in 2002. TPA\u2019s goals for USTR negotiators include  overall and principal objectives and promotion of certain priorities. In  addition to TPA, USTR has its own goals for the Doha Round outlined in a  required official notification to Congress in November 2002. (See fig. 1 for  a description of the TPA and USTR goals.) In general, USTR states that it  plans to use the Doha Round negotiations to strengthen the multilateral  trading system, improve the operation of the WTO, and liberalize  international markets. USTR places special emphasis on creating new  export opportunities for the United States in agriculture, manufacturing,  and services. USTR must explain how any resulting agreement makes  progress towards TPA goals when submitting it for consideration for  congressional approval under TPA\u2019s expedited approval procedures. TPA is  set to expire in mid-2005, but provides a procedure for the President to  request a one-time extension of the authority to July 1, 2007. The President  recently requested such an extension, which is automatic unless Congress  disapproves it by June 30, 2005.", "The Doha declaration also set several goals for the following ministerial  conference. However, at the ministerial conference held in Cancun,  Mexico, from September 10-14, 2003, WTO ministers were unable to  achieve these goals or to bridge wide, substantive differences on individual  negotiating issues. They concluded the unsuccessful conference with WTO  members sharply divided along North-South (developed-developing  country) lines and agreed only to continue consultations and convene a  meeting of the General Council by mid-December 2003 to take steps to  move the negotiations forward. As we noted in our January 2004 report,  the Doha Round of WTO negotiations had missed virtually all of the  established milestones for progress during its first two years. The  breakdown at Cancun threatened to derail the talks completely. The  December 2003 General Council meeting did not result in any agreements,  except to resume talks in early 2004. As a result, WTO negotiators missed  the original deadline of January 1, 2005, for concluding a Doha Round  agreement.

Active leadership by the United States and the European  Union (EU) proved essential to progress, as did a more interactive process  and hard bargaining. Former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick is  widely credited with taking the initiative to resume talks with a January  2004 letter to fellow trade ministers urging them to keep 2004 from being a  lost year for the WTO and suggesting various ways to make the agenda  more manageable. He followed up on the letter with extensive foreign  travel to meet with other WTO nations and rally support for resuming talks.  WTO Director-General Supachi also traveled extensively as part of an  active outreach effort to WTO member country officials.", "WTO members reactivated Doha negotiating groups in February 2004 with  new chairs intent on ensuring more fruitful member-to-member  discussions. Summing up the status after his visits with foreign officials,  Ambassador Zoellick concluded that a breakthrough on agriculture was  \u201cabsolutely the key\u201d to progress. WTO members undertook intensive  efforts to reach a breakthrough on agriculture both in Geneva and at high- level meetings among key nations. Observers credited the EU Trade  Commissioner Lamy\u2019s offer in May to eliminate export subsidies with  providing a tangible incentive to reach agreement on agriculture. Several  conciliatory initiatives were also taken to allay specific developing country  concerns. For example, a workshop held in Benin emphasized the  importance of cotton reform to growth and poverty reduction in Africa. To  alleviate poorer countries\u2019 concerns over adjustment costs that were  holding back overall trade liberalization, the EU suggested the WTO\u2019s  poorest members in Africa and elsewhere should be offered the \u201cRound for  Free\u201d\u2014that is, they would benefit from others\u2019 concessions without having  to offer much if anything in return. The offer sparked a debate over this  differentiation by making it clear that the EU felt the Doha Round offered,  and expected, more of other developing countries.", "Developing countries also took on leadership roles and actions that  contributed to progress. After Cancun, there was skepticism in some  quarters as to whether the newly-created coalitions of developing countries  would be able to maintain cohesion and play constructive roles. However,  according to other participants, throughout 2004, these groups articulated  their positions clearly and negotiated effectively with other groups,  including the industrialized countries. For example, the group of populous  developing countries with agricultural interests known as the Group of 20  (G-20) issued a late May paper setting forth principles to govern tariff cuts  to help bridge wide differences in agricultural market access. Malaysia  played a key role in shaping the novel terms for trade facilitation  negotiations.", "The WTO negotiating process also became more effective, contributing to  progress. In our last report, we noted that the WTO\u2019s large number of  members made formal gatherings increasingly ineffective and more  suitable for speech-making or restating well-known-positions than for  advancing the negotiations. Moreover, members often focused their efforts  toward influencing the negotiating group chairmen, rather than other  members. In early 2004, a series of mini-ministerials and other smaller,  informal group meetings were used to foster direct interaction between  members and became the real venues for moving the negotiations forward.  Negotiating groups on specific issues also adopted informal meetings that  featured more direct member-to-member dialogue rather than the prior  chair-driven process.", "Yet, leadership and process improvements alone were not sufficient to  attain agreement. Hard work and willingness to compromise were also  required. The wide remaining gaps on agriculture and unrealized demands  on other issues were apparent at a late June 2004 meeting of the WTO  Trade Negotiations Committee. WTO Director General Supachai  Panitchpadki urged members then, and at a ministerial among African  nations shortly thereafter in Mauritius, to seize the opportunity before  them and show the flexibility required to seal a deal. With the July 16  release of a draft text, 2 weeks of day-and-night negotiating\u2014often in  intensive small group settings\u2014were begun. An ad hoc group called the  Five Interested Parties (or Group of Five)\u2014composed of five key players in  agriculture\u2014was critically important in bridging developed/developing  country differences and shaping agreement (even though some members,  such as the Group of 10 net agricultural importers, complained about being  left out of these deliberations). Finally, on July 31, 2004, WTO members  reached a deal on a framework agreement and adopted it formally at a  WTO General Council meeting.", "The main features of the July framework agreement were: establishing key  principles for each aspect of global agricultural trade reform, launching  negotiations to clarify and improve WTO rules on customs procedures  (trade facilitation), identifying the key elements of negotiations to improve  industrial (nonagricultural) market access, and stressing the importance of  liberalizing access to services markets and addressing outstanding  development concerns. It also set a notional December 2005 date for the  next WTO ministerial in Hong Kong but did not set a new deadline for  concluding the Doha Round.

Finalizing  modalities is also an important interim step before concrete negotiations  can occur among WTO members. WTO members had hoped that by mid- July 2005 they would be able to get a sense of how well their balance of  issue interests are being met through such means as producing a \u201cfirst  approximation\u201d of the relevant texts or conducting stocktaking meetings  on negotiating progress. However, at a late April 2005 TNC meeting WTO  Director-General Supachai expressed concern about meeting these goals,  noting that across the board progress has fallen short of what is required.  He urged greater unity of purpose and warned that without better progress,  WTO members could be facing major problems for Hong Kong. At an early  May 2005 meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) in Paris, ministers called for a heightened sense of  urgency in the negotiations and expedited preparations for the Hong Kong  conference.

Third, U.S. and  EU cooperation remains pivotal, but leadership transitions may change  relationships. Fourth, analysts agree that action on high-profile WTO  dispute settlement cases such as trade remedies and cotton could prove  important to ongoing negotiations.

Several experts and negotiating participants told us  that the scope of work remaining is considerable and that the current  round is more complex than past rounds because the number of countries  actually participating is larger and the issues are, in some sense, unfinished  work from prior negotiations. The fact that agriculture had not been  addressed for most of the trading system\u2019s first half century was cited  frequently as evidence of its thorny nature. The last (Uruguay) round  succeeded in the complex challenge of adding agriculture, services, and  intellectual property rights to the trading system for the first time. The  Doha Round is ambitious because it aims to cut subsidies and trade  barriers from the Uruguay Round\u2019s high levels. In industrial goods, the  Doha goal of having all members conform to specific methods for  liberalizing tariffs on all products differs from past practice of relying  primarily on member-to-member bargaining to secure tariff cuts. (Past  practice did result in substantial liberalization, but left in place high  barriers on some goods and in some countries.)", "The diversity of economic costs and benefits also makes the task complex.  Studies emphasize that both developed and developing countries are  positioned to benefit from the Doha Round, but individual countries face  varying economic incentives that could affect their willingness to  compromise on issues at the Hong Kong ministerial. The Doha talks have  been fueled by the premise that international trade can positively benefit a  country\u2019s overall growth and development. As discussed more fully in  appendix V, a number of expert studies have emerged in response to the  negotiations that estimate potential worldwide economic gains exceeding  $100 billion under an ambitious liberalization scenario. However, the  distribution of economic gains may vary within and between countries,  creating perceived winners and losers. For example, several studies  estimate economic losses from agricultural liberalization for regions that  are large net importers of food, such as North Africa and the Middle East,  because the removal of developed country subsidies may increase world  food prices. Other experts point out that for countries receiving  preferential trade access the estimated economic benefits from worldwide  trade liberalization may not reflect export losses from erosion of those  preferences. Potential losses in tariff revenue may also be a concern to  certain developing countries that heavily rely on trade taxes for  government financing. In April 2004, to assist developing countries with  potential adjustment costs to trade liberalization, the IMF introduced a new  lending program called the Trade Integration Mechanism (TIM)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maturing of Country Coalitions May Facilitate Progress, but Differences in Visions between Developing and Developed Countries Persist", "paragraphs": ["Coalitions of WTO members have been a factor in both leading and  preventing movement forward in the Doha negotiations.

Since then, country coalitions have matured and now advance  common priorities of many types. See appendix VI for a depiction of some  major groups of countries and their negotiating interests. Developing  countries in particular have become more active and influential, according  to various participants. A number of ad hoc groups have arisen around  other issues. For example, the Colorado Group has led discussion on trade  facilitation issues; a variety of \u201cfriends\u201d groups have formed to advocate  positions in the services negotiations; and the Friends of Antidumping  Negotiations group has pressed for changes in the antidumping agreement.  This mode of operations has been particularly valuable to developing  country members, which sometimes cannot afford to maintain enough staff  in Geneva to attend all negotiating sessions that interest them. By reaching  an agreement on negotiating proposals within groups, coalitions also help  to overcome the difficulty of creating consensus in an organization as large  as the WTO. By the same token, they may strengthen opposition to  proposals that some members might not otherwise care about. Country  coalitions also have other drawbacks, according to several participants\u2014 they cannot be relied on exclusively as interlocuters because country  interests vary and not every country is included; internal communication is  critical, but sometimes breaks down; and coalitions\u2019 efforts to forge  common positions may leave little room for negotiating maneuver.", "Developing countries are not monolithic in their interests, but there is still  some evidence that developing and developed countries have competing  visions of Doha Development Round\u2019s promise and that satisfying  developing country\u2019s expectations may be difficult--factors we identified as  challenges in prior reports.

In recent years the European Union spent just over half of  what it is permitted to spend on these trade-distorting domestic supports,  and its actual spending has declined.", "By contrast, trade experts and officials told us that other countries are  concerned about U.S. domestic subsidy programs due to the United States\u2019  trend of increased spending. The United States has supplied official WTO  notifications through 2001 that indicate its Amber Box program spending  was within established WTO limits, but its actual spending in Amber Box  supports grew from $6.2 billion in 1995 to $15.6 billion in 2001, the most  recent year data are available.", "Furthermore, as we reported in our January 2004 report, the 2002 Farm  Bill could increase U.S. agricultural support spending and shift its  composition.

As a result, the  United States has pushed in the WTO Doha Round for a redefinition of the  WTO Blue Box, in which it currently does not spend \u2013 so that as long as the  Blue Box exists it has greater flexibility to allow access for other programs  that are less trade- distorting to count against its current, unused ceiling for  this category of domestic supports.", "The July framework language regarding the Blue Box was favorable to the  United States, trade officials and experts told us. It redefines the Blue Box  to allow direct payments that do not require production limitations if  based on certain criteria. This has met with sharp resistance from the G-20  and other WTO members that seek significant reductions in all forms of  trade-distorting domestic supports. These members are concerned that by  allowing the United States to place its countercyclical payments in the  redefined Blue Box, the United States will not be forced to reduce its trade- distorting domestic support programs and could in fact increase its total  sum of trade-distorting domestic support. As recently as March 2005, the G-20 called for further disciplines on price-linked supports in the  provisionally redefined Blue Box to allow the compensations for some, but  not all, of the difference between market and target prices, among other  proposals.", "The July framework calls for a cap on the Blue Box of 5 percent of the  production value, with historical spending patterns to be determined as a  base. This could affect the European Union, trade officials and experts told  us, which in 2001 spent 23.7 billion euros in Blue Box supports, or 9.6  percent of its total agricultural production.", "To ensure ambitious cuts in domestic support, the July framework also  calls for a substantial reduction in overall trade-distorting support,  specifically the sum of Amber Box spending as measured by \u201cFinal Bound  Total AMS,\u201d Blue Box payments, and de minimis programs\u2014with a 20  percent cut to be made in that total in the first year of implementation.  However, the specific extent of reductions was left to future negotiations.", "Finally, on non- or minimally trade-distorting \u201cGreen Box\u201d domestic  supports, the framework called for a review, but not a capping or cut of  these supports. The G-20 has charged that certain current Green Box direct  payments to producers contradict the Green Box criteria of being non- or  minimally trade-distorting. The United States and the European Union have  resisted caps and cuts, but agreed to examine concerns about abuse. The  United States spent about $51 billion in these types of supports, according  to its 2001 notification to the WTO, the most recent year that data are  available."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Market Access", "paragraphs": ["Market access remains the most difficult pillar of the negotiations, country  officials and experts told us. Major agricultural exporters including  Canada, Australia, and Brazil want to expand their overseas markets.

The United States has conditioned domestic  support cuts on gains in market access. However, many developing  countries have resisted liberalization, arguing they do not have the means  to subsidize exports or domestic production, and that tariffs are their only  source of leverage and protection in the agricultural negotiations.", "Though the July 2004 framework states that a numerical formula will be  used to cut tariffs from current bound rates, countries differ strongly over  the type of formula they prefer. The methodology for converting specific  tariffs into ad valorem equivalents, upon which the tariff reduction  formula would be applied, also frustrated progress in the market access  negotiations for months. Such differences are based on the widely  divergent tariff profiles among WTO members. Specifically, several studies  by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the  World Bank find that for agricultural goods, developed countries tend to  have lower average bound and applied tariffs. However, developed  countries have a greater percentage of specific (non-ad valorem) tariffs and  tariff peaks. The products where developed countries have specific tariffs  tend to be those with high levels of protection and the products where they  have tariff peaks tend to be those of export interest to developing  countries. In contrast, developing countries have uniformly higher bound  tariffs, though currently applied tariff rates tend to be far lower than bound  tariff rates and specific tariffs are rare. To illustrate these different tariff  profiles, table 1 provides agricultural goods weighted average tariff rates  for a selected set of countries and products. Due to member differences  over the methodology for calculating ad valorem equivalents, the data  excludes specific tariffs.", "In line with these general patterns, the table shows that developed country  members such as the United States, the European Union, and Japan have  relatively low average bound and applied ad valorem tariff rates that range  from around 2 percent to 7 percent. However, by excluding specific tariff  rates, the table does not show the full extent to which these countries  protect their agricultural sectors. According to the World Bank, the  European Union, for example, has specific tariff rates on 44 percent of its  agricultural product lines. A 2001 study by the U.S. Department of  Agriculture employed a certain methodology for converting ad valorem  equivalents and estimated that the non-trade weighted average tariff rate  for agricultural goods in the United States, the EU, and Japan was 12  percent, 30 percent, and 58 percent respectively. Additionally, for the  example products of dairy, fruits and nuts, and tobacco, the United States,  the European Union, and Japan have relatively high tariffs and a large share  of international peaks. The United States\u2019 average tariffs in the tobacco  sector are extremely high, at around 71 percent.", "Developing countries such as India, Indonesia, Kenya, and Venezuela have  much higher average bound tariffs, ranging from 54 percent in Indonesia to  126 percent in India. However, in each of these cases, there are substantial  gaps between the bound and applied tariff rates.", "The contrast between developed and developing country tariff profiles has  fueled a sharp debate on what formula to use to conduct tariff reduction,  country officials and trade experts told us. Some developed countries,  including the United States, have advocated for a harmonizing formula  called a Swiss formula, that would reduce high tariffs by a larger  percentage than low tariffs. Developing countries and, particularly net- exporters such as Brazil with high bound tariffs want more flexibility than  the Swiss formula would offer. As an alternative, they advocate a banded  approach, which divides tariffs into a series of bands and applies an  average tariff reduction within each band. The banded approach would  apply larger reductions to higher tariff bands\u2014thereby addressing  developed country tariff peaks \u2013 but would be less harmonizing than a  Swiss formula. A formula that combines elements of both Swiss formula  reductions and linear reductions is a blended approach.", "The United States was among a handful of nations that in June 2004 penned  and circulated a draft market access white paper attempting to strike a  compromise. The paper called for a different type of a tiered formula  approach, where within each band a certain percentage of bound tariffs  would be cut by a Swiss (harmonizing) formula and a certain percentage of  bound tariffs would be cut by a linear percentage. A certain number of  tariff lines would be exempt from either a Swiss or linear cut. Instead,  liberalization would be handled through tariff rate quota increases. This in  effect allows member countries to shield themselves from substantial  reduction commitments for certain products by self-designating them as  \u201csensitive products.\u201d", "Continued disagreement on the tariff reduction formula is significant  because variations in the type of formula could result in widely different  results. Recent studies indicate that for developed countries, the banded  approach reduces applied tariff rates in some instances more than the  blended approach. These studies further indicate that the blended  approach could have a greater impact in reducing bound rates in  developing countries due to the homogeneity of their bound rates at  relatively high levels. However, irrespective of the type of tariff reduction  formula chosen, the degree of liberalization will strongly be affected by the  degree of ambition within the formula, as determined by the coefficients,  and by the exceptions to the formula through sensitive product  designation.", "Negotiators had hoped to agree on the formula to cut tariffs in July 2004 but  were unable to do so. Instead, they agreed that (1) the future formula will  be a single approach for developed and developing countries; (2) the future  formula will be tiered, with progressive reductions achieved through  deeper cuts in higher tariffs; and (3) all WTO members will have some  flexibilities in applying cuts to sensitive products that will be used in the  future. Under the framework, increased market access on sensitive  products will be achieved through expanded tariff quota rates and tariff  reductions.", "Sensitive products and special products\u2014whereby developing countries  are allowed to declare additional products exempt from standard  reductions under certain criteria, such as rural development or food  security needs\u2014are likely to be among the most contentious battles going  forward, trade officials and experts told us.

To achieve this  result, the United States, the EU, and other developed country members, as  well as some developing country members that have autonomously  liberalized in the past, continue to support a Swiss-type formula \u2013 a  harmonizing nonlinear formula that would reduce high tariffs by a larger  percentage than low tariffs. Such a formula would also address tariff peaks  and escalation.  To account for special and differential  treatment, the United States has proposed that developing countries could  apply a different coefficient within the Swiss formula than developed  countries, implying more moderate liberalization. The EU and Norway have  proposed a \u201ccredit-based approach\u201d where the flexibility in the formula  coefficient for developing countries would be determined uniquely for each  country based on credits for commitment to apply the formula without  exception or participation in sector agreements, for example.", "In contrast, some developing countries emphasize that due to their higher  average tariff rates, harmonizing formulas that reduce higher tariffs more  than lower tariffs would result in greater percentage cuts for developing  countries than developed countries\u2014a result that they argue contradicts  the principle of special and differential treatment. As such, they continue to  support a Girard type formula\u2014a non linear formula proposed by the  former Chair of the industrial market access negotiating group that is based  on each country\u2019s average tariff rate and allows countries with higher initial  tariffs to reduce those tariffs at a lesser rate than countries with lower  initial tariffs.

Developing countries stand  to receive gains from trade liberalization due to the fact that developed  countries often have pockets of high average tariffs on products that  developing countries tend to export.

For  countries that are dependent on tariff revenues to finance government  operations, the tax burden on importers who pay those tariffs may be  relatively high compared with the burden on consumers or domestic  industries that pay consumption or production taxes. As tariffs are  reduced through trade liberalization, tariff revenues may also be  reduced if there is not a sufficient increase in the quantity of imports in  response to lower tariff rates. In such cases, the burden of financing  government operations may shift away from traders and toward non- traders within an economy. For African least-developed countries that,  on average, rely on tariffs for 34 percent of government revenue, the  potential distributional consequences from lower trade taxes is likely to  be an important adjustment cost to trade liberalization."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Trade Negotiating Interests and Affiliations of Leading Merchandise Exporters", "paragraphs": ["Exports by Sector (%)", "Top 50 merchandise  exporters in 2003 (in rank  order of dollars exported)", "X (Continued From Previous Page)", "Exports by Sector (%)", "Top 50 merchandise  exporters in 2003 (in rank  order of dollars exported)", "C(m)", "Non-WTO members are shaded.", "X* indicates that the country participated in the group or the action as a member of the European  Union.", "Other members of the Cairns Group are Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, New Zealand,  Paraguay, and Uruguay.", "Other members of the G-20 are Bolivia, Cuba, Egypt, Pakistan, Paraguay, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe.", "Other members of the G-10 are Bulgaria, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Mauritius.", "Other members of the G-33 are Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, Benin, Botswana, Congo,  Cote D'Ivoire, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Kenya,  Mauritius, Madagascar, Mongolia, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, Senegal, St.  Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sri Lanka, Suriname, Tanzania,Trinidad  and Tobago, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.", "C indicates that Turkey is a candidate for membership in the European Union."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Michelle Munn, Kendall  Schaefer, Emilie Cassou, Ann Baker, Mark Keenan, Jose Martinez-Fabre,  Jonathan Rose, Jamie McDonald, and Ernie Jackson made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
