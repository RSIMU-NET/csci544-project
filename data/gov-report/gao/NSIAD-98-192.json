The World Bank, the oldest and largest of the multilateral development banks, was the focal point for much of this criticism. Several World Bank projects became the targets of highly publicized international campaigns aimed at convincing officials to withdraw bank support. Two examples\u2014both the subject of congressional inquiries\u2014were the following: The Polonoroeste Project: This project, which received major World Bank support beginning in 1982, encouraged impoverished Brazilians to take up farming in a previously inaccessible area of the Amazon basin. In 1985, the Bank suspended payments to Brazil when it became clear that the region\u2019s soils could not actually support farming and that, rather then alleviating poverty, the project was resulting in environmental destruction and maltreatment of local indigenous people. Bank support for development in the region was renewed after the adoption of measures to protect the environment and local peoples.", "The Sardar Sarovar Dam: In 1985, the World Bank committed to supporting this project\u2014a portion of a larger Indian government plan for developing the Narmada River basin\u2014even though a full assessment of the project\u2019s likely environmental and social impacts had not been completed. The Bank ceased supporting the project in 1993, after years of controversy centering on the forced relocation of tens of thousands of people and the publication of an independent assessment that found substantial flaws in both project preparation and implementation.", "Concern about such projects prompted Congress to convene a series of hearings on the environmental impacts of bank-supported projects. One Senate report resulting from these hearings concluded that the banks had not \u201cadequately considered the potential unacceptable environmental consequences of many of the projects that are selected for funding\u201d before deciding to proceed. These inquiries and other critiques provided the impetus for the introduction of bank policies requiring environmental assessments (EA) on proposed projects. Figure 1.1 describes the EA process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Project Development Process", "paragraphs": ["Throughout most of their existence, the banks imposed few requirements on project sponsors (borrowing government agencies or private companies) regarding public consultation on proposed projects. The banks also made few provisions themselves to permit or elicit public involvement in bank decisions on whether to support sponsor proposals. The extent of public consultation in decision-making was regarded as lying within the discretion of individual borrowing governments. The banks themselves did not, as a rule, independently engage the public in dialogue on proposed projects. When working with private companies, the banks also cited the need to safeguard information submitted by these companies so as not to compromise their competitive positions as a reason for limiting public involvement in project development. Bank critics said that the relatively closed nature of the processes the banks used to develop projects was an important cause of unsatisfactory project results. While these processes differ in many details, the banks employ a broadly similar procedure for developing project plans. This process is outlined in figure 1.2.", "Bank critics raised two distinct but interrelated problems with the banks\u2019 project development processes. These were inadequate consultation and a lack of transparency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consultation", "paragraphs": ["Bank critics believed that greater public consultation was needed throughout project preparation.

Bank critics noted that project sponsors often did not conduct meaningful consultations with those who would likely be directly affected by the proposed project and other concerned members of the public (for example, local nongovernmental organizations\u2014NGO). The lack of consultation during the early phases of project development (including EA preparation) was of particular concern, as opportunities for the public to affect project designs are greater in these early phases, when alternative designs and approaches can still be explored at comparatively little cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transparency", "paragraphs": ["The banks critics\u2019 main concern about bank transparency was that there was almost no access to EA reports for proposed projects. Critics believed that interested members of the public, both within borrowing countries and in the broader community, should have access to these documents in advance of final action by the banks\u2019 boards of executive directors. This access would permit them to review the EA reports\u2019 content and bring matters of concern to the attention of bank staff, project sponsors, and/or executive directors.", "Bank guidelines did not provide for making such information available for public review before projects were taken up by the executive directors. The banks did not require project sponsors to share information on such matters, nor did the banks themselves provide public access to EA reports or related documents through either their headquarters offices or their field offices in borrowing countries. Critics contended that this limited the banks\u2019 accountability to the public. They said that because of this lack of transparency, neither citizens in borrowing countries, international NGOs with expertise on environmental and social issues, nor officials of the banks\u2019 member countries were able to critique EA reports or raise concerns that may not have been adequately examined or addressed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Action", "paragraphs": ["While the United States cannot unilaterally mandate changes in bank policies and procedures, it has historically exercised considerable influence over bank operations.

Since 1985, Congress has repeatedly called upon the Department and the U.S. executive directors to work for changes in bank policies and procedures that would improve the manner in which environmental impacts are taken into account during project development. Among other things, Congress instructed the U.S. executive directors to seek improvements in bank guidelines regarding (a) the steps that project sponsors take to engage in meaningful consultation with peoples whom the projects might affect and other concerned members of the public during project preparation and (b) the steps that the banks themselves take to improve transparency. In 1987, Congress enacted legislation calling upon U.S. executive directors to vigorously promote participation by borrowing country NGOs at all stages of preparation for loans that may have adverse environmental or sociocultural impacts.", "In 1989, the \u201cPelosi Amendment\u201d instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to seek, through negotiations with other bank member countries and bank management, the adoption of policies and procedures within the banks that would (a) provide interested members of the public in all bank member countries with access to EA reports on proposed projects (or summaries thereof) at least 120 days prior to board action and (b) encourage public participation in reviewing project-specific environmental issues.", "The amendment\u2019s legislative history emphasized the important role that international NGOs play in facilitating thorough public review of proposed bank projects.

The Agency\u2019s written comments, reproduced in appendix III, provide details on the legal provisions in question and the efforts that the Agency has undertaken in response.", "The Pelosi Amendment sought to bring U.S. influence to bear in favor of effective implementation of such policies by barring U.S. executive directors from voting in favor of certain proposed actions. U.S. executive directors were called upon to refrain from supporting projects that would have significant impacts on the environment unless project sponsors had prepared EA reports and made the reports\u2014or summaries thereof\u2014available for review by affected groups and local NGOs, as well as bank staff and executive directors, for at least 120 days before the executive directors vote on the proposed actions. It also required the Secretary of the Treasury, in his role as leader of the U.S. government\u2019s interagency process for reviewing proposed loans, to take public comments on environmental matters into consideration in determining the position that the United States should take on proposed loans.", "In November 1997, Congress amended the International Financial Institutions Act to make clear that the Secretary of the Treasury should regard the Pelosi Amendment as applying to U.S. participation in the International Finance Corporation\u2014a member of the World Bank Group that works exclusively with private sector partners\u2014as well as to U.S. participation in the banks\u2019 lending programs for developing country governments.

Our study included the World Bank, the Inter-American and Asian Development Banks, and the International Finance Corporation.Together, these four institutions receive approximately 90 percent of the amounts that Congress annually appropriates for the support of the multilateral development banks. As an agency of the United States, we have no direct authority to review the operations of the multilateral development banks. Through the Department of the Treasury and the staffs of the U.S. executive directors in each institution, however, we interviewed bank staff at all levels, including the presidents of the World and Inter-American Development Banks, and obtained official bank documents and reports.", "To describe the banks\u2019 steps to ensure consultation and transparency, we reviewed bank documents and guidance and met with bank staff to gain an understanding of their guidance with regard to public consultation and the systems they have established to provide broad public access to bank documents.", "To evaluate the quality of public consultation, we developed rating criteria based on the banks\u2019 guidance on public consultation and environmental assessment, as well as other relevant materials, such as bank studies on best practices. These criteria provided a framework for assessing project sponsor consultation practices, including the extent to which  (a) concerned members of the public were informed about proposed projects, (b) public concerns were identified, and, subsequently (c) opportunities were provided for public comment on the manner in which public concerns had been addressed. The criteria also provided a framework for evaluating the measures that were adopted to respond to public concerns identified through the consultation process. We applied these criteria to a group of 44 out of 256 projects with significant environmental implications (generally referred to as category A and B projects) in Latin American and Asia that were submitted for approval by the banks\u2019 boards of executive directors during calendar year 1996. (See fig. 1.4 for a description of project categories.)", "To evaluate the impact that the banks had on the consultation practices employed on these projects, we employed a computational matrix that took into consideration the extent to which these projects employed practices that were upgraded from local norms and the extent to which these improvements could be directly linked to bank involvement. Our findings from this portion of the review apply only to the projects included in the sample.", "To assess bank transparency during project development\u2014that is, the extent to which the banks provide timely public access to information on proposed projects\u2014we obtained data on access to (a) project profiles and (b) EA reports between mid-1996 and mid-1997 via the banks\u2019 internet home pages. Although the banks have adopted policies and procedures that are intended to provide public access to project documents (in hard copy) through their headquarters and field offices, we did not assess document availability at these locations. Instead, we focused on the banks\u2019 internet home pages to provide a single, unified overview of bank performance in providing worldwide access to information on proposed projects.", "The banks have each established their own requirements regarding timeliness for providing public access to EA reports. We report each bank\u2019s performance against its own criteria. The Pelosi Amendment, a U.S. law, does not create a direct legal obligation for the banks but does instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to seek, through negotiation with other bank member countries and bank management, the adoption of policies and procedures that will result in interested members of the public in all bank member countries having access to EA reports at least 120 days before board consideration. Therefore, for comparative purposes, we also report on whether the banks\u2019 internet home pages met this time frame.", "Our methodology is discussed in more detail in appendix I.", "We conducted our work from January 1997 to June 1998 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "We received written comments on a draft of this report from the Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and the World Bank.

These steps have included (1) developing guidelines for consultation, including the preparation of environmental assessments; (2) hiring staff to improve the banks\u2019 capacity to undertake consultation; (3) developing working relationships with NGOs; and (4) placing a priority on developing environmentally and socially sustainable projects.

It required sponsors to complete EAs when appropriate (that is, when the nature and magnitude of a project\u2019s potential impacts appear to require systematic examination) as part of their project proposals. In doing such assessments, and in implementing projects, the policy required project sponsors to \u201ctake the views of affected groups and local NGOs fully into account.\u201d", "The other banks subsequently adopted similar policies and procedures. In 1990, the International Finance Corporation adopted its first environmental review procedure, which was intended to be consistent with World Bank procedures. Also in 1990, the Inter-American Development Bank adopted procedures calling for public consultation in preparing the terms of reference for project EAs (that is, specifying the assessment\u2019s scope and objectives) and in reviewing the results of the EA process. The Inter-American Development Bank also issued guidance that established a policy framework for assessing the environmental and sociocultural impacts of proposed projects, including the need for public consultation on these issues. In 1997, the Inter-American Development Bank adopted new procedures for evaluating social and environmental impacts through an internal bank Committee on the Environment and Social Impact. In 1993, the Asian Development Bank adopted EA procedures and requirements for public consultation similar to those adopted by the World Bank. Each of the banks has added to these basic policy statements with additional clarification and advice for both staff and project sponsors.", "Bank guidance generally advises project sponsors to provide concerned members of the public with relevant information (for example, a description of the project and its likely beneficial and adverse impacts) before asking for comments. International Finance Corporation guidelines, for example, note that truly meaningful public consultation can only take place when project sponsors have first provided affected groups and other interested parties with substantive information on the proposed project.

By mid-1997, 20 of the World Bank\u2019s 49 country directors were based in field missions. The World Bank also created an internal Environmentally and Socially Sustainable Development Network, including a corps of over 360 social development and environmental specialists, a number of whom are now stationed overseas.", "The Inter-American Development Bank has also taken some steps to augment its consultation capabilities, including increasing the number of staff dealing with these issues.

On almost all projects, sponsors addressed public concerns through actions such as relocating pipelines or modifying resettlement plans. Several factors contributed to the quality of consultation on the projects we examined.

Officials charged with project implementation credited bank staff with introducing mechanisms for engaging concerned members of the public that had not previously been employed in their ministries but that worked very well in practice.", "Project documents showed that International Finance Corporation intervention in one project in rural Asia had a very great impact on both the process and the measures taken to respond to identified concerns. In this case, neither an EA nor consultation was required by the government. However, the Corporation required that an EA be conducted and that the results be made available for public review. The Corporation was also instrumental in changing the proposed project site to avoid disrupting existing cultivation sites.", "On several projects, bank staff indicated that they had suggested innovative approaches to overcome local barriers to effective consultation. One example was a World Bank-supported effort directed at providing small-scale infrastructure for a number of isolated communities populated largely by illiterate people. This project employed a variety of unconventional communication techniques, including dramatic presentations, to effectively inform residents about the proposal.", "In several instances, the banks placed conditions on loans to ensure that the sponsors addressed the concerns raised by members of the public.

About 8 percent of the reports for category A World Bank projects in our sample were posted on the Bank\u2019s home page in the required time. Forty-six percent were not posted at all. Most Asian Development Bank reports for category A projects were posted in the required time. The International Finance Corporation met its 60-day standard for the sample of category A projects we examined. EA reports for Inter-American Development Bank projects were made available in the borrowing country in all cases, though about 33 percent of the reports were not made available for the required time.", "Table 4.3 shows the performance of the banks\u2019 internet home pages in providing access to EA reports for proposed category A projects, using the 120-day time frame advanced by the Pelosi Amendment for comparative purposes.", "The banks generally met their own requirements with regard to providing access to information on EA reports on category B projects. However, these requirements contain several features that limit the timeliness of public access to this information. For example, the Asian Development Bank divides category B projects into \u201csensitive\u201d and \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d subcategories. No information on EA results is provided on \u201cnon-sensitive\u201d projects until after the board has voted. The International Finance Corporation does not require that information on the results of category B project EA reports be posted until 30 days before board votes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The banks are not consistently meeting their goal of providing the public with timely access to key project information through the internet.
