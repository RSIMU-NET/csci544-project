A similar  provision was in effect for fiscal year 2014 funds, but it did not reference  the fully burdened cost of fuel, nor was the 10 percent notice requirement  included. DOD guidance also discusses consideration of cost with  regard to alternative fuel purchases for operational purposes, and DOD\u2019s  Operational Energy Strategy indicates that the department will acquire  such fuels for military operations at prices that are competitive with the  market price for conventional fuels. DOD has also recently issued  updated guidance establishing it is DOD\u2019s policy that alternative fuels for  operational purposes are purchased when cost-competitive with  traditional fuels and when qualified as compatible with existing equipment  and infrastructure.", "In December 2013, the Secretaries of the Departments of Agriculture and  the Navy announced an initiative, called Farm to Fleet, which is intended  to help the Department of the Navy meet its alternative fuels usage goals.  Related to this initiative, DOD intends to purchase, through its regular  domestic fuel purchases, Jet Propellant 5 jet and naval distillate fuels  meeting DOD\u2019s technical fuel specifications and that are blended with at  least 10 percent but no more than 50 percent alternative fuels\u2014 specifically biofuels\u2014for the Department of the Navy\u2019s use in military  operations. The Department of Agriculture plans, under the authority of  the Commodity Credit Corporation Charter Act, to contribute up to       $161 million to alternative fuel purchases to help defray some of the extra  costs\u2014which may include the costs of feedstocks\u2014that would have  caused the final alternative fuel to be more expensive than the price of  conventional fuels for DOD.  To be eligible for the Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Commodity Credit Corporation funding, the specific amounts  per gallon of which are provided in DOD\u2019s fuel solicitation documents, fuel  vendors have to provide an alternative fuel that was produced from an  approved domestic feedstock\u2014such as crop and tree residues,  algae/algal oil, or animal waste and by-products of animal waste.", "In the event of a contract award with fuel vendors providing alternative  fuels, the vendors would receive separate payments from the Department  of Agriculture\u2019s Commodity Credit Corporation and DOD. The Department  of Agriculture\u2019s Commodity Credit Corporation would pay the incentive  amount per gallon indicated in the solicitation to the fuel vendors in order  to help them defray some of their costs, including domestic feedstock  costs. DOD would pay the remainder of these alternative fuel vendors\u2019  prices. However, the incentive is not an additional sum paid to a fuel  vendor over and above the price submitted in its proposal, but rather  provides Commodity Credit Corporation funds to cover the portion of the  total submitted price that exceeds the price DOD would otherwise pay. In  no event would fuel vendors providing alternative fuels be paid more than  the price they submitted in their proposals. We note that such an  arrangement means that the cost of the alternative fuel to the federal  government as a whole may be higher than the cost of conventional fuel.  This is because, while DOD would be paying a price that is competitive  with the price of conventional fuel, the Department of Agriculture would be  paying an additional subsidy.", "DOD\u2019s first attempt to purchase alternative fuels for military operations,  through its large-scale fuel program, occurred in June 2014, when DOD  issued a solicitation, through its regular domestic large-scale fuel  purchase program for the Inland/East/Gulf Coast/Offshore region of the  United States, for the purchase of Jet Propellant-5 jet and naval distillate  fuels for which blended fuels with between 10 to 50 percent alternative  fuels were to be considered. The solicitation listed the estimated  maximum quantity of Jet Propellant-5 and naval distillate fuels as  approximately 392.5 million gallons. As such, the maximum amount of  biofuel to be blended into the desired fuel amount would be equivalent to  approximately 39 million gallons (at 10 percent blend) to 196 million  gallons (at 50 percent blend). The Department of Agriculture made  available approximately $27 million in Commodity Credit Corporation  funds to support successful biofuel contract awards. According to DOD  officials, proposals with biofuel bids for only naval distillate fuel but not Jet  Propellant-5 jet fuel were received. However, according to DOD officials,  none of the submitted proposals successfully met all of the technical  evaluation factors. The fuel contract awards under this solicitation were  announced on February 20, 2015. According to DOD officials, none were  for alternative fuels.", "DOD\u2019s second attempt to purchase alternative fuels for military  operations, through its large-scale fuel program, began in April 2015. At  that time, DOD issued a solicitation, through its regular domestic large- scale fuel purchase program for the Rocky Mountain/West  Coast/Offshore region of the United States, for the purchase of Jet  Propellant-5 jet and naval distillate fuels for which blended fuels with  between 10 to 50 percent alternative fuels were to be considered. The  solicitation listed the estimated maximum quantity of Jet Propellant-5 and  naval distillate fuels as approximately 290.6 million gallons. As such, the  maximum amount of biofuel to be blended into the desired fuel amount  would be equivalent to approximately 29 million gallons (at 10 percent  blend) to 145 million gallons (at 50 percent blend). The Department of  Agriculture has made available approximately $66 million in Commodity  Credit Corporation funds to support successful biofuel contract awards.  Fuel vendors had until May 18, 2015, to submit proposals, and DOD  plans to make contract awards before October 1, 2015.", "According to a Navy official, the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Commodity  Credit Corporation funds will not be available for DOD\u2019s regular fuel  purchase programs for the Atlantic/European/Mediterranean and Western  Pacific regions because those are international rather than domestic fuel  purchases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Used Defense Production Act Authorities in Collaboration with Private Industry to Promote Domestic Biofuel Production", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Defense Production Act Allows DOD to Provide Financial Incentives to Private Firms to Meet Critical National Defense Needs", "paragraphs": ["Title III of the Defense Production Act (DPA)\u2014Expansion of Productive  Capacity and Supply\u2014generally allows military and civilian agencies to  provide a variety of financial incentives to domestic firms to invest in  production capabilities, so as to ensure that the domestic industrial and  technological base is capable of meeting the national defense needs of  the United States.

The effort  would include the design, construction or retrofit, validation, qualification,  and operation of a domestic commercial-scale integrated biofuels  production enterprise.", "In June 2011, the Department of Agriculture, Department of Energy and  Department of the Navy signed a memorandum of understanding that  initiated a cooperative effort to assist in the development and support of a  sustainable commercial biofuels industry. This occurred in response to  the president\u2019s March 2011 Blueprint for a Secure Energy Future, which  challenged the Secretaries of these three departments to investigate how  they might work together to speed the development of drop-in biofuels  substitutes for diesel and jet fuel. The Blueprint noted that competitively  priced drop-in biofuels could help meet the fuel needs of the Navy, as well  as the commercial aviation and shipping sectors. The memorandum of  understanding explained that given the current economic environment,  significant start-up risks, and the competitive barriers posed by the firmly  established conventional fuels market, private industry would not assume  all of the uncertainty and risk associated with providing a commercially  viable production capability for drop-in biofuels. Accordingly, it was  necessary for the federal government to cooperate with industry to create  a strong demand signal and to make targeted investments to achieve the  necessary alternative fuels production capacity. The stated objective was  to construct or retrofit multiple domestic commercial- or pre-commercial- scale advanced drop-in biofuel plants and refineries. Specific  characteristics for these facilities include the capability to produce biofuels  meeting DOD\u2019s technical fuel specifications at a price that would be  competitive with conventional fuel, and that they would cause no  significant impact on the supply of agricultural commodities for the  production of food. Under the memorandum of understanding, the three  departments stated their intentions to equally contribute funding over a  period of 3 years.

According to DOD officials, an  interagency team was formed to review the responses and use the  findings as guidance to develop the requirements for the biofuel project.  In June 2012, DOD announced the initiation of and a solicitation for the  Advanced Drop-in Biofuels Production Project, which would provide  awards for biofuels production facilities over two phases. Phase I  awards would be for planning and preliminary designs for biofuel  production facilities; and Phase II awards would be for constructing,  commissioning, and performance testing of biofuel production facilities. In  January 2013, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics issued a determination that (1) an advanced  drop-in biofuels production capability is essential to the national defense;  and (2) without action under DPA authority, U.S. industry could not  reasonably be expected to provide the capability in a timely manner. This  written determination was submitted to relevant congressional  committees.

In  August 2014, three of the four Phase I awardees received Phase II  awards totaling $210 million, with private industry contributing funds for  the remainder of the costs (which are to be more than 50 percent). Phase  II awardees are currently performing activities in preparation for  constructing their biorefinery facilities, including conducting environmental  analyses and securing financing. According to DOD officials, DOD will  monitor the Phase II awardees by conducting biweekly teleconferences,  quarterly status reporting updates, and site visits. In general, monitoring  activities will monitor factors such as whether there are any changes to  the company\u2019s project scope, implementation, or timelines; and if the  company\u2019s amount of spending correlates to how much of the biofuel  production facility has been completed. As shown in Table 1 below, the  Phase II awardees will be making alternative fuel from different  production processes and deriving it from various feedstock sources.  According to DOD program officials, the Advanced Drop-in Biofuels  Production Project should provide, between 2017 to 2018, production  capacity for about 106 million gallons per year of alternative jet and naval  distillate fuels that meet DOD\u2019s technical fuel specifications and are  available at a price that is competitive with that of conventional fuels.", "DOD applied $100 million in fiscal year 2012 procurement funds to this  project. For fiscal year 2013, the explanatory statement for the  Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013, listed    $60 million for this project. The National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2013 provided that amounts made available to DOD under  the DPA for fiscal year 2013 for biofuels production could not be obligated  or expended for the construction of a biofuel refinery until matching  contributions were received from the Department of Energy and  equivalent contributions from the Department of Agriculture.
