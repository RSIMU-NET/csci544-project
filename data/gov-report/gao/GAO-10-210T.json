In June 2007, DHS announced its new financial management systems strategy, called the Transformation and Systems Consolidation (TASC) program. GAO's testimony provides preliminary analysis of the status of its prior recommendations and whether there were additional issues identified that pose challenges to the successful implementation of the TASC program. GAO reviewed relevant documentation, such as the January 2009 Request for Proposal and its attachments, and interviewed key officials to obtain additional information. GAO provided a draft report that this testimony is based on to DHS on September 29, 2009, for review and comment. After reviewing and considering DHS' comments, GAO plans to finalize and issue the report including providing appropriate recommendations aimed at improving the department's implementation of the TASC program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO's preliminary analysis shows that DHS has begun to take actions to implement four of the six recommendations made in the 2007 report; however, none of these recommendations have been fully implemented. GAO recognizes that DHS cannot fully implement some of the recommendations aimed at reducing the risk in accordance with best practices until the contract for TASC is awarded. DHS has taken, but not completed, actions to (1) define its financial management strategy and plan, (2) develop a comprehensive concept of operations, (3) incorporate disciplined processes, and (4) implement key human capital practices and plans for such a systems implementation effort. DHS has not taken the necessary actions on the remaining two recommendations, to standardize business processes across the department, including applicable internal control, and to develop detailed consolidation and migration plans since DHS will not know the information necessary to develop these items until a contractor is selected. While some of the details of the department's standardization of business processes and migration plans depend on the selected new system, DHS would benefit from performing critical activities, such as identifying all of its affected current business processes so that DHS can analyze how closely the proposed system will meet the department's needs. GAO's preliminary analysis during this review also identified two issues that pose challenges to the TASC program--DHS' significant risks related to the reliance on contractors to define and implement the new system and the lack of independence of the contractor hired to perform the verification and validation (V&V) function for TASC. DHS plans to rely on the selected contractor to complete key process documents for TASC such as detailed documentation that governs activities such as requirements management, testing, data conversion, and quality assurance. The extent of DHS' reliance on contractors to define and implement key processes needed by the TASC program, without the necessary oversight mechanisms to ensure that (1) the processes are properly defined and (2) effectively implemented, could result in system efforts plagued with serious performance and management problems. Further, GAO identified that DHS' V&V contractor was not independent with regard to the TASC program. DHS management agreed that the V&V function should be performed by an entity that is technically, managerially, and financially independent of the organization in charge of the system development and/or acquisition it is assessing. Accordingly, DHS officials indicated that they have restructured the contract to address our concerns by changing the organization that is responsible for managing the V&V function."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s (DHS) current effort\u2014the Transformation and Systems  Consolidation (TASC) program\u2014to implement a consolidated  departmentwide financial management system. Since DHS began  operations in March 2003, it has faced the daunting task of bringing  together 22 diverse agencies and developing an integrated financial  management system. DHS officials have long recognized the need to  integrate their financial management systems, which are used to account  for over $40 billion in annual appropriated funds. The department\u2019s prior  effort, known as the Electronically Managing Enterprise Resources for  Government Effectiveness and Efficiency (eMerge2) project, was  expected to integrate financial management systems departmentwide and  address existing financial management weaknesses. However, DHS  officials terminated the eMerge2 project in December 2005, acknowledging  that this project had not been successful. In June 2007, we reported the  department had made little progress since December 2005 in integrating its  existing financial management systems, and that, from an overall  perspective, the decision to halt its eMerge2 project was prudent. We  made six recommendations focused on the need for DHS to define a  departmentwide strategy and embrace disciplined processes to reduce risk  to acceptable levels.", "In June 2007, DHS officials announced its new financial management  systems strategy, called the TASC program. At that time, the TASC  program was described as the migration of other DHS component systems  to two existing financial management systems already in use at several  components. After a bid protest was filed regarding the proposed  approach, the TASC request for proposal was revised to acquire an  integrated commercial off-the-shelf software (COTS) system to be  implemented departmentwide. In January 2009 DHS issued its TASC  request for proposal for the provision of an integrated financial,  acquisition, and asset management commercial off-the-shelf software  (COTS) system already in use at a federal agency to be implemented  departmentwide. DHS is currently evaluating the proposals received and  expects to award a contract in January 2010.", "Today, our testimony will focus on our preliminary observations related to  our audit of (1) DHS\u2019 implementation of the six recommendations we  made in June 2007, and (2) two issues that have surfaced that pose  challenges to the TASC program. We have discussed the preliminary  observations included in this testimony with DHS officials. To address  these objectives, we reviewed the January 2009 request for proposal and  its attachments, such as the Statement of Objectives and Solution Process  Overview, to understand DHS\u2019 plans for implementing the TASC program.  We also reviewed other available planning documents, such as the  Acquisition Plan and the draft concept of operations, and determined the  status of these plans and others to see if DHS had fully implemented our  recommendations. We interviewed key officials from DHS\u2019 Office of the  Chief Financial Officer and its Resource Management Transformation  Office (RMTO), including its Director and Deputy Director for elaboration  and to provide additional perspectives to the information contained in  these documents. We also reviewed the Statement of Work for an  independent verification and validation (IV&V) contractor and confirmed  key information about this contract with the Director of RMTO.", "We recently provided our draft report, including recommendations, on the  results of our audit to the Secretary of Homeland Security for review and  comment. We plan to incorporate DHS\u2019 comments as appropriate and  issue our final report as a follow-up to this testimony. We conducted this  performance audit from March through October 2009 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

Figure 1 shows the key events that have occurred affecting  the TASC program. One of these key events was the filing of a bid protest  regarding DHS\u2019 initial TASC approach to migrate its components to two  financial management systems already in use. DHS subsequently issued its  January 2009 TASC request for proposal for the provision of an integrated  financial, acquisition, and asset management COTS system already in use  at a federal agency to be implemented departmentwide. A second bid  protest was filed over this January 2009 request for proposal and the U.S.  Court of Federal Claims dismissed the protestor\u2019s complaint, allowing  DHS to proceed with this request for proposal. However, the protestor  filed an appeal of this dismissal in July 2009.

DHS has defined its vision for the TASC program, which is to  consolidate and integrate departmentwide mission-essential financial,  acquisition, and asset management systems, by providing a seamless, real- time, web-based system to execute mission-critical end-to-end integrated  business processes. DHS has also established several major program goals  for TASC which include, but are not limited to:  creating and refining end-to-end standard business processes and a  standard line of accounting,  supporting timely, complete, and accurate financial management and  reporting,  enabling DHS to acquire goods and services of the best value that  ensure that the department\u2019s mission and program goals are met, and  enabling consolidated asset management across all components.", "DHS officials stated that this system acquisition is expected to take a  COTS-based system already configured and being used at a federal agency  as a starting point for its efforts. This approach is different than other  financial management system implementation efforts reviewed by GAO  where an agency acquired a COTS product and then performed the actions  necessary to configure the product to meet the agency\u2019s specific  requirements.", "Our review found that the strategy being taken by DHS does not contain  the elements needed to evaluate whether the acquired system will provide  the needed functionality or meet users\u2019 needs. For example, it does not  require DHS to (1) perform an analysis of the current processes to define  the user requirements to be considered when evaluating the various  systems, (2) perform a gap analysis before the system is selected and (3)  assess the extent to which the COTS-based system used at another agency  has been customized for the respective federal entities. Studies have  shown that when an effective gap analysis was not performed, program  offices and contractors later discovered that the selected system lacked  essential capabilities. Furthermore, adding these capabilities required  expensive custom development, and resulted in cost and schedule  overruns that could have been avoided. Without a comprehensive strategy  and plan that considers these issues, DHS risks implementing a financial  management system that will be unnecessarily costly to maintain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Recently Developed a Concept of Operations for the TASC Program", "paragraphs": ["The January 2009 request for proposal states that the selected contractor  will be required to provide a concept of operations for TASC. This concept  of operations is expected to provide an operational view of the new  system from the end users\u2019 perspective and outline the business processes  as well as the functional and technical architecture for their proposed  systems. On October 21, 2009, DHS provided us with a concept of  operations for the TASC program that we have not had the opportunity to  fully evaluate to assess whether it comprehensively describes the new  system\u2019s operations and characteristics. According to DHS officials, this  concept of operations document was prepared in accordance with the  Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards.  However, it is unclear how the DHS-prepared concept of operations  document will relate to the selected contractor\u2019s concept of operations  document called for in the request for proposal.", "According to the IEEE standards, a concept of operations is a user- oriented document that describes the characteristics of a proposed system  from the users\u2019 viewpoint. A concept of operations document also  describes the operations that must be performed, who must perform them,  and where and how the operations will be carried out. The concept of  operations for TASC should, among other things:    define how DHS\u2019 day-to-day financial management operations are and  will be carried out to meet mission needs;  clarify which component and departmentwide systems are considered  financial management systems;  include a transition strategy that is useful for developing an  understanding of how and when changes will occur;    develop an approach for obtaining reliable information on the costs of  its financial management systems investments; and  link DHS\u2019 concept of operations for the TASC program to its enterprise  architecture.", "A completed concept of operations prior to issuance of the request for  proposal would have benefited the vendors in developing their proposals  so that they could identify and propose systems that more closely align  with DHS\u2019 vision and specific needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Fully Incorporated Disciplined Processes into the TASC Program", "paragraphs": ["While DHS has draft risk management, project management, and  configuration management plans, DHS officials told us that other key  plans relating to disciplined processes generally considered to be best  practices will not be completed until after the TASC contract is awarded.

Offerors were instructed in the latest request for proposal to describe their  testing, risk management, and quality assurance approaches as well as  component migration and training approaches. The approaches proposed  by the selected contractor will become the basis for the preparation of  these plans.

The key to having a disciplined system development  effort is to have disciplined processes in multiple areas, including project  planning and management, requirements management, configuration  management, risk management, quality assurance, and testing. Effective  processes should be implemented in each of these areas throughout the  project life cycle because change is constant.

It is important for DHS to  identify all of its business processes so that the department can analyze  the offerors\u2019 proposed systems to assess how closely each of these  systems aligns with DHS\u2019 business processes. Such an analysis would  position DHS to determine whether a proposed system would work well in  its future environment or whether the department should consider  modifying its business processes. Without this analysis, DHS will find it  challenging to assess the difficulties of implementing the selected system  to meet DHS\u2019 unique needs.", "For the nine processes identified, DHS has not yet begun the process of  reengineering and standardizing those processes. DHS has asked offerors  to describe their proposed approaches for the standardization of these  nine processes to be included in the TASC system. According to an  attachment to the TASC request for proposal, there will be additional  unique business processes or sub-processes, beyond the nine standard  business processes identified, within DHS and its components that also  need to be supported by the TASC system. For DHS\u2019 implementation of the  TASC program, reengineering and standardizing these unique business  processes and sub-processes will be critical because the department was  created from 22 agencies with disparate processes. A standardized process  that addresses, for example, the procurement processes at the U.S. Coast  Guard, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and the Secret  Service, as well as the other DHS components, is essential when  implementing the TASC system and will be useful for training and the  portability of staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Not Yet Developed Plans for Migrating the New System to its DHS Components", "paragraphs": ["Although DHS officials have stated that they plan to migrate the new  system first to its smaller components and have recently provided a high- level potential approach it might use, DHS has not outlined a conceptual  approach or plan for accomplishing this goal throughout the department.

For example, a FEMA  official stated that the component has not replaced its outdated financial  management system because it is waiting for the implementation of the  TASC program. However, in the interim, FEMA\u2019s auditors are repeatedly  reporting weaknesses in its financial systems and reporting, an important  factor to be considered by DHS when preparing its migration plan.  Because of the known weaknesses at DHS components, it will important  for DHS to prioritize its migration of components to the new system and  address known weaknesses prior to migration where possible.

The purpose of the V&V function is to provide management with  objective insight into the program\u2019s processes and associated work  products. For example, the V&V contractor would review system strategy  documents that provide the foundation for the system development and  operations. According to industry best practices, the V&V activity should  be independent of the project and report directly to senior management to  provide added assurance that reported results on the project\u2019s status are  unbiased. An effective V&V review process should provide an objective  assessment to DHS management of the overall status of the project,  including a discussion of any existing or potential revisions to the project  with respect to cost, schedule, and performance. The V&V reports should  identify to senior management the issues or weaknesses that increase the  risks associated with the project or portfolio so that they can be promptly  addressed. DHS management has correctly recognized the importance of  such a function and advised us that they have taken prompt steps so that  the V&V function is now being overseen by officials in DHS\u2019 Office of the  Chief Information Officer.

DHS has started, but not completed  implementation of the six recommendations we made in June 2007, aimed  at helping the department to reduce risk to acceptable levels, while  acquiring and implementing an integrated departmentwide financial  management system. The open recommendations from our prior report  continue to be vital to the success of the TASC program. In addition, as  DHS moves toward acquiring and implementing a departmentwide  financial management system, it has selected a path whereby it is relying  heavily on contractors to define and implement the TASC program.  Therefore, adequate DHS oversight of key elements of the system  acquisition and implementation will be critical to reducing risk. Given the  approach that DHS has selected, it will be paramount that DHS develop  oversight mechanisms to minimize risks associated with contractor- developed documents such as the migration plans, and plans associated  with a disciplined development effort including requirements management  plans, quality assurance plans, and testing plans. DHS faces a monumental  challenge in consolidating and modernizing its financial management  systems. Failure to minimize the risks associated with this challenge could  lead to acquiring a system that does not meet cost, schedule, and  performance goals.", "To that end, our draft report includes specific recommendations, including  a number of actions that, if effectively implemented, should mitigate the  risks associated with DHS\u2019 heavy reliance on contractors for acquiring and  implementing an integrated departmentwide financial management  system. In addition, we also recommended that DHS designate a COTR for  the IV&V contractor that is not in RMTO, but at a higher level of  departmental management, in order to achieve the independence needed  for the V&V function. As discussed earlier, DHS officials advised us that  they have already taken steps to address this recommendation and we  look forward to DHS expeditiously addressing our other recommendations  too.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes our prepared statement.
