In fiscal year 2007, DHS provided approximately $1.7 billion to states and urban areas through its Homeland Security Grant Program (HSGP) to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events. As part of the Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2007, GAO was mandated to review the methodology used by DHS to allocate HSGP grants. This report addresses (1) the changes DHS has made to its risk-based methodology used to allocate grant funding from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2008 and (2) whether the fiscal year 2008 methodology is reasonable. To answer these questions, GAO analyzed DHS documents related to its methodology and grant guidance, interviewed DHS officials about the grant process used in fiscal year 2007 and changes made to the process for fiscal year 2008, and used GAO's risk management framework based on best practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2008 HSGP grants, DHS is primarily following the same methodology it used in fiscal year 2007, but incorporated metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) within the model used to calculate risk. The methodology consists of a three-step process--a risk analysis of urban areas and states based on measures of threat, vulnerability and consequences, an effectiveness assessment of applicants' investment justifications, and a final allocation decision. The principal change in the risk analysis model for 2008 is in the definition of the geographic boundaries of eligible urban areas. In 2007, the footprint was defined using several criteria, which included a 10-mile buffer zone around the center city. Reflecting the requirements of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, DHS assessed risk for the Census Bureau's 100 largest MSAs by population in determining its 2008 Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI) grant allocations. This change altered the geographic footprint of the urban areas assessed, aligning them more closely with the boundaries used by government agencies to collect some of the economic and population data used in the model. This may have resulted in DHS using data in its model that more accurately estimated the population and economy of those areas. The change to the use of MSA data in fiscal year 2008 also resulted in changes in the relative risk rankings of some urban areas. As a result, DHS officials expanded the eligible urban areas in fiscal year 2008 to a total of 60 UASI grantees, in part, to address the effects of this change to MSA data, as well as to ensure that all urban areas receiving fiscal year 2007 funding continued to receive funding in fiscal year 2008, according to DHS officials. Generally, DHS has constructed a reasonable methodology to assess risk and allocate funds within a given fiscal year. The risk analysis model DHS uses as part of its methodology includes empirical risk analysis and policy judgments to select the urban areas eligible for grants (all states are guaranteed a specified minimum percentage of grant funds available) and to allocate State Homeland Security Program (SHSP) and UASI funds. However, our review found that the vulnerability element of the risk analysis model has limitations that reduce its value. Measuring vulnerability is considered a generally-accepted practice in assessing risk; however, DHS's current risk analysis model does not measure vulnerability for each state and urban area. Rather, DHS considered all states and urban areas equally vulnerable to a successful attack and assigned every state and urban area a vulnerability score of 1.0 in the risk analysis model, which does not take into account any geographic differences. Thus, as a practical matter, the final risk scores are determined by the threat and consequences scores."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2002, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has distributed  almost $20 billion in federal funding through various DHS grant programs  that provide funding to public jurisdictions and private owners/operators  for planning, equipment, and training to enhance the nation\u2019s capabilities  to respond to terrorist attacks and, to a lesser extent, natural and  accidental disasters. In fiscal year 2007, DHS provided approximately $1.7  billion to states and urban areas through its Homeland Security Grant  Program (HSGP) to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from  acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events and plans to distribute  approximately $1.6 billion under this program in fiscal year 2008.", "The majority of funding from the Homeland Security Grant Program is  provided through two of its five component programs: the State Homeland  Security Program (SHSP) and the Urban Areas Security Initiative (UASI).  SHSP supports building and sustaining capabilities at the state and local  levels through planning, equipment, training, and exercise activities and  helps states to implement the strategic goals and objectives included in  state homeland security strategies. SHSP provides funding to all 56 states  and territories based on a combination of assessing relative risk, and  determining the effectiveness of states\u2019 proposed investments. UASI  addresses the unique multi-disciplinary planning, operations, equipment,  training, and exercise needs of high-threat, high-density urban areas. The  program provides funding to high-risk urban areas based on  determinations of risk and assessments of the effectiveness of the plans  for using the funds. DHS used this same risk-based methodology to  allocate $852 million in fiscal year 2008 under the Infrastructure Protection  Program, according to DHS.", "The distribution of HSGP funds, including UASI funding, has raised  congressional interest about DHS\u2019s methods in making such  determinations.

How reasonable is the fiscal year 2008 methodology?", "To answer these questions, we analyzed DHS documents, including the  risk analysis models for fiscal years 2007 and 2008, grant guidance, and  presentations. To provide a basis for examining efforts at carrying out risk  management, we applied a framework for risk management that GAO  developed based on best practices and other criteria. We used our risk  management framework to examine DHS\u2019s risk-based methodology\u2014 which includes its risk analysis model. Our analysis includes the extent to  which:   Information used in DHS\u2019s methodology\u2014such as specific measures  and weights\u2014was sufficient and reliable;    Attributes of DHS\u2019s methodology that potentially include both  government and non-government items were identified by a reasoned  process;    DHS could justify the aggregation or calculations of these attributes;    DHS documented its processes and applied written criteria when using  methods to obtain scores or weights (ie. peer review), or when ranges  or categories (ie. tiers) are used;    Relative risk rankings are sensitive to incremental changes in  assumptions or alternative perceptions related to grantee eligibility or  funding levels; and    DHS has procedures in place to update their methodology if new  information becomes available.", "Finally, we interviewed DHS officials about the HSGP grant determination  process used in fiscal year 2007 and about changes made to the process  for fiscal year 2008.

Rather, given limited resources, risk management is a  structured means of making informed trade-offs and choices about how to  use available resources effectively and monitoring the effect of those  choices. Thus, risk management is a continuous process that includes the  assessment of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences to determine  what actions should be taken to reduce or eliminate one or more of these  elements of risk.", "To provide a basis for examining efforts at carrying out risk management,  GAO developed a framework for risk management based on best  practices and other criteria. The framework is divided into five phases: (1)  setting strategic goals and objectives, and determining constraints; (2)  assessing the risks; (3) evaluating alternatives for addressing these risks;  (4) selecting the appropriate alternatives; and (5) implementing the  alternatives and monitoring the progress made and the results achieved  (see Fig.1).", "Because we have imperfect information for assessing risks, there is a  degree of uncertainty in the information used for risk assessments (e.g.,  what the threats are and how likely they are to be realized).

It is important that key decision-makers  understand the basis for those assumptions and policy judgments and  their effect on the results of the risk analysis and the resource decisions  based on that analysis.", "DHS has used an evolving risk-based methodology to identify the urban  areas eligible for HSGP grants and the amount of funds states and urban  areas receive (see Fig 2). For example, the risk analysis model used from  fiscal year 2001 through 2003 largely relied on measures of population to  determine the relative risk of potential grant recipients, and evolved to  measuring risk as the sum of threat, critical infrastructure and population  density calculations in fiscal years 2004 and 2005.", "The fiscal year 2006 process introduced assessments of threat,  vulnerability and consequences of a terrorist attack in assessing risk. In  addition to modifications to its risk analysis model, DHS adopted an  effectiveness assessment for fiscal year 2006 to determine the anticipated  effectiveness of the various risk mitigation investments proposed by urban  areas, which affected the final amount of funds awarded to eligible areas.  For the fiscal year 2007 allocation process, DHS defined Risk as the  product of Threat times Vulnerability and Consequences, or \u201cR= T* (V &  C)\u201d and applied a three-step risk-based allocation methodology which  incorporates analyses of risk and effectiveness to select eligible urban  areas and allocate UASI and SHSP funds (see Fig. 3). The three steps  include:  1.  Implementation of a Risk Analysis model to calculate scores for  states and urban areas, defining relative Risk as the product of  Threat, Vulnerability and Consequences;  2.  Implementation of an Effectiveness Assessment, including a  process where state and urban area representatives acting as peer  reviewers assess and score the effectiveness of the proposed  investments submitted by the eligible applicants.

In fiscal year 2007, 45  candidates were eligible to apply for funding under the UASI program, and  eligible candidates were grouped into two tiers according to relative risk.  Tier 1 included the six highest risk areas; Tier 2 included the other 39  candidate areas.

Because DHS considered most areas of the country  equally vulnerable to a terrorist attack given freedom of movement within  the nation, DHS assigns vulnerability a constant value of 1.0 in the formula  across all states and urban areas. Therefore, DHS\u2019s measurement of  vulnerability and consequences is mainly a function of the seriousness of  the consequences of a successful terrorist attack, represented by four  indices: a Population Index, an Economic Index, a National Infrastructure  Index, and a National Security Index.", "Population Index (40 percent).

For urban areas, factors such as population density, estimated  number of daily commuters, and estimated annual visitors were also  included in this variable using data from private entities. DHS  calculated the Population Index for urban areas by identifying areas  with a population greater than 100,000 persons and cities that reported  threat data during the past year, then combined cities or adjacent  urban counties with shared boundaries to form single jurisdictions,  and drew a 10-mile buffer zone around identified areas.", "Economic Index (20 percent).

DHS made this change in response to the 9/11Act  requirement to perform a risk assessment for the 100 largest MSAs by  population. Because the change in definition generally expanded the  geographic area of each potential UASI grant recipient, the change had an  effect on the data used to assess threat and consequences, and it may also  have resulted in the use of more accurate data in the risk analysis model.  The change to the use of MSA data in fiscal year 2008 also resulted in  changes in the relative risk rankings of some urban areas. As a result, DHS  officials expanded the eligible urban areas in fiscal year 2008 to a total of  60 UASI grantees, in part, to address the effects of this change to MSA  data, as well as to ensure that all urban areas that received fiscal year 2007  funding also received funding for fiscal year 2008, according to DHS  officials.", "Changing the boundaries had an effect on the data by which risk is  calculated because the change in boundaries resulted in changes in the  population and critical assets within the new boundaries. Figure 3 below  uses the Chicago, IL urban area to illustrate this change. One benefit of the  change to MSAs was that the UASI boundaries align more closely with the  boundaries used to collect some of the economic and population data used  in the model. Consequently, the fiscal year 2008 model may have resulted  in more accurate data. Because the 2007 boundaries were based on  distance, areas inside the boundaries may have included partial census  tracts or partial counties, each of which would have required DHS to  develop rules as to how to handle the partial areas. By contrast, the MSAs  are based on counties and allow DHS to use standard census data instead  of developing an estimated population within the defined boundaries.  Additional information describing the boundaries of UASI urban areas for  fiscal year 2007 versus fiscal year 2008 is presented in Appendix II.", "DHS calculated the Population Index of MSAs by: (1) using census data to  determine the population and population density of each census tract; (2)  calculating a Population Index for each individual census tract by  multiplying the census tract\u2019s population and population density figures;  and (3) adding together the population indices of all of the census tracts  making up the MSA. DHS did not use average population density because   using an average resulted in losing information about how the population  is actually distributed among the tracts. Using averages for population  density over census tracts with dissimilar densities could have yielded  very misleading results, according to DHS officials.", "The change to MSAs for fiscal year 2008 resulted in an increase of almost  162,000 square miles across the total area of urban area footprints. While 3  urban areas actually lost square mileage because of the change, the other  areas all increased their square mileage footprint by almost 2,700 square  miles on average. The increased size of urban areas\u2019 footprints increased  the number of critical infrastructure assets that were counted within them.  We analyzed the number of Tier 1 and Tier 2 critical infrastructure assets  associated with UASI areas between fiscal year 2007 and 2008, and found a  higher number of total Tier 1 and Tier 2 critical infrastructure assets  assigned to urban areas in 2008, and\u2013individually\u2014almost all urban areas  increased the number of assets assigned to them.", "This change to the use of MSAs also resulted in changes in urban areas  rankings, including the increase of the relative risk scores for such urban  areas as Albany, Syracuse and Rochester, NY, and Bridgeport, CT.

Risk assessment helps decision makers identify and evaluate  potential risks facing key assets or missions so that countermeasures can  be designed and implemented to prevent or mitigate the effects of the  risks. In a risk management framework, risk assessment is a function of  Threat, Vulnerability, and Consequences, and the product of these  elements is used to develop scenarios and help inform actions that are  best suited to prevent an attack or mitigate vulnerabilities to a terrorist  attack. Threat is the probability that a specific type of attack will be  initiated against a particular target/class of targets, and analysis of threat- related data is a critical part of risk assessment. The Vulnerability of an  asset is the probability that a particular attempted attack will succeed  against a particular target or class of targets. It is usually measured against  some set of standards, such as availability/predictability, accessibility,  countermeasures in place, and target hardness (the material construction  characteristics of the asset). The Consequences of a terrorist attack  measures the adverse effects of a successful attack and may include many  forms, such as the loss of human lives, economic costs, and adverse  impact on national security. The risk analysis model used by DHS is  reasonable because it attempts to capture data on threats, vulnerabilities,  and consequences\u2014the three types of information used in evaluating risk.", "Because DHS considered most areas of the country equally vulnerable to a  terrorist attack given freedom of movement within the nation, DHS assigns  vulnerability a constant value of 1.0 in the formula across all states and  urban areas. Therefore, DHS\u2019s measurement of vulnerability and  consequences is mainly a function of the seriousness of the consequences  of a successful terrorist attack. Because the risk analysis model is  consequences-driven, another measure of the model\u2019s overall  reasonableness is the extent to which the indices used to calculate the  consequences component of the model are reasonable. As previously  described, the consequences component of the model is comprised of four  indices \u2013 a Population Index, an Economic Index, a National  Infrastructure Index, and a National Security Index \u2013 each assigned a  different weight. These indices are generally reasonable.", "Both the population and economic indices are calculated from data  derived from reliable sources that are also publicly available, providing  additional transparency for the model. For example, according to DHS  officials, the fiscal year 2008 analysis used Gross Metropolitan Product  (GMP) estimates prepared by the consulting firm Global Insight for the  United States Conference of Mayors and the Council for the New  American City that were published in January 2007, and reported on the  GMP for 2005. In addition, the National Infrastructure Index focused on  over 2,000 Tier 1and Tier 2 critical infrastructure/key resource assets  identified by DHS\u2019s Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP). For both fiscal  years 2007 and 2008, DHS used a collaborative, multi-step process to  create the Tier 2 CIKR list. First, IP works with sector-specific agencies to  develop criteria used to determine which assets should be included in the  asset lists. Second, these criteria are vetted with the private-sector through  sector-specific councils, who review the criteria and provide feedback to  IP. Third, IP finalizes the criteria and provides it to the sector-specific  agencies and State and Territorial Homeland Security Advisors (HSAs).  Fourth, IP asks states to nominate assets within their jurisdiction that  match the criteria. Fifth, assets nominated by states are reviewed by both  the sector-specific agencies and IP to decide which assets should comprise  the final Tier 2 list. For example, to identify the nation\u2019s critical energy  assets, IP will work with the Department of Energy to determine which  assets and systems in the energy sector would generate the most serious  economic consequences to the Nation should they be destroyed or  disrupted. Further, in the fiscal year 2008 process, IP added a new,  additional step to allow for the resubmission of assets for reconsideration  if they are not initially selected for the Tier 2 list. In addition, the National  Security Index comprises only a small fraction of the model \u2013 5 percent \u2013  and has also evolved to include more precision, such as counting the  number of military personnel instead of simply the presence or absence of  military bases.  To identify the nation\u2019s critical defense industrial bases,  the Department of Defense analyzes the impact on current warfighting  capabilities, recovery and reconstitution, threat, vulnerability, and  consequences of possible facility disruption and destruction, and other  aspects.", "DHS\u2019s approach to calculating threat, which accounts for the remaining 20  percent of the model, also represents a measure of the model\u2019s overall  reasonableness. DHS uses analytical judgments to categorize urban areas\u2019  threat, which ultimately determines the relative threat for each state and  urban area.  DHS has used written criteria to guide these judgments, and  DHS provided us with the criteria used in both of these years for our  review. The criteria are focused on threats from international terrorism  derived from data on credible plots, planning, and threats from  international terrorist networks, their affiliates, and those inspired by such  networks. The criteria provided guidance for categorizing areas based on  varying levels of both the credibility and the volume of threat reporting, as  well as the potential targets of threats. Results of this process are shared  with the DHS Undersecretary for Intelligence and Analysis, the FBI, and  the National Counterterrorism Center, all of whom are afforded the  opportunity to provide feedback on the placements. Additionally, DHS  develops written threat assessments that indicate whether states are  \u201chigh,\u201d \u201cmedium,\u201d or \u201clow\u201d threat states. States can provide threat  information that they have collected to DHS, but in order for that  information to affect a state\u2019s tier placement and threat level, the  information must be relevant to international terrorism, according to DHS  officials. We reviewed several examples of these assessments from 2007,  which included key findings describing both identified and potential  threats to the state. The classified assessments addressed potential  terrorist threats to critical infrastructure in each of the 56 states and  territories.  However, DHS shared assessments only with state officials  who had appropriate security clearances.  According to DHS officials,  states without officials with sufficient clearances will receive an  unclassified version of their state\u2019s assessment for the fiscal year 2009  grant process. DHS is also developing a process by which they can share  the threat assessments with UASI areas, including those UASI areas whose  boundaries cross state lines; however, currently the assessments are  transmitted only to the DHS state representatives and state officials, and  the states and representatives are responsible for sharing the information  with the UASI areas, according to DHS officials.", "Another measure of the overall reasonableness of DHS\u2019s risk analysis  model is the extent to which the model\u2019s results change when the  assumptions and values built into the model, such as weights of variables,  change. A model is sensitive when a model produces materially different  results in response to small changes in its assumptions. Ideally, a model  that accurately and comprehensively assesses risk would not be sensitive,  and such a model exhibiting little sensitivity could be said to be more  robust than a model with more sensitivity to changes in assumptions  underlying the model. A robust calculation or estimation model provides  its users greater confidence in the reliability of its results.  For both fiscal  years 2007 and 2008, substantial changes had to be made to the weights of  any of the indices used in the risk model to calculate state and urban area  risk scores before there was any movement in or out of the top 7 (or Tier  1) ranked UASI areas. In other words, the model provides DHS with a level  of assurance that the highest at-risk areas have been appropriately  identified. While Tier 1 UASI areas were similarly robust in both FY 2007  and FY 2008, the sensitivity of Tier 2 UASI areas to changes in the weights  of indices used to calculate risk scores was significant in FY 2007, but  improved in FY 2008. In FY 2007, very small changes in the weights for the  indices used to quantify risk (for Tier 2 UASI areas at the eligibility cut  point) resulted in changes in eligibility; however, FY 2008 results are more  robust, as eligibility of urban areas is much less sensitive to changes in the  index weights in the FY2008 model than it was in the FY2007 model.  Appendix III provides an in-depth description of the sensitivity of the  model to specific changes in the relative weights of each index for Tier 1  and Tier 2 UASI areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vulnerability Element of the Risk Analysis Model Has Limitations that Reduce Its Value", "paragraphs": ["Although the methodology DHS uses is reasonable, the vulnerability  element of the risk analysis model\u2014as currently calculated by DHS\u2014has  limitations that reduce its value for providing an accurate assessment of  risk. DHS considered most areas of the country equally vulnerable to a  terrorist attack in the risk analysis model used for fiscal years 2007 and  2008 and assigned a constant value to vulnerability, which ignores  geographic differences in the social, built, and natural environments  across states and urban areas. Although DHS recognized and described the  significance of vulnerability in its FY 2006 model, the model used for fiscal  years 2007 and 2008 did not attempt to measure vulnerability. Instead,  DHS considered most areas of the country equally vulnerable to a terrorist  attack due to the freedom of individuals to move within the nation. As a  result, DHS did not measure vulnerability, but assigned it a constant value  of 1.0 across all states and urban areas.", "Last year we reported that DHS measured the vulnerability of an asset type  as part of its FY2006 risk analysis. DHS used internal subject matter  experts who analyzed the general attributes of an asset type against  various terrorist attack scenarios by conducting site vulnerability analyses  on a sample of sites from the asset type in order to catalog attributes for  the generic asset. These experts evaluated vulnerability by attack scenario  and asset type pairs and assigned an ordinal value to the pair based on 10  major criteria. In describing its FY 2006 methodology, DHS acknowledged  that because all attack types are not necessarily applicable to all  infrastructures, the values for threat must be mapped against vulnerability  to represent the greatest likelihood of a successful attack. DHS also  acknowledged that vulnerability of an infrastructure asset was also a  function of many variables and recognized that it did not have sufficient  data on all infrastructures to know what specific vulnerabilities existed for  every infrastructure, what countermeasures had been deployed, and what  impact on other infrastructures each asset had. At that time, DHS noted it  would require substantial time and resource investment to fully develop  the capability to consistently assess and compare vulnerabilities across all  types of infrastructure.", "Vulnerability is a crucial component of risk assessment. An asset may be  highly vulnerable to one mode of attack but have a low level of  vulnerability to another, depending on a variety of factors, such as  countermeasures already in place. According to our risk management  framework, the vulnerability of an asset is the probability that a particular  attempted attack will succeed against a particular target or class of  targets. It is usually measured against some set of standards, such as  availability/predictability, accessibility, countermeasures in place, and  target hardness (the material construction characteristics of the asset).  Each of these four elements can be evaluated based on a numerical  assignment corresponding to the conditional probability of a successful  attack. Additionally, other research has developed methods to measure  vulnerability across urban areas. For example, one study described a  quantitative methodology to characterize the vulnerability of U.S. urban  centers to terrorist attack for the potential allocation of national and  regional funding to support homeland security preparedness and response  in U.S. cities. This study found that vulnerability varied across the  country, especially in urban areas. The study noted that \u201cplace matters,\u201d  and a one-size-fits all strategy ignores geographic differences in the social,  built, and natural environments. Furthermore, in February of 2008 the  Secretary of DHS said that \u201cas we reduce our vulnerabilities, the  vulnerabilities change as well.\u201d However, while earlier iterations of the  risk analysis model attempted to measure vulnerability, DHS\u2019s risk  analysis model now considers the states and urban areas of the country  equally vulnerable to a terrorist attack and assigns a constant value to  vulnerability, which ignores geographic differences."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2008, DHS will distribute approximately $1.6 billion to states  and urban areas through its Homeland Security Grant Program \u2013 a  program that has already distributed approximately $20 billion over the  past six years \u2013 to prevent, protect against, respond to, and recover from  acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events. Given that risk management  has been endorsed by the federal government as a way to direct finite  resources to those areas that are most at risk of terrorist attack under  conditions of uncertainty, it is important that DHS use a reasonable risk- based allocation methodology and risk analysis model as it allocates those  limited resources.", "DHS\u2019s risk-based allocation methodology and risk analysis model are  generally reasonable tools for measuring relative risk within a given fiscal  year, considering its use of a generally-accepted risk calculation formula;  key model results\u2019 decreased sensitivity to incremental changes in the  assumptions related to Tier 1 UASI grantees or the eligibility for Tier 2  UASI funding, the reliability of the consequence variable component  indices, and its adoption of MSAs to calculate urban area footprints.
