Similarly, McClellan Air Force Base, California, and the Sacramento Air Logistics Center, including its Air Force maintenance depot, is to be closed by July 2001. To mitigate the impact of the closures on the local communities and center employees, the administration announced its decision to maintain certain employment levels at these locations. Privatization-in-place was one initiative for achieving these employment goals.", "Since that time, Congress and the administration have debated the process and procedures for deciding where and by whom the depot maintenance workloads at the closing depots should be performed. Central to this debate are concerns about the excess facility capacity at the Air Force\u2019s three remaining maintenance depots and the legislative requirement in  10 U.S.C. 2469 that, for workloads exceeding $3 million in value, a public-private competition must be held before the workloads can be moved from a public depot to a private sector company. Because of congressional concerns raised in 1996, the Air Force revised its privatization-in-place plans to provide for competitions between the public and private sectors as a means to decide where the depot maintenance workloads would be performed. The first competition was for the C-5 aircraft depot maintenance workload, which had been performed at the San Antonio depot. The Air Force awarded the workload to the Warner Robins depot in Georgia on September 4, 1997. During 1997, Congress continued to oversee DOD\u2019s strategy for allocating workloads currently performed at the closing depots.", "The 1998 Defense Authorization Act required that we and DOD analyze various issues related to the competitions at the closing depots and report to Congress regarding several areas, which are discussed in appendix I. One of these areas involves the combination into single solicitations of aircraft and multi-commodity workloads at the Sacramento depot and multiengine workloads at the San Antonio depot. Appendix II provides additional information about the maintenance workloads currently performed at these facilities. As required by the act, a solicitation may be issued for a single contract for the performance of multiple depot-level maintenance or repair workloads. However, the Secretary of Defense must first (1) determine in writing that the individual workloads cannot be performed as logically and economically without combination by sources that are potentially qualified to submit an offer and be awarded a contract to perform those individual workloads and (2) submit a report to Congress setting forth the reasons for the determination. Further, the Air Force cannot issue a solicitation for combined workloads until at least 60 days after the Secretary submits the required report.", "Our January 20, 1998, report made two key points about DOD\u2019s determinations. First, we stated that there was no analysis of the logic and economies associated with having the workload performed individually by potentially qualified offerors. Consequently, there was no support for determining that the individual workloads cannot as logically and economically be performed without combination. Second, we noted that the reports and available supporting data did not adequately support DOD\u2019s determinations. Appendix III contains a summary of this report.", "We discussed our findings in a February 24, 1998, hearing conducted by the Subcommittee on Military Readiness, House National Security Committee, and a March 4, 1998, hearing conducted by the Subcommittee on Readiness, Senate Armed Services Committee. At those hearings, Office of Secretary of Defense and Air Force officials provided additional rationale supporting DOD\u2019s determinations to combine the workloads. Subcommittee members expressed their concerns regarding whether the new data provided adequate support for the determinations. Both subcommittees requested that we analyze the additional data and report to them on our findings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Rationale for Workload Combination Determinations", "paragraphs": ["On February 24, 1998, the Air Force provided additional information in support of DOD\u2019s December 19, 1997, determinations. This information included two documents: a white paper containing the rationale for combining the Sacramento depot\u2019s aircraft and commodity workloads into a single solicitation and a report containing the rationale for combining the San Antonio depot\u2019s engine workloads into a single solicitation.", "Air Force officials stated that the decision to combine most of the aircraft and commodity workloads at the Sacramento depot and the engine workloads at the San Antonio depot was made before the mandate in the 1998 National Defense Authorization Act. The officials also said that the process used to make the decision was valid and that a reassessment of alternative acquisition strategies was not required in response to the act.", "The Sacramento white paper described the rationale supporting the workload combination determination as an iterative process that evolved over a 2-1/2-year period beginning in September 1995. This process included conferences and discussions with potential offerors, strategy panels with Air Force acquisition experts, repair base analyses,unsolicited input from industry representatives, and reviews of recent DOD outsourcing efforts. Sacramento officials explained that the initial approach involved a privatization-in-place strategy, including separate solicitations for seven individual workloads and separate transition schedules for some of the individual workloads. In July 1996, the Air Force decided to conduct a public-private competition combining the Sacramento KC-135 and A-10 aircraft and various commodity workloads, including hydraulics, instruments and avionics, and electrical accessories. According to Air Force officials, the Air Force has pursued workload combination as its acquisition strategy since that time.", "The San Antonio report recognized that the Air Force had not conducted an economic analysis regarding the potential savings of issuing single versus multiple solicitations. Instead, the Air Force relied on reviews of engine workload data, repair processes, and market surveys to identify the acquisition strategy for determining how San Antonio\u2019s engine workloads will be performed in the future.", "Both documents discuss the logic and economies supporting DOD\u2019s determinations to combine workloads into a single solicitation at each of the closing depots.

The Air Force believes that shared personnel skills and backshops provide an opportunity for achieving improved efficiencies and lower prices in peacetime while providing flexibility to better plan for wartime surge requirements. Air Force officials noted that shared fixed overhead costs for such functions, such as planning, scheduling, and providing materiel support over a larger workload base, provide opportunities for improved economies and reduced costs at both the Sacramento and San Antonio depots. Further, using the same backshops for multiple workloads should reduce the overall cost of the combined work at each location.", "Avoidance of multiple transitions and personnel turbulence. The Air Force believes that managing multiple transitions increases the readiness risks associated with closing complex, integrated industrial facilities. Further, delaying the award of the contract by splitting the competition into multiple awards could subject the workforce to multiple reduction-in-force actions, which would disrupt the skill mix and result in productivity losses and production delays that adversely affect the readiness of the Air Force\u2019s operational units.", "Workload stability. This factor was also cited to support the rationale at the Sacramento depot. The Air Force stated that, because the aircraft workload is stable, it can be competed using a guaranteed minimum quantity. However, the Air Force noted that many of the commodity workloads have been erratic and therefore cannot be competed with a minimum guaranteed workload. Consequently, the Air Force stated that combining the aircraft and commodity workloads into one solicitation would allow the winning offeror to smooth peaks in one workload segment and offset valleys in other workload segments, providing a more stable production capability. Further, the Air Force stated that a more stable workload would increase efficiency and savings by providing potential offerors a more reliable basis for employment levels and cost planning.", "Market surveys. To support workload consolidation at the San Antonio depot, the Air Force said that the majority of respondents to its October 1995 market survey indicated a preference for a single contract for the C-5 aircraft and a single contract for the combined engine workloads. Further, the Air Force concluded from survey results that more competitors would participate under the single solicitation for the multiple engine workloads."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Economic Factors Cited to Support Workload Combinations", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force cited the following factors supporting the economies of workload combination at the closing depots:", "Time delays. The Sacramento white paper stated that separating the Sacramento workload into five segments would delay contract award and transition completion dates by 16 months, which would impact closure, increase costs, and reduce projected BRAC savings. Similarly, the San Antonio report stated that separating the San Antonio engine workloads into three solicitations would extend the planned contract award from  225 to 740 days, impacting closure and increasing costs.", "Cost increases. The Air Force stated that conducting multiple competitions at Sacramento could result in cost increases to the offerors and the government, which the Air Force estimates to be between $22 million and $130 million. At San Antonio, the Air Force estimated the increased cost to be between $92 million and $259 million.", "Increased risks.

Second, some assumptions are creditable only if the combined workloads are performed in place.

For example, the Air Force states that combining workloads will preclude multiple workload transitions, thereby avoiding multiple reduction-in-force actions, limiting personnel turbulence, and minimizing readiness impacts. Further, the Air Force states that, for the Sacramento workload, combining aircraft and commodities into a single solicitation would provide the winning offeror the ability to shift employees between workload segments. The advantages cited by the Air Force are not likely to occur if the workloads are performed at a single location other than Sacramento and San Antonio or at multiple locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["We identified other weaknesses or deficiencies with each of the factors cited by the Air Force, including the following:", "Workload commonality and sharing of overhead. The Air Force\u2019s position that realizing efficiencies from shared personnel and facilities at Sacramento and San Antonio is best achieved with a single solicitation for combined workloads is questionable. The efficiencies that are achievable from shared facilities and personnel may be greater if the workloads being combined are the same or more similar than the workloads being combined under the Sacramento and San Antonio solicitations. For example, the Air Force may achieve greater efficiency by combining (1) the management of the Sacramento KC-135 workloads with other KC-135 workloads to be competed and/or (2) the San Antonio Air Force T-56 engine workloads with other engine workloads also to be competed. Both of these options provide opportunities for significant cost savings that were not considered by the Air Force.", "Avoidance of multiple transitions and personnel turbulence. We realize that risks can be associated with the transition of any depot maintenance workload. However, we have reported that there is no inherent reason why these workloads cannot be transitioned without impacting equipment readiness if the transition is properly planned and effectively implemented. Further, DOD has successfully closed 17 depots over the past 10 years and has successfully managed multiple transitions and the resulting sequential personnel reductions.", "Workload stability for commodities and aircraft repair at Sacramento. The Air Force data does not support the conclusion that the inherent inefficiencies of the commodity workload are improved by combining it with the more predictable and consistent aircraft workload. For example, even though the Air Force states that stability will come from being able to transfer employees between the aircraft and commodity workloads, this transfer has rarely happened. Although the Air Force has had the ability to shift workers among the aircraft and commodity workloads, Sacramento depot personnel data shows that on average, each year over the last  7 years, only 22 of the approximately 1,500 wage grade depot employees have been shifted between aircraft and commodities.", "Results of market surveys. We question whether the results of the 1995 market survey are applicable to the Air Force\u2019s current position that combining the San Antonio workloads is more logical and economical than issuing individual solicitations. The survey was designed to collect potential offeror preferences under the then-current acquisition strategy of privatizing the San Antonio aircraft and engine workloads in place. However, in 1996 the Air Force revised this acquisition strategy and adopted a public-private competition strategy. Further, in 1997 the Air Force conducted a market analysis of engine manufacturing companies to determine the availability and interest of public and private sector sources to perform the required repair of engines currently maintained in Air Force depots. In this survey, engine manufacturers indicated a preference for repairing their own engines and were less interested in repairing other engines. Additionally, our discussions with four potential offerors for the engine workload indicated that they are interested in participating regardless of whether the workloads are combined into a single solicitation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Significant Weaknesses in Economic Analyses", "paragraphs": ["We also identified two significant weaknesses in the Air Force\u2019s economic analyses supporting the combination of workloads into single solicitations at each site.

Second, the cost estimates are questionable for several key categories."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Incomprehensive or Inconsistent Comparative Cost Analyses", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force analyses stated that workload combination would save $22 million to $130 million at Sacramento and $92 million to $259 million at San Antonio. These figures represent estimates of costs associated with administering the additional contracts and delaying contract award and transition. However, the estimates contain two significant weaknesses.", "First, all costs associated with performing the work are not included. For example, the analyses did not consider the cost of performing maintenance operations, including the costs of labor, parts, and overhead required to perform the repair under the two alternatives considered, or the additional layer of cost associated with subcontracting under the combined workload package scenario. Also, the possibility of the cost benefits of increased competition resulting from solicitations for individual workloads was not recognized. Further, because the estimated value of the workload at these locations is $2.4 billion at Sacramento and $8 billion at San Antonio, the effect of not considering these costs could significantly impact the outcome of the analyses. To illustrate the significance, a small difference of, for example, 5 percent between cost estimates for single versus multiple solicitations would represent $120 million and $400 million, for the Sacramento and San Antonio workloads respectively. These amounts would materially affect the savings ranges projected by the Air Force.", "Second, the cost estimates for the two locations did not use consistent cost elements. For example, the San Antonio estimate included a $40-million cost associated with delaying depot closure, which would reduce the amount of estimated savings, whereas the Sacramento estimate did not consider such costs. We do believe costs associated with delaying closure are relevant to both locations, although we have some questions about the accuracy of the $40-million cost estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Questionable Cost Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Notwithstanding our concerns about the comprehensiveness and consistency of the cost analysis, our review of the cost data provided indicates that the estimates are overstated or questionable in several areas, including the following:", "Contract administration costs at Sacramento. The Sacramento estimate included a 1.9 percent estimate for contract administration costs resulting from having more than one contract for the Sacramento workload. This estimate was based on a contractor industrial performance metrics study.This estimate may be overstated because participants in the original study found the cost impacts projected by the contractor were significantly overstated. For example, five participants prepared estimates of the top 10 cost drivers identified in the contractor study and found that the study estimates were overstated from 14 to 70 percent.", "Closure savings costs. As mentioned above, the San Antonio cost estimate included a $40-million cost associated with delaying depot closure.However, this estimate is overstated. The $40-million estimate is based on the closure of all logistics operations, some of which will not close until 2001. According to the BRAC estimates, savings from closing the depot maintenance operations provided only 21 percent of the estimated annual savings from closure. At this rate, the cost of delay should be no higher than $8.4 million rather than the $40 million estimated in the San Antonio report.", "Transition costs. Sacramento included a cost estimate for extending the transition period. Under the multi-contract approach, Sacramento assumed workload segments would be transitioned incrementally over a 20- to 24-month period. Although the Air Force may incur additional transition costs under a multiple contract strategy, we found transition costs were overstated. The Air Force\u2019s transition cost methodology assumed that each individual winning offeror would require the full 20 to 24 months to complete the transition. However, Sacramento officials recognized that the contractors\u2019 transitions for the individual workload segments will not require the entire 20- to 24-month period.

For example, in 1996 the Air Force performed analyses for six depot-level workloads performed by the Sacramento depot to identify industry capabilities and capacity. Individual analyses were accomplished for hydraulics, software, electrical accessories, flight instruments, A-10 aircraft, and KC-135 aircraft depot-level workloads. As a part of these analyses, the Air Force identified sufficient numbers of qualified contractors interested in various segments of the Sacramento workload to support a conclusion that it could rely on the private sector to support the workloads.", "Second, reports and available data did not adequately support DOD\u2019s determinations \u201cthat the individual workloads cannot as logically and economically be performed without combination by sources that are potentially qualified to submit an offer and to be awarded a contract to perform those individual workloads.\u201d For example, DOD\u2019s determination report relating to the Sacramento Air Logistics Center, McClellan Air Force Base, California, states that all competitors indicated throughout their Sacramento workload studies that consolidating workloads offered the most logical and economical performance possibilities. This statement was based on studies performed by the offerors as part of the competition process. However, one offeror\u2019s study states that the present competition format is not in the best interest of the government and recommends that the workload be separated into two competitive packages. We were unable to determine whether the other two contractor studies support the statement in the DOD report that all competitors favored consolidating the workloads because the Air Force did not provide us adequate or timely access to the studies cited in the report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections":
