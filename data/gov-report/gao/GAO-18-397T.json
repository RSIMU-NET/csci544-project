As of October 2017, the Border Patrol had completed the planned deployment of select technologies to several states along the southwest border. The Border Patrol has also made progress toward assessing performance of surveillance technologies, but additional actions are needed to fully implement GAO's 2011 and 2014 recommendations in this area. For example, the Border Patrol has not yet used available data to determine the contribution of surveillance technologies to border security efforts.", "CBP spent about $2.3 billion to deploy fencing from fiscal years 2007 through 2015 and constructed 654 miles of fencing by 2015.

GAO reported in February 2017 that CBP was taking a number of steps in sustaining tactical infrastructure\u2014such as fencing, roads, and lighting\u2014along the southwest border. However, CBP has not developed metrics that systematically use data it collects to assess the contributions of border fencing to its mission, as GAO has recommended. CBP concurred with the recommendation and plans to develop metrics by January 2019. Further, CBP established the Border Wall System Program in response to a January 2017 executive order that called for the immediate construction of a southwest border wall. This program is intended to replace and add to existing barriers along the southwest border.

The Border Patrol divides responsibility for  southwest border security operations geographically among nine sectors,  and each sector is further divided into varying numbers of stations. To  respond to cross-border threats, DHS has employed a combination of key  resources, including surveillance technology, tactical infrastructure (which  includes fencing, roads, and lighting), and Border Patrol agents. For  example, DHS has deployed a variety of land-based surveillance  technologies, such as cameras and sensors, which the Border Patrol  uses to assist its efforts to secure the border and to apprehend individuals  attempting to cross the border illegally. In addition, CBP spent  approximately $2.4 billion from fiscal years 2007 through 2015 to deploy  tactical infrastructure, including about $2.3 billion on fencing, at locations  along the nearly 2,000 mile long southwest border. The Border Patrol  deploys agents along the immediate border and in areas up to 100 miles  from the border as part of a layered approach the agency refers to as the  defense in depth strategy, and the Border Patrol reported it had 16,605  agents staffed at southwest border sectors at the end of fiscal year 2017.", "Since 2009 we have issued over 35 products on the progress DHS and  its components have made and challenges it faces in using surveillance  technology, tactical infrastructure, personnel, and other resources to  secure the southwest border.

This statement also includes preliminary observations  and analyses from ongoing work related to the construction of new and  replacement physical barriers along the southwest border and our fourth  annual assessment of select DHS major acquisition programs. Our  reports and testimonies, along with selected updates, incorporated  information we obtained and analyzed from officials at various DHS  components, and during site visits along the southwest border. More  detailed information about our scope and methodology can be found in  our published reports and testimonies. For ongoing work, we reviewed  acquisition documents, such as CBP\u2019s Concept of Operations for  Impedance and Denial, the Wall System Operational Requirements  Document, and the Border Wall Prototype Test Plan. We also met with  officials from DHS components, including CBP\u2019s Office of Facilities and  Management and the Border Patrol, from September 2017 to January  2018. Further, in December 2017 we conducted a site visit to California to  view existing tactical infrastructure and border wall prototypes that will  inform the design of future physical barriers along the southwest border.  All of our work was conducted in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

For example, we reported that, according to officials, the Border  Patrol had completed deployments of all planned Remote Video  Surveillance Systems (RVSS), Mobile Surveillance Capability systems,  and Unattended Ground Sensors, as well as 15 of 53 Integrated Fixed  Tower systems to Arizona. The Border Patrol had also completed  deployments of select technologies to Texas and California, including  deploying 32 Mobile Surveillance Capability systems. In addition, the  Border Patrol had efforts underway to deploy other technology programs,  but at the time of our report, some of those programs had not yet begun  deployment or were not yet under contract. For example, we reported  that, according to the Border Patrol officials responsible for the RVSS  program, the Border Patrol had begun planning the designs of the  command and control centers and towers for the Rio Grande Valley  sector in Texas. Further, we reported that the Border Patrol had not yet  initiated deployments of RVSS to Texas because, according to Border  Patrol officials, the program had only recently completed contract  negotiations for procuring those systems. Additionally, the Border Patrol  initially awarded the contract to procure and deploy Mobile Video  Surveillance System units to Texas in 2014, but did not award the  contract until 2015 because of bid and size protests, and the vendor that  was awarded the contract did not begin work until March 2016.

For example, in  November 2011, we found that CBP did not have the information needed  to fully support and implement the Arizona Technology Plan and  recommended that CBP (1) determine the mission benefits to be derived  from implementation of the Arizona Technology Plan and (2) develop and  apply key attributes for metrics to assess program implementation. CBP  concurred with our recommendations and has implemented one of them.  Specifically, in March 2014, we reported that CBP had identified mission  benefits of its surveillance technologies to be deployed along the  southwest border, such as improved situational awareness and agent  safety. However, the agency had not developed key attributes for  performance metrics for all surveillance technologies to be deployed.", "Further, we reported in March 2014 that CBP did not capture complete  data on the contributions of these technologies. When used in  combination with other relevant performance metrics or indicators, these  data could be used to better determine the impact of CBP\u2019s surveillance  technologies on CBP\u2019s border security efforts and inform resource  allocation decisions. Therefore, we recommended that CBP (1) require  data on technology contributions to apprehensions or seizures to be  tracked and recorded within its database and (2) subsequently analyze  available data on apprehensions and technological assists\u2014in  combination with other relevant performance metrics or indicators, as  appropriate\u2014to determine the contribution of surveillance technologies.  CBP concurred with our recommendations and has implemented one of  them. Specifically, in June 2014, the Border Patrol issued guidance  informing agents that the asset assist data field\u2014which records assisting  technology or other assets (canine teams)\u2014in its database had become a  mandatory data field.", "While the Border Patrol has taken action to collect data on technology, it  has not taken additional steps to determine the contribution of  surveillance technologies to CBP\u2019s border security efforts. In April 2017,  we reported that the Border Patrol had provided us a case study that  assessed technology assist data, along with other measures, to  determine the contributions of surveillance technologies to its mission.  We reported that this was a helpful step in developing and applying  performance metrics; however, the case study was limited to one border  location and the analysis was limited to select technologies. In November  2017, we reported that Border Patrol officials demonstrated the agency\u2019s  new Tracking, Sign Cutting, and Modeling (TSM) system, which they said  is intended to connect between agents\u2019 actions (such as identification of a  subject through the use of a camera) and results (such as an  apprehension) and allow for more comprehensive analysis of the  contributions of surveillance technologies to the Border Patrol\u2019s mission.  One official said that data from the TSM will have the potential to provide  decision makers with performance indicators, such as changes in  apprehensions or traffic before and after technology deployments.  However, at the time of our review, TSM was still early in its use and  officials confirmed that it was not yet used to support such analytic efforts.  We continue to believe that it is important for the Border Patrol to assess  technologies\u2019 contributions to border security and will continue to monitor  the progress of the TSM and other Border Patrol efforts to meet our 2011  and 2014 recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBP Is Planning to Construct New Physical Barriers, but Has Not Yet Assessed the Impact of Existing Fencing", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fencing Is Intended to Assist Agents in Performing Their Duties, but Its Contributions to Border Security Operations Have Not Been Assessed", "paragraphs": ["We have reported on the significant investments CBP has made in  tactical infrastructure along the southwest border. The Illegal Immigration  Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), as amended,  provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security shall take actions, as  necessary, to install physical barriers and roads in the vicinity of the  border to deter illegal crossings in areas of high illegal entry. The  Secure Fence Act of 2006, in amending IIRIRA, required DHS to  construct at least two layers of reinforced fencing as well as physical  barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors on certain segments of the  southwest border. From fiscal years 2005 through 2015, CBP increased  the total miles of primary border fencing on the southwest border from  119 miles to 654 miles\u2014including 354 miles of primary pedestrian fencing  and 300 miles of primary vehicle fencing. In addition, CBP has deployed  additional layers of pedestrian fencing behind the primary border fencing,  including 37 miles of secondary fencing. From fiscal years 2007 through  2015, CBP spent approximately $2.4 billion on tactical infrastructure on  the southwestern border\u2014and about 95 percent, or around $2.3 billion,  was spent on constructing pedestrian and vehicle fencing. CBP officials  reported it will need to spend additional amounts to sustain these  investments over their lifetimes. In 2009, CBP estimated that maintaining  fencing would cost more than $1 billion over 20 years. CBP used  various fencing designs to construct the 654 miles of primary pedestrian  and vehicle border fencing. Figure 2 shows examples of existing  pedestrian fencing deployed along the border.", "In February 2017, we reported that border fencing had benefited border  security operations in various ways, according to the Border Patrol. For  example, according to officials, border fencing improved agent safety,  helped reduce vehicle incursions, and supported Border Patrol agents\u2019  ability to respond to illicit cross-border activities by slowing the progress  of illegal entrants. However, we also found that, despite its investments  over the years, CBP could not measure the contribution of fencing to  border security operations along the southwest border because it had not  developed metrics for this assessment. We reported that CBP collected  data that could help provide insight into how border fencing contributes to  border security operations. For example, we found that CBP collected  data on the location of illegal entries that could provide insight into where  these illegal activities occurred in relation to the location of various  designs of pedestrian and vehicle fencing. We reported that CBP could  potentially use these data to compare the occurrence and location of  illegal entries before and after fence construction, as well as to help  determine the extent to which border fencing contributes to diverting  illegal entrants into more rural and remote environments, and border  fencing\u2019s impact, if any, on apprehension rates over time. Therefore, we  recommended in February 2017 that the Border Patrol develop metrics to  assess the contributions of pedestrian and vehicle fencing to border  security along the southwest border using the data the Border Patrol  already collects and apply this information, as appropriate, when making  investment and resource allocation decisions.

For example, CBP had funding allocated for tactical  infrastructure sustainment requirements, but had not prioritized its  requirements to make the best use of available funding, since CBP also  required contractors to address urgent repair requirements. According to  Border Patrol officials, CBP classifies breaches to fencing, grates, or  gates as urgent and requiring immediate repair because breaches  increase illegal entrants\u2019 ability to enter the country unimpeded. At the  time of our February 2017 review, the majority of urgent tactical  infrastructure repairs on the southwest border were fence breaches,  according to Border Patrol officials. From fiscal years 2010 through 2015,  CBP recorded a total of 9,287 breaches in pedestrian fencing, and repair  costs averaged $784 per breach.", "While contractors provide routine maintenance and address urgent  repairs on tactical infrastructure, certain tactical infrastructure assets used  by the Border Patrol\u2014such as border fencing\u2014become degraded beyond  repair and must be replaced. For example, in February 2017 we reported  that CBP had provided routine maintenance and repair services to the  primary legacy pedestrian fencing in Sunland Park, New Mexico.  However, significant weather events had eroded the foundation of the  fencing, according to the Border Patrol officials in the El Paso sector, and  in 2015 CBP began to replace 1.4 miles of primary pedestrian fence in  this area. We also reported on several additional CBP projects to replace  degraded, legacy pedestrian fencing with more modern, bollard style  fencing. For example, in fiscal year 2016, CBP began removing and  replacing an estimated 7.5 miles of legacy primary pedestrian fencing  with modern bollard style fencing within the Tucson sector. In addition,  from fiscal years 2011 through 2016, CBP completed four fence  replacement projects that replaced 14.1 miles of primary pedestrian  legacy fencing in the Tucson and Yuma sectors at a total cost of  approximately $68.26 million and an average cost of $4.84 million per  mile of replacement fencing.

In addition, officials reported  experiencing some confusion about their roles and responsibilities in this  process. We reported that developing guidance on this process would  provide more reasonable assurance that the process is consistently  followed across the Border Patrol. We therefore recommended that the  Border Patrol develop and implement written guidance to include roles  and responsibilities for the steps within its requirements process for  identifying, funding, and deploying tactical infrastructure assets for border  security operations. The agency concurred with this recommendation and  stated that it planned to update the Requirements Management Process  and, as part of that update, planned to add communication and training  methods and tools to better implement the process.

The memo cited  challenges such as competing with other federal, state, and local law  enforcement organizations for applicants. In particular, the memo noted  that CBP faces hiring and retention challenges compared to DHS\u2019s U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (which is also planning to hire  additional law enforcement personnel) because CBP\u2019s hiring process  requires applicants to take a polygraph examination, Border Patrol agents  are deployed to less desirable duty locations, and Border Patrol agents  generally receive lower compensation.", "In November 2017, we reported that the availability of agents is one key  factor that affects the Border Patrol\u2019s deployment strategy. In particular,  officials from all nine southwest border sectors cited current staffing levels  and the availability of agents as a challenge for optimal deployment. We  reported that, as of May 2017, the Border Patrol had 17,971 authorized  agent positions in southwest border sectors, but only 16,522 of those  positions were filled\u2014a deficit of 1,449 agents\u2014and eight of the nine  southwest border sectors had fewer agents than the number of  authorized positions.

Generally,  sector officials said that the recruitment and retention challenges  associated with particular stations were related to quality of life factors in  the area near the station\u2014for example, agents may not want to live with  their families in an area without a hospital, with low-performing schools, or  with relatively long commutes from their homes to their duty station. This  can affect retention of existing agents, but it may also affect whether a  new agent accepts a position in that location. For example, officials in one  sector said that new agent assignments are not based solely on agency  need, but rather also take into consideration agent preferences. These  officials added that there is the potential that new agents may decline  offers for stations that are perceived as undesirable, or they may resign  their position earlier than they otherwise would to pursue employment in a  more desirable location.
