GAO and inspectors general (IGs) evaluations of agency information security programs, including policies and practices, determined that most agencies did not have effective information security program functions in fiscal year 2016.

OMB, in consultation with other relevant entities, has expanded the use of a maturity model developed by the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency and used to evaluate additional information security performance areas each year. However, OMB and others have not developed a plan and schedule to determine whether using the security capability maturity model will provide useful results that are consistent and comparable.

Hence, securing these systems and data is vital to the nation\u2019s  safety, prosperity, and well-being.", "The emergence of increasingly sophisticated threats and continuous  reporting of cyber incidents underscores the continuing and urgent need  for effective information security. These threats come from a variety of  sources and vary in terms of the types and capabilities of the actors, their  willingness to act, and their motives. For example, advanced persistent  threats\u2014where adversaries possess sophisticated levels of expertise and  significant resources to pursue their objectives\u2014pose increasing risks.", "Further, systems used by federal agencies are often riddled with security  vulnerabilities\u2014both known and unknown.

For fiscal year 2016, the selected agencies were the Departments of  Agriculture, Defense, Housing and Urban Development, and Labor; the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission. For each of our prior three FISMA evaluation  reports, we selected six other agencies to reflect a range in the number  of systems agencies reported having. The six agencies we reviewed for  this current report were selected because they were the remaining  agencies not selected in the prior reporting cycles. While not  generalizable to all agencies, the information we collected and analyzed  about the six selected agencies provided insights into various processes  in place to produce FISMA reports. Based on this assessment, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  reporting objectives.", "To address the second objective we analyzed the FISMA provisions to  identify federal responsibilities for overseeing and providing guidance for  agency information security.

Boundary protection-related deficiencies accounted for 56 of the total 516  access control deficiencies identified. Without appropriately controlling  connectivity to system resources, agencies risk exploitation of network  entry points and access paths by unauthorized users to gain access to  sensitive data.", "The implementation of effective identification and authentication controls  is one of the most widely reported access control weaknesses.  Identification and authentication controls allow a computer system to  identify and authenticate different users so that activities on the system  can be linked to specific individuals. Factors used for authentication  include something you know (password or personal identification  number), something you have (cryptographic identification device or  token), or something you are (biometric). Multifactor authentication  involves using two or more factors to achieve authentication.

Based on the reports analyzed, two agencies  did not meet the PIV implementation requirement for unprivileged users,  five agencies did not meet the requirement for privileged users, and two  agencies did not meet the PIV implementation requirement for both  unprivileged and privileged users. Identification and authentication related  deficiencies accounted for 120 of the 516 total deficiencies found in our  analysis. Without implementing adequate logical access controls to  appropriately identify and authenticate users, agencies cannot prevent  illegitimate users, such as hackers, from accessing systems or restrict  legitimate users to only the systems that they need.", "The implementation of effective authorization controls was a widely  reported access control weakness. Authorization is the process of  granting or denying access rights and permissions to a protected  resource, such as a network, a system, an application, a function, or a  file.

In addition, one agency did not consistently identify, notify, or  remediate security incidents to ensure incidents were resolved in a timely  manner.

We analyzed, categorized, and summarized  weaknesses identified in these reports using the five major categories of  information security general controls identified in our Federal Information  System Controls Audit Manual: (1) access controls, (2) configuration  management controls, (3) segregation of duties, (4) contingency planning,  and (5) security management controls. We also analyzed, categorized,  and summarized the annual FISMA data submissions for fiscal year 2016  by each agency\u2019s inspector general.

To select these agencies for each of our  prior three FISMA evaluation reports, we sorted the 24 major agencies  from highest to lowest using the total number of systems each agency  had reported each year; separated them into even categories of large,  medium, and small agencies; then selected the median two agencies  from each category. For fiscal year 2016, the Departments of Agriculture, Defense, Housing and Urban Development, and Labor; the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration; and the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission were the remaining agencies not selected in prior reporting  cycles. To assess the reliability of the agency-submitted data, we  collected and analyzed documentation of agencies\u2019 FISMA reporting  processes to determine if they were effective in ensuring the quality of the  information reported for FISMA. We also conducted interviews with  agency officials to get an understanding of the quality control processes  in place to produce the annual FISMA reports. As appropriate, we also  interviewed officials from OMB, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

We collected documentation of coordination between  DHS, OMB, and the IGs to update and refine the FISMA reporting  metrics.
