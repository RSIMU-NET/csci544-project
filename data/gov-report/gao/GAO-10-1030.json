Tin, tantalum, and tungsten follow a similar supply chain; they are mined by hand, sold to small-scale traders, carried by porters, transported by truck or airplane to the border, and sold to trading houses for export. The minerals transit DRC's neighbors, such as Rwanda, and most are processed in Asia and used in technology products, such as mobile telephones. In contrast, according to U.S. officials and others, most gold is smuggled out of the DRC and is ultimately used by the jewelry industry. Illegal armed groups and some Congolese national military units commit human rights abuses and are involved in the minerals trade. A UN official stated that approximately 50 percent of the reported human rights abuses are committed by Congolese army units; many soldiers in these units have committed violations in the past as rebels, are poorly integrated into the Congolese military, and are consistently unpaid. To varying degrees, illegal armed groups and some military units illicitly tax minerals at mines and mineral transport routes, but they also make money illicitly taxing other trades, such as trade in charcoal and timber. The minerals trade is not the root cause but one of many factors perpetuating the conflict. The United States and the international community, particularly the UN, are working to help control the illicit minerals trade, but many efforts are in the preliminary stage. State issued a \"white paper\" and produced a map of mines and armed groups, but both should be improved. The white paper lacks concrete, actionable steps regarding U.S. contribution to help control the trade, and the map presents data that need updating to enhance its usefulness. Provisions in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Pub. L. No. 111-203) underscore the importance of U.S. agencies taking action to help address the trade. The UN has made efforts to help control the trade by imposing sanctions, deploying expert teams, and developing mineral training centers. Others, such as a global tin industry association and the DRC government, have also made efforts, but these efforts are in the early stage. Significant challenges, which are yet to be addressed, exist to monitoring and controlling the minerals trade, including tracking the mine of origin. For example, many mines are in remote areas, lack road access, and are occupied by armed groups, making it challenging to monitor mine activities. Tracking the origin of minerals will rely on DRC mining officials, but these officials suffer from a lack of skills and from corruption. U.S. and foreign officials and others said that lack of security, weak governance, and lack of infrastructure in eastern DRC are significant challenges that, unless addressed, will likely impede efforts to control the minerals trade. Addressing these challenges requires measures to reform the security sector, improve governance, and invest in infrastructure, but little progress has been made in these areas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of State, in consultation with relevant agencies, (1) provide concrete, actionable steps to help control the minerals trade, including addressing lack of security, governance, and infrastructure, and (2) work with relevant stakeholders to periodically update information on mines and armed groups.

During the Mobutu regime, the nation\u2019s productive capacity shrank and its  ethnic tensions grew. Following the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,  perpetrators of the genocide and refugees fled into eastern DRC.", "The Mobutu regime was toppled in 1997 by Laurent Kabila, who led a rebel  group from eastern DRC with the assistance of Rwanda and Uganda.  Kabila was assassinated in 2001 and leadership shifted to his son, Joseph  Kabila. During the period of the senior Kabila\u2019s regime, the nation  experienced a period of civil war during which numerous rebel groups\u2014- with the assistance of Rwanda, Uganda, and other neighboring countries\u2014 -captured significant parts of the DRC. The war continued into the regime  of Joseph Kabila, and it is estimated that by 2004, about 4 million people  had died as a result of the conflict.", "To deal with the humanitarian crisis in the DRC, the UN has had a large  commitment to the DRC in the MONUSCO peacekeeping force, which has  been in place since 1999. MONUSCO has grown from an initial force of  about 5,500 troops to over 18,500 troops in 2010. Included within its broad  mission, MONUSCO is to facilitate civilian protection, humanitarian  assistance, and human rights monitoring\u2014-with particular attention to  vulnerable groups, including women, children, and demobilized child  soldiers. Among multiple priorities, MONUSCO is to monitor the  implementation and compliance with measures to curtail the provision of  support that illegal armed groups derive from their involvement in the  trade of natural resources. MONUSCO also has provided logistical support  for Congolese national military efforts to eradicate illegal armed groups  from mining areas.", "After decades of instability and years of war, the central government in  Kinshasa currently has little administrative capacity and even less control  over remote regions, such as eastern DRC. The lack of control is  exacerbated by the long distances and the rudimentary infrastructure,  which make transportation and communication difficult.

To address these objectives, we  reviewed and analyzed various reports, memorandums, and other  documents from relevant U.S. agencies; foreign governments; multilateral  organizations, such as the United Nations (UN); nongovernmental  organizations; and industry organizations. We interviewed officials from  the Department of State (State), the Department of Defense, the United  States Agency for International Development, the Department of the  Treasury (Treasury), and the Office of the United States Trade  Representative.", "We reviewed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act of 2010; Treasury\u2019s DRC sanctions regulations; State  documents and reports, including State Country Reports on Human Rights;  United States Geological Survey\u2019s Mineral Commodities Summaries and  Minerals Yearbooks; other documents, cables, reports, and memorandums  from relevant U.S. agencies; reports issued by the UN Group of Experts on  the DRC; and World Bank reports and program documents. We also  reviewed various documents and reports on the global tin association\u2019s tin  traceability initiative for eastern DRC. In addition, we reviewed numerous  reports by nongovernmental agencies, subject matter experts, and  academics on a variety of issues related to eastern DRC.", "During the course of our review, we traveled to London (United Kingdom),  Brussels (Belgium), Goma (eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo),  and Kigali (Rwanda) and interviewed U.S. agency officials, various foreign  government officials, officials from multilateral organizations, and  representatives from both western and local nongovernmental  organizations and industry. We also interviewed UN officials, United  Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of  the Congo (MONUSCO) officials, and U.S. officials of the United States  Mission to the United Nations in New York. We interviewed a number of  current and former members of the UN Group of Experts panels. The UN  and MONUSCO, in particular, have had a substantial, long-term presence  in eastern DRC for the past decade that positions them as the leading  subject matter experts on the situation on the ground in eastern DRC. The  Human Rights Division of MONUSCO, the United Nations Joint Human  Rights Office, has operated on the ground in the DRC since 1996 and  monitors, investigates, and reports on human rights abuses by means of its  in-country network, which includes more than 120 human rights officers  throughout the DRC; military observers; and working relationships with  nongovernmental organizations. Also, the UN Panel of Experts and,  subsequently, the UN Group of Experts have examined the link between  natural resource exploitation in the DRC and conflict since 2000.", "Because of the inaccessibility of many locations in eastern DRC and the  mining sites, in particular, our analysis of conditions in mining areas is  based largely on in-depth research and site visits conducted by  representatives from various western and local nongovernmental  organizations, UN officials, U.S. and foreign government officials, and  international subject matter experts.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 to September  2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. These standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Godwin Agbara, Assistant  Director; Ian Ferguson; Qahira El\u2019Amin; Michael Hoffman; Ernie Jackson;  and Karen Deans made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
