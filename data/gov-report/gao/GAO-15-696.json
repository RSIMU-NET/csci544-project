Participants are required to invest $1 million in a business that is to create at least 10 jobs--or $500,000 for businesses located in an area that is rural or has experienced unemployment of at least 150 percent of the national average rate. Upon meeting program requirements, immigrant investors are eligible for conditional status to live and work in the United States and can apply to remove the conditions for lawful permanent residency after 2 years.", "GAO was asked to review fraud risks and economic benefits for the EB-5 Program. This report examines USCIS efforts under the EB-5 Program to (1) work with interagency partners to assess fraud and other related risks, (2) address any identified fraud risks, and (3) increase its capacity to verify job creation and use a valid and reliable methodology to report economic benefits. GAO reviewed risk assessments and processes to address fraud risks, verify job creation, and report economic benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) administers the Employment-Based Fifth Preference Immigrant Investor Program (EB-5 Program) and collaborated with its interagency partners to assess fraud and national security risks in the program in fiscal years 2012 and 2015. Unique fraud risks identified in the program included uncertainties in verifying that the funds invested were obtained lawfully and various investment-related schemes to defraud investors. These assessments were onetime efforts; however, USCIS officials noted that fraud risks in the EB-5 Program are constantly evolving, and they continually identify new fraud schemes. USCIS does not have documented plans to conduct regular future risk assessments, in accordance with fraud prevention practices, which could help inform efforts to identify and address evolving program risks.", "USCIS has taken steps to address the fraud risks it identified by enhancing its fraud risk management efforts, including establishing a dedicated entity to oversee these efforts. However, USCIS's information systems and processes limit its ability to collect and use data on EB-5 Program participants to address fraud risks in the program. For example, USCIS does not consistently enter some information it collects on participants in its information systems, such as name and date of birth, a fact that presents barriers to conducting basic electronic searches that could be analyzed for potential fraud, such as schemes to defraud investors. USCIS plans to collect and maintain more complete data in its new information system; however, GAO reported in May 2015 that the new system is nearly 4 years delayed. In the meantime, USCIS does not have a strategy for collecting additional information, including some information on businesses supported by EB-5 Program investments, that officials noted could help mitigate fraud, such as misrepresentation of new businesses. Given that information system improvements with the potential to expand USCIS's fraud mitigation efforts will not take effect until 2017 at the earliest and that gaps exist in USCIS's other information collection efforts, developing a strategy for collecting such information would better position USCIS to identify and mitigate potential fraud.", "USCIS increased its capacity to verify job creation by increasing the size and expertise of its workforce and providing clarifying guidance and training, among other actions. However, USCIS's methodology for reporting program outcomes and overall economic benefits is not valid and reliable because it may understate or overstate program benefits in certain instances as it is based on the minimum program requirements of 10 jobs and a $500,000 investment per investor instead of the number of jobs and investment amounts collected by USCIS on individual EB-5 Program forms. For example, USCIS reported 4,500 jobs for 450 investors on one project using its methodology instead of 10,500 jobs reported on EB-5 Program forms for that project. Further, investment amounts are not adjusted for investors who do not complete the program or invest $1 million instead of $500,000. USCIS officials said they are not statutorily required to develop a more comprehensive assessment. However, tracking and analyzing data on jobs and investments reported on program forms would better position USCIS to more reliably assess and report on the EB-5 Program economic benefits."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that, among other things, USCIS conduct regular future risk assessments, develop a strategy to expand information collection, and analyze the data collected on program forms to reliably report on economic benefits.

This category, commonly referred  to as Employment-Based Fifth Preference (EB-5), is for employment  creation by qualified immigrants seeking to enter the United States to   Upon meeting certain EB-5  engage in a new commercial enterprise.Immigrant Investor Program (EB-5 Program) requirements\u2014including  investing $1 million (or $500,000 in targeted employment areas) in a new  commercial enterprise that will result in the creation of at least 10 full-time  jobs\u2014immigrant investors and their eligible dependents are eligible to  receive 2-year conditional green cards to live and work in the United  States. Within the 90-day period prior to the second anniversary of the  date on which an immigrant investor obtained conditional status, he or  she can apply to remove the conditional basis of his or her green card.  Approximately 10,000 EB-5 visas per fiscal year are made available to  qualified immigrant investors and their families seeking to immigrate to  the United States through the EB-5 Program.", "Under the EB-5 Regional Center Program, first enacted as a pilot in 1992  and reauthorized seven times since, a certain number of the EB-5 visas  are set aside annually for immigrant investors in economic units called  regional centers, which are established to promote economic growth.  Most recently, the Regional Center Program was extended until  September 30, 2015, and the term \u201cpilot\u201d was removed from the name of  the program. Under the Regional Center Program, immigrant investors  can pool their investments with those of other foreign and U.S. investors  to fund a new commercial enterprise within a regional center. An  immigrant investor in any new commercial enterprise, including under the  Regional Center Program, can meet the requirement that he or she be  engaged in the management of that enterprise, as opposed to  maintaining a purely passive role, if he or she is, for example, a limited  partner of a limited partnership. Immigrant investors must demonstrate  that their investment in a new commercial enterprise will result in the  creation or, in the case of a troubled business, preservation or creation  (or some combination of the two), of at least 10 full-time positions for  qualifying employees. Immigrant investors in a regional center  commercial enterprise may meet the statutory employment creation  requirement by providing evidence of creating or preserving, either  directly or indirectly, 10 full-time positions. In recent years, the Regional  Center Program has increased in popularity as a viable source of low- interest funding for major real estate development projects, such as the  Barclays Center\u2014a multipurpose indoor arena in Brooklyn, New York\u2014 and the Marriott Convention Center Hotel in Washington, D.C. In fiscal  year 2014, the maximum number of visas available were allocated for the  EB-5 Program\u2014approximately 10,000 annually, with about 95 percent of  the investments in regional center projects.", "Several federal and state agencies are involved to varying degrees in  ensuring the integrity of the EB-5 Program. The Immigrant Investor  Program Office (IPO), within the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), administers  the EB-5 Program\u2014adjudicating applications and petitions while striving  to ensure that program participants, including immigrant investors and  principals operating U.S. regional centers, comply with program  requirements. USCIS also has a Fraud Detection and National Security  (FDNS) unit charged with preventing, detecting, and responding to  allegations of fraud in the program. States contribute to the EB-5  process\u2014in relation to investors seeking a reduced investment of  $500,000 in a targeted employment area\u2014by certifying through the state  government\u2019s authorized body that the geographic or political subdivision  in which the enterprise is, or will be principally doing business, has been  designated a high-unemployment area. After USCIS approves initial  petitions for immigrant investors to participate in the program, the  Department of State (State) adjudicates the immigrant visa applications,  conducting background checks and other activities to help ensure  investors and their families comply with national security and other  requirements for admission to the United States. FDNS refers cases of  fraud related to immigrant investors to DHS\u2019s U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) for  investigation. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  investigates allegations of fraud or other misconduct in connection with  securities offerings related to EB-5 projects by U.S. principals operating  regional centers, or others. The Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as the lead federal agency for combating  terrorism, investigates any activity by investors or regional centers that  may pose a risk to national security as well as other criminal activities.", "In 2005, we reported that, among other things, USCIS had not issued  implementing regulations to adjudicate hundreds of pending EB-5  petitions and applications. Specifically, we reported that USCIS  suspended about 900 EB-5 applications in 1998 because the financial  arrangements in the applications did not comport with the statute and  program regulations, and that guidance to adjudicators was unclear on  how to determine the type and value of benefit to the U.S. economy for  different types of investments. DHS concurred with our recommendation  to finalize and issue regulations, publishing a proposed rule in the Federal   However, as of June 2015, USCIS officials said that  Register in 2011.they had not finalized these regulations because of competing priorities.", "The DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) has also issued two reports  on the EB-5 Program. Specifically, in December 2013, the DHS OIG  reported that several conditions had prevented USCIS from administering  and managing the EB-5 Program effectively. These conditions, as cited  by the report, included, among other things, laws and regulations that do  not give USCIS the authority to prevent a regional center\u2019s participation in  the program on the basis of fraud or national security concerns. The  report concluded that because of difficulties ensuring the integrity of the  Regional Center Program, USCIS was limited in its ability to prevent fraud  or national security threats and could not demonstrate that the program  was benefiting the U.S. economy and creating full-time employment as  required by law. Further, in March 2015, the DHS OIG conducted an  investigation of employee complaints about the EB-5 Program and  reported that the former director\u2019s communication with external  stakeholders on specific matters outside the normal procedures, coupled  with favorable action that deviated from the regulatory scheme, had  created an appearance of favoritism and special access. The DHS  Secretary, in response to the OIG findings, acknowledged the popularity  of the program as an economic development tool but also expressed  concerns about the program and asked Congress for help in  strengthening the program\u2019s integrity. He noted that in the past, DHS  had unsuccessfully sought a number of statutory enhancements to the  program\u2019s integrity and urged Congress to work with the department to  strengthen the security and integrity of the program.", "You asked us to review the fraud risks and economic benefits for the EB- 5 Program. This report addresses the following questions:", "To what extent have USCIS and its interagency partners assessed  fraud risks and other related risks in the EB-5 Program and what risks  did they identify?", "To what extent has USCIS implemented efforts to address any  identified fraud risks in the EB-5 Program?", "To what extent has USCIS increased its capacity to verify job creation  and used valid and reliable methodologies for reporting program  outcomes and overall economic benefits?", "To determine the extent to which USCIS and its interagency partners  have assessed fraud risks in the EB-5 Program and what risks they have  identified, we examined past audit findings by GAO and DHS OIG, and  reviewed fraud risk assessments conducted by DHS, USCIS, State, SEC,  FBI, and ICE HSI. We interviewed USCIS, SEC, FBI, and ICE HSI  headquarters officials and analyzed USCIS processes, procedures, and  training for detecting, preventing, and investigating fraud and compared  them against standards in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government, GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Management Framework, and GAO\u2019s  Strategies to Manage Improper Payments. To gain the perspective of  Regional Center Program participants on the types and prevalence of  fraud in the program, we also interviewed the principals of two regional  centers located in proximity to USCIS headquarters and the USCIS  California Service Center, which we visited because it was primarily  responsible for administering the EB-5 Program prior to the program\u2019s  transfer to USCIS headquarters\u2019 new Immigrant Investor Program Office.  We also interviewed officials about fraud risks in the EB-5 Program from a  national industry association representing EB-5 Program regional centers  and a national immigration lawyers association in Washington, D.C., as  well as SEC and ICE officials in California during our site visit to the  USCIS California Service Center. Although the information from these  interviews and the site visit is not representative of all EB-5 industry  stakeholders\u2019 perspectives, they provided insights into the fraud risks and  vulnerabilities of the program. We also reviewed a nonprobability sample  of 28 EB-5 Program files for immigrant investors and regional centers  USCIS approved to participate in the program to identify any potential  fraud indicators and review internal controls. While the files we reviewed  are not representative of all completed and approved applications and  petitions, they did provide us with information about different immigrant  investor and regional center circumstances.", "To determine the extent to which USCIS has implemented efforts to  address any identified fraud risks in the EB-5 Program, we examined  agency action to address past DHS OIG and ICE HSI risk assessment  findings and evaluated the information systems and standard operating  procedures that USCIS adjudicators use for evaluating EB-5 petitions and  applications and that FDNS officials use for identifying, preventing, and  addressing fraud risks. We also evaluated USCIS\u2019s internal quality  assurance capabilities as well as its records management and data  storage capabilities. To gain perspective on how EB-5 Program  processes have changed over time to address fraud risks, during our site  visit to the USCIS California Service Center, we interviewed six officials  who formerly adjudicated EB-5 Program petitions and applications. We  also interviewed a nonprobability sample of 16 current adjudicators and 8  economists in IPO to identify efforts taken to identify and address fraud in  the program. We selected the adjudicators and economists based on  factors such as length of employment with USCIS, grade level, and the  type of EB-5 Program forms they adjudicate. While the adjudicators and  economists we interviewed are not representative of all EB-5 adjudicators  and economists, from the interviews we were able to gain insights into  USCIS\u2019s efforts to identify and address fraud, among other aspects of EB- 5 Program adjudication. We also interviewed FDNS and IPO supervisory  officials to identify specific corrective actions USCIS has taken or plans to  take to address fraud risks in the program. We compared the results with  standards identified in Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal  Government and GAO\u2019s Fraud Framework, which have established  requirements and identified leading practices for addressing fraud risks.", "To determine the extent to which USCIS has increased its capacity to  verify job creation and uses valid and reliable methodologies to report  program outcomes and overall economic benefit, (1) we assessed the  changes in USCIS workforce, guidance, training, and the petition  adjudication process to address past audit findings reported by GAO and  the DHS OIG; (2) reviewed the methodology used by USCIS to report the  total amount of investment and number of jobs created through the  program; and (3) reviewed the statement of work for a contracted study  on the program\u2019s economic impact. We interviewed IPO management as  well as a nonprobability sample of 24 adjudicators, including 8  economists chosen for the reasons previously discussed, about their  views on the adequacy of the guidance and training provided by USCIS,  and their access to the data and information they needed to verify job  creation reported by immigrant investor petitioners and regional center  applicants. The views of these adjudicators and economists cannot be  generalized to all USCIS adjudicators and economists, but provided us  with insights into the quality of the guidance and training on verifying job  creation estimates. For the process USCIS used to adjudicate immigrant  investor petitions associated with regional center projects, we also  reviewed economic models used by immigrant investors and USCIS to  estimate the number of jobs to be created by the project when petitioning  to participate in the program as well as other methods for verifying the  number of jobs created when a petitioner seeks to remove the conditional  basis of his or her green card. To assess the models, we reviewed the  underlying economic assumptions and data as well as past studies and  audits identifying limitations in use of the models for the EB-5 Program.  We also interviewed subject matter experts to include academic  researchers in urban and economic development, a policy research think  tank, a state economic development agency, and Department of  Commerce (Commerce) officials responsible for administering the  Regional Input-Output Modeling System (RIMS II model). This system is  widely used across the private and public sectors, including USCIS, and  is considered to be among those valid for verifying job creation estimates  reported by program participants within regional centers. We selected  these experts to interview because they have reviewed various aspects of  the program, written published articles, or have a role in the EB-5  Program.", "To determine the extent to which USCIS\u2019s methodology for reporting  program outcomes is valid and reliable, we compared how USCIS  compiles numbers for total jobs created by the EB-5 Program and the  dollar amount of EB-5 Program investments against the information  included in EB-5 Program petitions and verified by USCIS throughout the  adjudication process. We compared USCIS\u2019s methodology against  guidance in GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government and requirements in the Project Management Institute\u2019s The  Standard for Program Management for programs to establish monitoring  and controlling activities to report on program performance. In regard to  USCIS\u2019s plans to fund a contracted study reporting on the overall  economic impact of the EB-5 Program, we also interviewed USCIS  officials as well as officials at Commerce with whom USCIS has  established a memorandum of agreement to study the program\u2019s  economic impact, to identify the study methodology and data inputs. We  compared the planned methodology for this study against Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-94, Guidelines and Discount  Rates for Benefit-Cost Analysis of Federal Programs, which applies to all  analyses used to support government decisions to initiate, renew, or  expand programs or projects that would result in a series of measurable  benefits or cost.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2014 through August  2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

For example, in 2012, USCIS  met with its interagency partners and National Security Staff to assess  fraud and national security risks in the EB-5 Program. An internal memo  discussing this effort also highlighted steps that USCIS was undertaking  to mitigate fraud risks to the program, such as improving collaboration  with law enforcement agencies such as SEC and FBI. In response to this  assessment, later in 2012, USCIS worked with FBI and the Department of  the Treasury\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),among others, to better understand the scope of EB-5 Program fraud  risks and to assess the benefits of incorporating enhanced security  screenings to improve its vetting of EB-5 Program petitioners. FDNS  officials told us that one key determination of the study was the need to  provide dedicated fraud personnel to the EB-5 Program, which, as  discussed later, USCIS implemented. Most recently, in early 2015, DHS\u2019s  Office of Intelligence and Analysis prepared a classified report updating  the program\u2019s 2012 risk assessment, in response to congressional and  USCIS requests, which assessed the fraud risks to the EB-5 Program.", "In addition to conducting these risk assessments, USCIS officials told us  that they identify potential fraud stemming from the EB-5 Program  through regular oversight work such as producing reports on investors\u2019  sources of funds. Additionally, law enforcement agencies such as ICE  HSI, SEC, and FBI may also uncover fraud through their own  investigative efforts and, as appropriate, will share this information with  USCIS.", "FDNS officials noted that fraud risks and schemes in the EB-5 Program  were constantly evolving, and that updating their 2015 risk assessment  helped them better understand the nature and scope of fraud risks to the  program. Further, FDNS officials stated that the office constantly identifies  new fraud schemes, and that they must work to stay on top of emerging  issues. SEC training materials for EB-5 Program staff on securities fraud  also stated that fraud scams are creative and constantly changing, and  may make use of new distribution channels such as social media.  Moreover, as noted previously, the program has grown substantially over  time\u2014the total number of EB-5 visas issued increased from almost 3,000  in fiscal year 2011 to over 9,000 in fiscal year 2014, according to State  data; this creates additional opportunities for fraud.", "Although the risk assessments conducted by USCIS and other agencies  have helped provide information to USCIS to better understand and  manage risks to the EB-5 Program, these assessments were onetime  exercises, and USCIS does not have documented plans to conduct  regular future risk assessments of the program because, according to  USCIS officials, the agency would perform them on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis.  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides  guidance on the importance of identifying and analyzing risks, and using  that information to make decisions. These standards address various  aspects of internal control that should be continuous, built-in components  of organizational operations. One internal control standard, risk  assessment, calls for identifying and analyzing risks that agencies face  from internal and external sources and deciding what actions should be  taken to manage these risks. The standards indicate that conditions  governing risk continually change and mechanisms are required to  ensure that risk information, such as vulnerabilities in the program,  remains current and relevant. Such mechanisms could include periodic  risk assessment updates. Moreover, our executive guide for helping  agencies identify effective strategies to manage improper payments notes  the importance of periodically updating risk assessments because of  constant changes in governmental, economic, industry, regulatory, and  operating conditions that can affect program risks in their programs.  Information collected through periodic reviews, as well as daily  operations, can inform the analysis and assessment of risk. Furthermore,  DHS\u2019s Risk Management Fundamentals states that DHS and its  component agencies should use a risk-based approach when managing  programs that includes, among other things, identifying potential risks,  assessing and analyzing identified risks, and using risk information and  analysis to inform decision making. Planned regular or updated future  risk assessments could help better position USCIS to identify, evaluate,  and address fraud risks given the potential for changing conditions.", "Unlawful Source of Petitioner Funds  As one example, Fraud Detection and  National Security (FDNS) Directorate officials  told us about a case in which a petitioner did  not report potential financial ties to a number  of brothels in China, which would have raised  questions about the legitimacy of the  petitioner\u2019s source of funds.

In addition, ICE  HSI headquarters officials provided us with cases of immigrant investors  using overseas preparers to submit counterfeit documentation to  fraudulently show that funds were lawfully obtained, which can make  determining the legitimacy of the source of funds challenging. Further,  ICE HSI officials stated that they are concerned that overseas document  preparers and recruiters may try to use increasingly sophisticated  methods to circumvent program controls. USCIS officials said that IPO  and FDNS did not have a means to verify self-reported immigrant  financial information with many foreign banks. In addition, both USCIS  and State officials noted that they did not have authority to verify banking  information with many foreign countries. For example, State officials said  that because the U.S. government lacks access to many foreign financial  systems, there is no reliable method to verify the source of the funds of  petitioners.", "Legitimacy of investment entity. The amount of investment required to  participate in the EB-5 Program, coupled with the fact that EB-5 investors  are making an investment in order to obtain an immigration benefit, can  create fraud risks tied to unscrupulous regional center operators and  intermediaries. According to SEC officials, they have identified instances  of fraudulent investment schemes, including securities fraud, related to  EB-5 investments. From January 2013 through January 2015, SEC  officials reported receiving over 100 tips, complaints, and referrals related  to possible securities fraud violations and the EB-5 Program. Just over   half of these tips, complaints, and referrals resulted in further investigation  by SEC staff or were referred to other state, local, or federal law  enforcement agencies for further review. According to an SEC official,  as of July 2015, SEC has initiated four civil enforcement actions alleging  securities law violations by EB-5 Program participants. Moreover,  according to FDNS documentation, as of May 2015, over half (35) of the  59 open investigations tracked by the program primarily involved  securities fraud issues. In addition, SEC officials noted that immigrant  investors may be vulnerable to fraud schemes because they may be  primarily focused on obtaining their visas. SEC officials noted that,  anecdotally, immigrant investors often accepted lower rates of return on  their investment relative to other non-EB-5 Program investors in the same  project as well as non-EB-5 Program investment opportunities. A 2015  academic study reported that EB-5 Program loans bear a lower overall  interest rate than conventional loans because the immigrant investors are  motivated by the visa rather than the maximization of financial returns.SEC officials said that investors sometimes did not exercise due diligence  about their investment decisions, thus increasing the likelihood that  immigrant investors could be taken advantage of by unscrupulous  regional centers through fraud schemes or by being steered toward poor  investments. Moreover, SEC officials told us that the U.S. government is  limited in its ability to investigate foreign-based sales and marketing  practices of EB-5 Program investment opportunities and that unrealistic or  patently false promises are sometimes made to investors. For example,  SEC cases have uncovered incidents of regional center principals  defrauding prospective immigrant investors by misrepresenting the  business investment. Additionally, USCIS and ICE HSI officials all  reported that it can be difficult to verify whether funds are being invested  in projects and commercial enterprises as reported in immigrant investor  petitions and regional center applications and immigrant investors may  also be involved in schemes to fraudulently portray job creation or  economic activity. For example, ICE HSI officials reported on a 2014  investigation related to a business enterprise that did not provide  employees any work and told the employees to sit in an office during  business hours. In another example cited by ICE HSI, in 2013, an alleged  future EB-5 Program hotel project site was actually a vacant lot; the  owner of the location was not aware of any plans to build a hotel there.", "Appearance of favoritism and special access. The DHS OIG reported  in March 2015 that a previous USCIS director had created an appearance  of favoritism by providing certain petitioners and stakeholders with special  access to DHS leadership and preferential treatment for their EB-5   The OIG report also stated that Program applications or petitions. according to USCIS whistleblower allegations, which the OIG  corroborated in some cases, the former director created special  processes and revised existing policies in the EB-5 Program to  accommodate specific parties. According to the OIG, if not for the  intervention of the then director, the career staff at USCIS would have  decided adjudication matters differently. According to the OIG report,  some USCIS employees felt uncomfortable and pressured to comply with  managers\u2019 instructions that appeared to have come from the former  director or those working directly for him. Not consistently following  standard processes designed to identify potential fraud and other risks in  adjudicating applications can increase the likelihood that those with  criminal ties or those making fraudulent investments will go unnoticed. It  may also create a control environment tolerant of not adhering to risk  mitigation processes and could reduce trust and transparency in the  overall adjudication process. Although the OIG report did not make  specific recommendations, following its issuance, the DHS Secretary  expressed further concerns about the program and asked Congress for  help to strengthen the security and integrity of the program, stating that  the EB-5 Program was frequently contacted by outsiders on behalf of  those with an interest in the outcome of a particular EB-5 Program case.  The DHS Secretary also announced the creation of a new protocol to help  prevent the reality or perception of improper outside influence in the EB-5  Program. As of June 2015, USCIS officials had developed the protocol  and anticipate that it will be fully implemented by August 2015.", "Given these identified fraud risks, and the constantly evolving nature of  risks to the program, planning and conducting regular fraud risk  assessments of the EB-5 Program could better position USCIS to identify  and evaluate emerging fraud risks to the program and address and  mitigate these risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Has Taken Some Steps to Address Fraud Risks, but Additional Controls Could Improve Fraud Prevention and Detection", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USCIS Has Taken Some Steps to Enhance Its Fraud Risk Management Efforts", "paragraphs": ["USCIS has taken some steps to enhance its fraud risk management  efforts, including creating an organizational structure conducive to fraud  risk management, establishing a dedicated entity to design and oversee  its fraud risk management activities, conducting fraud awareness training,  and establishing collaborative relationships with external stakeholders,  including law enforcement agencies.", "USCIS established an organizational structure to better address  fraud risks. In 2013, USCIS restructured the organization of its EB-5  Program operations to help better detect fraud, moving EB-5 Program  activities from its California Service Center office and centralizing these  operations in USCIS headquarters\u2019 new Immigrant Investor Program  Office in Washington, D.C. As of June 2015, nearly all EB-5 adjudication  operations are now colocated in Washington, D.C., with the exception of  adjudication for Form I-485 applications from immigrant investors who are  already in the United States under other lawful immigration status and  who are applying to adjust their status to conditional permanent residency  under the EB-5 visa category. USCIS officials indicated they plan to move  adjudication of the Form I-485 applications from the California Service  Center to the National Benefits Center in Lee\u2019s Summit, Missouri, by the  end of 2015. These officials stated that because USCIS is primarily  paper-driven, colocation also allows for relatively more efficient handling  and examination of files for fraud and other risks. In November 2013,  USCIS also established a fraud specialist unit for the EB-5 Program  within FDNS. FDNS officials said that they increased the number of fraud  specialists and hired individuals with specialized skill sets in areas that  they consider critical to fraud prevention, including economics, finance,  immigration, and national security, as well as relevant language skills. As  of May 2015, FDNS was in the process of hiring an additional 8 dedicated  staff with specialized fraud expertise to enhance its EB-5 Program fraud  detection capabilities and oversight, which will bring the total authorized  FDNS EB-5 staff from 13 to 21.", "USCIS established fraud awareness training. GAO\u2019s fraud control  framework states that providing training on fraud awareness and potential  fraud schemes to all key government staff is important in stopping fraud.  FDNS\u2019s training of its employees includes specialized fraud training. For  instance, as of May 2015, FDNS had sent 8 of its 12 staff to Federal Law  Enforcement Training Centers for specific training on detecting money  laundering following an introductory course provided in headquarters in  May 2014. FDNS has also developed an \u201cEB-5 University\u201d to provide  staff with monthly presentations on specific fraud-related topics believed  to be immediately relevant to adjudication of EB-5 Program petitions and  applications. USCIS held six sessions from August 2014 through January  2015, each of which addressed a different issue, including an overview of  FinCEN and the use of external agency data for investigating potential  fraud.", "USCIS took steps to improve law enforcement collaboration. USCIS  took steps to improve its level of coordination related to EB-5 fraud risk  with SEC, ICE HSI, and FBI. USCIS does not generally conduct  enforcement actions and therefore coordinates with, and also makes  referrals to, law enforcement when it detects potential fraud, criminal  activity, or national security threats. According to SEC, ICE HSI, FBI, and  USCIS officials, USCIS has increased its level of coordination with law  enforcement agencies to cross-train staff with additional expertise. For  example, in September 2014 USCIS held an interagency symposium to  encourage collaboration among the government partners that have a  stake in the EB-5 Program. These officials also said that USCIS has  established more reliable avenues of communication among the  agencies, which has led to increased communication and collaboration on  referrals, investigations, and enforcement actions that can be taken when  potential threats and fraud are detected in the EB-5 Program. As of May  2015, USCIS was also finalizing a memorandum of understanding with  the Department of the Treasury\u2019s FinCEN to improve USCIS\u2019s ease of  access to information related to financial fraud and related criminal  activity. Moreover, since consolidating operations in Washington, D.C.,  USCIS officials stated that they have expanded the scope of their  background checks to include a greater number of individuals associated  with EB-5 investments and have increased the number of databases used  to examine individuals considered high risk.

While improvements to USCIS information  systems are delayed, USCIS has taken alternative steps to gather  information to mitigate fraud risk, such as expanding its site visits  program to include random checks of the operation of EB-5 Program  projects. However, opportunities remain to expand information collection  through interviews with immigrant investors and expanded EB-5 Program  petition and application forms.", "Limitations in electronic data on EB-5 Program regional center  applicants and immigrant investors. USCIS relies heavily on paper- based documentation. While USCIS contractors and employees are to  enter certain information from these paper documents into various  electronic databases, these databases have limitations that reduce their  usefulness for conducting fraud-mitigating activities. For example,  information that could be useful in identifying program participants linked  to potential fraud is not required to be entered into USCIS\u2019s database,  such as the applicant\u2019s name, address, and date of birth on the Form I- 924 used to apply for regional center participation in the EB-5 Program.Moreover, FDNS officials told us that some data fields are also not  standardized, a fact that presents significant barriers to conducting basic  fraud-related searches. For example, the \u201cgeographic location\u201d field,  which USCIS personnel use to record where a regional center intends to  operate, variously contains counties, parishes, cities, states, ZIP codes,  census tracts, and other abbreviations. USCIS\u2019s rules guiding data entry  leave many form fields \u201coptional\u201d in USCIS data-systems because,  according to USCIS officials, the adjudication is completed from the paper  application forms, so USCIS considers entering these data unnecessary.  However, including such information in USCIS databases could better  position USCIS to use information on investors to assess whether any  potential fraud may exist with individual investors or across the program  and initiate appropriate mitigating actions. For example, including in  USCIS databases information on regional center principals and other  Regional Center Program participants that is not consistently recorded in  those databases, such as name and date of birth, could help USCIS  better identify specific individuals who may be targeted for or are under  investigation. Further, more standardized information in USCIS  databases, such as for the geographic locations of regional centers, could  help the agency better identify and assess any potential regional center  fraud trends, for example, within and across geographic areas.", "USCIS officials stated that the agency will be able to collect and maintain  more readily available data on EB-5 Program petitioners and applicants  through the deployment of electronic forms in its new system, the  Electronic Immigration System (USCIS ELIS). USCIS officials told us in  May 2015 that they expect USCIS ELIS capabilities for the EB-5 Program  to become functional in 2017. However, USCIS has faced long-standing  challenges in implementing USCIS ELIS, a fact that raises questions  about its eventual deployment and thus the extent to which it will position  USCIS to collect and maintain more readily available data. As we  reported in May 2015, USCIS ELIS is nearly 4 years delayed and  program costs increased by over $1 billion. In March 2012, USCIS began to significantly change its acquisition strategy to address various  technical challenges with the system, and these changes have  significantly delayed the program\u2019s planned schedule. Changes made to  the program\u2019s acquisition strategy were intended to help mitigate past  technical and programmatic challenges; however, at the time of our  review, the plans had not yet been approved and USCIS was operating  without a current and approved acquisition program baseline. USCIS  subsequently approved the plans for an acquisition program re-baseline  in May 2015. However, as we reported in May 2015, USCIS\u2019s ability to  effectively monitor USCIS ELIS program performance and make informed  decisions about its implementation has been limited because department- level governance and oversight bodies were not using reliable program  information to inform their program evaluations. While USCIS ELIS is  under development, other actions could help USCIS mitigate fraud, as  discussed below.", "FDNS\u2019s project site visits are limited in number and scope, but  FDNS has taken steps to expand them. FDNS presently conducts EB-5  Program site visits when IPO staff have identified a material concern such  as indicators that a project is behind schedule or nonexistent and that  cannot be verified through other means such as database searches or  requests for evidence from the petitioner or applicant. FDNS officials  told us that during a site visit, they typically look for evidence to  corroborate petitioner and applicant information such as loan  documentation and invoices showing that a business project\u2019s  management staff use of investment funds is consistent with the  approved business plan. USCIS, SEC, and ICE HSI officials and  members of the national industry association representing regional  centers said that additional site visits could enhance program integrity. In  one example, USCIS officials stated that an EB-5 Program site visit was  conducted because three stand-alone businesses claimed they were  operating at the same address on their EB-5 petition materials. The  businesses had placards on the door, but the owner of the property did  not know the petitioners were using the space to run businesses. As a  result, USCIS rejected these EB-5 Program petitions. GAO\u2019s fraud control  framework states that inspections and physical validations are important  tools to help mitigate fraud.officials, even relatively simple site examinations, limited to a physical  visit of the investment site, may catch indicators of fraud risk when the  site is obviously unsuitable for the stated business purpose or when the  petition or application includes falsified information. According to these  officials, more comprehensive site examinations are staff intensive but  sometimes necessary for detecting fraud. ICE HSI officials said that this  includes cases when a business has not invested in physical property or  is inactive even though the EB-5 documents show that spending is taking  place. These more comprehensive examinations include gathering   Further, according to SEC and ICE HSI  sources of information related to the project site such as mortgage  documents and local city records.", "Recognizing the potential benefits of site visits, USCIS plans to expand  the EB-5 Program site visits, which could enhance fraud detection and  deterrence. FDNS officials stated that they would like to conduct  additional scrutiny of cases based on indications of fraud risk, which may  include site visits; however, because of the EB-5 Program data limitations  described above, FDNS has been unable to develop risk indicators and  therefore cannot conduct risk-targeted site visits. However, officials plan  to pilot random site visits, which may also help to identify and deter fraud.  According to FDNS officials, USCIS approved their request for EB-5  Program random site visits in 2015, but they were not granted the staff  positions required to administer these site visits. As of May 2015, FDNS  had received authorization to hire 8 additional EB-5 Program staff, a level  that FDNS officials stated is sufficient to begin administering a random  site visit program. FDNS requested an expanded site visit budget for  fiscal year 2016, which is now pending approval. FDNS officials stated  that if the request is approved, a pilot random site visit program will begin  sometime in fiscal year 2016. While improvements to USCIS information  systems are delayed, piloting a random site visit program is a step that  could provide USCIS valuable information in its efforts to mitigate fraud.", "USCIS does not interview immigrant investors seeking removal of  permanent residency conditions. USCIS is statutorily required to  conduct interviews of immigrant investors within 90 days after they submit  the Form I-829 petition to remove conditions on their permanent  residency. However, USCIS also has the statutory authority to waive the  requirement for such interviews. As of April 2015, USCIS officials stated  that USCIS IPO has not conducted an interview at the I-829 stage.  Conducting interviews at this stage to gather additional corroborating or  contextual information could help establish whether an immigrant investor  is a victim of or complicit in fraud\u2014a concern shared by both ICE HSI and  SEC officials, who noted that gathering additional information and context  about individual investors could help to inform investigative work. For  example, interviews could present an opportunity to gather additional  information on the extent to which the initial investment proposal offered  to potential immigrant investors differed from the actual investments  made and interest returned on investments. Further, these interviews  could gather additional information from immigrant investors in cases  where their associated regional center or commercial enterprise is  suspected of fraud, such as whether investors were asked to recruit other  investors as a condition of receiving a return on their investment. Thus,  USCIS\u2019s use of its authority to conduct interviews under the program  could help collect information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain  from investors. USCIS officials agreed that conducting interviews at this  stage could be a source of relevant information and said they anticipate  conducting these interviews in the near future. However, USCIS officials  explained that they have not developed plans or a strategy for conducting  interviews at this stage primarily because IPO is relatively new and began  adjudicating I-829 petitions in September 2014. These officials added that  IPO is in the process of determining whether or not to schedule an  interview with a current immigrant investor but does not have a general  strategy for conducting these interviews. While we recognize the  establishment of IPO is relatively new, developing a strategy for  conducting interviews on investors at the I-829 stage could, for example,  help corroborate information those investors originally submitted to  demonstrate that the investors have met program requirements before  having their conditions for lawful permanent residency removed. Given  that IPO is relatively new, this strategy could include an approach to focus  on those investors at the I-829 stage who may be at higher risk for fraud.", "USCIS does not collect certain applicant information that could help  mitigate fraud. In fiscal year 2011, USCIS expanded reporting  requirements to gather information about ongoing regional center  activities such as information on the active projects managed by each  regional center. According to USCIS and SEC officials, this information  has helped identify potential incidents of fraud. However, USCIS does not  require information on the Form I-924 about the businesses supported by  the regional center and program investments coordinated by the regional  center, such as the names of principals or key officers associated with the  business, or information on advisers to investors such as foreign brokers,  marketers, attorneys, and other advisers receiving fees from investors.  According to USCIS officials, USCIS is drafting revised Forms I-924 and  I-924A that will seek to address many of these concerns. However, as  these revisions have not been completed, it is too early to tell the extent  to which they will position USCIS to collect additional applicant  information. SEC and FDNS stakeholders with whom we spoke  emphasized that collecting additional information could be useful for  USCIS to combat fraud. For example, according to these officials, the  absence of information about businesses supported by regional centers  limits USCIS\u2019s ability to identify potential fraud such as misrepresentation  of a new commercial enterprise. USCIS officials agreed that some  additional information collection would enhance program integrity but  have not done so because the process to add questions to application  forms to capture information requires USCIS to document the rationale for  such changes by directly connecting new questions to statutory eligibility  criteria, and USCIS has dedicated its regulatory group to other priorities  pending potential new legislation or expiration of the Regional Center  Program in September 2015. We recognize these competing priorities  currently exist; while these priorities are being addressed by USCIS\u2019s  regulatory group, the agency could also develop a strategy for identifying  and collecting additional information on its petition and application forms  to help mitigate fraud risks to the program, such as information on the  businesses supported by regional centers.", "GAO\u2019s fraud control framework states that fraud prevention can be  achieved by requiring registrants to provide information that is sufficient to  provide reasonable assurance against fraud risks. Further, Standards  for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that identified  program risks, including fraud risk, should guide management\u2019s planning  and development of internal controls. Given that information system  improvements with the potential to expand USCIS\u2019s fraud mitigation  efforts will not take effect until 2017 at the earliest and that gaps exist in  USCIS\u2019s other information collection efforts, developing a strategy to  capitalize on existing opportunities for collecting additional information  would better position USCIS to identify and mitigate potential fraud."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Has Made Efforts to Enhance Its Statutory Authority to Help Mitigate Risks Associated with the EB-5 Program", "paragraphs": ["USCIS has recognized that the connection between national security  concerns and specific EB-5 Program eligibility criteria may, at times, be  tenuous.

The preponderance of  evidence standard requires petitioners or applicants to establish eligibility  by demonstrating that it is more likely than not that they meet all EB-5  Program requirements. USCIS\u2019s authority with respect to fraud or  misrepresentation identified by an adjudicator in the petition or application  process is less uncertain than that for national security concerns in that  petitioners or applicants must show that their claims for EB-5 Program  eligibility are more likely true than not (i.e., probably true), and potential  fraud would generally bear on the truthfulness of petitioner or applicant  claims.

However, USCIS believes that unless a connection can be made that the  regional center is failing to promote economic growth, it does not have the  authority to terminate a regional center.

Specifically, in April 2005, GAO reported that USCIS  adjudicators lacked the expertise to adjudicate EB-5 Program petitions,  and were not sufficiently trained to properly adjudicate EB-5 Program  petitions because of the complex business and tax issues involved.More recently, in December 2013, the DHS OIG reported that USCIS  lacked meaningful economic expertise to conduct independent and  thorough reviews of economic models used by investors to estimate  indirect job creation for regional center projects, and recommended that  USCIS coordinate with other federal agencies to provide expertise in the  adjudication process.", "USCIS took action over time to increase the size and expertise of its  workforce, provide clarifying guidance and training, and revise its process  for assigning petitions and applications for adjudication. For example, in  2014, USCIS began increasing its staffing from 9 adjudicators to 58  adjudicator officers and 22 economists as of June 2015, and in May 2013,  issued a policy memorandum clarifying existing guidance to help ensure  consistency in the adjudication of petitions and to provide greater  transparency for the EB-5 Program stakeholder community, according to  IPO officials.

IPO program managers estimated that as of fiscal year  2015, about 95 percent of EB-5 Program petitioners used economic  models to estimate job creation, with about 90 percent of those petitioners  using RIMS II. The RIMS II model is widely used across the public and  private sectors and is considered to be valid to verify estimates of indirect  and induced jobs reported for investments in regional center projects,  according to USCIS and Commerce economists, as well as industry and  academic experts. Indirect jobs include jobs that are not directly created  by the new commercial enterprise, but may result from increased  employment in other businesses that supply goods and services to the  regional center business as well as induced jobs created from workers\u2019  spending of increased earnings on consumer goods and services.

USCIS economists said that the use of the RIMS II  multipliers in combination with other information, including the eligible  project investment amount, the code that identifies the project industry,  and project location, has provided them with the necessary capacity to  better ensure investors meet program requirements for job creation. We  conducted a technical review of articles and other documents on the  model as well as interviewed subject matter experts, including industry  and academic researchers who published studies of the EB-5 Program  structure, Commerce officials with the Bureau of Economic Analysis who  administer the RIMS II model, and USCIS IPO officials who review the  various economic models used by EB-5 investors.

Accordingly, USCIS reported  that from program inception in fiscal year 1990 through fiscal year 2014,  the EB-5 Program has created a minimum of 73,730 jobs and more than  $11.2 billion in investments.", "Our review and past GAO and DHS OIG audits of the program have  pointed out the limitations of this methodology to report reliable program  outcomes in that the data can be understated or overstated in certain  instances. For example, USCIS officials stated that the majority of  immigrant investors reported creating more than the 10-job minimum, and  10 percent of immigrant investors pay $1 million instead of $500,000  because they invest in projects outside of a targeted employment area.  Estimating economic outcomes using the minimum program requirements  in these circumstances would lead to an underestimate of the program\u2019s  benefits. For example, we reviewed one project with about 450 immigrant  investors that created over 10,500 jobs, or about 23 jobs per immigrant  investor, while USCIS counted only the 10-job minimum per immigrant  investor (totaling 4,500), a difference of 6,000 jobs.

For example,  the methodology assumes that all immigrant investors approved for the  program will invest the required amount of funds, and that these funds will  be fully spent on the project. According to our analysis of EB-5 Program  data, there are fewer immigrant investors who successfully complete the  program than were approved for program participation, and the actual  amount invested and spent in these circumstances is unknown. For  example, our analysis showed that approximately 26 percent of all EB-5  Program immigrant investors who entered the program from its inception  year through fiscal year 2011 may not have completed the process to  show funds spent and jobs created with an approved I-829 as of the fiscal  year ending in 2014.", "USCIS collects more complete information on EB-5 Program forms, but  does not track or analyze this information to more accurately report  program outcomes.

Specifically, his analysis showed that about 160 industries, including  manufacturing, are unable to create the required 10 jobs per investor  based solely on the EB-5 Program minimum investment of $500,000.  According to IPO officials, without the practice of allowing immigrant  investors to claim jobs generated by investments from other sources, a  higher investment amount would be required for investors to meet the job  creation requirements in these industries and qualify for removal of their  permanent residency conditions.", "GAO did not independently corroborate the outcomes of this analysis.", "Economic modeling for the project showed that 10,500 jobs were created by the total  project spending.

According to the IPO Economics Division Chief, USCIS  undertook this action in response to a December 2013 DHS OIG  recommendation that USCIS conduct a comprehensive review of the EB- 5 Program to demonstrate how investor funds have stimulated the U.S.  economy. As of June 2015, USCIS and ESA had not yet finalized the  methodology for the new study; however, ESA and USCIS approved a  statement of work in November 2014 that outlines a preliminary  methodology and study steps that would address some, but not all,  shortcomings of prior studies of the overall EB-5 Program benefits. Past  studies, for example, included small sample sizes that were not  representative of the total population and may have overstated economic  impact because of the use of national, instead of regional, multipliers in  the analysis. ESA\u2019s study is to assess the value of the EB-5 Program  beginning at the EB-5 project level for all projects completed (or at least  lasting 2 years) for fiscal years 2012 and 2013. According to Commerce  officials, the study findings will include (1) the immigrant investor  investments as well as the non EB-5 investments used in each job  creation estimate; (2) the number of jobs created as well as the value of  the jobs from each project, citing the geographic area for which the job  creation was claimed in the economic impact assessment; and (3) the  likely household spending of immigrant investor families while living in the  United States. Commerce officials indicated that for the study, all projects  within a state will be added to derive a state total and then the state totals  will be aggregated to determine a national total. ESA will review a  majority of the economic impact assessments that led to the job creation  estimates for each of the projects to determine whether the models used  for estimating job creation were applied correctly. ESA also plans to use  information submitted by immigrant investors on EB-5 Program forms and  entered into the Intranet Computer Linked Application Information  Management System (iCLAIMS) to more specifically and reliably report  program benefits.
