In 2018, we found that all  three programs have been at risk of cost and schedule growth since  NASA approved their baselines, and have since experienced cost  growth and schedule delays. This was in part because NASA did not  follow best practices for establishing cost and schedule baselines for  these programs, including not updating cost and schedule analyses to  reflect new risks. As a result, NASA overpromised what it could  deliver from a cost and schedule perspective. Further, in 2019 we  found that NASA should enhance contract management and oversight  to improve SLS and Orion program outcomes.

In  October 2019, Gateway program officials stated they have reconsidered  this direction and now plan to conduct a program-level JCL. However,  given that NASA officials previously determined they would not require  the Gateway program to establish a baseline that is informed by a  program-level JCL, the decision to conduct a JCL is subject to change  again.", "NASA\u2019s commitment to the program\u2019s October 2019 decision to conduct a  program-level JCL would enhance oversight and management for  Gateway. NASA\u2019s cost estimating handbook states that a JCL can serve  as a valuable management tool that helps enforce some best practices of  program planning and control, and potentially enhance vital  communication to various stakeholders. Having a program-level JCL  could help the program identify additional cost and schedule risks  associated with integration of, or dependencies across, Gateway  components that individual projects may not identify. As a tightly coupled  program, Gateway has project schedules that are dependent on one  another. For example, PPE provides power to subsequent Gateway  components, such as the Habitation and Logistics Outpost, and must be  launched and in lunar orbit for the outpost to dock with PPE. A program- level JCL would be able to quantify risk of delay across all dependent  activities, regardless of which individual project experiences the delay. It  would also provide NASA decision-makers and external stakeholders,  such as Congress, with the probability of the program meeting both its  cost and schedule commitments to support the Artemis III mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gateway Schedule", "paragraphs": ["The Gateway program is also the program in the lunar architecture that is  the furthest along in developing a schedule aside from the SLS, Orion,  and Exploration Ground Systems programs.

We identified two challenges  with the Gateway program\u2019s schedule that stem from decisions to meet  the program\u2019s rapid pace of development.", "Program and project technical reviews do not align. The NASA  program management handbook states that lower-level technical reviews,  such as project preliminary design reviews, are typically conducted prior  to the program-level reviews. In addition, GAO\u2019s Schedule Assessment  Guide states that lower-level project schedules should be consistent with  upper-level program review milestones. This creates consistency  between program and project schedules, which enables different teams to  work to the same schedule expectations and ensures the proper  sequencing of activities.", "The Gateway program obtained approval from the NASA Associate  Administrator to tailor its review schedule.  This includes the replacement  of traditional reviews with program sync reviews informed by project-level  technical reviews. The program has some of the project-level technical  reviews for its projects\u2014PPE, Habitation and Logistics Outpost, and  Logistics\u2014occurring after equivalent Gateway program-level reviews. The  Gateway program-level reviews are referred to as sync reviews, during  which information is assessed across all projects.

Figure 7  shows the preliminary Gateway program schedule and identifies reviews  that differ from the notional tightly coupled program schedule found in  NASA guidance.", "Without the results of project-level reviews, program officials may have  limited information to assess progress at program-level reviews. This  opens up the possibility of costly re-designs at later stages of the program  life cycle. Gateway program officials said as the program progresses,  they plan to assess the risk of holding a project-level review after a  program-level review against the risk of delaying a program-level review  to hold all the project-level reviews first. Officials added that they are still  reviewing their approach for the timing of the reviews. We will continue to  follow up through future work on the Gateway program\u2019s risk  assessments related to the timing of the technical reviews.", "Scheduling of key program milestone reviews after 2021 deferred.

Currently, the final key decision point scheduled for the program is KDP I  in 2021, which evaluates the completeness of the preliminary design,  including for projects, and determines the program\u2019s readiness to begin  the detailed design phase.

It may be appropriate not to schedule  a KDP III\u2014a decision point that evaluates the readiness of the program,  including its projects, for launch and early operations\u2014for the Gateway  program since the projects will launch separately and conduct operations  on different timelines.

A senior HEOMD official said that the agency developed a  cost estimate that included costs for the lunar mission to 2028 to support  budget submissions. However, the official said this life-cycle cost estimate  included costs outside of the Artemis III mission, such as for missions  later than Artemis III, and may not include integration and overall  management costs. NASA officials told us that it is complicated to  separate out costs for each mission and, as a result, do not plan to  develop an Artemis III cost estimate. In addition, senior NASA officials  stated that many of the programs needed to execute the mission are  currently in the early stages of acquisition, and therefore NASA has  limited cost information. Meanwhile, NASA requested an additional $1.6  billion in fiscal year 2020 above its initial budget request to support the  Artemis III mission.", "Cost estimates provide management with critical cost-risk information to  improve the control of resources in the present and future. GAO\u2019s Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide states that a life-cycle cost estimate  enhances decision-making, especially in early planning of an  acquisition.

While NASA policy does not  require programs to analyze alternatives before starting work, GAO best  practices state that analyzing alternatives provides a framework to help  ensure that entities consistently and reliably select the alternative that  best meets the mission need based on selection criteria, such as safety,  cost, or schedule. Similarly, the Department of Defense, an agency that  also invests billions of dollars in acquisitions, considers an analysis of  alternatives a key input to defining a system\u2019s capabilities and assessing  affordability. We previously found that analyzing alternatives is a key  element in establishing a sound business case for a new architecture or  program. Having a strong business case, including a formal assessment  of alternatives, would help NASA effectively communicate its decisions to  various stakeholders and facilitate a better understanding of its current  lunar plans.", "NASA officials told us that they arrived at the current architecture and the  designs of its lunar programs by conducting numerous studies and  analyses over multiple decades. These studies looked at aspects of the  various lunar missions NASA has planned over time, including the prior  Constellation program and Journey to Mars effort. A HEOMD official  responsible for mission directorate analyses said that the studies ranged  from quick turn-around analyses to long-term, thorough studies. NASA  officials identified 12 studies completed since the conclusion of the  Constellation program in 2010 that informed their decision to build  Gateway and other aspects of the lunar architecture. The studies varied  in focus, ranging from a study on the overall framework for a mission to  Mars to a study exclusively on the human lunar landers.", "We reviewed these 12 studies to determine the extent to which NASA  analyzed alternatives to inform its current lunar architecture. We found  that some of the studies contained detailed analyses, but had a narrow  scope. For example:", "NASA conducted a study on the design of its human lunar landers  that identified several alternative designs for the lander configuration,  including two- and three-stage landers. The study provided an  analysis on each alternative in order to compare those alternatives,  given the physical constraints of SLS and commercial launch vehicles.", "HEOMD reviewed prior studies on a cislunar habitation facility  conducted by internal and external partners that informed an  Assessment of Alternatives for the Gateway program. At the time the  mission directorate conducted this assessment, the concept was  focused on the Journey to Mars effort, and mentioned lunar landers  only as a potential secondary mission. The assessment analyzed  various alternative configurations that Gateway might use and  selected one of them based feasibility and schedule.", "NASA conducted studies on the best orbit in which to place Gateway.", "While these studies were robust, they did not more broadly analyze  whether Gateway was the best solution to meet the mission need  based on selection criteria.", "The following are examples of topics that NASA could have addressed if  they had analyzed alternatives with a broader scope:", "Assessing commercial alternatives to SLS and Orion for a  human landing on the Moon. Each of the studies assumes the use  of SLS and the Orion capsule in order to conduct the required  mission. A HEOMD official told us that they did not assess  commercial alternatives to SLS and Orion because commercial  alternatives are not available. If commercial technology to replace  SLS and Orion becomes available, the official said NASA can on- ramp those options if SLS and Orion are not delivered on time.", "Assessing how a more capable SLS could have affected the  lunar architecture. NASA did not assess whether refocusing  investment on more capable versions of its current programs,  including SLS, might affect risk, cost, and schedule for a lunar landing  mission. For example, developing a more capable SLS earlier may  have enabled NASA to propose a different lunar lander design or to  launch components of the architecture in fewer launches. In the study  on the design of its human lunar landers, NASA assumed that a more  capable version of SLS would not be available until at least 2028, and  therefore did not assess using it as a part of its architecture. Further,  at the time of the study in 2018, NASA was unsure it would have  enough SLS core stages available to utilize them for any components  of the architecture other than to transport crew.", "Identifying alternatives to a lunar landing without using Gateway.  All of the studies assumed the use of Gateway or similar capability as  opposed to a capability that would take astronauts directly to the lunar  surface. A HEOMD official told us that NASA did not assess  architectures without Gateway because they planned to utilize SLS  and Orion, and NASA did not design the Orion capsule for a direct-to- moon landing. However, a HEOMD official provided us with a quick  turn-around analysis that NASA conducted in 2019, after NASA  initiated the Gateway program, in response to questions about  alternative lunar architectures. This analysis compared a lunar landing  from Gateway to a landing without Gateway and found that NASA  would have to upgrade the Orion Capsule to have a direct-to-moon  landing, which would increase the cost and development time of the  program. As a result, the analysis concluded that a lunar landing  using Gateway was the superior option. Additionally, officials said  Gateway helped develop an architecture that was sustainable and  could contribute to a mission to Mars.", "In addition, only one of the studies focused on a lunar landing mission  because NASA completed most of the studies prior to the December  2017 Space Policy Directive-1. NASA officials stated that this is because  they were told not to analyze a lunar landing during the previous  administration. As a result, none of these studies represents a  comprehensive assessment for NASA\u2019s current plans to return to the  Moon and are, in total, missing information on potential alternatives.", "While conducting a formal analysis of alternatives for the lunar  architecture is no longer viable given NASA\u2019s schedule, by not having  such an analysis NASA is ill-equipped to consider other alternatives as  off-ramps if the current lunar architecture plans run into delays. Further,  none of the studies contained a life-cycle cost estimate and without this,  NASA does not know the costs of its architecture or of potential  alternatives.", "In October 2019, NASA officials stated they had begun to develop an  Architecture Campaign Document, which would provide a summary of the  studies and analyses that have informed NASA\u2019s lunar architecture.  However, this document was still in draft form at the time of our review  and officials did not commit to a completion date. Until NASA completes  this summary, it will not have a cohesive document outlining the rationale  for how it selected its current lunar architecture and lunar programs.", "Lastly, the practice of formally assessing alternatives is a beneficial  practice for future architectures and programs. However, NASA policy  and guidance describe an analysis of alternatives as a tool, but does not  require officials to analyze alternatives prior to starting work to develop a  system architecture or initiating directed missions. NASA may analyze  alternatives for an architecture, program, project, or specific design or  capability, but conducting a formal analysis of alternatives is optional.  Without a requirement to conduct an analysis of alternatives prior to  NASA authorizing the initial planning of a program, NASA could miss  opportunities to move forward with a more viable architecture or program  to meet mission needs in the future. For a new architecture or large  programs that require a lot of investment, such as future exploration  efforts including Mars, conducting an analysis of alternatives would better  position NASA to build a sound business case, justify and document its  decisions, and advocate for its plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Effectively executing the Artemis III mission will require extensive  coordination within NASA and its commercial partners, and for each  individual program to meet aggressive development time frames.
