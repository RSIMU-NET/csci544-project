GAO analyzed published and unpublished budget data covering Direct Loans made from fiscal years 1995 through 2015 and estimated to be made in 2016 and 2017; analyzed and tested Education's computer code used to estimate IDR plan costs; reviewed documentation related to Education's estimation approach; and interviewed officials at Education and other federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For the fiscal year 2017 budget, the U.S. Department of Education (Education) estimates that all federally issued Direct Loans in Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans will have government costs of $74 billion, higher than previous budget estimates. IDR plans are designed to help ease student debt burden by setting loan payments as a percentage of borrower income, extending repayment periods from the standard 10 years to up to 25 years, and forgiving remaining balances at the end of that period. While actual costs cannot be known until borrowers repay their loans, GAO found that current IDR plan budget estimates are more than double what was originally expected for loans made in fiscal years 2009 through 2016 (the only years for which original estimates are available). This growth is largely due to the rising volume of loans in IDR plans.", "Education's approach to estimating IDR plan costs and quality control practices do not ensure reliable budget estimates. Weaknesses in this approach may cause costs to be over- or understated by billions of dollars. For instance:", "Education assumes that borrowers' incomes will not grow with inflation even though federal guidelines for estimating loan costs state that estimates should account for relevant economic factors. GAO tested this assumption by incorporating inflation into income forecasts, and found that estimated costs fell by over $17 billion.", "Education also assumes no borrowers will switch into or out of IDR plans in the future despite participation growth that has led budget estimates to more than double from $25 to $53 billion for loans made in recent fiscal years. Predicting plan switching would be advisable per federal guidance on estimating loan costs. Education has begun developing a revised model with this capability, but this model is not complete and it is not yet clear when or how well it will reflect IDR plan participation trends.", "Insufficient quality controls contributed to issues GAO identified. For instance:", "Education tested only one assumption for reasonableness, and did so at the request of others, although such testing is recommended in federal guidance on estimating loan costs. Without further model testing, Education's estimates may be based on unreasonable assumptions.", "Due to growing IDR plan popularity, improving Education's estimation approach is especially important. Until that happens, IDR plan budget estimates will remain in question, and Congress's ability to make informed decisions may be affected."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations to Education to improve the quality of its IDR plan budget estimates.

Ford Federal Direct Loans (Direct Loans), and there  are indications that some face difficulties repaying their loans. For  instance, almost 20 percent of Direct Loan borrowers were delinquent on  their loan payments at the end of 2015, and more than a million  borrowers defaulted on their loans over the 2015 fiscal year. Since 2009,  the U.S. Department of Education (Education) has created several new  Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans that borrowers can select to  reduce challenges they face in repaying their loans. These plans primarily  base payment amounts on a borrower\u2019s income and extend repayment  periods from the standard 10 years to up to 25 years with any remaining  balance forgiven at the end of that period.", "Participation in IDR plans is growing, as is their estimated cost to the  government. By June 2016, 24 percent of borrowers repaying their loans  (or 5.3 million borrowers) were doing so in IDR plans, and it is likely that  more will join in the future. We reported in 2015 that there were gaps in  awareness about IDR plans. In April 2016, the Administration announced  a new goal to add 2 million new borrowers to IDR plans over the next  year, through efforts including targeted outreach. Education has also  increased its estimates of IDR plan costs. For instance, in its fiscal year  2016 budget justification, Education revised its prior-year estimates of  Direct Loan costs upward by $12.3 billion, and cited growing IDR plan  enrollment as the primary cause.", "Given questions among policymakers and experts about IDR plan costs  to the federal government, you asked us to examine Education\u2019s IDR plan  budget estimates and evaluate its approach to estimating costs. In this  report, we examine:  1.  What are Education\u2019s current IDR plan budget estimates and how  have they changed over time?  2.  To what extent do Education\u2019s approach to estimating IDR plan costs  and quality control practices help ensure reliable budget estimates?", "We used a variety of methods to answer these questions. We reviewed  relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance regarding subsidy cost  estimates and IDR plans. We also interviewed officials from the  Congressional Budget Office and the U.S. Department of the Treasury  (Treasury) and staff from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB),  the office that oversees the formulation of the President\u2019s budget, as well  as higher education policy experts to discuss issues related to federal  budgeting practices and estimated IDR plan costs. Additionally, we  reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from Education about  the agency\u2019s approach to estimating costs and its quality control  practices.", "We analyzed data underlying Education\u2019s annual budget estimates for the  Direct Loan program. To address our first objective, we analyzed data  from two sources: (1) Education\u2019s annual submissions to the President\u2019s  budget for fiscal years 2011 through 2017 and (2) supplemental data  provided by Education that rely on the data and assumptions underlying  its fiscal year 2016 and 2017 budget estimates. To address our second  objective, we reviewed the computer programs and data Education uses  to estimate repayment patterns for loans in IDR plans. We then used  these programs to generate our own estimates of how changing selected  assumptions would affect cost estimates. We also analyzed estimated  cash flow data for loans in IDR plans to estimate the proportion of loan  dollars Education expects to be forgiven through these plans. To assess the reliability of Education\u2019s budget estimates, we interviewed agency  officials, reviewed related documentation, and conducted extensive  electronic testing. We believe the data are reliable to report on the  funding Education reports is necessary to operate the Direct Loan  program, and to illustrate the sensitivity of Education\u2019s budget estimates  to different assumptions about future loan repayment activity. We  evaluated Education\u2019s approach to estimating IDR plan costs and quality  control practices using guidance for estimating subsidy costs issued by  the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board, accepted statistical  practices, and Education\u2019s information quality guidelines, among other  sources. We assessed Education\u2019s information sharing practices against  Education\u2019s strategic plan and standards for internal control in the federal  government.

The interest rate as of July 1, 2016 is 3.76  percent. Borrowers are not responsible for  paying interest on these loans while in school  and during certain periods of deferment.   Unsubsidized Stafford Loans: Available  both to undergraduate and graduate school  students irrespective of financial need.

Borrowers must pay all  interest on these loans.  Consolidation Loans: Available to student  and parent borrowers wanting to combine  multiple federal student loans (including those  listed above) into one loan. Repayment  periods are extended up to 30 years, thereby  lowering monthly payments. Interest rates are  equal to the weighted average of the  underlying loans.", "Education offers a variety of repayment plans for Direct Loan borrowers:  Standard, Graduated, Extended, and Income-Driven. Income-Driven  Repayment (IDR) is an umbrella term that describes a number of  repayment plans available to Direct Loan borrowers who meet specific  eligibility requirements, as seen in figure 1. Unlike the Standard,  Graduated, and Extended repayment plans, IDR plans offer loan  forgiveness at the end of the repayment term. Additionally, their  repayment terms are longer than under the Standard and Graduated  plans, which are set at 10 years for non-consolidated loans.", "Borrowers in IDR plans generally have lower monthly payments  compared to the Standard 10-year repayment plan. They may also pay  less in the long term than they would under the Standard 10-year  repayment plan due to the opportunity for eventual loan forgiveness.  However, some borrowers may pay more. Borrowers in IDR plans can  ultimately pay more in interest on their loans than they would under the  Standard 10-year repayment plan due to longer repayment periods.  Some borrowers will also fully repay their loans before their IDR plan  repayment term ends and, therefore, not receive forgiveness.  Additionally, under current tax law any amount forgiven under these plans  is subject to federal income tax.", "In addition to making monthly payments more manageable (and  eventually reducing the total amount owed for some borrowers receiving  forgiveness), IDR plans may also reduce the risk of default. Borrowers  who default on student loans face serious consequences, including  damaged credit ratings and difficulty obtaining affordable credit in the  future. In 2015, we reported that borrowers in two IDR plans had much  lower default rates than borrowers in the Standard repayment plan.  Specifically, among borrowers who entered repayment from fiscal year  2010 through fiscal year 2014, less than 1 percent of borrowers in the  Income-Based Repayment and Pay As You Earn had defaulted on their  loan, compared to 14 percent in the Standard repayment plan.", "To participate in an IDR plan, borrowers must provide documentation of  their adjusted gross income (which we generally refer to as income in this  report) to their loan servicer and certify their family size for an eligibility  determination. Borrowers must recertify this information annually, which  is used to update the borrower\u2019s monthly payment amount. A borrower  who fails to provide updated income information can remain in an IDR  plan in order to qualify for future loan forgiveness, but their monthly  payments will no longer be based on their income. Rather, payments will  generally revert to the amount that would be owed under the Standard  10-year repayment plan until the borrower submits the required  information.", "Borrowers who work in public service may lower their long-term loan  costs by participating in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF)  program while repaying their loans through an IDR plan. Beginning in  October 2017, borrowers eligible for PSLF can have their remaining  Direct Loan balances forgiven after at least 10 years of payments in  eligible repayment plans, generally an IDR plan or the Standard 10-year  repayment plan. As we recently reported, PSLF may provide substantial  savings over the life of the loan for qualifying borrowers in IDR plans  compared to what they would pay without the PSLF benefit. In contrast,  borrowers in the Standard 10-year repayment plan would pay their loans  in full by the time they were eligible for forgiveness under PSLF. (See  figure 2.)", "Participation in IDR plans has grown over time, as seen in figure 3.  According to currently available quarterly data released by Education, the  percent of outstanding Direct Loan dollars being repaid through IDR plans  doubled from June 2013 to June 2016 to 40 percent.

A proposal has  been introduced in the current Congress that would similarly make only  one IDR plan available to new borrowers and target more generous  benefits to those with lower incomes. Additional legislative proposals  would automatically enroll all borrowers in a version of income-driven  repayment and withhold payments from borrowers\u2019 paychecks. Other  proposed legislation would allow for automatic annual recertification of  borrowers\u2019 incomes and automatically place certain delinquent borrowers  in an IDR plan.

(In this report, we generally refer to subsidy costs as \u201ccosts.\u201d) Subsidy  cost estimates are calculated based on the net present value of lifetime  estimated cash flows to and from the government associated with these  loans. For Direct Loans, cash flows from the government include loan  disbursements to borrowers, while cash flows to the government include  repayments of loan principal, interest and fee payments, and recoveries  on defaulted loans. A positive subsidy cost estimate indicates that the  government anticipates a net cost, while a negative subsidy cost estimate  indicates that the government anticipates generating net subsidy income,  not counting administrative costs.", "Education also annually reestimates the cost of loans made in each fiscal  year, known as a loan cohort.

Reestimates may result in  increases or decreases in subsidy cost estimates. No loan cohorts have  been fully repaid, and estimates for all cohorts continue to be updated  annually in the President\u2019s budget.", "To estimate subsidy costs, Education has developed a student loan cash  flow model (the student loan model) that incorporates a variety of  assumptions about the future. These assumptions concern various  aspects of loan performance, such as how many borrowers will prepay  their loans, how many borrowers will default, and how successful default  collection activities will be. Education uses a supplementary model to  assist with the task of estimating repayment patterns for loans in IDR  plans. (See appendix II for a description of how this supplementary model  for estimating IDR plan repayment patterns works.)

More specifically, Education estimates that about $355 billion in loans will  enter an IDR plan, and $281 billion will ultimately be paid by borrowers.", "As a result, Education expects a 21 percent subsidy rate, or an average  cost to the government of $21 per every $100 in loans disbursed. See  figure 4.", "All of the Direct Loan types eligible to participate in IDR plans contribute  to the $74 billion Education estimates the government will incur in subsidy  costs. Of these loan types, Consolidation loans are estimated to be the  most costly, as seen in figure 5. Consolidation loans, which combine  multiple existing federal student loans into one loan, are larger on  average than other types of Direct Loans, and may have higher balances  forgiven at the end of their repayment term. Further, Education officials  said that some borrowers in IDR plans with Consolidation loans have  higher default risks than other borrowers, which leads to higher expected  subsidy rates for these loans. Education estimates lower subsidy costs  for Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford and PLUS loans for graduate  student borrowers (known as Grad PLUS loans) than Consolidation  loans.", "As figure 6 shows, Education estimates higher subsidy costs for loans  participating in IDR plans from more recent loan cohorts compared to  loans from older cohorts.", "Figure 7 shows that these higher estimated costs track closely with the  higher loan volume (or total loan dollars) estimated to enter IDR plans for  more recent loan cohorts. Education officials confirmed that this higher  estimated loan volume is likely related to three key factors: more generous IDR plans available for loans issued since fiscal year  increased efforts to make borrowers aware of IDR plans, and  increased overall volume of Direct Loans issued as a result of  increased college attendance following the 2008 economic downturn  and the end of the Federal Family Education Loan program (which  guaranteed federal student loans issued by private lenders) in 2010.", "While borrowers in IDR plans in more recent loan cohorts have access to  more generous benefits (which could lead to higher government costs),  these loan cohorts do not have higher estimated subsidy rates than  earlier loan cohorts, as seen in figure 8. Direct Loan subsidy rates  fluctuate according to changes in a variety of factors, and are particularly  sensitive to changes in government borrowing costs and borrower interest  rates. As we previously reported, government borrowing costs fell  sharply in 2009, due to historically low interest rates of Treasury  securities. This phenomenon contributed to lower overall estimated  subsidy rates for Direct Loans issued following the 2008 loan cohort."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education\u2019s Current IDR Subsidy Cost Estimates Are Higher than Previously Expected, but Actual Costs Will Not Be Known for Many Years", "paragraphs": ["Education has raised its estimates of IDR plan costs in recent years  through its annual process of revising past budget estimates to account  for actual loan performance and updated assumptions about future loan  performance. In figure 9, we compare Education\u2019s original IDR plan  subsidy cost estimates for loans issued in recent cohorts to its current  subsidy cost estimates prepared for the President\u2019s fiscal year 2017  budget. Our results show that current estimated IDR plan costs are  more than double what was originally expected for these cohorts. For  instance, Education originally estimated in the President\u2019s fiscal year  2012 budget that IDR plan costs for the 2012 cohort would be $1.2 billion.  As of the fiscal year 2017 budget, Education\u2019s estimate had grown to $3  billion.

Because Education  expects loans in IDR pans to have positive subsidy rates (or to have costs  to the government), this growth in estimated loan volume has been  accompanied by increasing estimates of IDR plan costs.", "According to our data analysis and interviews with Education officials,  Education may have originally underestimated the volume of loans that  would enter IDR plans from these cohorts for several reasons:  1.  Education did not include Grad PLUS loans in its IDR plan subsidy  estimates until the fiscal year 2015 budget, even though Grad PLUS  loans have been eligible for IDR plans since they were first issued in  2006. Education officials said that they had to make a model  adjustment in order to include Grad PLUS loans in IDR estimates.  Prior to this adjustment they assumed all Grad PLUS loans would be  repaid in other repayment plans.  2.  Policy changes made IDR plans more generous and available to more  borrowers after Education originally estimated costs for some cohorts.  For example, the Pay As You Earn repayment plan was implemented  in fiscal year 2013 and retroactively made more generous benefits  available to certain borrowers with loans issued as early as the 2008  cohort.  3.  While some eligible borrowers still may not be aware of IDR plans,  participation rates are growing, and officials responsible for budget  estimates may not have adequately anticipated participation growth.", "While we previously reported that there are substantial challenges  associated with estimating Direct Loan subsidy costs, these challenges  are increased for Direct Loans in IDR plans due to their complex features  and other uncertainties. It is difficult for Education to estimate which  borrowers have incomes low enough to benefit from or be eligible for IDR  plans because Education does not collect income information for all  Direct Loan borrowers.  Additionally, IDR plan participation rates are  difficult to predict. While participation has been growing rapidly in recent  years, it is unclear at what rate it will continue to grow. It is also  challenging to predict how the incomes of borrowers already participating  in IDR plans will change over time and how much loan principal will  ultimately be forgiven. Further complicating Education\u2019s task is the fact  that the large majority of loans expected to be repaid in IDR plans are  from recent cohorts, and many borrowers in these cohorts have not yet  started repaying their loans. As a result, there is limited actual repayment data available to inform Education\u2019s estimates. Further, no borrower has  received loan forgiveness under IDR plans.", "Volatility in subsidy cost estimates is generally expected to be greatest  early in the life of a loan cohort, and to decrease over time as more actual  repayment data are incorporated into estimates. When we compared  original, third-year, and currently estimated IDR plan subsidy cost  estimates for several recent cohorts, we found that third-year estimates  were generally closer to current estimated costs than the original, as  figure 11 illustrates. However, estimates will continue to change over  time, and actual subsidy costs of a loan cohort will not be known until all  loans in the cohort have been repaid, which may take 40 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Estimated IDR Plan Costs Are Offset by Greater Estimated Income from Loans in Other Repayment Plans", "paragraphs": ["While loans in IDR plans are expected to have long-term costs to the  government, loans in other repayment plans (Standard, Graduated, and  Extended) are expected to generate greater subsidy income, as seen in  figure 12. Figure 12 also illustrates that Education currently expects  income to be higher for more recent cohorts than older cohorts.  However, as mentioned previously, subsidy cost estimates change over  time, and the actual costs or income attributable to any Direct Loan cohort  will not be known until all loans in the cohort are repaid.", "Subsidy income estimates for loans participating in non-IDR plans vary by  loan type and repayment plan. Unsubsidized Stafford and PLUS loans  participating in the Standard 10-year repayment plan are estimated to  result in the greatest subsidy income to the government. This could be  due in part to the higher interest rates charged to borrowers with  Unsubsidized Stafford and PLUS loans compared to Subsidized Stafford  loans, as well as a higher volume of loans participating in Standard  repayment compared to other repayment plan options. See figure 13.", "Further, as with loans in IDR plans, Education\u2019s estimates of subsidy  income from loans in non-IDR plans have changed over time and will  continue to fluctuate as they are updated with actual repayment data and  revised assumptions about future cash flows. We found that estimated  income associated with loans participating in non-IDR plans increased  (about $19 billion more) for some cohorts and decreased (about $36  billion less) for other cohorts when we compared Education\u2019s original and  current estimates for those cohorts (2009-2015).", "While Education currently estimates that loans in IDR plans will have  costs to the government, these plans are designed to provide relief to  struggling borrowers, which could indicate that government subsidies may  be expected. By tying monthly payments to borrowers\u2019 incomes, IDR  plans help make potentially onerous student debt payments more  affordable for many individuals. Because these borrowers\u2019 repayment  amounts may be lower than they otherwise would be, borrowers in IDR  plans may have more success in making their loan payments than  borrowers in other plans. As we previously reported, substantially lower  percentages of participants in the Income-Based Repayment and Pay As  You Earn repayment plans had defaulted on their loans compared to  those in the Standard 10-year repayment plan, and the great majority of  borrowers in these IDR plans were in active repayment status (e.g., not in  delinquency, default, or forbearance).

Increasing payment amounts would, in turn,  decrease costs to the government. When asked, Education officials said  they did not adjust income forecasts for inflation because they did not  identify patterns in the estimated historical income data suggesting that  incomes would be affected by inflation. Whether or not these patterns  were evident when reviewing the data, there was inflation over the almost  20-year period covered by the historical dataset and there is likely to be  inflation in the future. Federal guidance for estimating subsidy costs  stresses the importance of taking economic effects into account when  estimating loan performance. For IDR plan costs, this would include the  extent to which inflation affects borrower incomes and payment amounts.", "By choosing not to adjust income forecasts to capture inflation\u2019s future  effects, Education over-estimated IDR plan costs.

Until Education adjusts for inflation, its budget  estimates will continue to inaccurately represent potential IDR plan costs.", "Additionally, Education assumes that all borrowers in IDR plans will  recertify their incomes every year as required, which is likely to be  inaccurate and could lead Education to overstate IDR plan costs. In fact,  we recently reported that over half of borrowers in an Education sample  failed to do so. When borrowers fail to recertify their income, Education  generally increases their payments to what they would owe under the  Standard 10-year repayment plan until they submit their required  recertification. For some borrowers who fail to recertify their income,  payments could increase by hundreds of dollars a month. While some  borrowers may subsequently recertify within a few months, others may  never recertify. Because Education does not take these occurrences into  account, it underestimates what borrowers will pay when their certification  lapses.", "Education officials told us they did not include certification lapses in their  approach to estimating IDR plan costs because they lacked recertification  data linked to individuals. They also believed that certification lapses  would not have a large impact on their estimates. Initially, officials said  the agency is taking steps to reduce the number of borrowers failing to  recertify. However, officials later acknowledged that these efforts are in  the early stages of implementation, and there have been some  setbacks. Until efforts to improve recertification rates are put in place,  certification lapses will likely continue. Further, without data indicating that  certification lapses do not have a large impact on borrower payment  amounts, Education may overstate IDR plan costs. Federal guidance for  estimating subsidy costs states that the information used in the estimation  process should reflect actual repayment patterns for loans whose costs  are being estimated, which would include instances when a borrower\u2019s  payment amount changes due to program rules. Obtaining data on  borrowers\u2019 actual repayment patterns after they fail to recertify their  income could help Education determine whether its current approach  appropriately accounts for the impact of recertification failure on IDR plan  costs, and determine whether changes are needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Future IDR Plan Participation", "paragraphs": ["Education likely underestimates IDR plan participation because it  assumes all borrowers will remain in their currently selected repayment  plan for their entire repayment period.

Participation is also  likely to continue growing. Education agreed with our recent  recommendation that the agency increase its efforts to make all  borrowers aware of IDR plans. Further, as previously mentioned, the  Administration recently announced a goal to enroll 2 million additional  borrowers in IDR plans.", "As a result of Education\u2019s likely underestimation of IDR plan participation,  its IDR plan budget estimates may be biased downward, or appear lower  than they otherwise should be. We found that Education\u2019s IDR plan  budget estimates for loans issued in recent cohorts have more than  doubled over what was originally expected ($53 billion vs. $25 billion),  primarily because of higher than expected participation in IDR plans.

However, Education does not estimate these plans\u2019 costs separately.

For instance, the current interest rate on a  Grad PLUS loan is almost double that of a Subsidized Stafford loan,  leading borrowers with Grad PLUS loans to owe much more in interest on  those loans over time. Conversely, borrowers with Subsidized Stafford  loans will pay down principal on their loans more quickly over time  because less of their payment goes toward interest. However,  Education\u2019s cost estimates do not reflect higher expected interest  payments on Grad PLUS loans in IDR plans or faster principal repayment  on Subsidized Stafford loans in IDR plans, because they are based on  aggregate repayment patterns that include both types of loans. Education  officials told us that, as a result of this practice, all differences in  published subsidy rates for these loan types are wholly attributable to  fees charged to borrowers at the time the loans are issued and how much  interest accrues during the relatively short period that borrowers are still  in school.", "Because Education\u2019s estimates do not reflect differences in performance  over the decades that loans in IDR plans may be in repayment, users of  the budget are missing key information that could help them assess how  IDR plan costs vary by loan type. As an example, some experts have  raised concerns that Grad PLUS loans could have relatively high  forgiveness amounts because they are larger on average than Stafford  loans and may have a large amount of outstanding loan principal at the  end of their repayment term. Due to limitations in Education\u2019s current  approach, users of the budget cannot determine the extent to which this  concern affects subsidy rates for Grad PLUS loans in IDR plans.", "According to Education officials, they could have separately estimated  repayment patterns for each loan type, but did not believe that it was  important to do so for several reasons.

Further, until Education obtains data needed to estimate the impact of income recertification lapses on borrower payment  amounts, it will not know whether borrower payments are currently  underestimated and whether adjustments are needed to avoid overstating  IDR plan costs. In addition, until Education\u2019s planned revisions to its  student loan model have been completed and tested to ensure  reasonableness, the agency\u2019s IDR plan budget estimates will not  reasonably reflect participation trends in IDR plans, particularly the extent  to which borrowers in other repayment plans may switch into them.

First, we tested the effects of inflation on income  projections and poverty guidelines, both of which are used to estimate  borrower payment amounts. We adjusted borrower incomes and poverty  guidelines for inflation due to the exclusion of inflation from Education\u2019s  current model and the results of a prior Education analysis showing that  cost estimates were sensitive to changes in borrower incomes. Second,  we tested Education\u2019s assumption about PSLF participation and the year  borrowers would be first eligible for forgiveness under the program. We  focused on PSLF participation because actual participation is not yet  known for this program and Education assumed that any borrower they  estimated to be eligible for PSLF would choose to participate. We carried  out each sensitivity analysis by rewriting relevant portions of the existing  SAS computer programs that Education developed to implement the IDR  plan repayment model.", "To conduct these analyses, we first produced baseline cash flow  estimates using the existing programs we received from Education. We  sought to produce baseline estimates that were identical to those from  Education\u2019s existing model. The baseline replication ensured that the new  model assumptions, rather than different versions of programs or input  data, were solely responsible for any changes in the estimates. The  replication process included selecting random samples of the data files  and using the SAS Compare procedure to detect any differences in  observations and variables. We interviewed Education officials to confirm  the sequence and versions of programs and to establish our final baseline  file.", "After producing baseline estimates, we wrote two new sets of SAS  program files to implement each new assumption and produce new cash  flow output for each analysis. The final output data, which we sent to  Education to produce subsidy rates, consisted of cash flows summed  across all borrowers in repayment within each fiscal year and within loan  population type (non-consolidated loans, loans consolidated from default, and loans consolidated not from default). We provided this output to  Education officials, who uploaded and ran the new estimates through the  larger student loan model. Education officials provided revised subsidy  rates for each loan type and origination cohort, reflecting the new IDR  plan cash flows under our alternative assumptions. For each sensitivity  analysis, we compared the baseline and revised IDR cash flows and  subsidy cost estimates and calculated the percent change.", "We tested Education\u2019s assumptions regarding borrower participation and  the first year that borrowers are eligible for PSLF. Education estimates  borrower eligibility for PSLF using survey data that may not be  representative of borrowers in newer IDR plans. In addition, Education  assumes that 100 percent of borrowers who are estimated to be eligible  for PSLF will choose to participate after making 120 payments in a  qualifying repayment plan. Lastly, Education assumes that no borrower  will become eligible to benefit from PSLF until a year after the program is  scheduled to begin. To assess the impact of altering these three  assumptions, we increased and decreased the estimated percentage of  borrowers eligible and participating in PSLF by 10 and 5 percentage  points, and moved up the PSLF start date by a full year.", "Adjusting Projected Incomes and Poverty Guidelines for Inflation  We tested the extent to which cost estimates were sensitive to adjusting  incomes and poverty guidelines for inflation for future years after 2013. As  described in appendix II, Education forecasts borrowers\u2019 incomes by  substituting the historical incomes of borrowers with similar  characteristics, but does it not adjust these projected incomes for  inflation. Education also uses 2013 poverty guideline data for future  years, with no inflation adjustment. To implement this adjustment, we  obtained inflation factors from OMB for all future repayment years, and  inflated Education\u2019s forecasted borrower incomes and poverty guidelines  into the appropriate year\u2019s dollar units.

This random sample of borrowers was also drawn from the  National Student Loan Database and reflected all loan activity through the  end of fiscal year 2013, including but not limited to, the amount borrowed,  loan type, and repayment plan. From this sample, Education selected all  borrowers who had already begun repaying their loans under an IDR plan  by September 2013. For the purpose of modeling future loan cohorts,  Education assumes all borrowers entering repayment after September  2013 will have the same characteristics as borrowers who entered  repayment in 2013.", "Education then estimates how much each of these borrowers will owe on  their loans over a 31-year span, based on the borrower\u2019s estimated  adjusted gross income (income) and family size for each year in the  repayment period and the rules of the IDR plan selected. Education used  a two-step process to forecast borrower income and family size:  1.  To forecast borrowers\u2019 future incomes, Education first worked with  Treasury to estimate past incomes, filing status, and family sizes of  the sample of borrowers who had entered repayment by the end of  fiscal year 2013. Treasury developed these estimates because  Education does not collect tax data on all borrowers. Treasury collects  this information for all U.S. tax filers, but did not share actual data  from these borrowers\u2019 tax filings due to privacy restrictions. Instead, it  created a tax file that contained substituted, or \u201cimputed,\u201d information  based on borrower characteristics including age, gender, loan  balance, dependency status and family income. Treasury first  estimated if a borrower would file taxes in a given year. For each  borrower estimated to file taxes, it then imputed estimated nominal  incomes and number of tax exemptions (approximating family size) for  each of the borrower\u2019s repayment years that occurred in tax years  1996 through 2013. For example, borrowers who entered repayment  in 1996 would have 18 years of imputed incomes while borrowers  entering repayment in 2000 would have 14 years. (See Evaluating  Income Data Used in Education\u2019s Approach in appendix III for more  information on Treasury\u2019s methodology to estimate borrower incomes  and our assessment of error associated with its approach).  2.  To forecast future incomes of each borrower in its sample from 2014  through the end of the borrower\u2019s repayment period (up to 31 years in  the future), Education first converted the estimated historical income  data from Treasury from calendar years into \u201crepayment years.\u201d A  borrower who began repaying his loan in calendar year 2000 would  have estimated historical income data covering repayment years 1  through 14 (formerly calendar years 2000 through 2013). To forecast  that borrower\u2019s future income in repayment year 15, Education first  matched the borrower with a set of borrowers with similar  characteristics. Education then randomly selected a borrower from  this matched set of borrowers and substituted the nominal historical  income observation from the same repayment year. It repeated this  step for each subsequent year of the borrower\u2019s maximum repayment  period, choosing a different borrower\u2019s nominal historical income  observation in each year. Because Education matched the borrowers  in their file with Treasury\u2019s based on their repayment year (as  opposed to calendar year), the nominal historical income values used  in the forecasts could come from various non-sequential calendar  years. (See Evaluating Income Data Used in Education\u2019s Approach in  appendix III for more information on Education\u2019s methodology and the  error associated with its approach).", "Once Education forecasted incomes and family size for each borrower in  the sample\u2019s entire repayment period, Education then applied the rules of  the borrower\u2019s selected IDR plan to calculate the amount the borrower  would owe over time. For instance, a borrower in the New Income-Based  Repayment plan would pay 10 percent of her discretionary income for 20  years, whereas a borrower in the Income-Contingent Repayment plan  would pay 20 percent of her discretionary income for 25 years. For  borrowers in the file who had not yet selected an IDR plan as September  2013 (i.e., those estimated to enter repayment in 2014 or later),  Education selects a plan for them based on assumptions about borrower  behavior. For borrowers in the Income-Contingent Repayment plan, the  IDR plan repayment model annually reevaluates whether they will switch  into the Income-Based Repayment plan, and does so if the borrower\u2019s  monthly payment amount would be lowered by at least $50 by switching  into the Income-Based Repayment plan. The IDR plan repayment model  switches a borrower into the Revised Pay As You Earn Plan if that  borrower is not eligible for the Pay As You Earn or New Income-Based  Repayment plans and if the borrower saw his or her payment fall by $50  compared to what would be owed under the Income-Based Repayment  plan. Borrowers were assumed to choose Revised Pay As You Earn if the  present value of the payments with Revised Pay As You Earn were lower  than the present value of payments without Revised Pay As You Earn  using a 30 percent discount rate. Education used a high discount rate  because borrowers would likely place much less weight on the higher  payments that would be likely to occur toward the end of the repayment  period. Borrowers already in IDR repayment were assumed to choose  Revised Pay As You Earn in the first year their payments fell by $50 a  month or more. Borrowers who had not yet chosen an IDR plan were  assumed to choose Revised Pay As You Earn if their payments would be  lower in the first year. Borrowers stay in an IDR plan for their entire  repayment period, even if their income rises beyond the point at which  they would qualify if they were applying in that year, in order to calculate  possible loan forgiveness amounts.", "The IDR plan repayment model also includes predictions about when  borrowers will delay repaying their loans (through deferment and  forbearance); when they will fail to repay their loans (due to default,  death, and disability); when they will prepay their loans through  consolidation; and when their loan balances will be forgiven due to  participation in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program or at the  end of their IDR plan\u2019s full repayment term.", "The IDR plan repayment model\u2019s final output consists of cash flows  received (broken out by principal and interest) and foregone (such as  through default, death, and disability) for each of the 31 years of  repayment.

Treasury staff told us that  they lacked the time and prior experience with Education\u2019s data to have a  pre-existing model to meet these specifications. Instead, Treasury used  graphical methods to automatically identify a model that best fit the joint  distribution of the data across several variables and allowed for the  simulation of new imputed data.

First, Treasury  rescaled all variables from their natural scales into discrete categories,  which primarily affected borrower incomes, which are naturally measured  in continuous nominal dollars. Using categories of incomes rather than  the continuous dollar scale allowed Treasury to develop a model using  graphical methods that required less computing power. Second, Treasury  used graphical methods to identify the relationships (or dependencies)  among the borrower and tax variables in the matched data, in the form of  multivariate crosstabulations. The model first estimated the probability  that a borrower would file a tax return in a given year, and then modeled  the joint distribution of the data, given that the first-stage model estimated  that a borrower would file a return. After estimating these  crosstabulations, Treasury created a single imputed dataset by drawing  random variates from the fitted joint distribution of the data, in order to  replace records in the actual dataset.", "When imputing incomes, Treasury staff told us they took an additional  step to transform the imputed income variables from a categorical to  continuous scale by drawing random dollar values from probability  distributions. For borrowers with incomes imputed in the lowest and  highest categories, Treasury simulated continuous incomes by drawing  from normal or log-normal distributions with moments set to their sample  values.

The model imputed a borrower\u2019s income in the current year  based on the borrower\u2019s one-year lagged income, which generally  ensures that the imputed data recreates the correlation between incomes  in adjacent years (i.e., the first-order autocorrelation).

Imputation can also produce imputed datasets  that are unbiased but have a high degree of imputation error. (More  specifically, the variance of a model\u2019s posterior predictive distribution can  be large.) In these cases, the imputed distribution of the data will  resemble the actual distribution across many imputations, but the imputed  distribution in any one sample of imputed data, often one random  simulation, may be quite different.

The imputed data will vary randomly across implicates,  depending on the nature and precision of the imputation method, because  most imputation models have a partially random or probabilistic structure.

Accurate longitudinal profiles of income are important, because  Education\u2019s IDR plan repayment model includes a number of calculations  at the borrower level, such as specific payment amounts and borrowers\u2019  eligibility for specific IDR plans, which use the sequence of data within  borrowers over time as inputs and are re-calculated each year over the  repayment period.", "Treasury staff told us they did not seek to impute incomes on the dollar  scale.

The frequency statistics showed  that the marginal and joint distributions of key variables were generally  similar in the imputed and actual data for the categorical data, but that the  secondary imputation of dollar scale incomes produced additional error  for borrowers in the lowest and highest income categories. As the  Treasury-provided summary statistics in table 1 show, the mean imputed  income was about 2.1 times smaller than the mean actual income among  borrowers who earned $12,000 or less. The imputed mean was about 1.9  times larger than the actual mean for borrowers in the highest income  category. Treasury officials agreed that imputation error may be greater in  the lowest and highest categories, but speculated that the error may not  be practically consequential for the calculation of income-based loan  payments. However, because these data form the foundation of  numerous individual-level sequential calculations that determine what  borrowers are estimated to repay to the government, error associated  with the data should be measured and its effect on budget estimates  should be assessed.", "By design, Treasury\u2019s imputation model ensured that the correlation  between incomes in adjacent years was similar in the imputed and actual  data. Despite this important constraint, the model did not seek to  accurately impute complete, realistic profiles of dollar-scaled incomes  over time within the same borrower for all observed years. Consequently,  the imputed profiles of incomes over time within borrowers were not  designed to ensure that they resemble those observed in the actual data  at the individual level. Treasury staff confirmed this feature of the imputed  data.", "Our limited exploratory analysis of the imputed dollar-scaled income data  revealed patterns consistent with these features of the imputation.  Incomes were less strongly correlated between adjacent years in the  imputed data than in the actual data, based on statistics that Treasury  staff provided. Specifically, let Var(AGIt | ADIt-1, AGIt-2, \u2026 , AGIt-k)  denote the marginal variance of incomes at time t, conditional on k  previous values. In the imputed data, the limited evidence available to us  suggests that the estimated conditional variance in the imputed data may  exceed the actual variance in the population of student loan borrowers.  The Pearson correlation between incomes in the current and previous  year, truncated to the interval of positive incomes less than $1 million,  was 0.84 in the actual data and 0.58 in the imputed data. In other words,  one measure of the year-to-year instability of incomes was about 44  percent larger than in the actual data. In addition, the absolute value of  incomes changed between adjacent years by 52 percent in the actual  data but 75 percent in the imputed data. Consistent with these aggregate  statistics, figure 19 shows how imputed incomes vary by large amounts  from year to year within the same 10 randomly selected borrowers  presented previously in the report, this time with their tax filing status  indicated. Figure 20 illustrates how imputed incomes vary by large  amounts from year to year within the same 60 randomly selected  borrowers.", "The secondary imputation of incomes in dollars may explain the patterns  above. Simulating dollar-scaled incomes from a set of uniform, normal, or  log-normal distributions would have added some amount of  approximation error, potentially inflating the conditional variance above in  the imputed data. The degree of error would depend on how strongly the  actual income distribution within each category diverged from the  assumed distribution (e.g., its nonlinearity when simulated as uniform).  Consistent with this explanation, Treasury staff reported nearly identical  Pearson correlations between current and 1-year lagged categorical  incomes in the imputed and actual data, at 0.69 and 0.67, respectively.  The approximation error for continuous incomes may have compounded  across years when Treasury staff independently simulated incomes for  the same borrowers in adjacent years, without constraining the imputed  distribution to preserve the potential dependency of incomes across  second-order lags and higher.", "Treasury staff emphasized that adjusted gross income can be more  volatile over time than other measures of income. Adjusted gross income  includes gross wages, business income, and asset income, among other  sources, as well as certain deductions and credits. According to Treasury  staff, adjusted gross income can vary more substantially over time than  other sources of income, such as wages, and that such variation is  common among upper-income filers. However, we found that the  absolute value of imputed adjusted gross incomes varied between  adjacent years by 15 to 77 percent for the middle 50 percent of the  sample of borrowers with adjusted gross incomes above 0 and less than  $400,000. The widespread nature of the volatility conflicts with an  explanation that emphasizes volatile sources of income, deductions, and  credits among borrowers with high incomes.", "We did not receive sufficient information to fully evaluate the nature and  extent of imputation error in the Treasury data, and how it would affect  Education\u2019s IDR plan cost estimates. For instance, we did not receive  Treasury\u2019s computer code or the actual tax data. Instead, Treasury staff  described the analysis in interviews and written briefing slides, as well as  a 7-page summary of the analysis that they previously provided to  Education. The correlations and proportional change statistics above are  limited in their ability to fully describe complete profiles of incomes at the  individual borrower level and their dependence over time, because they  describe linear associations only between data from adjacent years.  Additional analysis, with full access to the imputation model code and tax  data and a thorough assessment of the longitudinal structure of incomes  within borrowers over time, is necessary to confirm the imputation error  suggested by the limited evidence we obtained from Treasury."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Forecasting Future Borrower Incomes and Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["The IDR plan repayment model uses the imputed data on borrower  incomes and other characteristics to forecast these data for future  repayment years that have not yet occurred.

Conversely, for a borrower who entered repayment in 1986  and repaid all debt in 2000, the data would span the last four historical  years but not the first 10. Many other types of overlap are possible.", "The repayment model uses these historical data and hot-deck methods to  impute or forecast data for repayment years that have not yet occurred.  The hot-deck is a general purpose method of imputation, which statistical  organizations commonly use to impute missing survey data. For a set of  records needing imputation, hot-deck methods use a set of covariates to  identify one or more records in the data with observed values on all  variables, which is similar to the record needing imputation. The method  then substitutes the observed values for the values needing imputation,  often using random selection among the donor records when multiple  donor records are available.", "Once the repayment model forecasts data for unobserved repayment  years, it treats them as known, observed data. The repayment model  uses the forecasted data as input for the second stage of modeling, which  applies various assumptions about how borrowers will repay their loans  over time.

Using  either approach, accepted statistical practice involves quantifying and  propagating the error that is inherently associated with prediction.", "An econometric approach would use an explicit statistical model for how  the forecasted variable depends on several other variables (or  covariates). Additional assumptions would describe how the imputed  variable varies over time, either through covariates (such as time  indicators) or assumptions about the variable\u2019s random fluctuation around  its long-term mean (such as an error term with an autoregressive order 1  structure). These model assumptions provide explicit formulas to predict  future values of the variable and to quantify the likely error of prediction.  The latter formulas for prediction error (or the posterior predictive  distribution) can allow analysts to propagate the error of prediction into  subsequent analyses of those predictions.", "An alternative approach would use more advanced methods of imputing  missing data, such as multiple, maximum likelihood, or expectation- maximization imputation. These methods assume an explicit probability  model for the joint distribution of the data, with parameters that can be  estimated from the data. Analysts can use various methods for drawing  from the fitted data distribution, in order to generate multiple implicate  datasets, as discussed above. This allows for analysts to quantify and  propagate error across subsequent analyses of the imputed data.", "Education\u2019s application of the hot-deck method does not follow these  general statistical principles. The method imputes the future values of all unknown data, using donor cases that are similar on a set of covariates,  such as gender and highest educational program level. After making  predictions, the method does not quantify the prediction error of the  estimates, using in-sample statistics such as mean-squared error,  misclassification rates, deviance statistics, predictive p-values, or the  estimated variance of the posterior predictive distribution.", "Once the repayment model forecasts the income data for future years, it  assumes that the estimates have zero prediction error associated with  them, or equivalently, that the error does not affect the repayment  model\u2019s loan cost estimates. Since any applied method of forecasting or  imputation produces error, and Education\u2019s IDR plan cost estimates are  highly sensitive to changes in borrower income forecasts, it is important  for Education to measure this error and determine its ultimate impact on  IDR plan cost estimates.", "Moreover, the IDR repayment model uses source data that have their  own unquantified imputation error from Treasury\u2019s imputation. These two  sources of error\u2014Treasury\u2019s imputation and Education\u2019s forecast\u2014may  interact and combine in ways that further increase the bias and  imprecision of Education\u2019s loan cost estimates. The presence of multiple  forms of error, at different stages of analysis, emphasizes the importance  of propagating all sources of error through the entire analysis, or else  eliminating imputation error from the imputed data by using actual  observations. At a minimum, Education should acknowledge the  presence of imputation error and identify how it might affect estimates  from the repayment model. Such acknowledgements would provide more  transparent information to users of its estimates, compared to point  estimates that do not disclose the limitations of the source data.", "Statistical organizations accept the need for users of imputed data, such  as Education, to quantify and assess the effects of imputation error,  despite their release of public data that have been imputed.

In recent  years, the Census has generated imputed data for several surveys, the  Survey of Income and Program Participation and Longitudinal Business  Database, but has warned that analyzing imputed data without necessary corrections may understate the variance of estimates.
