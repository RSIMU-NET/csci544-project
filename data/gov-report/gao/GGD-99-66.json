At the time we reviewed these five test plans, OPM had not completed development of all its test plans. The five test plans that we reviewed were prepared and submitted by three OPM offices: the Employment Service, the Office of Communication, and the Retirement and Insurance Service. OPM\u2019s business continuity project manager said that these offices included the most critical of the agency\u2019s core processes.", "We used our business continuity planning guide as a framework to review the five contingency test plans. Our review of these test plans showed that important elements were often not addressed. Elements missing from the test plans included clearly defined test objectives, necessary personnel and their roles, the duration and location of tests, and expected test results. These elements are important because they allow the agency to evaluate whether individual contingency plans are capable of providing the desired level of support to the agency\u2019s core business processes and whether the plans can be implemented within a specified period of time.", "At our April 2, 1999, meeting with OPM to discuss its written comments on our draft report, agency officials provided us with documentation that demonstrated that the agency had taken additional action to incorporate these missing elements into its test plans. This additional information showed that its test plans included the important elements needed for testing, such as test objectives, necessary personnel, the duration and location of tests, and expected test results.

OPM developed a strong planning strategy for its business continuity planning efforts by creating a project structure and milestones for the planning effort, identifying core business processes, establishing key reporting requirements, and obtaining solid support for the planning effort from the agency\u2019s senior managers. Once a Year 2000 continuity strategy is developed, successful implementation becomes crucial to providing reasonable assurances that the agency has reduced the risk and potential impact of Year 2000-induced information system failures.", "In response to concerns we raised during our review, OPM undertook actions to improve the implementation of its Year 2000 business continuity planning strategy. OPM\u2019s Year 2000 risk and impact assessment now includes the assignment of risk to each of its mission-critical information systems. OPM\u2019s Year 2000 contingency plans now address key information that is essential for ensuring the continuity of agency operations. Finally, OPM\u2019s contingency test plans now include important elements for determining the effectiveness of its contingency plans.

On April 2, 1999, we met with OPM officials to obtain and discuss the agency\u2019s written comments on our draft report. At this meeting, OPM provided us with its written comments as well as supplemental documentation that showed that the agency had taken additional actions to respond to our concerns. Descriptions of the additional actions that OPM undertook were incorporated throughout this report. OPM\u2019s written comments, which were provided by OPM\u2019s Deputy Director, are reprinted in appendix IV and summarized and evaluated here.", "In its written comments, OPM stated that during our review we made a number of good suggestions that were helpful to the agency in its ongoing Year 2000 business continuity planning efforts. Although OPM commended our effort, the agency said that it disagreed with various statements in our draft report. OPM\u2019s overall disagreement with the conclusions and recommendations in our draft report focused primarily on the timing of our review. OPM stated that our review occurred in the middle of the agency\u2019s Year 2000 business continuity planning efforts, and as a result, the material we reviewed was preliminary and incomplete. Although we recognized that OPM\u2019s preparation for the Year 2000 computing problem was an ongoing effort, we based the timing of our review on the schedule that OPM had established for completing various milestones in its business continuity planning process. For example, OPM\u2019s schedule called for the completion of its initial Year 2000 contingency plans by December 2, 1998; we began our review of these plans later in that month. Additionally, in response to OPM\u2019s request, we delayed completion of our scheduled audit work so that the agency could provide us with contingency test plans from various OPM units.", "In commenting on a recommendation in our draft report that OPM complete a Year 2000 risk assessment for the agency\u2019s mission-critical systems, OPM stated that after we raised concerns about the timing of its verification efforts, it accelerated the schedule for the independent verification contractor to provide it with information about the risk associated with its mission-critical systems. OPM stated that with assistance from its verification contractor, the agency developed a risk assessment for each of its 109 mission-critical systems. At the April 2, 1999, meeting with OPM to discuss the agency\u2019s written comments on our draft report, OPM officials provided us with documentation that showed the criteria OPM used to assess the systems and the results of the risk assessment for each system. OPM officials told us that they would use this assessment to prioritize the agency\u2019s Year 2000 business continuity planning efforts. To recognize the additional action that OPM undertook in developing the risk assessment, we made changes to the relevant sections of our report, including the removal of our recommendation that OPM develop a Year 2000 risk assessment of its mission-critical systems.", "In commenting on the conclusion in our draft report that OPM\u2019s plans did not demonstrate that the agency considered all its mission-critical systems in the planning process, OPM stated that all the automated systems that support its core business functions had been considered in the business continuity planning process. OPM stated that during our review, it had provided us with a crosswalk that linked each core business process to all mission-critical systems supporting it. Although this process of linking core business processes to mission-critical systems is important to document for planning purposes, this process alone did not demonstrate that OPM considered or included all the agency\u2019s mission-critical systems in its Year 2000 contingency plans. After it had given us its written comments on our draft report, OPM provided us with a crosswalk that linked each of its critical systems to the relevant sections of its contingency plans. By creating this crosswalk of its critical systems to its contingency plans, OPM was able to ensure that all critical systems were considered in the agency\u2019s planning process. In response to this additional action, we made revisions to the relevant sections of our report, including the removal of our recommendation that OPM ensure its contingency plans demonstrate that all critical systems have been considered in the agency\u2019s contingency plans.", "Regarding a recommendation in our draft report that OPM revise its Year 2000 contingency plans to provide clear procedures and responsibilities for activation and implementation, OPM stated that this lack of clear procedures and assignment of responsibilities was not an oversight but was the result of our review\u2019s being done while OPM was still developing its plans. Our review of OPM\u2019s contingency plans, however, occurred in mid-December 1998, after the date by which OPM had requested that its units submit their contingency plans. We based the timing of our review of OPM\u2019s contingency plans on the agency\u2019s internal schedule for completing its initial contingency plans. At the April 2, 1999, meeting with OPM to discuss the agency\u2019s written comment on our draft report, agency officials provided us with documentation that showed that OPM had taken additional action to address our recommendation concerning clear procedures and responsibilities for plan activation and implementation. This new information showed that OPM had identified the officials responsible for activating and implementing the contingency plans, specified the triggers for plan activation, and articulated the procedures needed for operating in contingency mode. In response to the supplemental documentation that OPM provided to us, we amended our report to reflect OPM\u2019s additional work on this issue and removed our recommendation from the report.", "As to a recommendation in our draft report concerning the development of a zero day or day one strategy and procedures, OPM stated that after we had completed our audit work, it developed zero day plans for the various OPM units. In its written comments, OPM stated that from the outset of its business continuity planning process, the agency had intended for OPM units to submit their zero day plans in April 1999. OPM stated that the absence of a zero day strategy was not due to an oversight but rather to the fact that these plans were not yet due. During our review, however, OPM\u2019s business continuity project manager initially told us that he did not know when OPM would develop its zero day plans. Prior to OPM\u2019s written comments on a draft of this report, the plans that OPM had provided to us did not specify when the agency\u2019s zero day strategy and procedures would be completed. In response to the additional information that OPM provided to us, we amended our report to reflect that OPM was requiring its units to submit their respective zero day plans in April 1999. Our report now also states that OPM provided us with additional documentation showing that OPM units had developed zero day plans. In addition, we removed our recommendation calling for OPM to develop a zero day strategy and procedures.", "As to a recommendation in our draft report that OPM ensure that its Year 2000 contingency test plans include important elements needed to test their effectiveness, OPM stated that it had always intended for this information to be part of the completed test plans. The contingency test plans that OPM made available to us for review in February 1999, however, were often missing elements that our business continuity planning guide states are important. At our April 2, 1999, meeting with OPM, agency officials provided us with information that showed that the agency had taken additional action to document these important elements, including test objectives, necessary personnel, the duration and location of tests, and expected test results. In response to OPM\u2019s additional actions on this issue, we revised our report to reflect that OPM had documented these important elements in its contingency test plans. In addition, we removed our recommendation that OPM ensure that its test plans include the important elements needed to test their effectiveness.", "We are sending copies of the report to the Honorable Janice R.

To accomplish these objectives, we relied on our Year 2000 business continuity planning guide, which provides a structured approach for helping agencies manage the risk of potential Year 2000-induced disruptions to their operations. This structured approach helps to ensure that agencies have, at a minimum, addressed the important components of a well-developed business continuity plan for the Year 2000 computing problem.", "To assess OPM\u2019s efforts in developing a Year 2000 business continuity planning strategy, we reviewed key OPM documents related to Year 2000 planning, including internal monthly status reports, minutes of business continuity work group meetings, and monthly and quarterly status reports to OMB.
