In fiscal year 2016, small businesses in Puerto Rico received about 47 percent of federal contracting obligations to Puerto Rico (about $319 million out of $682 million) compared to 23 percent of federal obligations awarded to small businesses nationwide. Of the four Small Business Administration (SBA) programs that provide contracting preferences based on socioeconomic designations, a higher percentage of obligations was awarded in Puerto Rico through the 8(a) Business Development program compared to the Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) programs. The use of 8(a) contract awards in Puerto Rico was somewhat higher than nationwide, while the use of the other three SBA programs was roughly comparable.", "Agencies and industry associations GAO interviewed identified several challenges small businesses in Puerto Rico may face in obtaining federal contracting opportunities. Challenges they identified included a lack of knowledge about the federal contracting process; difficulty meeting procurement requirements; and difficulty accessing bonding, financing, and capital. Many of these challenges are similar to those GAO identified in a September 2012 report (GAO-12-873) that small businesses in general face in seeking federal contracting opportunities. However, stakeholders indicated that some challenges may be exacerbated by Puerto Rico's geography and economic conditions. Stakeholders did not identify any federal laws that have created unique contracting challenges for small businesses in the region.

Total federal  contracting obligations in Puerto Rico have ranged from a low of $404  million to a high of $1 billion during the past 10 fiscal years. The Small  Business Administration (SBA) administers several programs in Puerto  Rico and nationwide that provide federal contracting preferences to small  businesses, including the 8(a) Business Development (8(a)), Historically  Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone), Women-Owned Small Business  (WOSB), and Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business  (SDVOSB) programs. Small businesses certified with these  socioeconomic designations benefit from federal contracting preferences,  such as sole source contracts (awards are made without competition) and  set-aside contracts (awards are limited to a designated pool of competing  firms). The federal government has additionally specified annual prime  contracting and subcontracting goals for designated small business  categories.", "Puerto Rico currently faces many economic challenges. U.S. Census  Bureau\u2019s Puerto Rico Community Survey and American Community  Survey from 2015 show that about 46 percent of Puerto Rico\u2019s residents  live below the federal poverty level, compared to a national average of  about 15 percent. Additionally, as of June 2017, Puerto Rico\u2019s  government faces a debt crisis. In June 2016, Congress enacted the  Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act to  address the debt crisis and Puerto Rico\u2019s fiscal affairs. The act includes a  provision for us to evaluate the application and utilization of SBA  programs in Puerto Rico (including contracting activities relating to  HUBZone small business concerns) and identify any provision of federal  law that may create an obstacle to efficient implementation of such  activities related to these programs. This report examines (1) trends in  small business contracting and the use of SBA programs that provide  federal contracting preferences to small businesses in Puerto Rico from  fiscal years 2006 through 2016, and (2) stakeholder views on any  challenges small businesses in Puerto Rico face in obtaining federal  contracting opportunities, including those posed by federal laws, and  steps SBA and other agencies have taken to assist Puerto Rican small  businesses in obtaining federal contracting opportunities.", "To identify trends in the use of SBA programs that provide federal  contracting preferences to small businesses in Puerto Rico from fiscal  years 2006 through 2016, we analyzed data on prime contract obligation  amounts for Puerto Rico and nationwide from the Federal Procurement  Data System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG) for those fiscal years. We  also analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community  Survey on HUBZone census tracts. We assessed the reliability of the  FPDS-NG and U.S. Census Bureau data by reviewing relevant related  documentation and determined that they were sufficiently reliable for  analyzing trends and for describing economic conditions in HUBZone  areas. To identify stakeholder views on any challenges that small  businesses in Puerto Rico face in obtaining federal contracting  opportunities, including those posed by federal laws, and steps SBA and  other agencies have taken to assist Puerto Rican small businesses in  obtaining federal contracting opportunities, we interviewed SBA officials  and other stakeholders such as federal agency contracting officials,  industry associations, and economic development entities in Puerto Rico.

We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Under the Small Business Act, SBA plays an important role in ensuring  that small businesses gain access to federal contracting opportunities.  SBA negotiates specific agency-wide goals to help ensure that the federal  government collectively meets the 23 percent statutory goal for contract  dollars awarded to small businesses. In addition, SBA administers the  8(a), HUBZone, WOSB, and SDVOSB programs that are intended to  assist small businesses of various socioeconomic categories. Firms with  multiple socioeconomic designations can receive set-asides or sole  source contracts under one or more of the four programs. For example, a  HUBZone firm that also qualifies as an SDVOSB could receive an award  under the SDVOSB program as well as another under the HUBZone  program. Each program has different requirements. As of March 2017,  Puerto Rico had 76 8(a) certified businesses, 40 HUBZone certified  businesses, 256 WOSBs, and 56 SDVOSBs.  8(a) Program: The purpose of the 8(a) program is to develop small  businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged  individuals. A business must meet several initial eligibility requirements to  qualify for the 8(a) program. For example, the firm must be a small  business as defined by SBA, it must be owned and controlled by one or  more socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who are of  good character and U.S. citizens, and it must demonstrate the potential  for success. Upon certification by SBA, the business may stay in the  program for 9 years if it meets other requirements for continued  participation.", "HUBZone Program: Congress created the HUBZone program in 1997 to  stimulate economic development in economically distressed communities  by designating certain areas as HUBZones. There are several types of  HUBZone areas, including qualified census tracts, which are determined  by the area\u2019s poverty rate or household income. SBA updates HUBZone  designations based on whether areas meet statutory criteria, such as  having certain income levels or poverty or unemployment rates. For  example, SBA revised the designation of HUBZones based on the  release of the 2010 U.S. Census Bureau data in October 2011. For a  business to be certified by SBA as a HUBZone business, it must meet the  following criteria: be small by SBA size standards, be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by U.S. citizens, have its principal office\u2014the location where the greatest number of  employees perform their work\u2014located in a HUBZone, and have at least 35 percent of its employees reside in a HUBZone.", "On June 16, 2016, SBA announced that it had revised the definition of  qualified census tracts eligible to be designated as HUBZones to provide  additional opportunities for small businesses in Puerto Rico and  nationwide to participate in the HUBZone program. Previously, in addition  to poverty rate and income, a statutory population cap limited the number  of eligible census tracts. Under the cap, in metropolitan areas where more  than 20 percent of the population qualified, the list of eligible census  tracts was ordered from the highest percentage of eligible households to  the lowest until the 20 percent limit was exceeded. By lifting the  population cap, SBA expanded the number of eligible census tracts in  Puerto Rico by 516 (from 260 to 776). As a result, nearly all of Puerto  Rico now qualifies as a HUBZone (see fig.1). In the rest of the United  States, the number of eligible census tracts increased by 1,499 (from  15,938 to 17,437). (See app. II for maps of the newly eligible and existing  census tracts in the United States, excluding U.S. territories.)", "WOSB Program: In 1994, Congress established a goal of not less than 5  percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for  each fiscal year for WOSBs to increase federal contracting opportunities  for WOSBs. In 2000, Congress authorized the WOSB program and SBA  issued implementing regulations that became effective in 2011. Under the  program, contracts are reserved for WOSBs in designated industries in  which WOSBs and economically disadvantaged WOSBs were historically  underrepresented. Set-aside and sole source awards can be made to  WOSBs only in those designated industries. Various changes have  been made to the WOSB program since it was established, including the  removal of limitations on the amount of contract dollars in a set-aside that  WOSBs can compete for in 2013 and allowing sole source awards  starting in October 2015. Among other eligibility requirements, a business  must be at least 51 percent owned and controlled by one or more women;  it must be certified as eligible by a third party or be self-certified by the  business owner; and the owner must provide documents demonstrating  that the business meets program requirements.", "SDVOSB Program: The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business  Development Act of 1999 established an annual government-wide goal of  not less than 3 percent of the total value of all prime contract and  subcontract awards for SDVOSBs. In addition, the Veterans Benefits  Act of 2003 gave federal contracting officers the authority to restrict  competition to SDVOSBs and award a sole source or set-aside contract  where certain criteria are met. To be eligible, the business must be  majority-owned by one or more service-disabled veterans who manage  and control daily business operations, and it must qualify as a small  business under the North American Industry Classification System Code  industry-size standards. The Veterans Benefits, Health Care, and  Information Technology Act of 2006 requires the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA) to set aside contracts for SDVOSBs and other veteran-owned  small businesses (unless a sole source contract is used) if the contracting  officer expects two or more such firms to submit awards. VA may make  sole source awards of up to $5 million, without a determination that only  an SDVOSB or a veteran-owned small business is available.", "Other categories. Other socioeconomic programs include those for  veterans, small disadvantaged businesses, and other small businesses.", "To help ensure that small businesses receive a share of federal  procurement contract dollars, Congress has set an annual government- wide goal of awarding not less than 23 percent of prime contract dollars to  small businesses. To promote this goal, the Small Business Act permits  contracting officers at federal agencies to award contracts to small  businesses through set-aside or sole source to 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB,  and SDVOSB businesses, under certain requirements. Federal agencies  are generally required to set aside contracts with values exceeding  $150,000 if the contracting officer expects at least two small businesses  to submit bids for the procurement. Under the HUBZone, WOSB, and  SDVOSB programs, a contracting officer may award sole source  contracts valued up to $4 million if the contracting officer does not have a  reasonable expectation that two or more small businesses would submit  offers and the award can be made at a fair and reasonable price. Under  the 8(a) program, federal agencies are to make sole source awards for  contracts valued up to $4 million. Federal agencies are also required to  reserve contracts with values exceeding $3,000 but less than $150,000  for small businesses exclusively if the contracting officer expects at least  two small businesses to submit bids.", "The Small Business Act also established other programs and resources  to assist small businesses nationwide, including with small business  contracting activities. Among them, SBA employs Procurement Center  Representatives (PCR) to assist small businesses in obtaining federal  contracts. Among other activities, PCRs can make recommendations to  agency contracting officers that proposed contracts be set aside for  eligible small businesses. In addition, the act generally requires federal  agencies with procurement authorities to establish an Office of Small and  Disadvantaged Business Utilization to oversee the agency\u2019s functions and  duties related to the awarding of contracts to small and disadvantaged  businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Among Other Trends, the Percentage of Obligations to Small Businesses in Puerto Rico Was Relatively High, and Use of SBA Programs Varied", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of federal prime contracting data identified a number of  trends in federal contracting obligations to small businesses in Puerto  Rico from fiscal years 2006 through 2016.

Additionally, we found that a  greater percentage of obligations was awarded to small businesses in  Puerto Rico through full and open competition and the 8(a) program  compared to the other three SBA socioeconomic contracting programs.  We also found that the number of HUBZone applications has increased  since SBA expanded the number of HUBZone-eligible census tracts in  June 2016; about half of the applicants were located in newly designated  HUBZone-qualified census tracts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Small Businesses in Puerto Rico Received a Relatively High Percentage of Federal Prime Contracting Obligations", "paragraphs": ["The percentage of federal prime contracting obligations awarded to small  businesses within Puerto Rico for contracts performed there was  relatively high from fiscal years 2006 through 2016, particularly in the last  4 fiscal years.

In fiscal year 2016, small  businesses in Puerto Rico received about 47 percent of federal prime  contracting obligations (about $319 million out of $682 million) for work  performed there. In contrast, federal prime contracting obligations  awarded to small businesses nationwide were consistently around 20  percent from fiscal years 2006 through 2013 and increased to about 23  percent from fiscal years 2014 through 2016; in fiscal year 2016, small  businesses nationwide received about 23 percent of the federal prime  contracting obligations (see fig. 2).", "For the contracts performed in Puerto Rico by small businesses, most  obligations went to businesses also located in Puerto Rico, although  some obligations were awarded to businesses located elsewhere, such  as on the U.S. mainland.

We also found that small businesses in Puerto Rico largely  performed contracts inside of Puerto Rico rather than outside of Puerto  Rico. Specifically, more than 94 percent of the small businesses located  in Puerto Rico that received contract awards received them for work  performed in Puerto Rico each fiscal year from 2006 through 2016, with  the exception of fiscal year 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Full and Open Competition and the 8(a) Program Were the Most Prevalent Bases for Awards to Small Businesses in Puerto Rico for Work Performed There", "paragraphs": ["As previously discussed, small businesses can receive federal prime  contracts based on full and open competition and through set-asides and  sole source awards they may qualify for based on their certifications from  one or more of the four SBA socioeconomic programs or other  socioeconomic designations. To illustrate how SBA certifications may  have influenced the ability of small businesses in Puerto Rico to obtain  prime contracts for work performed in Puerto Rico, we analyzed contract  obligations based on whether awards were obtained through the four SBA  programs or through other means. As shown in figure 3, we found that a  substantial percentage of contracting obligations for this period were  awarded to small businesses in Puerto Rico outside of these four  programs, either based on full and open competition or through set- asides or sole source awards based on other socioeconomic  designations. For fiscal years 2006 through 2016, the percentage of  obligations awarded without the use of the four SBA programs ranged  from a combined low of 49 percent in 2009 to a combined high of 82  percent in 2013 for Puerto Rico.", "Consistent with nationwide results, we also found that a higher  percentage of federal prime contracting obligations were awarded through  the 8(a) program than through HUBZone, WOSB, or SDVOSB programs  combined for contracts awarded to small businesses located in Puerto  Rico. The percentage of obligations awarded using the 8(a) program was  higher in Puerto Rico than nationwide, as shown in figure 3. SBA,  Department of Defense (DOD), and General Services Administration  (GSA) officials provided a few potential reasons why the 8(a) program  may have been used more than HUBZone, WOSB, and SDVOSB  programs in Puerto Rico. SBA officials stated that federal agency  contracting officers consider the 8(a) program\u2019s certification process to be  rigorous and believe in the competence of 8(a) businesses. Under the  HUBZone, WOSB, and SDVOSB programs, a contracting officer has the  authority to award using sole source only when it has been determined  that two or more qualified business are not likely to submit offers; this  restriction on the use of sole source contracts does not apply to the 8(a)  program. SBA, GSA, and DOD officials all noted this factor as a reason  why the 8(a) program is more widely used than others. DOD officials  stated that this enables contracting officers to award quickly while GSA  officials noted that using 8(a) sole source allows them to target  contractors, such as those located in Puerto Rico. DOD officials also cited  business development assistance provided by SBA to 8(a) program  participants as an advantage.", "We also found instances in which a few relatively large contracts, in  addition to variation in the number of contracts awarded, caused  substantial variation in the award of obligations using 8(a), HUBZone,  WOSB, and SDVOSB programs in Puerto Rico, as seen in figure 3. For  example, for the 8(a) program, one contract awarded in fiscal year 2009  made up about 46 percent of the obligations awarded through the  program during that year. In fiscal years 2010 and 2011, four large  contracts awarded using the HUBZone program substantially increased  the amount of obligations awarded through the program during those  fiscal years as compared to the other fiscal years. The trends in  obligations awarded for these four programs did not appear to be related  to any particular regulatory or programmatic changes. See appendix V for  information on regulatory or programmatic changes made to these  programs.", "In addition, we found that small businesses in Puerto Rico that had  HUBZone and WOSB designations received a majority of obligations  awarded to them without the use of these respective programs. For  example, in fiscal year 2015, only 7 percent of the obligations awarded to  businesses with HUBZone designations in Puerto Rico were through the  HUBZone program; the remainder were awarded to HUBZone  businesses using other programs\u2014including the other three SBA  programs and other socioeconomic programs \u2014or full and open  competition. In comparison, small businesses in Puerto Rico that had  SDVOSB and 8(a) designations received a majority of the obligations  awarded to them through those respective programs. Agencies can count  contracting dollars awarded to small businesses under more than one  socioeconomic category. For example, if a business with both HUBZone  and SDVOSB designations received a contract through the HUBZone  program, the contracting dollars would count towards both of these  programs\u2019 contracting goals.

Stakeholders in  our 2012 report stated that contract bundling could reduce the number of  contracting opportunities for small businesses. In that report,  representatives from advocacy groups stated that contract bundling could  reduce the number of contracting opportunities available for small and  minority-owned businesses.

Additionally, bundling of acquisitions  undergoes several levels of review to ensure that bundling is necessary.  Specifically, the Small Business Act requires that procuring activities (1)  conduct market research to justify acquisition strategies that could lead to  consolidated procurement requirements, (2) provide advance notice of  substantial bundled solicitations on a public website, and (3) implement  certain procurement strategies when solicitations involve substantial  bundling. According to SBA, FPDS-NG and agency data collection  sources do not currently contain sufficient information to quantify the  extent to which bundling of contract requirements affects the ability of  small businesses to compete as prime contractors or to compare the  savings realized under an existing bundled contract with the potential  savings that may occur if that bundled contract is recompeted in its  current configuration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Difficulty Meeting Procurement Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from four associations and the Federal Contracting  Center stated that the procurement requirements for federal contracts,  such as performance history for construction contracts, posed challenges  for small businesses in Puerto Rico.

Business  owners can search the online locator using the business\u2019s geographic  coordinates or its address, or they can use a color-coded HUBZone map.  Due to the unique formatting of addresses in Puerto Rico, SBA\u2019s system  is not able to process certain addresses. SBA officials told us that they  are aware that SBA\u2019s online tool is unable to process some addresses in  Puerto Rico and have generally advised businesses to search using  geographic coordinates.

For Puerto Rico, we used data on the obligations awarded to  businesses located in Puerto Rico for work performed there. We used the  nationwide data as a reference point for our analysis of small business  federal contracting trends in Puerto Rico. Using these data, we analyzed  the level of federal contracting obligations to small businesses and the  use of SBA\u2019s socioeconomic programs to award obligations to businesses  located in Puerto Rico and nationwide. Those programs are 8(a)  Business Development (8(a)), Historically Underutilized Business Zones  (HUBZone), Women-Owned Small Business (WOSB), and Service- Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB). Additionally, using  fiscal year 2016 data from FPDS-NG, we analyzed the industries with the  highest amounts of obligations and the agencies that awarded the most  obligations. To identify regulatory changes that could have influenced  trends in the use of the SBA socioeconomic programs, we reviewed the  Federal Register and GAO reports. We determined that the data from  FPDS-NG were sufficiently reliable for analyzing trends by reviewing  relevant documents related to the data to determine their reliability.", "To examine the potential influence of a change SBA made to the  HUBZone program in June 2016 that expanded the number of eligible  HUBZone areas, we analyzed monthly data provided by SBA on the number of applications to the HUBZone program in Puerto Rico from  October 2015 through March 2017. We also obtained information from  SBA on the names, addresses, and census tracts of the applicants that  applied between June 2016 and March 2017 to determine if the  applicants came from newly designated census tracts. Further, we  obtained information to determine if the applicants to the HUBZone  program had other certifications by downloading data from SBA\u2019s  Dynamic Small Business Search (DSBS) database on businesses with  certifications in the 8(a), WOSB, and SDVOSB programs. Using DSBS  data, we searched for the names of the HUBZone applicants to determine  if they had these certifications. Additionally, we obtained economic data  from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey and  compared economic conditions of the HUBZone census tracts that were  newly designated and previously existing as well as census tracts  ineligible for the program. We determined that the data from the Census  Bureau, the DSBS database, and other data provided by SBA were  sufficiently reliable for describing economic conditions in HUBZone areas  and for describing the status of HUBZone applicants.

For  SBA, we interviewed officials at the headquarters level and in the Puerto  Rico District Office, as well as Procurement Center Representatives  (PCR) responsible for federal contracting activities in Puerto Rico. For  federal agencies, we interviewed contracting officials at the three  agencies with the largest proportions of small business obligations in  Puerto Rico in fiscal year 2016: the Department of Defense (DOD),  Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), and General Services Administration  (GSA). We also interviewed representatives from the following  organizations located in Puerto Rico: Economic Development Bank for  Puerto Rico, Puerto Rico Trade and Export Company, Federal  Contracting Center, Chamber of Commerce (which included a  representative from the Small Business and Technology Development  Center (SBTDC)), Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA)  Business Center, Minority Development Council, Manufacturers  Association, Builders Association, General Contractors Association, and  an industry observer formerly with the Economist Association. Several of  these stakeholders, such as the Federal Contracting Center, MBDA  Business Center, and SBTDC, provide information and assistance for  federal contracting to businesses. We selected these organizations based  on our analysis of relevant stakeholders, including those representing the  largest industries in which obligations were awarded in Puerto Rico in  fiscal year 2016. Additionally, as we conducted interviews, we asked each  interviewee to suggest additional stakeholders we should interview. We  did not assess the extent to which steps SBA and other agencies have  taken address the challenges stakeholders identified. We reviewed data  on outreach events that SBA provided. We determined that the data  provided by SBA were sufficiently reliable for our purpose of describing  outreach SBA conducted in Puerto Rico. We also conducted a literature  review of trade articles, academic articles, testimonies, and GAO and  SBA reports to identify challenges cited for the 8(a), HUBZone, WOSB,  and SDVOSB programs and challenges faced by small businesses in  federal contracting in Puerto Rico.
