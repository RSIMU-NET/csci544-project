Under the  EDA program, defense items can be transferred to foreign governments  or international organizations; at fundamentally no cost to the recipient  (via a grant) or at a percentage of the original acquisition value of the item  (via sale).

The Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) within  the Department of Defense (DOD) has responsibility for determining  whether proposed transfers could adversely affect U.S. industries. In  recent years, the Humvee manufacturer, has expressed concerns that  transfers of excess Humvees to foreign governments have the potential to  limit the manufacturer\u2019s ability to directly sell new or used vehicles to  requesting countries. The Fiscal Year 2018 National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA) included certain requirements pertaining to the  transfer of excess Humvees. Among other things, the NDAA required that  any Humvees transferred to a foreign country must be modernized in a  manner consistent with vehicles that would be used for operational  purposes by the U.S. military.

These data provided insight  about the countries that have requested EDA Humvees, the condition and  types of vehicles delivered to those countries, and delivery time frames.  We also reviewed documentation provided by countries requesting the  vehicles to identify the intended purpose of the request. We interviewed  agency officials responsible for the data to identify the quality controls in  place to help ensure the data are accurate and reliable.

We reviewed BIS policies and procedures related to the EDA  program to identify the factors BIS considers in making a  recommendation about the adverse effect of a proposed transfer. We also  reviewed data generated by BIS to identify the extent to which the  Humvee manufacturer objected to proposed transfers for the 7-year  period included in our review. We also reviewed data provided by the  Army on the number of Humvees procured for its use and for sale to  foreign governments through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program  from fiscal years 2012 through 2018. To gain insight about DSCA and  BIS\u2019s approach to assess industrial base effects of proposed transfers,  we selected two transfer requests as illustrative case studies: a 2016  transfer for Afghanistan, which was the single largest proposed transfer,  and a 2016 transfer for Albania, which was the only proposed transfer for  which BIS did not sustain the Humvee manufacturer\u2019s objection.

The Foreign Assistance Act  permits the transfer of excess defense articles provided that such  transfers will not adversely affect the industrial base.  In particular, under  the Act, transfers must not reduce the opportunity for U.S. contractors to  sell new or used defense equipment to countries requesting the transfer.   Excess defense items can include aircraft, ammunition, clothing, radios,  trucks, and spare parts.  According to DOD officials, the vast majority of  EDA items are low- to medium-level technologies that, if not transferred,  would either be stored at cost to DOD or destroyed. Excess defense  items can be transferred as grants\u2014as permitted by the Foreign  Assistance Act\u2014or sold to eligible foreign governments at a reduced cost  in \u201cas is, where is\u201d condition pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act.

Multiple federal entities play a role in the EDA  program, as illustrated in figure 1.", "Following the interagency coordination, if DSCA determines the proposed  transfer will not adversely affect industry and thus can proceed, DSCA  notifies Congress about proposed transfers that are valued at over $7  million or that contain significant military equipment. As part of the  congressional notification, DSCA provides information on (1) the purpose  for which the item is being provided to the country, (2) whether the item  has been previously provided to the country, (3) the current value and  original acquisition value of the item, and (4) its findings regarding how  industry will be affected by the proposed transfer. After a 30-day  congressional notification period, DSCA authorizes the proposed transfer  in consultation with State, provided that Congress does not object and all  agencies concur with the transfer.", "DSCA follows the same process to review and approve all proposed EDA  transfers\u2014including for excess Humvees.

DOD plans to shift from procuring new Humvees to sustaining existing  vehicles in its fleet. In its 2014 Tactical Wheeled Vehicle Strategy, the  Army stated plans to buy fewer new Humvees because the vehicle no  longer fully meets its evolving mobility or protection requirements. While  DOD decreased its procurement of Humvees for military operations, it  has plans to upgrade and refurbish existing vehicles. There are nearly  300,000 Humvees or vehicles with the Humvee chassis operating globally  by the U.S. military and other foreign governments. These vehicles are  expected to require ongoing maintenance and upgrades for the next 20 to  30 years.", "DOD routinely conducts industrial base risk  assessments to gain insight on the viability of  current suppliers to meet its current and future  requirements. The assessment takes into  account a range of considerations including  (1) factors that could cause a current supplier  to go out of business or exit the market and  (2) the extent to which an existing supplier  relies on DOD, foreign military sales, or  commercial sales.

The corresponding conference report  stated the conferees\u2019 expectation that any modernization and  refurbishment work must generally be done at no cost to DOD. According  to DOD, the cost to modernize would be incurred by the requesting  foreign government.

In DOD documents we reviewed,  foreign governments cited having limited budgets and being financially  unable to purchase defense equipment such as Humvees. As such, they  rely on the EDA program to acquire defense items. DSCA officials told us  that the modernization work is to be done at no cost to the U.S.  government; however, they added that paying the cost to modernize  Humvees can be cost-prohibitive for foreign governments.", "Foreign governments can request, through DSCA, that the modernization  requirement be waived. Since December 2017, according to DSCA  officials, DSCA has received waiver requests from three foreign  governments but has not exercised the waiver authority. According to  DSCA officials, these requests likely will remain unapproved for the  foreseeable future; however, the provision requiring the refurbishment of  excess Humvees prior to transfer is set to expire in December 2020.  According to DSCA officials, DSCA plans to resume its normal EDA  approval process thereafter. Currently, according to DSCA officials, they  are encouraging foreign governments to look at other options to meet  their fleet requirements, including purchasing new Humvees. However,  DSCA officials acknowledge that, if a foreign government cannot afford to  buy new vehicles, DOD does not have any low-cost vehicles to offer as  an alternative solution.", "However, DOD officials and Army documents we reviewed noted that  even if foreign governments were able to independently fund the  modernization costs, there are not sufficient quantities of the newer model  Humvees\u2014M1100  series\u2014in inventory that can support the additional  weight of the added armored capabilities for the modernized crew  compartment. According to DSCA documentation, the EDA program has  a little over a hundred vehicles that could be refurbished to the  modernization requirements. Additionally, most of the Humvees in DOD\u2019s  inventory are older models that would first require a new expanded  vehicle chassis to withstand the weight of adding armor.

DSCA has considerable latitude for  such decisions as the Foreign Assistance Act, as delegated, does not  specify how determinations should be made on whether proposed  transfers could adversely affect U.S. industries. Historically, DSCA has  sought input from BIS to aid its determination about potential industrial  base effects of proposed transfers. According to DSCA officials, all  proposed EDA Humvee transfers have undergone an assessment of  adverse industrial base effect by BIS. We found that BIS actively engages  the Humvee manufacturer on proposed transfer requests and supported  all but one objection from fiscal years 2012 through 2018. BIS\u2019s standard  practice is to collect information from the prime contractor and other  suppliers to inform its recommendation to DSCA about possible industrial  base effects.", "As part of its efforts regarding proposed Humvee transfers, BIS notified  AM General and provided information on all the transfer requests  including the requesting country; number of vehicles requested; the  vehicle model; and the country\u2019s plans, if known, to repair or upgrade  EDA vehicles, including who the country intends to select for such work.  BIS officials told us that they request a response within 7 calendar days  on whether the manufacturer supports or objects to the proposed transfer.", "In instances where the Humvee manufacturer objected to a transfer, BIS  required that the manufacturer provide an explanation of its objection. In  documents we reviewed, the manufacturer objected for various reasons,  including that a transfer would: (1) directly interfere with ongoing  marketing or planned sales to the requesting country, or (2) adversely  affect its business and that of its suppliers.", "BIS\u2019s standard procedure is to request proof of ongoing sales efforts if a  company states that a proposed transfer will interfere with potential sales.  In the cases where the Humvee manufacturer cited ongoing or planned  business development with a requesting country, BIS required that the  manufacturer provide information of its ongoing efforts to sell its vehicles  to the requesting country, including: documentation of recent or planned meetings with foreign government  officials and a timeline of the meetings; export licenses; and business plans.", "If a manufacturer submits an objection, BIS will also check if they have  registered business activity with Commerce\u2019s Advocacy Center, which  provides assistance to defense companies pursuing contracts with  overseas governments and government agencies. If BIS concludes the  Humvee manufacturer has a basis for its objection due to ongoing  business with the requesting country, it will recommend that DSCA not  authorize the transfer. According to DSCA officials, this is largely because  it considers the possibility that the transfer could dissuade requesting  foreign governments from purchasing new or used vehicles. Thus,  providing vehicles through the EDA program at no cost or a discounted  price to a foreign government could siphon potential business from the  manufacturer or could compete with the manufacturer\u2019s sales efforts.  Under the Foreign Assistance Act, a transfer request cannot be fulfilled if  doing so will interfere with the manufacturer\u2019s ability to sell equipment to  the requesting country. During fiscal years 2012 through 2018, we found  only one instance where DSCA, based on BIS\u2019s recommendation, did not  support AM General\u2019s objection.

In total, the Humvee  manufacturer has challenged 11 transfer requests for over 4,000 vehicles  between fiscal years 2015 and 2018. The manufacturer told us that the  increasing number of proposed transfers is concerning because the  transfers amount to nearly 3 years\u2019 worth of new vehicles it could produce  to sustain its production lines.", "AM General representatives told us they will continue to object to the  transfer of older Humvee vehicles (M900 and M1000 models). For these  models, the representatives citied concerns that parts for these vehicles  are no longer in production, and thus the manufacturer cannot ensure  qualified parts are available for maintenance and repairs. They are also  concerned that older vehicles have the propensity to break down, which  could damage the Humvee brand internationally\u2014particularly, if  counterfeit parts are used. In our review of documents describing  requesting countries\u2019 use of vehicles, we found that older model vehicles  are, at times, accepted by foreign governments to use as spare parts to  maintain an existing fleet and to develop their workforce\u2019s capability to  repair vehicles. However, we found that since 2015, the majority of  vehicles to which the manufacturer objected were the newer M1100  models\u2014stemming largely from a single 2016 request for Afghanistan. To  support its objections to this transfer, AM General has stated that its own  international sales are an important source of revenue, particularly  because DOD has reduced its procurement of Humvees.", "AM General representatives explained that proposed transfers through  the EDA program can threaten their company\u2019s potential future sales to  foreign governments that may be less likely to purchase new Humvees if  DSCA approves transfers of used vehicles. According to the  manufacturer, each transfer is a potential one-for-one reduction of a  possible sale of a new vehicle to the requesting country, which can affect  its bottom line as well as the suppliers that provide parts and materials to  produce the Humvees. In our review of Army procurement data, we found  that many countries that requested excess Humvees have not purchased  them through the FMS program from fiscal years 2012 through 2018.  DSCA officials told us that most of the countries requesting Humvees  through the EDA program find it cost-prohibitive to purchase new Humvee  vehicles directly from the manufacturer. A new Humvee can cost between  $115,000 and $190,000 depending on the model and capabilities  included. As a result, these countries rely on EDA Humvees provided  through grants to sustain their military fleets.

If the  manufacturer did not object to a transfer, which was largely the case prior  to March 2015, BIS provided its recommendation to DSCA, on average,  within 21 days. However, our analysis showed that an objection to a  Humvee transfer on average added approximately 152 days to address  industry objections. DSCA officials acknowledged that the approval  process can be prolonged when the manufacturer objects to a proposed  transfer, potentially contributing to longer waiting periods for requesting  countries to receive the Humvees. In addition, the longer that vehicles  remain in storage, the more likely it is that they will require more repairs to  make them operational, resulting in increased costs to the requesting  foreign governments to refurbish them, according to a DSCA official.", "Manufacturer representatives also told us they want to be involved earlier  in the process to provide input on the potential effects of proposed  transfers. We found that, on average, DSCA notifies BIS about 4 months  after a country submits its Humvee request and BIS reaches out to the  manufacturer a day or two later. A DSCA official explained that it can be a  challenge to involve the manufacturer earlier because the request is not  fully stable and could be revised for a number of reasons, including  countries canceling the request or changing requirements to obtain  different capabilities, and DOD internal policy considerations need to be  vetted before reaching out to the manufacturer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Took Steps to Address Manufacturer\u2019s Concerns", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, DSCA and BIS have taken steps to address AM  General\u2019s increasing objections to proposed transfers.

According to BIS officials, this was  in response to the pattern of consistent objections that they were  receiving from the Humvee manufacturer. AM General acknowledged that  communication with DSCA and BIS about Humvee EDA transfers has  improved. For example, DSCA notified AM General about its decision to  sustain the company\u2019s objection and, thus, not move forward on a  transfer request made in July 2019 for 2,000 vehicles.

For example,  we found that the manufacturer received business opportunities from  EDA Humvee transfers to Afghanistan, Iraq, Jordan, and Thailand that  included, providing long-term sustainment and refurbishment of  Humvees, among other things. In response, the contractor withdrew over  a third of its objections between fiscal years 2012 and 2018 based on  receiving this type of work or reaching agreements with foreign  governments to provide fully operational Humvees. The remaining  transfers were cancelled; put on hold pending resolution with the Humvee  manufacturer; or in one case, moved forward with an objection in place.", "The agreements to provide additional support can be financially beneficial  to the manufacturer and help sustain its production capabilities. For  example, we found that in 2012, the Humvee manufacturer objected to a  country\u2019s transfer request of 250 vehicles, but withdrew their objection  after reaching an agreement with the foreign government to perform  much of the refurbishment work for those vehicles. In another case, we  found that for the 2016 proposed transfer of 2,461 vehicles to support the  Afghanistan National Security Force, the Humvee manufacturer objected,  citing concerns about the large number of vehicles requested, among  other concerns (see sidebar).  The proposed transfer of EDA Humvees  to Afghanistan was requested by DOD after a 2016 Senate report  expressed concerns about a lack of insight into the cost-benefit analysis  of procuring new equipment instead of refurbishing excess equipment.   In response to the proposed transfer, the manufacturer sent a letter to  BIS outlining their anticipated role in the Afghanistan transfer, including  obtaining Army contracts to add armor kits to  EDA vehicles, providing  new powered chassis, and if required, new Humvees.  The letter also  noted the Humvee manufacturer\u2019s withdrawal of its objection to the  transfer. DSCA subsequently notified the manufacturer that it did not  agree with the terms AM General outlined in the letter to BIS and  specified that the proposed transfer would create business opportunities  for U.S. industry, including AM General, to refurbish EDA Humvees.  DSCA also added that it would continue to ensure that industry is notified  of all proposed Humvee EDA transfer requests so that industry can  provide input or express concerns.", "According to DOD officials, the number of Humvees available for transfer  to Afghanistan was reduced as DOD decided to split the number of  available EDA Humvees in inventory at the time to meet requirements in  Afghanistan and Iraq. In total, 1,644 vehicles were identified for transfer to  Afghanistan. As part of this effort, according to information we received  from the Army, AM General, and the Office of the Undersecretary of  Defense for Policy, the Humvee manufacturer was awarded a contract to  provide armor kits for the 1,644 EDA Humvees being refurbished by the  Army\u2019s Red River Depot. The manufacturer also provided other vehicle  parts as part of the EDA transfer request for Afghanistan. According to  DOD officials, it currently does not have plans to transfer additional  vehicles to Afghanistan to fulfill the remaining EDA vehicles requested as  part of the 2016 transfer request and will reevaluate future Afghanistan  requirements, as needed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Departments of Commerce and  Defense for review and comment.

To provide information about DOD\u2019s approval of  transfers of excess Humvees, we analyzed data for fiscal years 2012  through 2018 (the most recent available fiscal year at the time of our  review) from the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command, Defense  Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), and the Defense Logistics Agency  (DLA). These data provided insight about the countries and geographic  regions that have requested excess defense article (EDA) Humvees as  well as the condition and types of vehicles delivered to foreign  governments. We also reviewed documentation provided by requesting  countries to identify the intended purpose of the request. We interviewed  agency officials responsible for the data to identify the quality controls in  place to help ensure the data are accurate and reliable.", "To assess the reliability of each data source, we compared the data in  each DOD component\u2019s data sets to ensure that the information was  complete and consistent. We did this by identifying common identifiers  used for the Humvee EDA transfers that occurred within the designated  7-year period. According to DSCA officials, the DSCA EDA database is a  consolidation of data provided annually by the military departments, and  DLA, and is manually entered into the database by DSCA officials.  Furthermore, we reviewed the data for issues such as missing data  elements and duplicates, among other steps.  Based on these steps  taken, we determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes  of reporting information about EDA Humvee transfer requests. See table  1 of DOD data sources used to track information on excess defense  articles.", "To provide information about how the Humvee manufacturer\u2019s  perspectives on the proposed transfers have been addressed by DOD as  part of the determination of any adverse industrial base effects, we  reviewed documents, data, and interviewed officials from DSCA and the  Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the Commerce Department,  that advises DSCA on industry effects of proposed EDA transfers. For  purposes of this report, unless otherwise indicated, transfers refers to  grants of EDA under the Foreign Assistance Act. We reviewed BIS  policies and procedures related to the EDA program to identify the factors  BIS considers in making adverse effect determinations. We also reviewed  data generated by BIS to identify the extent to which the Humvee  manufacturer objected to proposed transfers for the 7-year period  included in our review. We also reviewed data provided by the Army on  the number of Humvees procured for the Army\u2019s use and for vehicles sold  to foreign governments through the Foreign Military Sales program from  fiscal years 2012 through 2018. To gain insight about DSCA and BIS\u2019s  approach to assess industrial base effects of proposed transfers, we  selected two transfer requests as illustrative case studies: a 2016 transfer  for Afghanistan which was the single largest proposed transfer and a  2016 transfer for Albania as it was the only proposed transfer that BIS did  not sustain the manufacturer\u2019s objection. We also spoke with  representatives from AM General to obtain their perspectives on the EDA  program and gain insight about the effect of EDA transfers on their  business.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2019 to February  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
