In fiscal year 2005, CMS's total staff resources allocated to these activities was about 8.1 full-time equivalent (FTE) staffing units--approximately 3.6 FTEs at headquarters and 4.5 FTEs in the regional offices. Among CMS's 10 regional offices--each of which oversees states whose Medicaid outlays include billions of federal dollars--7 offices each have a fraction of an FTE and the rest each have less than 2 FTEs allocated to Medicaid fraud and abuse control efforts. Moreover, the placement of the Medicaid fraud and abuse control staff at headquarters--apart from the agency's office responsible for other antifraud and abuse activities--as well as a lack of specified goals for Medicaid fraud and abuse control raise questions about the agency's level of commitment to improve states' activities in this area. CMS's support and oversight initiatives include a pilot project for states to enhance claims scrutiny activities by coordinating with the Medicare program. Despite the project's positive results in several states, less than one-fifth of the states currently participate in the project and resource constraints may require CMS to scale back these efforts instead of expanding them to additional states that are seeking to participate. Similarly, CMS's support activities--such as conducting national conferences, regional workshops, and training--have been terminated altogether. The frequency of CMS's on-site reviews of states' fraud and abuse control activities--about seven to eight visits a year--has not changed since GAO reported on this last year. This means that federal oversight of a state's Medicaid program safeguards will not occur, at best, more than once every 7 years. Relatively few and questionably aligned resources and an absence of strategic planning underscore the limited commitment CMS has made to strengthening states' ability to curb fraud and abuse. Despite the millions of dollars CMS receives annually from a statutorily established fund for fraud and abuse control, the agency has not allocated these resources to sufficiently fund initiatives that can help states increase the effectiveness of their Medicaid fraud and abuse control efforts. Developing a strategic plan for Medicaid fraud and abuse control activities would give CMS a basis for providing resources that reflect the financial risk to the federal government. In discussing the facts in this statement with a CMS Medicaid official, he stated that the agency does not view antifraud and abuse initiatives as separate from financial oversight, an area that has received substantial resources in recent years. While we agree that financial management is important to program integrity, we believe that an increased commitment to helping states fight fraud and abuse is warranted."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today as you discuss fraud and abuse control in  Medicaid, a program that provides health care coverage for eligible low- income individuals and is jointly financed by the federal government and  the states. In fiscal year 2003, Medicaid covered nearly 54 million people,  and the program\u2019s benefit payments totaled $261 billion, of which the  federal share was about $153 billion. Because fraud and abuse by their  nature are unknown until detected, the amount of Medicaid funds lost  through health care providers\u2019 inappropriate billings cannot be precisely  quantified. Some states have made estimates of their respective programs\u2019  improper Medicaid payment rates that reflect not only fraudulent and  abusive billings but also inadvertent billing errors, such as clerical  mistakes. A nationwide improper payment rate for Medicaid has not been  made, but even a rate as low as 3 percent would mean a loss of almost $4.6  billion in federal funds in fiscal year 2003. To put this hypothetical figure  in perspective, it is roughly the amount that the federal government spent  in fiscal year 2003 on the State Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program  (SCHIP).", "Such a drain of vital program dollars is a detriment to both taxpayers and  beneficiaries. For example, paying for services billed but not provided  wastes funds that could have been used for health care. For example, in  2004, the owners of a Louisiana health care clinic were found guilty of  billing the program more than $400,000 for health care screening services,  nurse consultations, and nutrition consultations never provided.  Alternatively, paying for unnecessary services can have a substantial, if not  quantifiable, impact on health care quality. Consider the charge in 2004  against 20 dentists in California for conspiracy to defraud the state\u2019s  Medicaid program of $4.5 million. As part of the conspiracy, the dentists  billed Medicaid for unnecessary or inappropriate services that placed  patients at risk by reusing dental instruments without sterilizing them,  performing dental surgeries without adequate anesthesia, developing  treatment plans that called for unneeded root canals and fillings, and  forcibly restraining children during dental operations.", "States are primarily responsible for the fight against Medicaid fraud and  abuse. Specifically, they are responsible for ensuring the legitimacy of  providers billing the program, detecting improper payments, recovering  overpayments, and referring suspected cases of fraud and abuse to law  enforcement authorities. At the federal level, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS) in the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) is responsible for supporting and overseeing state fraud and abuse  control activities. Last year, we reported that CMS had initiatives to assist  states in combating fraud and abuse in their Medicaid programs, but its  oversight of states\u2019 activities in this area was limited. The dollar and staff  resources allocated to compliance reviews suggested that CMS\u2019s level of  effort was disproportionately small relative to the risk of serious financial  loss.", "Concerned about the stewardship of federal Medicaid funds, this  Committee has raised questions about CMS\u2019s commitment to Medicaid  fraud and abuse control. It is important to note that activities designed to  prevent, detect, and recover improper payments made to providers  resulting from fraud and abuse are a component of ensuring Medicaid  program integrity. These activities are valuable not only from a financial  standpoint but also have a sentinel effect on providers that may otherwise  consider billing the program inappropriately. Another component is  financial management activities, which involve the oversight of state  claims for federal reimbursement, including the matching, administrative,  and disproportionate share funds that CMS provides the states. While  these program integrity functions are related, they are not  interchangeable. My remarks today will focus on (1) the level of resources  CMS currently applies to helping states prevent and detect fraud and  abuse in the Medicaid program and (2) the implications of this level of  support for CMS fraud and abuse control activities.", "To do this work, we reviewed agency documents on Medicaid program  safeguard support and oversight activities as well as our issued reports on  this topic.

Within broad federal guidelines, each program  establishes its own eligibility standards; determines the type, amount,  duration, and scope of covered services; and sets payment rates. In  general, the federal government matches state Medicaid spending for  medical assistance according to a formula based on each state\u2019s per capita  income. In fiscal year 2004, the federal contribution ranged from 50 to 77  cents of every state dollar spent on medical assistance. For most state  Medicaid administrative costs, the federal match rate is 50 percent.", "As program administrators, states have primary responsibility for  conducting program integrity activities that address provider enrollment,  claims review, and case referrals. Specifically, federal statute or CMS  regulations require states to    collect and verify basic information on potential providers, including  whether the providers meet state licensure requirements and are not  prohibited from participating in federal health care programs;    have an automated claims payment and information retrieval system\u2014 intended to verify the accuracy of claims, the correct use of payment  codes, and patients\u2019 Medicaid eligibility\u2014and a claims review system\u2014 intended to develop statistical profiles on services, providers, and  beneficiaries to identify potential improper payments; and  refer suspected overpayments or overutilization cases to other units in the  Medicaid agency for corrective action and potential fraud cases, generally,  to the state\u2019s Medicaid Fraud Control Unit for investigation and  prosecution.  As noted in our 2004 report, states use a variety of controls and  safeguards to stem improper provider payments. For example, states  target high-risk providers seeking to bill Medicaid with on-site facility  inspections, criminal background checks, and probationary or time-limited  enrollment. States also reported using information technology to integrate  databases containing provider, beneficiary, and claims information and to  increase the effectiveness of their utilization reviews. Various states  individually attributed cost savings or recoupments to these efforts valued  in the millions of dollars.", "In contrast, CMS\u2019s role in curbing fraud and abuse in the Medicaid  program is largely one of support to the states. As we reported last year,  CMS administers two pilot projects\u2014one focused on measuring the  accuracy of a state\u2019s Medicaid claims payments (Payment Accuracy  Measurement (PAM)) and the other focused on improper billing detection  and utilization patterns by linking Medicare and Medicaid claims  information (Medi-Medi). CMS also sponsors general technical assistance  and information-sharing through its Medicaid fraud and abuse technical  assistance group (TAG). In addition, CMS performs oversight of states\u2019  Medicaid fraud and abuse control activities.

In fiscal year 2005, CMS\u2019s Medicaid staff  resources allocated to supporting or overseeing states\u2019 anti-fraud and  abuse operations was an estimated 8.1 FTEs\u20143.6 FTEs at headquarters  and 4.5 FTEs in the regional offices. Staff at headquarters are engaged in  arranging and conducting the on-site compliance reviews of states\u2019 fraud  and abuse control efforts and in information-sharing activities. Staff at the  regional offices also participate in the state compliance reviews and  respond to state inquiries. Canvassing the 10 regional CMS offices, we  found that 7 regions each have a fraction of an FTE and the rest each have  less than 2 FTEs devoted to providing assistance on fraud and abuse  issues. For example, Region IV\u2014which covers eight states and accounted  for $33 billion of federal funds for Medicaid benefits in fiscal year 2004\u2014 reported having 1 FTE devoted to Medicaid fraud and abuse control  activities. (See table 2.)", "For fiscal year 2006, CMS\u2019s budget has no line item devoted to Medicaid  fraud and abuse control activities. The project to estimate payment error  rates known as PAM/PERM (required by statute) and the Medi-Medi pilot  project (with benefits accruing to both programs) are financed through a  statutorily established fund\u2014the Health Care Fraud and Abuse Control  (HCFAC) account. (See table 3.) The HCFAC monies from which these  two projects are largely financed are known as \u201cwedge\u201d funds. As CMS\u2019s  distribution of these funds varies from year to year, the level of support for  fraud and abuse control initiatives is uncertain and depends on the  priorities set by the agency. For example, fiscal year 2005 funds allocated  from the HCFAC account for PAM/PERM and Medi-Medi were less than  half the funds allocated in fiscal year 2004. In contrast, Medicare fraud and  abuse control activities at CMS are financed primarily through earmarked  funds from another HCFAC component\u2014the Medicare Integrity Program.", "CMS\u2019s Medicaid compliance reviews are funded through a different  source\u2014HHS\u2019s budget appropriation.

Currently, two different headquarters offices are charged with  working with states on fraud and abuse issues. CMS\u2019s Office of Financial  Management staffs the PAM/PERM and Medi-Medi initiatives, while the  Center for Medicaid and State Operations (CMSO) staffs the state  compliance reviews and TAG functions. Under this organizational  structure, the Medicaid fraud and abuse staff in CMSO are not in an  optimal position to leverage the resources allocated to the office with  responsibility for developing tools and strategies for combating fraud and  abuse.", "As further evidence of the low priority assigned to Medicaid fraud and  abuse control, the planning, outreach, and building of staff expertise lacks  leadership continuity. From 1997 to 2003, the leadership and funding of  CMS\u2019s support for states\u2019 antifraud and abuse efforts resided in a  consortium of two regional offices. The consortium led a network of  regional fraud and abuse coordinators and state Medicaid representatives,  sponsoring telephone conferences and workshops, seminars, and training  sessions aimed at sharing best practices for fighting fraud and abuse.  Medicaid staff based at headquarters reported to a national network  coordinator located at one of the consortium\u2019s regional offices. With the  retirement of the national coordinator in 2003, the consortium  relinquished its leadership and funding role and the Medicaid antifraud  and abuse activities were reassigned to CMSO without additional  resources. Since then, no nationwide meetings with state program  integrity officials have been held.", "At the same time, CMS lacks a strategic plan to drive its Medicaid  antifraud and abuse operations. Goals for the long term, as well as plans  on how to achieve them, have not been specified in any public department  or agency planning documents. For example, HHS\u2019s fiscal year 2004  performance and accountability report cited Medicaid\u2019s high risk of  payment errors as the department\u2019s management challenge for fighting  Medicaid fraud and abuse. To address this challenge, the report cited the  PAM/PERM initiative for estimating payment error rates, as this activity is  required in federal statute. But there was no mention of any other fraud  and abuse support or oversight activities or goals. Similarly, the discussion  of Medicaid program integrity in the Administration\u2019s Budget for Fiscal  Year 2006 covers activities to curb states\u2019 inappropriate financing  mechanisms but makes no mention of federal support or oversight of  states\u2019 fraud and abuse efforts.

CMS\u2019s distribution of resources may require some activities to be scaled  back and others to be eliminated.", "Specifically, the expansion of the Medi-Medi data match project has been  slow, leaving potentially millions of dollars in cost avoidance and cost  savings unrealized. This project enables claims data analysts to detect  patterns that may not be evident when providers\u2019 billings for either  Medicare or Medicaid are viewed in isolation. For example, by combining  data from each program, analysts can identify \u201ctime bandits,\u201d or providers  who bill for more than 24 hours in a single day. As of March 31, 2005,  seven states with fully operational projects reported returns to the  Medicaid and Medicare programs of $133.1 million in provider payments  under investigation, $59.7 million in program vulnerabilities identified, and  $2.0 million in overpayments to be recovered. In addition, 240  investigations had been initiated and 28 cases referred to law enforcement  agencies. Two additional states, Ohio and Washington, have begun Medi- Medi projects that are expected to be operational later this year.", "Because of anticipated unmet funding needs, existing Medi-Medi data  match activities are in jeopardy of being scaled back considerably. As CMS  stated in its fiscal year 2005 second quarter report on Medi-Medi projects,  \u201cEliminating certain Medi-Medi projects in their entirety and/or  dramatically reducing the level of effort across all of the projects are  among the approaches under consideration. Beyond FY 2006, the entire  project will terminate if additional funding is not identified.\u201d Agency  officials noted that several additional states have expressed interest in  participating but expanding the program to more states will not occur  without a new allocation or realignment of resources. Plans for additional  activities that involve coordination with Medicare have been put on hold,  pending budget decisions. These include enhanced oversight of  prescription drug fraud when Medicare begins covering Medicaid  beneficiaries\u2019 drug benefits in 2006 and the use of a unified provider  enrollment form instead of separate forms for Medicare and Medicaid.", "Similarly, CMS\u2019s role as provider of technical assistance and disseminator  of states\u2019 best practices has been severely limited because of competing  priorities. At a health care fraud and abuse conference sponsored by HHS  and the Department of Justice in 2000, participants from states and CMS  regional offices articulated their common unmet needs with regard to  fraud and abuse technology. The top three areas cited were information- sharing and access to data; training in data analysis and use of technology;  and staffing, hardware, and software resources. CMS has not sponsored a  national conference with state program integrity officials since 2003 and  has not sponsored any fraud and abuse workshops or training since 2000.  According to a CMS official, such information-sharing and technical  assistance activities would not be expensive to support\u2014less than  $100,000 annually\u2014and could result in returns that would exceed this  relatively low amount.", "Resource shortages also account for CMS\u2019s limited oversight of states\u2019  Medicaid prevention, detection, and referral activities for improper  payments. Since January 2000, CMS\u2019s Medicaid staff from headquarters  and regional offices have been conducting compliance reviews of about  seven to eight states a year. The reviews are aimed at ensuring that states  have processes and procedures in place, in compliance with federal  requirements for enrolling providers, reviewing claims, and referring  cases. These compliance reviews have been effective at identifying  weaknesses in states\u2019 efforts to combat fraud and abuse. For example, in  the course of these reviews, CMS has found instances in which    a state had no process in place to prevent payments to excluded providers,    states did not use their authority to evaluate providers\u2019 professional or  criminal histories as part of the provider enrollment process, and    a state did not follow appropriate procedures for referring a case to state  law enforcement authorities.", "States have reported making positive modifications in their programs as a  result of the CMS compliance reviews. Nevertheless, at the currently  scheduled pace, states\u2019 programs will be reviewed once in 7 years at the  earliest. Because the compliance reviews are infrequent, CMS\u2019s knowledge  of states\u2019 fraud and abuse activities is, for many states, substantially out- of-date at any given time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Relatively few and questionably aligned resources and an absence of  strategic planning underscore the limited commitment CMS has made to  strengthening states\u2019 ability to curb fraud and abuse.
