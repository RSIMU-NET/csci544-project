Patent licensing is a technology transfer activity that allows, for example, federal inventions to be legally transferred to the private sector for commercial use. Specifically, officials at the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Energy (DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as external stakeholders, noted challenges in having researchers identify potentially patentable inventions. DOD, DOE, and NIH officials also cited having inadequate internal systems to keep track of inventions developed in the labs. In addition, several stakeholders stated that licensing patented inventions can be lengthy and bureaucratic, which may deter companies from licensing. The agencies reported taking steps to address these challenges, such as implementing model license agreements across labs to expedite the process.", "The Department of Commerce has delegated to its National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to annually report agencies' technology transfer activities, including patent licensing. Although NIST has reported some challenges, it has not fully reported the range of challenges identified by agency and lab officials and stakeholders. NIST officials stated that they were generally aware of the challenges but had not considered including them to a greater degree in their annual reports to Congress. By fully reporting the range of challenges in federal patent licensing, NIST has the opportunity to further ensure that Congress is more aware of challenges that limit agencies' efforts and ways for potentially addressing those challenges.", "Federal agencies and labs have limited information to guide officials when establishing the financial terms of patent licenses. For example, while federal labs can use comparable licenses to help establish financial terms, their access to information on comparable licenses from other labs varies, and such information is not formally shared among the agencies. Based on its established interagency role, NIST is best positioned to assist agencies in sharing information on comparable licenses, in accordance with leading practices for interagency collaboration. By doing so, NIST would provide federal agencies and labs with useful information that can help them better establish financial terms and successfully license inventions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations, including that Commerce instruct NIST to fully report the range of challenges in federal patent licensing in its annual reports to Congress and facilitate information sharing among agencies.

The intellectual property generated  by this research\u2014including inventions\u2014has application beyond federal  agencies\u2019 immediate, mission-related goals if the private sector can bring  the inventions to market. For example, government research has led to  new products and processes for the commercial marketplace, including  antibiotics, plastics, airplanes, computers, microwaves, and  bioengineered drugs. However, a 2013 Office of Science and Technology  Policy report raised concerns that only a small portion of the inventions  arising from government research have been commercialized by the  private sector, and that the United States is potentially missing critical  opportunities to improve the nation\u2019s standard of living, create new jobs,  maintain international competitiveness, and enhance the overall  economy, among other things.", "Technology transfer is the process of transferring scientific findings from  one organization to another for the purpose of further development and  commercialization. A series of federal laws and executive orders  spanning nearly 40 years have directed federal agencies to enhance their  labs\u2019 beneficial impact on society through technology transfer. For  example, the Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980  (Stevenson-Wydler Act) states that its purpose is to improve the  economic, environmental, and social well-being of the United States by,  among other things, stimulating improved utilization of federally funded  technology developments by nonfederal entities. Accordingly, the act  provides that the federal government, where appropriate, shall transfer  federally owned or originated technology to state and local governments  and to the private sector.", "From fiscal years 2015 to 2017, four federal agencies consistently had  the highest annual federal R&D spending: the Department of Defense  (DOD), the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Aeronautics and  Space Administration (NASA), and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)  within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Together,  these four agencies accounted for nearly 90 percent of total federal R&D  spending on average, as shown in figure 1.", "One way federal agencies transfer technology is by licensing patents on  inventions generated by R&D at federal labs. This licensing aims to put  federal inventions in the hands of those equipped to further develop the  inventions into marketable products accessible to the public or to find  other practical applications for them. Examples of inventions developed  at DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH labs can be found in appendix I.  Numerous statutory and regulatory requirements have been established  to help ensure that agencies commercialize inventions arising from R&D  at federal labs. The Department of Commerce (Commerce) is responsible  for government-wide functions related to patenting, including granting  patents through the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO).  Commerce is also responsible for functions related to licensing of  federally owned inventions, including reporting federal agencies\u2019  technology transfer activities to Congress and issuing regulations, both of  which it delegated to the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST).", "Over the years, we and others have reported on a range of challenges  that agencies face in commercializing inventions arising from R&D at  federal labs. You asked us to review agency practices for managing  intellectual property developed at federal labs, with a particular focus on  the licensing of patented inventions (patent licensing) to nonfederal  parties that might use the patented inventions to manufacture products.  This report examines, for DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH and their labs, (1)  challenges that federal labs face in patent licensing, steps taken to  address those challenges, and the extent to which NIST has reported  them and (2) the extent to which federal agencies and labs have  information on processes, goals, and comparable licenses to guide  establishing patent license financial terms.", "For both objectives, we reviewed statutes and regulations applicable to  patent licensing to describe the legal framework governing federal patent  licensing and license financial terms. To obtain views on patent licensing  practices across the federal government, we conducted 60  semistructured interviews, including 38 with agency and lab officials. We  interviewed officials from DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH, as well as from  nine federal labs across these agencies. We interviewed officials at  multiple labs at each agency and selected them to obtain a variety of  perspectives on patent licensing, including variation in whether they were  contractor-operated (two labs) or government-operated labs (seven labs);  the volume and type of licensing activity; and other agency-specific  considerations, such as whether they use a service center model.", "In addition, we conducted 22 interviews with external stakeholders\u2014 including academic researchers (4), partnership intermediaries (11) (i.e.,  organizations that assist federal labs and businesses in licensing federal  patents), industry representatives and companies (3), and professional  trade organizations and universities (4)\u2014that were knowledgeable about  federal patent licensing practices. Partnership intermediaries were  selected based on lists of partnership intermediaries associated with the  selected labs and agencies that the agencies submitted and referrals  from other partnership intermediaries. To select other stakeholders, we  used snowball sampling based on referrals obtained from prior  engagements, our review of academic literature, and referrals from  stakeholder interviews during the engagement. We also interviewed  officials from NIST and USPTO. The information we obtained from these  interviews is not generalizable to all agency and lab officials and external  stakeholders, but we determined that our selection of interviewees was  appropriate to obtain varied perspectives on the patent licensing process  and related challenges and that the selection would generate valid and  reliable evidence to support our work.", "To understand the level of patent licensing activity and the terms in patent  licenses at federal labs, we requested data from each agency on licenses  that were active as of the end of fiscal year 2014. To assess the  reliability of the data on active patent license agreements, we asked  agency and lab officials questions about the accuracy and completeness  of the data and asked them to confirm specific information. Based on  these steps, we found the data to be sufficiently reliable for understanding  the overall level of licensing activity in the labs, for identifying licenses  that became effective in fiscal year 2014, and as a source of information  for those licenses. We also requested from each agency and reviewed  the subset of licenses that became effective in fiscal year 2014.", "To address the first objective, we first conducted a literature search. We  broadened our search beyond articles published in peer-reviewed  journals to identify studies, such as dissertations, conference  proceedings, and organizational studies issued by research institutes or  studies issued by government agencies. For example, we conducted  both subject and keyword searches related to patent licensing in various  databases. We performed these searches and identified 23 studies from  2000 to 2016\u20142016 was the year for which the most recent information  was available at the time of our review.", "We reviewed relevant agency documentation and interviewed the agency  and lab officials and external stakeholders identified above to obtain their  perspectives on areas of the patent licensing process identified from our  review of relevant federal statutes and regulations. Using information  obtained from the interviews, we conducted a content analysis of  responses. Challenges in each area were identified from the content  analysis based on the frequency and consistency of responses from  agency and lab officials and stakeholders. We also examined other  relevant agency documentation, including NIST\u2019s fiscal year summary  reports to Congress from fiscal years 2013 through 2015\u2014the most  recent reports available\u2014to determine the extent to which challenges in  federal patent licensing had been reported.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed relevant economic  literature on establishing the financial terms of patent licenses and other  related licensing terms. From the literature, we identified economic  principles that apply to structuring financial terms to promote the  commercial use of inventions. We reviewed all relevant documentation  describing licensing practices at the agency and lab levels that DOD,  DOE, NASA, and NIH provided. This included documentation describing,  among other things, processes and goals for establishing license terms,  including financial terms. We reviewed each document to identify (1)  factors considered in establishing financial terms; (2) data sources used  in the process; (3) methods, such as calculations or guidelines, for setting  financial terms; (4) guidance on when or how to use various types of financial terms; and (5) goals applicable to financial terms. We also  reviewed narratives and written responses describing lab practices for  establishing financial terms in patent licenses that the agencies and labs  provided in response to our requests. To identify patents at the labs under  the four agencies we reviewed and the extent to which they patent in  similar technology fields, we searched the assignee field in USPTO\u2019s  PatentsView database for patents issued since 2000 using search terms  associated with the four agencies and their contractor labs, if applicable.  The list of assignees for the patents from the initial search was reviewed  to eliminate patents that may not have been assigned to the four  agencies. In total, the search yielded 20,612 patents assigned to the four  agencies. To examine similarities across technology areas, we used  PatentsView data on technology sectors and fields classified according to  the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) international  classification system for patents.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2016 to June 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

By the late 1970s, there was  increasing debate in Congress over ways to allow the private and public  sectors better access to federally owned inventions by, among other  things, creating a uniform policy for those seeking to license inventions  developed in federal labs. In the 1980s, Congress began passing a series  of key laws that have provided the foundation for federal technology  transfer activities, including patenting and licensing inventions that are  developed in federal labs and funded by federal dollars. One of the first  technology transfer laws, the Stevenson-Wydler Act, established  technology transfer as a federal policy and required federal labs to set up  Offices of Research and Technology Applications (which, for our  purposes, we refer to as technology transfer offices) and devote budget  and personnel resources to promoting the transfer of federal technologies  to the private sector. In 1980, another key law, the Bayh-Dole Act  allowed not-for-profit corporations, including universities, and small  businesses to retain title to their federally funded inventions. In 1984,  through amendments made to the Bayh-Dole Act, Commerce became  responsible for issuing regulations to implement the act.", "The Stevenson-Wydler Act was amended by the Federal Technology  Transfer Act of 1986, which (1) established the Federal Laboratory  Consortium (FLC); (2) required that technology transfer efforts be  considered positively in employee performance evaluations; and (3)  empowered federal agencies to permit the directors of government- owned, government-operated labs to enter into cooperative research and  development agreements (CRADA) and to negotiate license agreements  for inventions created in the labs. The FLC began largely as a forum for  the education, training, and networking of federal technology transfer  officials to promote the integration of technical knowledge that federal  departments and agencies developed into the U.S. economy. Over time,  the FLC\u2019s role would include serving as a clearinghouse\u2014a central point  for collecting and disseminating information\u2014for federal technologies and  assisting outside entities in identifying available federal technology. Within  Commerce, NIST is the designated host and financial administrator of the  FLC.", "Additional laws were adopted to help further the development of federally  owned inventions for commercial use. Among them was the National  Competitiveness Technology Transfer Act of 1989, which directed federal  agencies to propose, for inclusion in contracts, provisions to establish  technology transfer as a mission of government-owned, contractor- operated labs and permitted those labs, under certain circumstances, to  enter into CRADAs. In addition, the Technology Transfer  Commercialization Act of 2000 required Commerce to provide Congress  with summary reports on agencies\u2019 patent licensing and other technology  transfer activities. Since 2007, Commerce has delegated to NIST the  role of providing to Congress an annual report summarizing technology  transfer at federal agencies. NIST\u2019s role as the lead in an interagency  collaborative effort in federal technology transfer grew further when  Commerce delegated to the agency the additional responsibility of  coordinating the Interagency Working Group for Technology Transfer.  Commerce also has delegated to NIST its authority to promulgate  implementing regulations pertaining to patenting and licensing at federal  labs.

Contractor-operated labs, on the other hand, operate facilities  and equipment that are owned by the federal government, but the staff is  employed by a private or nonprofit contractor that operates the lab under  a contract with the federal government. Contractor-operated labs  typically license their technologies under the authority of the Bayh-Dole  Act, applicable regulations, and their contracts, which generally give  contractor-operated labs more flexibility in licensing their technologies.

Negotiations are often an  iterative process in which both the lab and the licensee request  adjustments to the terms of the license. Laws and regulations specify  some terms that government-operated labs must include in their licenses.  Among others, a typical license includes terms related to (1) financial  compensation (if applicable), (2) the degree of exclusivity of the license,  (3) the U.S. manufacturing requirement, (4) retained rights for the  government, (5) termination of the license, and (6) enforcement of  licenses.", "Financial terms may include up-front fees; minimum payments; royalties,  usually based on sales; and milestone payments, among others. Federal  labs typically establish financial terms on a case-by-case basis that are  tailored to the specifics of the technology, licensee, and market  conditions.

After this period, comments and  objections are considered. Negotiations then begin with the proposed  licensee or, if the licensee has changed, another public announcement of  the new licensee may be required. Government-operated labs are  required to obtain a commercialization plan from a potential licensee  regardless of the degree of exclusivity. Contractor-operated labs, which  typically retain title to their inventions under the authority of the Bayh-Dole  Act, are not subject to the requirement to obtain a commercialization plan  from a prospective licensee before granting a license; however, they are  subject to requirements specified in their contracts regarding patent  licensing.

There is a general preference for products that  incorporate federal inventions to be manufactured substantially in the  United States; however, on a case-by-case basis, agencies may waive  this requirement. Applicable law also reserves certain rights for the  government to protect the public\u2019s interests in federally funded inventions.  For example, the government retains a royalty-free license to use  inventions that are contractor owned or that are licensed exclusively. In  addition, the Bayh-Dole Act provides the government march-in authority  when certain statutory conditions have been met. Under this authority, an  agency may grant a license to an invention developed with federal  funding even if the invention is exclusively licensed to another party if, for  example, it determines that such action is needed to alleviate public  health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the  contractor, assignee, or their licensee.

Officials at one  NASA lab noted that they have come across a few contractor employees  who do not see the benefit of filing invention disclosures, and sometimes  researchers are too busy to engage in the patenting process. According  to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) officials, some  researchers decide not to disclose an invention because they believe  filing a patent application, which includes a filing fee, could take away  money from the research itself, and most federal researchers are not  motivated by the potential for receiving royalty distributions.", "Our analysis of relevant literature and interviews with stakeholders also  showed that researchers not identifying and disclosing inventions is a  government-wide challenge.

While DOD  officials stated that the agency has been unsuccessful in purchasing  software to track inventions across the agency, Air Force officials said  they are developing a pilot program and seeking new software to manage  the Air Force\u2019s inventions, and they expect the pilot program to increase  the number of invention disclosures. Air Force and NIH officials stated  that they have contacted NASA, which has a centralized system for  tracking inventions, about leveraging the agency\u2019s expertise. NASA  officials reported that they have been hosting regular webinars with other  agencies to determine whether NASA\u2019s tracking system could help meet  other agencies\u2019 needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selecting Inventions to Patent", "paragraphs": ["DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH agency and lab officials cited selecting  inventions to patent as a challenge because of the expense of patenting  fees. According to some agency and lab officials we interviewed, fees  paid to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) affect  their decision on whether to patent an invention. For example, DOE  officials stated that budget constraints force them to make decisions  about whether they should file a patent or engage in other agency  activities. NIH officials stated that the agency maintains fewer patents  because of the patent maintenance fees and the agency\u2019s tight budgets.", "NASA officials reported that one step the agency is taking to deal with the  costs of maintaining its issued patents is to identify technologies with low  licensing potential and allow the patents to expire if they fail to attract  licensees. NASA has created a searchable database that catalogs  thousands of expired NASA patents already in the public domain, making  them freely available to industry for unrestricted commercial use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Attracting Potential Licensees", "paragraphs": ["Federal labs under DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH face challenges that limit  their ability to attract potential licensees, according to agency and lab  officials. Even officials at NASA, described by NIST officials as one of the  best agencies in promoting its inventions to industry, said the agency is  not selecting among multiple licensees and would like to have more  companies license its patents.", "There are various reasons why federal labs struggle to attract companies  interested in licensing their inventions, according to agency and lab  officials we interviewed. First, several agency and lab officials cited that  the number of entities that want to license inventions is generally not  large. Second, some agency and lab officials identified inadequate  promotion of federal inventions and licensing opportunities to companies,  including start-ups, as a factor. Third, some agency and lab officials also  noted that their inventions are often in the early stages of development  and thus pose more of a risk for companies to license.", "Based on our analysis of relevant literature and interviews with  stakeholders, difficulty in attracting industry to license inventions  developed in federal labs is a government-wide challenge. According to  several stakeholders, industry perceives federal labs as not friendly to the  private sector when it comes to patent licensing, especially for start-ups.  For example, one stakeholder said that it is rare that federal agencies  want to license to a start-up, and that more often the labs want a \u201csafer  route\u201d by licensing inventions to large companies that already have a  steady revenue stream. Another stakeholder said that DOE\u2019s contractor- operated labs in particular tend to not issue exclusive licenses to start-ups  and prefer to license to large companies because the agency sees those  companies as presenting less of a risk. In addition, stakeholders stated  that federal inventions are often not yet commercially viable, which can  deter companies from licensing federal inventions. One stakeholder, for  example, stated that NASA officials may think that NASA technology is  more developed than it is and therefore underestimate how long it will  take a company to develop it for practical application, the millions of  dollars needed to develop it, and whether it can be manufactured for  commercial use.", "DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH officials stated that they are taking steps to  attract potential licensees by, for example, conducting local outreach to  attract companies and working on improving their databases so that  companies can learn about federal inventions available for licensing. For  instance, NASA officials stated that the agency\u2019s comprehensive  database accessible to potential licensees uses a wide variety of search  criteria and attracted 6 million unique visitors in 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Negotiating the License Agreement", "paragraphs": ["Agency and lab officials and stakeholders noted that federal labs face  challenges in negotiating the license agreement because the process is  (1) lengthy and (2) uniquely regulated, which can deter companies from  licensing federal inventions.", "Stakeholders stated that the federal licensing process can take anywhere  from about 3 months to more than 2 years. Some stakeholders stated that  from their point of view taking a year to negotiate a license agreement is  too long. One stakeholder said that such lengthy processes are  particularly difficult for start-ups, which often need to finalize license  agreements in 3 months. Another stakeholder noted that the federal  government in general does not understand how urgent it is for  companies to complete the licensing process in a timely manner.  Although actions on the part of both the labs and companies can cause  delays, if the overall process is time-consuming, prospective licensees  will tend to move onto something else instead, according to agency and  lab officials and stakeholders.", "Based on our analysis of licensing information provided by the agencies,  we found that the amount of time from receipt of an application for a  license to signature of the license by the lab varies widely. Specifically,  based on this measure of the length of the process, approximately 60  percent of 132 licenses effective in fiscal year 2014 took at most 6  months for DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH labs to process. Officials at one  Navy lab stated that issuing an invention license to a company within 6  months is \u201chighly unusual,\u201d and officials at one NASA lab stated that the  fastest they have issued a license was a week because the start-up was  prepared and ready to go. For more on our analysis of licensing  information from DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH, see appendix III.", "Several agency and lab officials also noted that federal regulations  associated with patent licensing can deter companies from licensing  federal inventions. Such regulations include requirements that are unique  to federally funded and federally owned inventions, including that  products arising from the invention must be substantially manufactured in  the United States and that the government may retain rights to the  invention and terminate the license agreement if the licensee does not  take steps to commercialize the technology. In particular, NASA officials  stated that venture capital firms sometimes oppose the government  retaining rights for federal technology used by start-ups that they fund.  According to DOD and DOE officials, federal regulations require a level of  documentation or explanation that can deter some companies from  licensing inventions developed in federal labs. Based on interviews with  stakeholders, as well as our analysis of relevant literature, company  concerns about federal regulations is a government-wide challenge that  federal labs face in licensing their inventions.", "For example, according to NIST officials, the U.S. manufacturing  requirement can influence whether companies consider licensing federal  inventions, because manufacturing in the United States can be more  expensive than manufacturing in other countries. NIST officials also  stated that some prospective licensees initially become concerned when  they are told about march-in authority, because it applies to federally  funded inventions and contractors. However, once companies are told  that it is a legal requirement and that the provision has never been  exercised, they generally become more comfortable with it.", "DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH agency officials said they are taking steps to  address companies\u2019 concerns about the time it takes to negotiate a  license agreement and their unfamiliarity with federal licensing  requirements. For instance, NASA, NIH, and Navy officials told us they  have developed model license agreements to help guide companies  through the process, and NASA and NIH have special license  agreements for start-ups to shorten the licensing process. Also, DOE  created an agency-wide licensing guide to help prospective licensees  navigate federal licensing requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Monitoring Licensee Performance", "paragraphs": ["DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH agency and lab officials we interviewed  identified limited resources and inadequate monitoring systems as factors  that make it difficult to monitor licensee performance.", "NASA and NIH officials reported that the number of license agreements  has increased in their labs and that they do not have enough resources to  monitor licenses. DOD officials stated that the agency\u2019s technology  transfer offices have traditionally been understaffed and that the agency\u2019s  monitoring systems are inadequate for tracking the status of issued  licenses. Officials at one DOE lab stated that collecting royalties from  licensees can be difficult because the lab does not have enough funds to  support that activity. In addition, agencies may rely on the same systems  they use to keep track of inventions to monitor licensee performance, and  as previously discussed, these systems are in need of improvement.", "Some stakeholders we interviewed noted that monitoring licensee  performance is a government-wide challenge. They explained that  sometimes licensees do not pay fees if they are not contacted, and a few  stakeholders stated that federal labs have limited funding and resources  to monitor contracts effectively. One stakeholder recalled one agency that  did not communicate with a licensee for 2 years after the license  agreement was signed. According to another stakeholder, ineffective  monitoring of licensee performance may limit federal labs\u2019 ability to  determine whether a company is developing federal inventions for  commercial use per the terms and conditions of the license agreement.", "Some agency and lab officials stated that they have taken steps to  regularly monitor licensees. In particular, at NASA and NIH\u2014where  monitoring of licensee performance is centralized at the agency level\u2014 officials have programed systems to remind staff to check on licensee  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measuring Licensing Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Federal labs, including those under DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH, also  face challenges in effectively measuring patent licensing outcomes,  based on our interviews with stakeholders and analysis of relevant  literature. According to one stakeholder, labs need metrics to assess  whether a licensee has made progress on developing the invention for  commercial use and whether the lab needs to get the license back and  give it to another company.", "However, some stakeholders we interviewed stated that although the  2011 presidential memorandum on technology transfer called for  strategies to establish metrics, federal labs are still struggling to  implement metrics for measuring technology transfer outcomes, including  patent licensing activities. Stakeholders we interviewed and our analysis  of relevant literature have indicated that federal labs in general track the  numbers of patents, licenses, and revenues instead of using metrics that  identify direct economic impacts from patent licensing and other  technology transfer activities. In agencies where such metrics do exist,  they may be applied inconsistently across labs. For example, officials at  one DOE lab stated that DOE metrics are generally not consistent across  the agency\u2019s labs.", "DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH agency officials stated that they are working  to improve their metrics and incorporate metrics beyond tracking numbers  of patents, licenses, and revenues. For example, in addition to measuring  the numbers of patents and licenses issued, NASA and Air Force officials  stated that they are also measuring factors that affect the length of time it  takes for their labs to process licenses. Such information, officials said,  will help them expedite the licensing process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Prioritizing Patent Licensing as an Agency Mission", "paragraphs": ["DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH face challenges in prioritizing patent  licensing as part of their agency missions, which can affect the entire  patent licensing process.", "For example, DOD and DOE agency and lab officials stated that an  agency\u2019s mission affects patent licensing activities. DOD officials stated  that the agency\u2019s primary mission is protecting the warfighter and that  patent licensing is a secondary benefit to the agency. According to DOE  officials, the nuclear security labs do not focus on patenting but instead  on developing technologies associated with a weapons program.", "In addition, several stakeholders we interviewed stated that some  agencies and labs do not have a culture that prioritizes patent licensing.  In particular, one stakeholder stated that at some federal labs, patent  licensing is not reflected in performance evaluation management plans,  which can help incentivize lab personnel to engage in patent licensing  activities. A few stakeholders stated that at some labs where  management does not prioritize patent licensing activities, researchers\u2019  careers can be negatively affected if they engage in patent licensing  activities.", "DOD, DOE, NASA, and NIH agency and lab officials cited limited  resources to conduct the range of activities related to patent licensing.  For example, sometimes there is just one person at a DOD lab  overseeing technology transfer activities, according to DOD agency and  lab officials. Officials at one NIH lab stated that many labs across the  agency do not receive enough royalties to offset their patent licensing  costs. In its fiscal year 2015 report\u2014its most recent report\u2014to Congress  on federal technology transfer activities, NIST reported that the federal  intramural research budget, which include patent licensing activities, has  generally not increased in the past 4 fiscal years. Several agency and  lab officials stated that budget constraints affect the extent to which they  can engage in patent licensing activities\u2014including patent enforcement,  which can cost millions of dollars and presents challenges for federal  labs, according to DOE officials.", "Some agency and lab officials stated they have taken steps to overcome  such challenges. For example, officials at one Navy lab stated that the lab  has management support and nine patent attorneys to assist in the  reviews of researchers\u2019 invention disclosures.
