For instance, State tracks information on overseas residences in its property database, establishes threat levels at overseas posts, develops security standards for different types of residences and threat levels, and requires posts to periodically conduct residential security surveys. However, 17 of the 68 surveys for residences GAO reviewed were untimely or missing. Without up-to-date security surveys of all its overseas residences, State's ability to identify and address vulnerabilities or make informed decisions about where to allocate resources for security upgrades is limited.", "State has taken steps to update its residential security standards; however, these updates have not been timely, and the standards are difficult to use. According to State officials, updating residential security standards should take about 75 days, but all three updates since 2005 took more than 3 years each. State is making efforts to improve the timeliness of such updates in response to a prior GAO recommendation. In addition, while federal internal control standards state that policy standards should be clear and consistent to support good decision making, State's standards and other security-related guidance for residences have gaps and inconsistencies, complicating posts' efforts to determine and apply the appropriate security measures and potentially leaving some residences at risk.", "State addresses security vulnerabilities at residences by installing various upgrades intended to help residences meet security standards, but 38 of the 68 residences GAO reviewed did not meet all applicable standards. For example, 8 residences did not meet the standards for perimeter barriers. When residences do not and cannot meet all applicable security standards, posts are required to request exceptions, which identify steps the posts will take to mitigate vulnerabilities. However, State had an exception on file for only 1 of the 38 residences that did not meet all applicable standards. As a result, State lacks key information that could provide it with a clearer picture of security vulnerabilities at residences and enable it to make better risk management decisions.", "State manages risks to schools and other soft targets overseas in several ways, but its efforts may be constrained by limited awareness of relevant guidance and tools. In fiscal years 2010 through 2015, State awarded almost 400 grants in total for security upgrades at schools and other soft targets. While federal internal control standards call for timely communication of relevant information to staff responsible for program objectives, officials at most of the posts GAO visited were unaware of some guidance and tools for securing schools and other soft targets. As a result, State may not be fully leveraging existing programs and resources for addressing security needs at these facilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that State, among other things, institute procedures to ensure residential security surveys are completed as required, clarify its standards and security-related guidance for residences, develop procedures to ensure residences either meet standards or have exceptions on file, and take steps to ensure posts are aware of existing guidance and tools regarding the security of schools and other soft targets.

Our judgmental  sample of 10 posts included nine countries in four of State\u2019s six  geographic regions\u2014Africa, the Near East, South and Central Asia, and  the Western Hemisphere. In addition to ensuring geographic coverage,  we selected posts that had relatively high threat and risk ratings as  established by DS. At the 7 posts we visited, we evaluated a judgmental  selection of 68 residences against applicable security standards. To do  so, we created checklists of all the OSPB residential security standards  and then reviewed each residence against the standards applicable to it.  We also reviewed security measures in place at 10 schools attended by  U.S. government dependents and 3 off-compound employee association  facilities and met with State\u2019s regional security officers (RSO) and other  officials involved in efforts to secure residences and other soft targets.

As we  reported in 2005, State considers soft targets to be places where  Americans and other westerners live, congregate, shop, or visit. In  addition to residences and schools, soft targets can include hotels, clubs,  restaurants, shopping centers, places of worship, and public recreation  events. Travel routes of U.S. government employees are also considered  soft targets, based on their vulnerability to terrorist attacks. For the  purposes of this report, we focus primarily on U.S. diplomatic residences;  we also focus on schools attended by U.S. government dependents and  off-compound employee association facilities since such schools and  facilities are eligible for State-funded security upgrades.", "As of the end of fiscal year 2014, the U.S. government leased or owned  more than 15,000 residences worldwide, according to State. About  13,000 were residences leased by the U.S. government and located off  embassy or consulate compounds, while slightly more than 2,000 were  government-owned, most of which were also located off embassy or  consulate compounds. With respect to schools, State estimates that  there are nearly 250,000 school-age American children overseas, of  which approximately 8,000 are U.S. government dependents. State  provides assistance to almost 200 \u201cAmerican-sponsored\u201d schools  worldwide to help provide quality education for children of U.S.  government employees. U.S. government dependents may also attend  any other schools preferred by their parents. In addition, State has  chartered about 130 employee associations at posts overseas. These  associations maintain a variety of facilities, including, among others, retail  stores, cafeterias, recreational facilities, and quarters for officials on  temporary duty.

The threat levels are as follows:  critical: grave impact on U.S. diplomats; high: serious impact on U.S. diplomats; medium: moderate impact on U.S. diplomats; and low: minor impact on U.S. diplomats.", "Threat levels for each post are assessed and updated annually in the  Security Environment Threat List. According to DS officials, the bureau  develops the list based on questionnaires filled out by post officials, and  the final threat ratings are reviewed and finalized through an iterative  process involving officials at overseas posts and headquarters. These  threat levels are used to determine the security measures required for  residences at each post.", "Second, in consultation with the interagency OSPB, DS develops physical  security standards for diplomatic facilities and residences. The  residential security standards apply to all residences of U.S. government  personnel assigned abroad under chief-of-mission authority. The OSPB  standards are published in the FAH and vary by residence type.  Specifically, there are separate OSPB standards for six different  residence types, one of which is on-compound housing. The remaining  five are for off-compound (1) apartments, (2) single family homes, (3)  residential compounds, (4) Marine Security Guard residences, and (5)  residences for principal officers. OSPB standards also vary by date of  construction or acquisition, threat level, and whether they are mandatory.  If residences do not meet all applicable mandatory standards, posts are  required to request exceptions to the OSPB standards.", "Within the OSPB standards, we identified six key categories of security  standards to protect residences from the threats of political violence,  terrorism, and crime. These include (1) an anti-climb perimeter barrier,  such as a wall or a fence, and access control; (2) setback from the  perimeter; (3) a secure off-street parking area; (4) a secure building  exterior with substantial doors and grilled windows with shatter-resistant  film; (5) alarms; and (6) a safe space for taking refuge. Figure 1 portrays  these six categories at a notional residence.", "In addition to the OSPB standards, State developed the Residential  Security Handbook and Physical Security Handbook, also published in  the FAH, which provide detailed supporting information designed to help  officials understand how to implement and meet the OSPB standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Posts Conduct Residential Security Surveys to Identify Vulnerabilities, but Many Surveys at Posts We Visited Were Not Completed as Required", "paragraphs": ["According to the FAM, before State can purchase or lease an overseas  residence, the RSO must conduct a residential security survey of the  property, document all security deficiencies that must be corrected, and  approve the purchase or lease of the residence.

Additionally, according to  DS officials, RSOs at posts that experience a change in threat level must  resurvey all post residences within 1 year of the threat-level change.  While officials at the posts we visited were able to provide us with up-to- date surveys for most of the 68 residences that we evaluated, not all  surveys at five of the seven posts we visited met the requirements  outlined in the FAH and the FAM. Specifically, 17 surveys were not  completed as required: 9 surveys were outdated, 1 survey was completed  after the residence had already been leased, and 7 surveys were missing.  Among the residences with surveys that did not meet requirements were  those of two principal officers. At one post, we found that the consul  general\u2019s residence had not been surveyed since 2006.

As noted  in the framework we developed to help federal agencies implement the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, leading organizations  reinforce results-oriented management by giving their managers  extensive authority to pursue organizational goals in exchange for  accountability for results. According to officials at DS headquarters,  ensuring that residential security surveys are completed as required is the  responsibility of individual posts. These officials added that they recently  started reviewing surveys for on-compound residences. However, aside  from periodic DS headquarters-led inspections that review, in part, the  extent to which posts are conducting residential security surveys as  required, DS has not instituted procedures to hold posts accountable for  complying with the survey requirements for off-compound residences,  which, as noted earlier, greatly outnumber on-compound residences.  Without up-to-date security surveys of all its overseas residences, State  has limited ability to effectively and efficiently identify vulnerabilities or  make informed decisions about where to allocate resources for security  upgrades to address such vulnerabilities.", "State Has Taken or Planned Actions to Enhance Residential Security  Following Attacks on U.S. Facilities and Personnel State has taken steps to enhance residential security in response to previous  attacks on U.S. facilities. These have included actions taken or planned to address  recommendations resulting from interagency security assessments and  Accountability Review Board (ARB) reports. In response to the September 2012  attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities\u2014including facilities in Libya, Sudan,  Tunisia, Yemen, and Egypt, among others\u2014State formed several Interagency  Security Assessment Teams to assess security vulnerabilities at 19 posts that the  Bureau of Diplomatic Security considered to be high-threat and high-risk. Rather  than assess the facilities at the 19 posts against the Overseas Security Policy Board  standards typically used to assess these facilities, the teams assessed all facilities  at the 19 posts for any type of security vulnerability\u2014physical or procedural. This  assessment process resulted in a report that recommended physical security  upgrades at some residences. At one post that we visited, officials noted that in  response to this report they had added a closed-circuit television system at the  ambassador\u2019s residence, but had not yet installed an emergency siren system at a  residential compound, which was also recommended by the report.", "State has also taken or planned steps to address recommendations from ARB  reports stemming from previous attacks on U.S. facilities and personnel overseas.  According to State, there have been four ARB reports related to the security of  residences, with 10 residential security recommendations in total. We found that 8 of  the 10 recommendations related to residential security have been implemented. For  instance, State established an interagency working group in response to a  recommendation to conduct a comprehensive review of issues related to residential  security. The 2 open recommendations are both from the 2005 ARB report on the  attacks on the U.S. consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Those recommendations,  which called for the construction of a new consulate compound along with  residences that meet the relevant security standards, will be closed as implemented  once staff transition into the new consulate compound in Jeddah. According to State  documentation, the new consulate compound was originally projected for completion  in March 2010. However, in May 2010, State terminated the contract because of the  original contractor\u2019s failure to perform. State awarded a new contract for the project  in September 2012.

Specifically, it should  take up to 30 days to draft and obtain approval within DS for an update to  the security standards in the FAH and up to another 15 days to obtain  approval for the draft changes by other relevant stakeholders within State,  such as OBO and the Office of the Legal Adviser. Obtaining approval  from OSPB members should occur within an additional 30 days.

Specifically, State (1) developed new residential security standards to  address the threat of terrorism, (2) revised the standards for newly  acquired on-compound housing, and (3) developed new standards for  existing on-compound housing. In each of these cases, the update  process took more than 3 years, including one instance that took more  than 9 years (see fig. 2).", "In April 2005, the ARB resulting from the attacks on the U.S.  consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, recommended developing  residential security standards to address terrorism. A working group  completed a final draft of the standards 4 years later in April 2009,  and it took other stakeholders within State nearly 5 more years to  clear the standards. As a result, the standards were not approved by  OSPB and published until May 2014. Moreover, DS did not notify  posts that the new standards had been completed until mid-October  2014\u20145 months after their publication and 3 months after they went  into effect. DS officials stated that their decision to notify posts was  prompted in part by our asking how posts become aware of new or  revised standards. Of the three posts that we visited prior to DS\u2019s  notification regarding the new standards, one had found them in the  FAH on its own in the same month that the standards went into effect,  one had found the new standards in the FAH on its own but not until  they had already gone into effect, and one was unaware of the new  standards until we mentioned them during our visit. According to DS  officials, these new standards applied immediately to off-compound  residences acquired on or after July 1, 2014; all other off-compound  residences have to meet the standards within 3 years\u2014by July  2017\u2014or receive exceptions. However, because DS did not notify  posts about the new standards until October 2014, post officials  effectively lost several months during which they could have been  preparing to apply the new standards. Additionally, officials at one  post stated that the DS notification arrived 1 day before the deadline  for submitting a budget request for the following fiscal year. In order to  request funding for newly required security features, they had to make  major revisions to the budget request they had already developed but  had very little time to do so. Likewise, officials at another post stated  that they had to make significant revisions to the building plan for a  new residential compound already under construction in order for it to  meet the new standards.  In November 2010, OSPB gave its approval for revising the standards  for newly acquired on-compound housing. These standards were not  finalized until September 2014. DS notified posts of their publication in  October 2014.  In November 2010, OSPB also gave its approval for developing new  standards for existing on-compound housing. The standards did not  receive approval within DS until September 2014. State published the  standards in May 2015.", "As we reported in June 2014, two key factors can cause major delays in  DS\u2019s process for updating security standards. First, if a stakeholder  suggests a change to the draft standards at any time during the review  process, the proposed draft must go through the entire review process  again; some stakeholders may then request additional time for reviewing  proposed changes, further prolonging the process. Second, when  changes are being made to an existing FAH subchapter, the FAH  requires officials to review and update the entire subchapter, and  according to DS officials, there is no specific exception for updates to  standards aimed at ensuring security and protecting lives. As a result,  even when DS needs to make urgent changes to the OSPB standards, it  must review and update the entire subchapter containing the update.", "In an attempt to mitigate delays in the process for updating OSPB  standards, State has taken some steps to help posts apply draft  standards before they are officially approved, but these steps have not  fully addressed the delays. While the standards for newly acquired on- compound housing were still in the OSPB approval process, State  incorporated them into the Physical Security Handbook\u2014updates to  which, according to DS, require clearance only within State\u2014so that  RSOs could begin to apply them. Similarly, State incorporated the  standards for existing on-compound housing into the Physical Security  Handbook before DS approved them. With respect to timely  communication of updated standards, DS recently began sending  monthly notices to RSOs to announce recently published updates to the  FAH. However, DS had not yet begun these monthly notices when the  new standards addressing terrorism were finalized in May 2014. Thus,  these efforts notwithstanding, delays in updating OSPB security  standards and communicating the updates may leave posts unaware of  the most current security measures required to address identified threats.  Accordingly, we recommended in June 2014 that State take steps to  ensure that updates to security and safety standards be approved  through an expedited review process. State concurred with the  recommendation, explaining that it had shortened the deadline for  department clearance on draft policies from 30 days to 15 days. However,  in two of the three cases outlined above\u2014the revised standards for newly  acquired on-compound housing and the new standards for existing on- compound housing\u2014draft standards were submitted for department  clearance after State\u2019s decision to shorten the associated deadline to 15  days.

We located relevant  standards and guidance in nine different subchapters of the FAH and  FAM. Further, one of the subchapters refers to a set of standards that  predated the 1998 embassy bombings and no longer exists. DS has  taken steps to mitigate this dispersion by creating tables that  consolidate the relevant standards. Specifically, DS has created  tables for each of the following: (1) the standards for newly acquired  on-compound housing; (2) the standards for existing on-compound  housing; and (3) the standards for off-compound residences, including  the new May 2014 standards to address terrorism. DS officials stated  in April 2015 that they had not yet provided RSOs with the table for  off-compound residences but planned to do so in May 2015. In  addition, DS officials told us that they plan to develop an automated  template for on-compound housing to assist RSOs in identifying the  relevant standards.", "Confusing terminology. RSOs at five posts stated that the standards  and guidance are sometimes worded in a confusing manner.  Specifically, while some standards are worded as mandatory  measures that \u201cmust\u201d be taken, others are worded in a way that could  be interpreted as mandatory or discretionary. For example, some  measures \u201cshould\u201d or will \u201cideally\u201d be taken, or are \u201crecommended\u201d;  likewise, some standards \u201cmust be considered,\u201d while others \u201cshould  be considered.\u201d DS officials told us that the intent of using various  terms in the guidance is to give RSOs some flexibility in deciding  which measures are applicable to their posts. However, a number of  RSOs told us that they sometimes had difficulty deciding whether and  how to apply certain standards because of their confusing wording.  These RSOs said that difficulties in distinguishing the nuances  between the various terms used in the standards sometimes resulted  in their uncertainty as to whether the residences at their posts were  fully in compliance with the standards.", "Unclear housing categories. While the new standards issued in May  2014 include a section outlining specific security measures for  residential compounds, DS headquarters officials told us that they  have had difficulty defining what differentiates this type of housing  from single family homes located in gated communities, which are  subject to a separate set of security measures. Officials added that in  the absence of clearly defined housing categories, it is difficult for  RSOs to know which standards to apply.", "In addition to finding State\u2019s residential security standards and guidance  to be confusing in nature, we identified multiple gaps and inconsistencies,  including the examples described below.", "The previous version of the FAM subchapter detailing State\u2019s program  for residential security stated that when a post experiences a change  in its Security Environment Threat List rating, the post must resurvey  residences to determine what security upgrades, if any, are needed.  However, a new version of the FAM subchapter published in August  2014 does not include this requirement. When we asked DS officials  about this, they told us it was an oversight and stated that the  requirement still exists. They also stated that because we brought this  issue to their attention, they plan to revise the standards issued in  May 2014 to include the requirement.", "While the new standards released in May 2014 call for pedestrian and  vehicle gates at residences to have locking devices, DS officials noted  that the standards as written do not explicitly require the residences to  have gates. They told us they plan to modify the wording of this  standard to clarify that gates are required.  In addition to announcing the completion of residential security  standards to address terrorism, the notification DS sent to posts in  October 2014 enumerated other sets of security standards for posts to  apply, including standards to address crime and standards for newly  acquired on-compound housing. However, the notification did not  mention the security standards in effect at the time for existing on- compound housing. Additionally, those standards for existing on- compound housing, which dated back to December 1999, were  labeled in the FAH as standards for \u201cnew\u201d on-compound housing. This  could potentially have caused confusion since the September 2014  standards for newly acquired on-compound housing are also labeled  as standards for \u201cnew\u201d on-compound housing. As noted earlier, State  issued new standards for existing on-compound housing in May 2015.  Because State completed those standards late in our review, we were  unable to fully evaluate them.", "We found inconsistent guidance on whether residential safe havens  are required to have an emergency exit. The Residential Security  Handbook states that every residential safe haven must have an  emergency exit. By contrast, a definitional section of the OSPB  security standards states that an emergency exit is required in  residential safe havens that have grilles and are located below the  fourth floor. A third variation appears in the new residential security  standards to address terrorism released in May 2014; it states that  residential safe havens must have an emergency exit \u201cif feasible.\u201d DS  officials told us that they plan to update the May 2014 standards to  help RSOs determine feasibility, but it is unclear whether they plan to  eliminate the inconsistencies we identified.", "These gaps and inconsistencies exist in part because DS has not  comprehensively reviewed and harmonized its various standards and  security-related guidance for residences. The FAH requires OSPB to  review all the OSPB standards periodically\u2014at least once every 5  years. In practice, as we previously reported, the process by which  security standards are updated is typically triggered by an event, such as  an attack, rather than by a periodic and systematic evaluation of all the  standards. As noted above, DS officials are planning updates to the  OSPB residential security standards to remedy some of the issues we  found. DS officials also stated that they are in the process of updating the  Residential Security Handbook and, as part of that effort, are adding  further clarifications and details to help guide RSOs. However, as  discussed earlier in this report, updates to the OSPB standards have  frequently taken State several years. Furthermore, the planned updates  that DS officials discussed with us do not constitute a comprehensive  effort to review all standards and security-related guidance for residences  to identify all potential gaps, inconsistencies, and instances where clarity  is lacking. Consequently, the confusing nature of the standards and  guidance and the gaps and inconsistencies they contain may continue to  complicate RSOs\u2019 efforts to identify and apply the appropriate security  measures, potentially leaving some residences at greater risk. At a  minimum, such gaps and inconsistencies in the standards and guidance  can lead to confusion and inefficiency. For example, according to RSO  officials at one post we visited, DS inspectors from headquarters told  them during a review of the post\u2019s security operations that residential safe  havens must have a reliable water source and grilles on all external  windows, including inaccessible windows.

In addition, two factors discussed earlier in this  report may contribute to unmet standards. First, missing or outdated  residential security surveys may hamper posts\u2019 ability to identify and  address residential security vulnerabilities that could have otherwise been  recognized and corrected. Second, the difficult-to-use nature of the OSPB  standards and other security-related guidance for residences can  complicate RSOs\u2019 efforts to identify and apply the appropriate security  measures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Nearly All of the Residences We Visited That Did Not Meet All Mandatory Standards Were Missing Required Exceptions", "paragraphs": ["Of the 38 residences we reviewed that did not meet all of the applicable  mandatory standards, DS had an exception on file for only 1.

However, many of the 38  residences that did not meet all of the applicable mandatory standards  had more significant vulnerabilities. For instance, as noted earlier, 3 of the  4 off-compound principal officer residences we visited did not meet the  standard that all accessible windows must have grilles when such  residences are located at posts rated high for political violence or crime;  DS did not have exceptions for any of the 3. Likewise, 5 of the 7 off- compound apartments acquired after July 1, 2014\u2014and therefore subject  to the new May 2014 standards\u2014did not have perimeter barriers  surrounding them as required by the standards; none of the 5 had  exceptions.", "We found that required exceptions for residences were missing for three  key reasons. First, posts do not always request exceptions when they are  needed. For example, of the 3 posts where off-compound principal officer  residences lacked some window grilles, none had requested exceptions  to this unmet standard. DS headquarters officials told us that State\u2019s  guidance for posts on how to request residential security exceptions has  historically been limited and vague, which, according to them, may  explain why posts do not always request exceptions when they are  needed. In cases where residences acquired since July 1, 2014, did not  meet all of the standards issued in May 2014, the lack of exceptions is  understandable, given that the posts acquired the residences before  being notified of the new standards in October 2014. In other cases,  though, the residences in question had been acquired several years or  even decades prior, and the standards we found that they were not  meeting had also been in existence for years.", "Second, until recently, State guidance on exceptions did not clearly  identify the roles and responsibilities of key offices involved in managing  the exception process, leading to confusion within DS headquarters and  potentially at posts as well. In 2007, State established FAM guidance  identifying an office within DS\u2019s Directorate for International Programs  (DS/IP) as the office responsible for managing the residential security  exception process. DS officials explained that, in practice, a different  office within DS\u2019s Directorate for Countermeasures (DS/C) has handled  residential exception requests since the late 1980s and, because of  limited staffing in DS/IP, continued to do so even after State guidance  named DS/IP as the responsible office in 2007. However, State did not  revise the FAM guidance to identify DS/C as the responsible office.  Subsequently, in August 2014, DS provided us with a written response  stating that, as of that date, it had not received any requests for  residential security exceptions. We subsequently learned the written  response was drafted by DS/IP, which was unaware that DS/C had been  receiving and processing exception requests for residences since the late  1980s. Since that time, the two offices have clarified their roles and  responsibilities with respect to residential security exceptions.  Specifically, officials told us in April 2015 that DS/C is now handling all  exception requests related to setback, while DS/IP is handling all other  exception requests.", "Third, weaknesses exist in DS\u2019s tracking of exceptions. The FAM states  that State documentation should be complete to the extent necessary to  facilitate decision making. However, we found weaknesses that raise  questions about the completeness of DS\u2019s documentation on exceptions.  For example, a list DS provided in response to our request for data on all  residential security exceptions only shows exceptions to the setback  standard. As noted earlier, DS had an exception on file for 1 of the 38  residences we reviewed that did not meet all of the applicable mandatory  standards. In reviewing the exception package for that residence, we  noted that the post requested\uf8e7and received approval for\uf8e7exceptions to  four different standards. The exception package also lists mitigation  actions the post plans to take. DS\u2019s list mentions that an exception was  granted to the setback standard, but it does not mention any of the other  three standards to which DS granted exceptions or the planned mitigation  actions. In addition, while the list DS provided identifies the post that  requested each exception, it does not identify the specific residence for  which the exception was requested. DS officials stated that in order to  identify the specific residence for which a given exception was requested  and approved, they would have to locate the paper copy of the exception  package\uf8e7a potentially time-consuming task given that, according to DS  officials, the paper copies of residential exception packages are  commingled with thousands of exception packages for office facilities  dating back as far as 1986. Because of these weaknesses, DS\u2019s list has  limited utility in helping DS and posts understand which residences may  have security vulnerabilities stemming from unmet standards.", "While DS is taking steps to improve its guidance and tracking for  exceptions, it is unclear if the planned improvements will fully address the  factors that have contributed to missing exceptions. DS officials told us  that as part of their ongoing update to the Residential Security Handbook,  they will be providing additional guidance for RSOs on how to submit  requests for exceptions. Since that initiative is still in development, it is  too early to assess its effectiveness. Additionally, DS/C officials told us  that they have begun converting paper copies of exception packages they  have processed to electronic form\u2014a task they estimate will take about 5  months\u2014and both DS/IP and DS/C have developed databases to record  exception requests. As noted earlier, the FAM calls for State  documentation to be complete to the extent necessary to facilitate  decision making; however, neither office currently plans for its database  to include all of the exceptions processed by the other office.  Consequently, DS may lack a complete picture of all the residential  exceptions it has processed\uf8e7valuable information that could help it better  understand the types of security vulnerabilities at residences and thus  make better informed risk management decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "New, More Rigorous Security Standards Will Likely Increase Posts\u2019 Need for Exceptions and Lead to Considerable Costs for Upgrades", "paragraphs": ["In addition to reviewing residences against the mandatory security  standards applicable to them at the time of our visit, we also reviewed  them using the new May 2014 standards in order to assess the impact  these standards will have on posts, DS headquarters, and future State  funding requests. As discussed earlier, by July 2017, all off-compound  residences will be required to meet the new standards to address  terrorism. If the residences do not meet the standards and cannot be  upgraded to meet them, posts will be required to apply for exceptions.  DS officials indicated that the new standards are more rigorous than the  previous ones and that many existing residences may be unable to meet  them. Overall, 55 of the 56 off-compound residences we reviewed did not  meet all of the new standards, including 49 residences that did not meet  two or more. As a result of the new standards, DS officials expect the  need for posts to apply for exceptions to increase. For example, officials  at one post told us that they do not believe it will be possible for any of the  approximately 300 apartments occupied by U.S. personnel at that post\u2014 or for other apartments available at their post\u2014to meet the new  mandatory standard of a perimeter barrier surrounding the building. In  other cases, it will be possible to upgrade existing residences to meet the  new standards, but the associated costs may be considerable. For  instance, RSO officials at the post with about 300 apartments stated that  they will need to install alarms and residential safe havens to meet the  new standards, at a cost of approximately $3,000 per residence. They  added that it is unlikely that current landlords will agree to pay for these  upgrades. The 2014 Security Environment Threat List indicates that  nearly 45 of the 275 U.S. diplomatic posts worldwide have higher threat  ratings for terrorism than for political violence and crime and thus will  likely have to adopt additional security measures\u2014potentially at  significant cost to the U.S. government\u2014in order to meet the new  standards to address terrorism. Furthermore, additional upgrades\u2014and  thus additional funding\u2014will likely be needed as posts take steps to apply  the new standards for existing on-compound housing, which, according to  DS officials, are also more rigorous than the standards that preceded  them.", "DS headquarters officials told us that because of our inquiries about the  implications of the new standards to address terrorism\uf8e7such as the  financial cost of meeting them\uf8e7they had decided to conduct a survey of  posts to assess the extent to which each one currently meets the new  standards. According to these officials, the results of the survey will help  them estimate the cost of upgrades needed to meet the new standards  and will provide them with valuable information on the types of  vulnerabilities that currently exist at residences.

Program funding was initially limited to \u201cAmerican-sponsored\u201d schools  that receive State assistance. Subsequently, eligibility for program  funding was expanded to non-American-sponsored schools that enroll  U.S. dependents or are expected to enroll such students within the next 6  months. In fiscal years 2010 through 2015, State allocated almost $28  million for security upgrades through the Soft Target Program (see table  3). State has used approximately $23.8 million of these allocations to  award almost 400 grants for specific upgrades. Of these awards,  approximately 97 percent ($23.1 million of $23.8 million) went to schools,  with the remaining 3 percent provided for off-compound employee  association facilities. According to State documentation, since the Soft  Target Program began in 2003, State has provided schools with more  than $100 million for physical security upgrades. American-sponsored  schools received $63 million of this funding; other schools received the  remaining $38 million.", "At the posts we visited, RSOs had worked with schools to identify  physical security needs and obtain funding for upgrades such as walls,  guard booths, public address systems, and window grilles. In addition to  school security upgrades, we also saw Soft Target Program-funded  security upgrades at employee association facilities, such as closed- circuit television systems, perimeter walls, and access control systems.  Overall, RSOs and school administrators told us they were pleased with  the upgrades.

Because it was beyond the scope of this  engagement to systematically review all residential security standards  and related guidance for gaps and consistencies, we cannot generalize  our findings to all standards and security-related guidance for residences.  We also evaluated the timeliness of updates to OSPB residential security  standards. To do so, we asked State to identify all updates to the  residential security standards since 2005 and to provide information about  when the updates started and were completed. We then analyzed how  long each update took and compared that against State officials\u2019  expectation of how long such updates should take.", "In addition to reviewing the documents above, we interviewed officials in  Washington, D.C., from DS; the Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations  (OBO); State\u2019s Office of Management Policy, Rightsizing, and Innovation;  and the U.S. Agency for International Development. We also traveled to 7  posts and conducted work focused on 3 other posts. Our judgmental  sample of 10 posts included nine countries in four of State\u2019s six  geographic regions\u2014Africa, the Near East, South and Central Asia, and  the Western Hemisphere. Each of the 10 posts was rated by DS as  having a high or critical threat level in one or more of the Security  Environment Threat List categories of political violence, terrorism, and  crime. Additionally, all but 1 of the 10 posts we selected were within the  top 75 posts rated by DS as the highest risk worldwide; of the 10, 7 were  within the top 50, and 4 were within the top 25. For security reasons, we  are not naming the 10 posts in our judgmental sample. Our findings from  these posts are not generalizable to all posts. Moreover, our judgmental  sample of high-threat, high-risk posts cannot be generalized to other high- threat, high-risk posts.", "For 2 of the 3 posts in our judgmental sample that we did not visit, we  reviewed residential security surveys and spoke with a Regional Security  Officer (RSO) regarding residential security measures in place at the  posts. For the third post we did not visit, we requested RSO input on  recent security upgrades and any remaining vulnerabilities at soft target  facilities at post. At the 7 posts we visited, we met with U.S. government  officials from State and other agencies involved in securing residences  and other soft targets\u2014including RSOs, general services officers,  financial management officers, facility managers, and members of post  Emergency Action Committees and Interagency Housing Boards\u2014to  understand their respective roles related to security of residences and  other soft targets and their perspectives on State\u2019s security policies and  procedures for these facilities. We also requested residential security  surveys for all 68 residences in our judgmental selection. We evaluated  the posts\u2019 records of these surveys using the residential security survey  requirements outlined in the FAM. Additionally, we reviewed security  measures in place at 10 schools attended by U.S. government  dependents and 3 off-compound employee association facilities. Of the  10 schools, 6 were \u201cAmerican-sponsored\u201d schools that receive State  assistance; the other 4 do not receive State assistance but enroll U.S.  government dependents.", "At the 7 posts we visited, we also evaluated a judgmental selection of 68  residences against applicable security standards. To do so, we first asked  DS officials to identify all sections of the FAH that contain residential  security standards. Based on DS\u2019s input, we reviewed all of the identified  sections and developed checklists of the residential security standards  applicable to each of the following residence types: on-compound  housing, off-compound apartments, off-compound single family homes,  off-compound residential compounds, off-compound Marine Security  Guard residences, and off-compound residences for principal officers.  The checklist for each residence type included the standards applicable  to it as of our fall 2014 visit, and the checklists for off-compound  residences also included the new May 2014 standards to address  terrorism, which all off-compound residences have to meet by July 2017.  As noted earlier in this report, standards also vary by date of construction  or acquisition and threat level. We included these variations in each  checklist so that for each residence we visited, we could apply the exact  standards applicable to it based on its type, its date of construction or  acquisition, and the post threat level.", "Our checklists included mandatory standards worded in terms of  measures that \u201cmust\u201d be taken as well as other standards, such as  measures that are \u201crecommended\u201d or that \u201cshould\u201d or will \u201cideally\u201d be  taken, among others. While we used all of these standards to review the  residences we visited, the analysis presented in this report only includes  mandatory standards worded in terms of measures that \u201cmust\u201d be taken.  We did not include other standards in our analysis because, as discussed  earlier in this report, some of the terminology used in those standards is  inconsistent, making it difficult to determine if a given residence is in  compliance or not.", "With regard to the specific 68 residences reviewed, we evaluated the  principal officer\u2019s residence at 6 of 7 posts and the Marine Security Guard  residence at 5 of 7 posts. The remaining 57 residences in our judgmental  selection represented a mix of different types of residences (such as  apartments and single family homes), on-compound and off-compound  residences, owned and leased residences, older and newer residences,  and residences occupied by State officials and non-State officials. Using  the checklists that we developed, we reviewed each of the 68 residences  against the mandatory standards applicable to it as of our fall 2014 visit;  in addition, we reviewed each of the 56 off-compound residences against  the mandatory standards in the new May 2014 standards to address  terrorism.", "After completing all 68 checklists, we categorized the mandatory  standards into six general categories, which we developed on the basis of  our professional judgment as well as our review of the six general  categories of security standards presented in our June 2014 reporting on  the security of diplomatic work facilities overseas. Each category  included one or more mandatory standards. For example, the category of  secure building exteriors included mandatory standards calling for  features such as lighting; substantial or grilled doors with peepholes and  deadbolt locks; and grilles, locks, and shatter-resistant film on accessible  windows. For the purposes of our analysis, if a residence did not meet  one of more of the mandatory standards in a given category, we classified  the residence as not meeting all mandatory standards in that category.  We used this methodology to calculate the number of residences that did  not meet all mandatory security standards applicable to them as of fall  2014 within each security standard category. We used the same  methodology to calculate the number of off-compound residences that did  not meet all mandatory standards within each category of the new May  2014 standards to address terrorism.", "To determine the reliability of the data we collected on overseas  residences and funding for security upgrades to residences, schools  attended by children of U.S. government personnel, and off-compound  facilities of employee associations, we compared information from  multiple sources, checked the data for reasonableness, and interviewed  cognizant officials regarding the processes they use to collect and track  the data. We evaluated the reliability of OBO\u2019s data on overseas  residential properties by comparing records for specific residences from  OBO\u2019s system with information we collected during site visits to these  residences and discussions with OBO and post officials. We evaluated  the reliability of the funding data we collected by comparing the data  against prior GAO reporting and by interviewing DS and OBO officials  familiar with State\u2019s financial management system to ask how the data  are tracked and checked for accuracy. On the basis of these checks, we  determined that the data we collected on overseas residences and  funding were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this engagement.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2014 to June 2015 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Thomas Costa (Assistant  Director), Joshua Akery, Amanda Bartine, John Bauckman, Tina Cheng,  Aniruddha Dasgupta, David Dayton, Martin De Alteriis, Jonathan  Fremont, Grace Lui, and Candice Wright made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
