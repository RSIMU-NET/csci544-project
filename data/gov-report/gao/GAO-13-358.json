Both agencies purchase drugs directly from manufacturers via prime vendors--intermediaries that provide the drugs at a discount off the lowest price that would otherwise be available. The agencies dispense these drugs to beneficiaries through their medical facilities and pharmacies, including their mail order pharmacies.", "GAO was asked to compare prices paid for prescription drugs across federal programs. This report describes direct purchase prices paid by DOD and VA for a sample of prescription drugs. GAO will compare drug prices paid using other approaches and by other federal programs in future work. Using prime vendor data provided by these agencies for the first quarter of 2012, GAO selected a sample of high-utilization and high-expenditure drugs important to both DOD and VA and compared average unit prices paid by these agencies for those drugs. The sample contained 43 brand-name and 40 generic drugs and accounted for 37 percent of DOD utilization, 32 percent of DOD expenditures, 28 percent of VA utilization, and 35 percent of VA expenditures for directly purchased drugs in that quarter. GAO calculated average unit prices by dividing total expenditures by total utilization for each drug, the entire sample, and the subsets of brand-name and generic drugs. GAO also compared DOD and VA average unit prices to the FSS and Big Four prices for each drug. GAO interviewed DOD and VA officials about their drug purchasing approaches and factors affecting the prices they are able to obtain."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["When GAO compared prices paid by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for a sample of 83 drugs purchased in the first calendar quarter of 2012, DOD's average unit price for the entire sample was 31.8 percent ($0.11 per unit) higher than VA's average price, and DOD's average unit price for the subset of 40 generic drugs was 66.6 percent ($0.04 per unit) higher than VA's average price. However, VA's average unit price for the subset of 43 brand-name drugs was 136.9 percent ($1.01 per unit) higher than DOD's average price. These results were consistent with each agency obtaining better prices on the type of drugs that made up the majority of its utilization: generic drugs accounted for 83 percent of VA's utilization of the sample drugs and brand-name drugs accounted for 54 percent of DOD's utilization of the sample drugs. DOD officials told GAO that in certain circumstances they are able to obtain competitive prices for brand-name drugs--even below the prices for generic equivalents--and therefore will often preferentially purchase brand-name drugs.", "At the individual drug level, DOD paid higher average unit prices than VA for 32 of the 40 generic drugs and for 23 of the 43 brand-name drugs in the sample, while VA paid higher average unit prices for the remaining 8 generic drugs and 20 brand-name drugs. In nearly every case, substantially higher prices paid by one agency were correlated with substantially lower utilization by that agency. Specifically, for 10 of the 11 drugs for which one agency paid more than 100 percent above the price paid by the other agency, the agency that paid a substantially higher price also had substantially lower utilization. However, even when one agency paid a substantially higher price than the other, in all 11 cases both agencies paid less than the highest of the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS) prices available to all direct federal purchasers or the Big Four prices available to the four largest government purchasers. Additionally, in most cases (9 out of 11 drugs) both agencies paid less than the lowest of these prices. The lower prices obtained by one agency may be due to factors such as differences in the agencies' formulary design and prescription practices, price and rebate negotiations with manufacturers that may not be available more broadly to the other agency, and differences in utilization practices between the agencies based on differences in their beneficiary populations.", "DOD and VA face continued challenges in controlling drug costs. While the prescription drug market is complex and there are many factors affecting the prices DOD and VA are able to obtain for directly purchased drugs, differences in prices paid for specific drugs may provide insights into opportunities for each agency to obtain additional savings on at least some of the drugs they purchase.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, DOD generally agreed with GAO's findings and described additional factors that may contribute to differences in prices paid by DOD and VA. VA expressed concerns with the content of the report. VA suggested additional analyses and highlighted the impact of program design on each agency's use of prescription drugs. GAO maintains that its analyses have value in identifying opportunities for savings and the report acknowledges the limitations involved with estimating potential cost savings in this complex area. DOD and VA also provided technical comments that GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs  (VA) are major federal purchasers of prescription drugs.

In our November 2012 report on DOD and VA  health care, agency officials told us that some of the differences in the  agencies\u2019 formularies are due to differences in the structure of their health  care systems. For example, DOD covers prescriptions written by both  military and civilian providers, and DOD officials previously reported that,  as a result, the department needs to have a broad formulary to account  for differences in prescribing practices among different providers. In  contrast, VA primarily covers medications for eligible beneficiaries  through prescriptions written by its own providers. As VA officials  reported, this allows VA to have more direct control over the medications  that are prescribed to its patient population.

In addition,  DOD noted that expressing differences between DOD and VA prices for  the sample as percentages rather than actual dollar amounts may give  the impression that significant dollar values are involved rather than a few  cents or less per unit. While we clarified in the report the dollar amount of  price differences, our findings indicated that small per-unit price  differences may result in significant additional expenditures when  accounting for the quantities purchased by the agencies. DOD also  described additional factors beyond those mentioned in our findings that  may contribute to differences in prices paid by DOD and VA.", "VA expressed concerns with the content of the report and suggested  additional analyses. For example, VA suggested that analyses accounting  for per-beneficiary costs, formulary design, utilization management, and  the mix of drugs used for a particular disease state would have provided  more appropriate comparisons. While we agree that such analyses could  be useful, the scope of our work was targeted to a comparison of prices  paid by each agency for a sample of high-utilization and high-expenditure  drugs and was not intended to capture all factors that can affect  pharmaceutical spending. We noted the limitations of our results in the  report, including that our results cannot be applied to all drugs purchased  by the agencies. Further, our report acknowledges the limitations involved  with estimating potential cost savings in this complex area. Nonetheless,  we maintain that comparing unit prices paid for selected generic and  brand-name drugs by different federal agencies has value in identifying  specific drugs with price differences that may warrant further  consideration for potential savings.", "VA also noted that most of its drug purchases are made through contracts  with a prime vendor that provides a negative distribution fee (i.e.,  discount), resulting in savings to VA. We revised the introduction to make  this information more prominent earlier in the report. VA agreed with our  conclusion that the maximum potential savings provided in our findings  are unlikely to be achieved and noted that obtaining lower prices on  brand-name drugs would require shifting utilization away from generic  drugs, potentially increasing overall drug costs. VA also stated that our list  of factors affecting the prices each agency is able to obtain did not  specifically include the ability of VA to direct utilization toward a limited  number of drugs within a therapeutic class to achieve savings. We  revised the report to clarify this point.", "VA also stated that, under an applicable Federal Acquisition Regulation  (48 C.F.R. \u00a7 8.002), it was required to purchase more expensive versions  of generic minocycline through the FSS contract rather than versions  otherwise available.

We excluded physician- administered outpatient prescription drugs and over-the-counter drugs  from our sample; we also excluded items that are not traditionally  considered drugs such as bandages, syringes, needles, diabetes test  strips, saline, and water for irrigation. We used data from Red Book to  determine the brand-name or generic status of each drug. Utilization was  determined using the National Council for Prescription Drug Programs  (NCPDP) Billing Unit Standard. When calculating expenditures, we used  the agencies\u2019 costs to purchase each drug without accounting for any  future offsets from beneficiary copayments for those drugs. We  aggregated the utilization and expenditure data at the drug level (drug  name, strength, and dosage form) separately for DOD and VA. For  example, all national drug codes (NDC) corresponding to 10 mg tablets of  Lipitor purchased by VA were aggregated and the associated utilization  and expenditures were summed and compared to other brand-name  drugs, while NDCs corresponding to 10 mg tablets of atorvastatin (the  generic equivalent of Lipitor) purchased by VA were aggregated  separately and compared to other generic drugs.", "We ranked the top 100 brand-name and top 100 generic drugs separately  for each agency on the basis of utilization and expenditures and then  combined these rankings to determine the top brand-name and generic  drugs that were purchased by both agencies.

For example, if a drug was 10th highest in utilization for VA but was not in  the top 100 for DOD, that drug would not be included in our sample.  Some drugs that were excluded from the sample appeared to be more  appropriate for the beneficiary population of one agency than the other.  For example, primaquine phosphate\u2014a drug used to treat malaria\u2014was  the fourth-highest-expenditure generic drug for DOD but was not in the  top 100 for VA. Some other excluded drugs were additional strengths of  drugs that did appear in our sample. For example, simvastatin (80 mg  tablet) was the sixth-highest-expenditure generic drug for VA but was not  in the top 100 for DOD and thus was excluded from the sample.
