Second, even for diagnoses clearly linked to a condition or disease, such as stroke, the length of treatment for patients with the same diagnosis varies widely. Third, because of the complexity of patient factors involved, most studies do not define the amount or mix of therapy services needed for Medicare beneficiaries with specific conditions or diseases. Provider groups remain concerned about adverse effects on beneficiaries needing extensive therapy if the caps are enforced. HHS does not, however, have the authority to provide exceptions to the therapy caps. Despite several related statutory requirements, HHS has made little progress toward developing a payment system for outpatient therapy that considers individual beneficiaries' needs. In particular, HHS has not determined how to standardize and collect information on the health and functioning of patients receiving outpatient therapy services--a key part of developing a system based on individual needs for therapy. The circumstances that led to the therapy caps remain a concern. Medicare payments for outpatient therapy are still rising significantly, and increases in improper payments for outpatient therapy continue.

From 1990 through 1996, spending  on these services grew at nearly double the rate of Medicare spending  overall. Some of the growth was attributed to financial incentives in  Medicare payment methods, which encouraged use of services, and to the  lack of program oversight to prevent inappropriate payments. For  example, in 1995 we reported widespread examples of overcharging  Medicare for therapy services delivered to nursing home residents,  including markups resulting from providers\u2019 exploiting regulatory  ambiguity and weaknesses in Medicare\u2019s payment rules. In 1997, as a  means to control the spending growth, Congress established new caps on  the amount that Medicare would pay for outpatient therapy services for a  beneficiary in any given year. These therapy caps raised concern, however,  that patients with extensive need for outpatient therapy services would be  adversely affected\u2014particularly patients who lacked access to hospital  outpatient departments, which are exempt from the caps. Since 1997, the  caps were actually in effect only in 1999 and part of 2003; in other years,  Congress placed temporary moratoriums on them. The current  moratorium on the therapy caps is due to expire at the end of December  2005.", "As part of the 1997 legislation that established the therapy caps, Congress  also required the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to  report by 2001 on its recommendations for an alternative, \u201cneeds-based\u201d  payment system for outpatient therapy services. We have reported that, in  contrast to less-targeted control over service use afforded by spending  limits, such a payment system could help target payments to beneficiaries  who genuinely require more services than could be paid for under the  therapy caps. A needs-based payment system could take into account the  type and extent of therapy warranted by a beneficiary\u2019s health and  functional status (that is, the person\u2019s ability to perform activities of daily  living, such as bathing, dressing, eating, or moving from one location to  another). In several laws enacted starting in 1997, Congress has directed  HHS to take certain actions related to the development of such a system,  including considering beneficiaries\u2019 functional status in the design of a  new outpatient therapy policy and reporting on the development of  standard instruments for assessing the health and functional status of  patients receiving Medicare services, including outpatient therapy. Within  HHS, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which  administers Medicare, has major responsibilities for this effort.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA), which put in place the most recent moratorium on therapy  caps, directed us to report on the conditions or diseases that may justify  waiving application of the caps. To provide a greater range of information  about these issues, as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction, we also  examined HHS\u2019s efforts to date in developing a needs-based payment  system. This report assesses (1) available information that could be used  to justify waiving outpatient therapy caps for particular conditions or  diseases, (2) the status of HHS\u2019s efforts to base Medicare payment policy  on outpatient therapy on beneficiaries\u2019 needs, and (3) whether the  circumstances initially leading to the caps have changed.", "To assess whether available information could be used to justify waiving  outpatient therapy caps for particular conditions or diseases, we reviewed  data and research including analyses of Medicare claims data by CMS  contractors.

We also reviewed the  literature on therapy treatment protocols and on the efficacy of outpatient  therapy for Medicare beneficiaries with selected conditions and diseases,  and we reviewed a related report by the Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission (MedPAC), an independent group of health care experts that  advises Congress on Medicare payment issues. To assess HHS\u2019s response  to requirements for developing instruments to ensure that Medicare  payments for outpatient therapy are targeted to beneficiaries\u2019 needs, we  reviewed the legislative history of Medicare\u2019s outpatient therapy caps,  related requirements for HHS, and studies by CMS contractors. We  examined HHS\u2019s actions in response to the legislative requirements and  studies\u2019 proposals and reviewed administrative options for ensuring that  medically necessary therapy is available to beneficiaries over the short and  long terms under Medicare\u2019s payment system. To determine whether the  circumstances leading to therapy caps\u2014specifically, significant growth in  outpatient therapy payments and a high rate of improper payments\u2014have  changed, we reviewed preliminary CMS estimates of overall Medicare part  B expenditures, which include spending on outpatient therapy services,  and CMS reports on improper payments for outpatient therapy services.

Beneficiaries receiving therapy  are expected to improve significantly in a reasonable time and to need  therapy for rehabilitation rather than maintenance. Medicare-covered  outpatient therapy services are provided in a variety of settings by  institutional providers (such as hospital outpatient departments, skilled  nursing facilities, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facilities,  outpatient rehabilitation facilities, and home health agencies) and by  noninstitutional providers (such as physicians, nonphysician practitioners,  and physical and occupational therapists in private practice). Both  institutional and noninstitutional providers\u2014with the exception of  hospital outpatient departments\u2014are subject to the therapy caps.", "For more than a decade, Medicare\u2019s costs for outpatient therapy services  have been rising, and widespread examples of inappropriate billing  practices, resulting from regulatory ambiguity and weaknesses in  Medicare\u2019s payment rules, have been reported by us and others. In 1995 we  reported, for example, that while state averages for physical, occupational,  and speech therapists\u2019 salaries in hospitals and skilled nursing facilities  ranged from about $12 to $25 per hour, Medicare had been charged   $600 per hour or more. HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported in  1999 that Medicare reimbursed skilled nursing facilities almost $1 billion  for physical and occupational therapy that was claimed improperly,  because the therapy was not medically necessary or was provided by staff  who did not have the appropriate skills for the patients\u2019 medical  conditions.", "To control rising costs and improper payments, Congress established  therapy caps for all nonhospital providers in the Balanced Budget Act of  1997. The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement  Act of 1999 later imposed a moratorium on the caps for 2000 and 2001.  The Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection  Act of 2000 then extended the moratorium through 2002. Although no  moratorium was in effect as of January 1, 2003, CMS delayed enforcing the  therapy caps through August 31, 2003. In December 2003, the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 placed  the most recent moratorium on the caps, extending from December 8,  2003, through December 31, 2005. The legislation establishing the caps  provided for two caps per beneficiary: one for occupational therapy and  one for physical therapy and speech-language pathology combined. The  legislation set the caps at $1,500 each and provided that these limits be  indexed by the Medicare Economic Index each year beginning in 2002.  When last in place in 2003, the two caps were set at $1,590 each.", "To process and pay claims and to monitor health care providers\u2019  compliance with Medicare program requirements, CMS relies on claims  administration contractors, who use a variety of review mechanisms to  ensure appropriate payments to providers. A system of automated checks  (a process CMS terms \u201cedits\u201d) flags potential billing errors and  questionable claims. The automated system can, for example, identify  procedures that are unlikely to be performed on the same patient on the  same day or pairs of procedure codes that should not be billed together  because one service inherently includes the other or the services are  clinically incompatible.", "In certain cases, automated checks performed by CMS claims  administration contractors may lead to additional claim reviews or to  educating providers about Medicare coverage or billing issues. The  contractors\u2019 clinically trained personnel may perform a medical review,  examining the claim along with the patient\u2019s medical record, submitted by  the physician.

As of October 2005, HHS had not reported its specific  recommendations on revising the coverage policy based on patients\u2019  needs. HHS had, however, contracted with researchers to conduct several  analyses of Medicare claims data as a means of responding to the  mandates.", "HHS\u2019s response, implemented through CMS, to the principal legislative  provisions addressing outpatient therapy services has been to contract for  a series of studies, first by the Urban Institute and then by AdvanceMed  (see table 4). In general, these studies have found that information  available from Medicare claims data is insufficient to develop an  alternative payment system based on patients\u2019 therapy needs, and a patient  assessment instrument for outpatient therapy services that collected  information on functional status and functional outcomes would be  needed to develop such a system.

Although outpatient therapy spending for 2003 and 2004 has not  been fully estimated, overall Medicare part B expenditures\u2014which include  spending on outpatient therapy services\u2014showed rapid growth (15  percent) from 2003 to 2004, according to CMS estimates reported in 2005.  CMS attributed this growth to five factors, one of which was increased use  of minor procedures such as therapy performed by physicians and  physical therapists. Payments for certain therapy services, for example,  increased by 24 percent or more from 2003 to 2004. CMS officials told us  that many valid reasons may exist for the significant growth in payments  for outpatient therapy.

Specifically, in November 2004, CMS reported that the estimated error rate  for claims rose steadily from 10.9 percent in 1998 to 20.4 percent in 2000.  CMS reported that most of the errors were due to insufficient  documentation to support the services claimed, such as lack of evidence  of physician review and certification of treatment plans. In January 2005,  CMS reported error rates in a random sample of more than 160,000 fee-for- service claims, which included therapy services, from 2003. The agency  found that claims submitted for therapy services were among those with  the highest rates of payments made in error because of insufficient  documentation or medically unnecessary services. Such services  included procedures frequently provided by therapists, such as therapeutic  exercise, therapeutic activities, neuromuscular reeducation, electrical  stimulation, manual therapy, and physical therapy evaluation. For  example, 23.5 percent of claims for therapeutic activities lacked sufficient  documentation, resulting in projected improper payments of more than  $34 million. Claims for therapeutic exercises had a \u201cmedically  unnecessary\u201d error rate of 3 percent, with projected improper payments of  more than $18 million.", "Our past work found that CMS needed to do more medical reviews of  beneficiaries receiving outpatient therapy services. We reported in 2004,  for example, that in Florida, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation  facilities were the most expensive class of providers of outpatient therapy  services in the Medicare program in 2002. Per-beneficiary payments for  outpatient therapy services to providers in these facilities were two to  three times higher than payments to therapy providers in other facilities.  We recommended that CMS direct the Florida claims administration  contractor to medically review more claims from comprehensive  outpatient rehabilitation facilities.", "CMS\u2019s contracted researcher concluded that CMS could improve its claims  system by identifying and implementing modifications to the agency\u2019s  automated claims review system to better target payments to medically  appropriate care.

In  analyzing 2002 Medicare claims data, the contractor found limited system  protections to prevent outpatient therapy providers from submitting  claims for procedures that are illogical for a given diagnosis. One example,  according to the contractor\u2019s report, was claiming for manual therapy  submitted with a diagnosis of an eye infection. The estimated impact of  improper billings based on illogical combinations of diagnosis and  procedure codes in 2002 amounted to $16.7 million.", "CMS officials agreed with the contracted researcher that such edits are  worth considering, but the agency had not implemented them as of  October 2005. A CMS official told us, however, that CMS is implementing  the proposed edits to control multiple billings of codes meant to be billed  only once per patient per visit; the agency expects these edits to be in  place in early 2006. As of October 2005, CMS was still considering whether  to implement the other two types of edits. In addition to the three types of  edits identified by the contracted researcher, the researcher proposed  routine data analysis of Medicare claims to identify other utilization limits  that could be applied to better target Medicare payments. CMS is  considering whether and how to implement this type of analysis.", "Provider groups we spoke with agreed that Medicare was likely paying for  some medically unnecessary therapy services and that improved payment  edits could help ensure that Medicare did not pay for such services.  Nevertheless, representatives from these groups stressed the importance  of mechanisms that would allow Medicare to cover payments for  beneficiaries who need extensive care. The representatives noted that an  exception process, based on a medical review, could help determine the  appropriateness of therapy services. Such an exception process could be  invoked to review the medical records of beneficiaries whose providers  seek permission for coverage of Medicare payments in excess of the caps.  CMS officials agreed that an appeal process or waiver from the caps could  be a short-term approach to focus resources on needy beneficiaries. They  added that possible criteria for waiving the caps could include (1) having  multiple conditions; (2) having certain conditions, levels of severity, or  multiple conditions suggested by research as having greater need for  treatment; (3) having needs for more than one type of service, such as  occupational therapy and speech-language pathology; or (4) having prior  use of services or multiple episodes in the same year.

In response to a  statutory requirement to report on the standardization of patient  assessment instruments in a variety of settings, HHS and CMS have an  effort under way to study and report to Congress on the development of  standard terminology that Medicare providers could use to assess patients\u2019  diagnosis and functional status. Although this provision requires that  outpatient therapy services be included in this effort, HHS and CMS have  not done so.", "Concerns remain that when the current moratorium expires and the caps  are reinstated, some beneficiaries who have medical needs for therapy  beyond what can be paid for under the caps may not be able to obtain the  care they need. Some beneficiaries may not be able to afford to pay for  care or may not have access to hospital outpatient departments, which are  not subject to the caps. In the absence of patient assessment information,  therefore, an interim process, demonstration, or pilot project may be  warranted to allow HHS to grant exceptions to the caps. For example,  such a project could allow beneficiaries, under circumstances that CMS  determines, an exception to the cap on the basis of medical review  supported by documentation from providers regarding their patients\u2019  needs for extensive therapy. Such a project could also provide CMS with  valuable information about the conditions, diseases, and functional status  of beneficiaries who have extensive medical needs for therapy. The  information gathered through the project could also facilitate development  of a standardized patient assessment process or instrument. HHS,  however, would need legislative authority to conduct such a project.  Although exceptions could increase Medicare payments for outpatient  therapy, exceptions could provide one avenue for Medicare coverage  above the caps for some beneficiaries who need extensive therapy.  Potentially, payment increases due to exceptions could be offset by  implementation of the contractor-proposed improvements, such as edits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To provide a mechanism after the moratorium expires whereby certain  Medicare beneficiaries could have access to appropriate outpatient  therapy services and to obtain better data needed to improve the Medicare  outpatient therapy payment policy, including data on the conditions and  diseases of beneficiaries who have extensive outpatient therapy needs,  Congress should consider giving HHS authority to implement an interim  process or demonstration project whereby individual beneficiaries could  be granted an exception from the therapy caps."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To expedite development of a process for assessing patients\u2019 needs for  outpatient therapy services and to limit improper payments, we  recommend that the Secretary of HHS take the following two actions:    ensure that outpatient therapy services are added to the effort already  under way to develop standard terminology for existing patient  assessment instruments, with a goal of developing a means by which to  collect such information for outpatient therapy, and  implement improvements to CMS\u2019s automated system for identifying  outpatient therapy claims that are likely to be improper."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment and received a  written response from the department (reproduced in app. I). HHS did not  comment on the matter for congressional consideration, in which we said  that Congress should give HHS authority to implement an interim process  or demonstration project whereby individual beneficiaries could be  granted an exception from the therapy caps. HHS concurred with our  recommendation that it ensure that outpatient therapy services are added  to the effort already under way to develop standard terminology for  existing patient assessment instruments. The department stated that it is  preparing to contract for a 5-month study to develop a policy and payment  guidance report as it explores the feasibility of developing a post\u2013acute  care patient assessment instrument.", "In commenting on our recommendation to implement improvements to  CMS\u2019s automated system for identifying outpatient therapy claims that are  likely to be improper, HHS discussed a national edit system to promote  correct coding methods and eliminate improper coding. This national edit  system has been applied to some therapy-related claims starting in 1996,  and HHS plans to apply it more broadly in 2006. While the national edit  system is complementary to the edits proposed by CMS\u2019s contracted  study, CMS can do more by also implementing improvements to its  payment system as suggested by the study\u2019s specific findings. HHS also  indicated that it was exploring other methods for automated evaluation of  claims but commented that its claims-processing system cannot always  identify an improper claim from the information that is available on claim  forms. We agree that the current system cannot always identify an  improper claim, given the lack of information on the claim forms about a  patient\u2019s actual needs for therapy. It was this conclusion that led to our  recommendation that HHS include outpatient therapy in its present efforts  to improve the collection of patient assessment information. We believe  that CMS can make improvements to its current automated system to  reduce improper claims, irrespective of its efforts to improve patient  assessment information. As we noted in the draft report, CMS\u2019s contracted  study found certain edits to be feasible using information already provided  on claim forms, such as edits of clinically illogical combinations of therapy  procedure codes.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services, and other interested parties.
