To be credible, an offset must be additional--it must reduce emissions below the quantity emitted in a business-as-usual scenario--among other criteria. Assessing credibility is inherently challenging because it is difficult to make business-as-usual projections. Outside the U.S., offsets may be purchased on compliance markets to meet requirements to reduce emissions. In the U.S., there are no federal requirements and offsets may be purchased in the voluntary market. GAO was asked to examine (1) the scope of the U.S. voluntary carbon offset market, including the role of the federal government; (2) the extent to which mechanisms for ensuring the credibility of offsets are available and used and what, if any, related information is shared with consumers; and (3) trade-offs associated with increased oversight of the U.S. market and including offsets in climate change mitigation policies. This report is based on analysis of literature and data, interviews with stakeholders, and GAO's purchase of offsets."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The scope of the U.S. voluntary carbon offset market is uncertain because of limited data, but available information indicates that the supply of offsets generated from projects based in the United States is growing rapidly. Data obtained from a firm that analyzes the carbon market show that the supply of offsets increased from about 6.2 million tons in 2004 to about 10.2 million tons in 2007. Over 600 organizations develop, market, or sell offsets in the United States, and the market involves a wide range of participants, prices, transaction types, and projects. The federal government plays a small role in the voluntary market by providing limited consumer protection and technical assistance, and no single regulatory body has oversight responsibilities. A variety of quality assurance mechanisms, including standards for verification and monitoring, are available and used to evaluate offsets, but data are not sufficient to determine the extent of their use. Information shared with consumers on credibility is also limited. Participants in the offset market face challenges ensuring the credibility of offsets, including problems determining additionality, and the existence of many quality assurance mechanisms. GAO, through its purchase of offsets, found that the information provided to consumers by retailers offered limited assurance of credibility. Increased federal oversight of the U.S. voluntary market could enhance the market's transparency and improve consumer protection, but may also reduce flexibility, increase administrative costs, and stifle innovation, according to certain stakeholders. Including offsets in regulatory programs to limit greenhouse gas emissions could also lower the cost of compliance, according to recent EPA analyses and economic literature. However, some stakeholders said that concerns about the credibility of offsets could compromise the environmental integrity of a compliance system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Carbon offsets provide a way for individuals, businesses, and governments  to address concerns about the impact of their greenhouse gas emissions  on the earth\u2019s climate by paying others to undertake activities that reduce,  avoid, or sequester greenhouse gases. A carbon offset can be defined as a  measurable reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from an activity or  project in one location that is used to compensate for emissions occurring  elsewhere. For example, a U.S. manufacturer might offset its emissions by  funding an external project that captures methane, a greenhouse gas  emitted from agricultural sources and landfills. The emissions reduced,  avoided, or sequestered by such projects are collectively termed carbon  offsets, though they may involve different greenhouse gases.", "Carbon offsets are a potentially attractive option for those interested in  addressing concerns about climate change because they can offer a  potentially low-cost and convenient means of reducing, avoiding, or  sequestering greenhouse gas emissions relative to other options, such as  altering manufacturing processes or using less fossil fuel. At the same  time, consumers of offsets need assurance that buying an offset has the  same effect on emissions as if they had decided to reduce emissions on  their own. Providing this assurance is inherently challenging because it  involves measuring the reductions achieved through an offset project  against a projected baseline of what would have occurred in its absence.  For example, if a facility that emitted 200 tons of carbon dioxide per year  implemented a project that reduced its emissions by 100 tons, it may have  created 100 tons of offsets. See figure 1 for a hypothetical depiction of an  offset project measured against a projected business-as-usual scenario.", "The shaded area in the diagram represents carbon offsets generated from the project.", "Emissions reductions from an offset project could occur immediately or gradually over time,  depending upon the project type.", "Although definitions differ, our review of literature and discussions with  stakeholders identified four general criteria for credible offsets: They must  be additional, quantifiable, real, and permanent. A carbon offset project is  generally considered \u201cadditional\u201d if it decreases emissions of greenhouse  gases below the quantity that would have been emitted in a projected  business-as-usual scenario. \u201cQuantifiable\u201d means the reductions can be  measured, and \u201creal\u201d means the reductions can be verified. \u201cPermanent\u201d  means the emissions reduced, avoided, or sequestered by a project will not  be released into the atmosphere in the future. In addition, it is important to  ensure that double-counting of a particular offset does not occur, where  multiple purchasers use the same offset. Participants in the offset market  may use a variety of quality assurance mechanisms to substantiate the  credibility of offsets. Market participants may also track the sale and  ownership of offsets by using one of several registries. The use of a  registry may help participants share details about offsets available for  purchase on the market.", "Participants in the offset market include project developers, who identify  and perform actions that reduce, avoid, or sequester emissions; third party  verifiers, who ensure that projects adhere to relevant quality assurance  mechanisms; intermediaries, including aggregators, who buy offsets and  bundle them into larger quantities for resale; and retailers, who market  and sell offsets to consumers, including organizations and individuals.  Other participants include brokers and exchanges, which facilitate  transactions between buyers and sellers. Participants may play multiple  roles. For example, a single company may develop projects, purchase  offsets from other developers, and market offsets to consumers. Project  developers may also skip steps in the supply chain and sell directly to  consumers. Figure 2 illustrates a generalized carbon offsets supply chain.", "Some carbon offsets are purchased by entities that are subject to legal  requirements to decrease their greenhouse gas emissions, such as the  European Union\u2019s (EU) Emissions Trading Scheme. In such cases, the  market for offsets is referred to as a \u201ccompliance market.\u201d In contrast, the  U.S. market is a \u201cvoluntary market,\u201d and purchasers are not required to  limit their emissions or purchase offsets. However, the Congress is  considering several proposals for limiting greenhouse gas emissions that  would enable regulated entities to rely, in part, on offsets for compliance  in a fashion similar to the European Union\u2019s program. Offsets also may  play a role in U.S. state and regional programs that are under development.", "A brief description of certain international and domestic programs is  provided in appendix VI.", "In the United States, market participants may purchase offsets through the  Chicago Climate Exchange (CCX) and on the retail market, which includes  transactions that occur outside of a formal exchange. CCX is a voluntary  greenhouse gas reduction and trading system through which members  make legally binding commitments to reduce their emissions. In addition  to these members, the CCX platform is also available to offset providers,  who may register tons on CCX that represent various greenhouse gas  reduction projects. CCX participants may trade offsets generated from  qualifying emissions reduction projects. According to CCX, to verify the  validity of offsets offered for sale on the exchange, and ensure that the  underlying offset projects conform to CCX rules, all tons registered for  sale have been verified by approved third party verification firms that are  specialized in particular fields. Further, in addition to other quality  assurance procedures, CCX market participants use a registry to help  track purchases and sales of offsets acquired or sold on the exchange. In  contrast to exchange trading, which occurs through platforms designed to  facilitate trades on a larger scale, retail sales typically involve transactions  directly between two parties. However, certain retailers buy offsets  through CCX and retire them on behalf of consumers. In addition, offsets  may be bought and sold across international borders and through Web  sites.", "In this context, you asked us to (1) describe the scope of the U.S.  voluntary carbon offset market, including the role of the federal  government; (2) analyze the extent to which mechanisms for ensuring the  credibility of voluntary carbon offsets are available and used, and what, if  any, related information is shared with consumers; and (3) assess the  trade-offs associated with increasing the federal oversight of the U.S.  voluntary carbon offset market and incorporating offsets into broader  climate change mitigation policies.", "In conducting our work, we reviewed available government and trade  literature related to carbon offset markets and conducted semistructured  interviews with nonprobability samples of stakeholders, including  providers, third party verifiers, and other knowledgeable stakeholders.

We also met with, among others,  representatives of the Council on Environmental Quality and officials  responsible for managing state and regional greenhouse gas mitigation  programs. To obtain detailed information about carbon offset projects in  the United States, we purchased and analyzed data from Point Carbon, a  provider of independent carbon market news, analysis, and consulting  services. We assessed the reliability of these data and determined that  they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. In addition,  to respond to the second objective, we purchased offsets from a  nonprobability sample of retail providers and analyzed the materials we  received in return as well as information provided on Web sites. To  respond to the third objective, we reviewed available economic literature  and information collected through stakeholder responses to  semistructured interview questions.

We identified  210 offset providers of various types, including 87 U.S.-based providers.  Project developers implement individual projects and may sell offsets directly  to consumers or to intermediaries. Intermediaries are further subdivided into  retailers, aggregators, and brokers, among other categories. Retailers  generally sell smaller quantities of offsets to individuals or organizations.  Aggregators, also known as wholesalers, sell in bulk and often own a portfolio  of offsets. Brokers facilitate transactions between sellers and buyers.  Providers obtain the rights to the offsets they sell in a number of ways,  including developing their own projects or purchasing directly from project  developers, sometimes through brokers. Other providers purchase and retire  offsets through CCX on behalf of customers. Providers may also play multiple  roles in the offset market. For example, a single company may develop  projects, aggregate offsets from other projects or providers for resale, and sell  offsets directly to consumers.

Project developers may use a third party verifier to confirm that offsets  generated by a project were accurately calculated. Once verified, the offset  might then be recorded by another independent party in a registry to track its  sale and ownership. Multiple registries operate in the United States to help  market participants track the ownership and retirement of offsets, although  not all offsets are listed on registries.", "A wide variety of consumers buy offsets, including individuals, businesses,  nonprofits, governments, research institutions, universities, religious  congregations, utilities, and other organizations.

Consumers may purchase offsets to compensate  for emissions that result from a variety of activities including flying,  driving, and purchasing consumer products.", "Offsets sell on the market at a wide range of prices. In 2007, prices on the  global voluntary market ranged from $1.83 per ton to about $306 per ton,  with an average of about $6 per ton, according to one recent market  study. We purchased offsets from 33 retail providers, both domestic and  international, and prices ranged from about $5 per ton to about $31 per  ton. CCX prices were at their lowest in 2004, at $0.79 per ton, but recently  peaked at $7.40 per ton in June 2008.", "There are also different types of carbon offset transactions, including  direct purchase and payment or donation in support of a service. The  difference between these transactions is whether the offsets are sold as a  commodity. In a direct purchase, consumers pay for the delivery of offsets  as a commoditized economic good. Direct purchases may allow the  consumer to evaluate the parameters of the offset project, including how  verification and monitoring methodologies were employed to create the  offset. When the transaction does not involve the exchange of a  commodity, consumers pay or donate money to a provider to support the  retirement of offsets or the development of new offset projects, but the  consumer does not own an asset after the transaction has been completed.  In this case, the payment or donation amounts to a promise by the  provider to supply the service of purchasing offsets or supporting offset  projects. Donations may be tax deductible, effectively reducing the cost of  the carbon offset.", "Another key distinction involves the timing of an offset\u2019s creation. In cases  where offsets are sold before they are produced, the quantity of offsets  generated from projects can be calculated using what is known as ex-ante  (or future value) accounting. On the other hand, when offsets are sold  after they are produced, the quantity of offsets can be calculated using ex- post accounting.

This is because most  greenhouse gases, including methane, have greater heat-trapping ability  relative to carbon dioxide. Thus, the global warming potential of these  greenhouse gases influences the volume of offsets generated.

The Carbon Capital Fund donations are invested in Forest Service  reforestation projects to sequester carbon. According to the Forest  Service, donations to the Carbon Capital Fund will be used to replant  areas on national forests that have been damaged by wildfire and other  natural disturbances and to demonstrate the role of forest carbon  sequestration in addressing climate change. The Forest Service manages  the reforestation projects and also selects the project sites by using a  forest vegetation simulation model to estimate the amount of carbon that  will be sequestered by prospective projects.

(See app. V for more  information about stakeholders\u2019 ratings of characteristics of offset  credibility and market challenges.)", "According to most stakeholders and key studies, additionality is  fundamental to the credibility of offsets because only offsets that are  additional to business-as-usual activities result in new environmental  benefits. However, certain stakeholders said that additionality is not a  critical factor at this early stage in the development of carbon markets and  that the key goal should be to keep transaction costs and barriers to entry  low to create financial incentives for reducing emissions. Several  stakeholders said that there is no correct technique for determining  additionality because it requires comparison of expected reductions  against a projected business-as-usual emissions baseline (also referred to  as a counterfactual scenario). Determining additionality is inherently  uncertain because, it may not be possible to know what would have  happened in the future had the projects not been undertaken.", "Stakeholders offered different definitions for additionality and preferred  different methods for determining whether projects are additional. For  example, some stakeholders said that additionality should be evaluated on  a case-by-case examination of the unique circumstances of each project,  while other stakeholders preferred evaluating projects against efficiency  standards for a technology or sector, known as a performance benchmark  approach. There are many other ways to determine whether projects are  additional, and many stakeholders said that applying a single test is too  simplistic because every project is different from others and operates  under different circumstances. See table 2 for descriptions of selected  additionality tests.", "Stakeholders also identified the existence of many different verification  and monitoring methods as a key challenge to ensuring the credibility of  offsets. There are many standards for measuring, verifying, monitoring,  and tracking the distribution of carbon offsets but few standards, if any,  that cover the entire supply chain. The proliferation of standards has  caused confusion in the market, and the existence of multiple quality  assurance mechanisms with different requirements raises questions about  the quality of offsets available on the voluntary market, according to many  stakeholders.", "The lack of standardization in the U.S. market may also make it difficult  for consumers to determine whether offsets are fully fungible\u2014 interchangeable and of comparable quality\u2014a characteristic of an efficient  commodity market. The term \u201ccarbon offset\u201d implies a uniform  commodity, but offsets may originate from a wide variety of project types  based on different quantification and quality assurance mechanisms.  Because offsets are not all the same, it may be difficult for consumers to  understand what they purchase. In addition, several stakeholders said that  a standardized offset registration process would foster transparency and  prevent double-counting. Because there is no single registry and because  of a lack of communication among existing registries, it is difficult for  consumers to determine the quality of the offsets they purchase.", "Certain stakeholders said that a single standard would bring greater  credibility to the voluntary carbon offset market and result in projects that  meet more stringent protocols. However, some stakeholders said that they  did not expect that a single standard would emerge because of the wide  variety and complexity of offset projects. Further, several stakeholders  said that a single standard may not be desirable because it could stifle  innovation and limit access to the market. Certain stakeholders said that  the flexibility offered by multiple standards encourages the testing of new  methodologies and emissions reduction technologies.", "While the concept of carbon offsets rests on the notion that a ton of  carbon reduced, avoided, or sequestered is the same regardless of the  activity that generated the offset, some stakeholders believe that certain  types of projects are more credible than others. Specifically, the  stakeholders identified methane capture and fuel-switching projects as the  most credible, and renewable energy certificates (REC) and agricultural  and rangeland soil carbon sequestration as less credible. Some  stakeholders also pointed out that projects that use future value  accounting practices to calculate offsets may be less credible. However,  certain stakeholders said that this does not mean such projects should be  categorically excluded from the offset market, only that they may require  more rigorous quality assurance. Approximately one-third of the  respondents said that credibility varies depending upon circumstances  specific to the project. See table 5 in appendix V for more details about  stakeholders\u2019 rating of the credibility of different types of carbon offset  projects.", "The stakeholders\u2019 views on the credibility of different project types may  stem from the fact that methane and fuel-switching projects are relatively  simple to measure and verify, while RECs, forestry, and agricultural and  rangeland soil carbon projects face challenges related to additionality,  measurement, and permanence. According to several stakeholders, RECs  and carbon offsets are not comparable environmental commodities and  differ in their objectives, the actions they represent, and the standards by  which they are defined. RECs certify that a certain quantity of electricity  has been generated from a qualifying type of renewable generation  technology, whereas carbon offsets represent an amount of carbon  reduced in comparison with a projected business-as-usual emissions  baseline. RECs may be bought and sold to satisfy state-level requirements  to produce electricity from renewable sources\u2014known as renewable  portfolio standards\u2014and also in the voluntary carbon offset market. The  carbon benefits of RECs may be double-counted if sold in both markets,  according to some stakeholders. With respect to agricultural and  rangeland sequestration and forestry, certain stakeholders said it is  difficult to accurately measure emissions reductions from these types of  projects. In addition, forestry offset projects may not be permanent  because disturbances such as insect outbreaks and fire can return stored  carbon to the atmosphere.", "Projects using future value accounting practices to calculate offsets may  also be less credible than those that do not, according to some  stakeholders. Ensuring the credibility of offsets purchased before they are  produced inherently involves a higher degree of uncertainty than  purchasing an offset that has already been generated. Some stakeholders  told us that future value accounting practices expose consumers to more  risk that the offsets will not materialize because it is more difficult to  verify and monitor such projects over time.

A second option would  involve the federal government providing incentives or developing  voluntary programs to encourage participants to take certain actions.  Other options include prohibiting certain types of projects that are  considered less credible and applying discounts or imposing insurance  requirements on certain types of offsets with greater uncertainty or  potential for failure. As an example of government oversight in the  voluntary offset market, several stakeholders mentioned the United  Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA)  framework for the Code of Best Practice for Carbon Offsetting. The code  is designed to increase consumer confidence in the integrity of carbon  offsets available for purchase in the United Kingdom. Offset products  meeting the requirements of the code will be assigned a certification mark  that providers may use for marketing purposes. The code initially covers  only Certified Emissions Reductions that are compliant with the Kyoto  Protocol, but voluntary emissions reductions could be included in the  code in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Offsets Could Lower the Cost of Future Mitigation Policies but Increase Uncertainty about Achieving Emissions Reductions", "paragraphs": ["Allowing offsets in a future compliance scheme could decrease the overall  compliance costs because it could provide regulated entities with a wider  variety of compliance options. In many cases, regulated entities may find it  economically advantageous to buy offsets instead of reducing emissions  themselves. Recent EPA analyses state that the cost of compliance with  mitigation policies under consideration by the Congress decreases  substantially as the use of offsets increases. Specifically, the agency\u2019s  recent analysis of the Climate Security Act of 2008 (S. 2191) reported that  if the use of domestic and international offsets is unlimited, then  compliance costs fall by an estimated 71 percent compared to the bill as  written. Alternatively, the price increases by an estimated 93 percent  compared to the bill as written if no offsets are allowed. A 2007 EPA study  analyzing the economic impacts of the Climate Stewardship and  Innovation Act of 2007 (S. 280) found similar results. Other quantitative  studies by economists also show that the use of offsets will decrease the  cost of achieving emissions reductions. In general, the carbon price is  lower in quantitative models of a U.S. compliance system when domestic  and international offsets are widely available and their use is  unrestricted. Using offsets in a compliance scheme could also increase  the administrative costs of the scheme because of increased government  oversight of quality assurance mechanisms used to ensure the credibility  of offsets.", "A lower carbon price due to the availability of offsets as a compliance tool  may have several effects, according to available economic literature. In the  short term, lower prices make compliance with a policy to reduce  emissions less expensive. Lower prices may also facilitate agreements to  limit emissions and enhance their environmental integrity by reducing the  incentive for regulated sources to either cheat on the agreement or shift  production to areas where carbon emissions are not regulated. Including  offsets in compliance schemes could also encourage investment and  innovation in unregulated sectors of the economy, possibly at the expense  of investment and innovation in regulated sectors. According to several  stakeholders and available economic literature, a market for offsets may  support climate-related innovation in sectors that supply offsets. For  example, unregulated facilities may devise new ways to limit greenhouse  gas emissions because they could sell offsets in the compliance market.", "The availability of offsets in a compliance scheme could also provide time  for regulated facilities to develop new technologies and processes. Some  stakeholders said that access to offsets provides more flexibility in  meeting short-term requirements, leaving more time to implement long- term plans for internal emissions reductions and technology development.  Further, according to certain stakeholders, offsets may allow regulated  sources to continue using assets such as power plants until the end of  their useful lives, thereby reducing their premature retirement and the cost  of emissions reductions overall. In addition, multiple stakeholders said  that offsets may allow covered sources to avoid investing in long-lived  assets that achieve only marginal improvements, instead focusing on more  effective assets that take longer to develop.", "On the other hand, allowing the use of offsets could compromise the  environmental integrity of a compliance system if nonadditional offsets  are used as compliance tools. Certain stakeholders said that because  offset programs increase the total quantity of compliance instruments  available to regulated sources, the integrity of the system can be  maintained only if offsets are additional. If a significant number of  nonadditional offsets enter the market, emissions may rise beyond levels  intended by the scheme, according to some stakeholders. Nonadditional  offsets could thus increase uncertainty about achieving emissions  reduction goals. This concern underscores the importance of using quality  assurance mechanisms to ensure the credibility of any offsets allowed into  a compliance scheme. In addition, these concerns could be minimized by  limiting the use of offsets or including policy options for enhancing  oversight of the market such as applying discounts or imposing insurance  requirements on offsets with greater uncertainty or potential for failure.", "The available economic literature supports some of the environmental  integrity concerns raised by stakeholders. Economic analyses of offsets  acknowledge difficulties with their use, including baseline determination,  additionality, permanence, double-counting, and verification and  monitoring. If these criteria are more likely to be satisfied by internal  reductions from regulated sources than by offsets, the use of offsets may  result in greater emissions, according to these sources. Economists have  also identified \u201cleakage\u201d as a potential problem for offsets, especially  those created on a project-by-project basis. Leakage occurs when  economic activity is shifted as a result of emission control regulation.  Consequently, emissions abatement achieved in one location that is  subject to emission control regulation is diminished by increased  emissions in unregulated locations. For an offset project, leakage occurs  when economic activity is shifted from the site of the offset project to  another location or sector where emissions are not controlled. For  example, an offset project that restricts timber harvesting at a specific site  may boost logging at an alternative location, thus reducing the  effectiveness of the offset project. Forestry projects are thought to be  particularly vulnerable to these challenges, as are credits originating in  developing countries, even though these offsets have been identified as  sources of significant cost savings to compliance regimes in developed  countries.", "Multiple stakeholders also said that including offsets in a compliance  scheme could slow investment in certain emissions reduction technologies  in regulated sectors and lessen the motivation of market participants to  reduce their own emissions. According to some stakeholders, if more cost- effective offsets are available as compliance tools, regulated sources may  delay making investments to reduce emissions internally, an outcome that  could ultimately slow the development of, and transition to, a less carbon- intensive economy. For example, a senior representative of the Council on  Environmental Quality said that there is a trade-off between short-term  focus on the marginal cost of reductions and long-term investment in  technology. This representative said that offsets may be a cheaper way to  reduce emissions today, but that investment in technology, not offsets,  builds emissions reductions into the economy for the long term. Other  stakeholders and the available economic literature raise similar concerns.  According to the literature, a market for offsets may support innovation in  sectors that supply offsets at the expense of investment in technology to  reduce emissions from regulated sources. Furthermore, certain  stakeholders said that it may be more difficult for regulators to mandate  the amount and timing of emissions reductions in specific economic  sectors if offsets are part of a compliance scheme.", "Certain stakeholders suggested imposing limits on the use of offsets in a  compliance scheme to address some of these challenges, but stakeholders  held different opinions about the potential effectiveness of this approach.  Some said it may be necessary to place restrictions on the use of offsets in  order to achieve internal emissions reductions from regulated sources. If  all the effort to reduce emissions is in the form of offsets, then the  compliance system may not provide the price signals necessary for long- term investment in technology at domestic industrial facilities and power  plants, according to multiple stakeholders. They said that domestic  abatement is central to achieving the long-term goal of any emissions  reduction system. However, other stakeholders said that incorporating  offsets into a compliance scheme will enable greater overall climate  benefits to be achieved at a lower cost, as long as offsets are additional  and are not double-counted.", "Existing international programs to limit greenhouse gas emissions that  allow the use of offsets for compliance may provide insights into trade-offs  between cost and credibility. For example, the European Union\u2019s program  to limit greenhouse gas emissions enables regulated entities to use certain  types of offsets for compliance.

First, while most markets involve tangible goods  or services, the carbon market involves a product that represents the absence  of something\u2014in this case, an offset equals the absence of one ton of carbon  dioxide emissions. Second, ensuring the credibility of carbon offsets poses  challenges because of the inherent uncertainty in measuring emissions  reductions or sequestration relative to a projected business-as-usual scenario.  Any measurement involving projections is inherently uncertain. These  challenges are compounded by the fact that project developers produce  offsets from a variety of activities\u2014such as sequestration in agricultural soil,  and forestry projects, and methane capture\u2014and do not use a single set of  commonly accepted quality assurance mechanisms. Third, many transactions  do not involve a central trading platform, exchange, or registry system.

According to the CAO, using strategies one and two, the House would  need to offset 24,000 short tons of carbon dioxide emissions to operate in  a carbon neutral manner.", "The CAO recommended purchasing carbon offsets through the Chicago  Climate Exchange (CCX), a voluntary greenhouse gas reduction and  trading system through which members make commitments to decrease  their emissions. If CCX members reduce emissions beyond their reduction  goals, they may sell the extra reductions to other members of the  exchange. In addition to emitting members, the CCX platform is also  available to offset providers, who may register tons on CCX that represent  greenhouse gas mitigation projects. To meet their commitments, CCX  members may trade emissions reductions or offsets known as Carbon  Financial Instruments (CFI). According to CCX, to verify the validity of  offsets offered for sale on the exchange, and ensure that the underlying  offset projects conform to CCX rules, all tons registered for sale on the  CCX platform from offset projects must have been verified by CCX- approved outside verifier firms that are specialized in particular fields. The  outside verification firms are to ensure that the projects are in accordance  with CCX eligibility rules and methodologies, verify that projects have  been implemented, conduct on-site inspections, and send verification  reports to CCX. CCX staff and, in certain cases, the CCX Offsets  Committee, review the verification reports and request corrective actions,  if necessary. After completion of any corrective actions, CCX sends the  verification reports to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  (FINRA) for a final review to ensure project verification documentation is  complete. Uniquely serialized Carbon Financial Instruments based on  these offsets are then issued to the project owner\u2019s CCX registry account,  and may then be sold in the CCX market. The market participants\u2019 registry  accounts help the market participant track purchases and sales of offsets  acquired or sold on the exchange that can be used to identify specific  information about the offset projects, including verification documents.  According to CCX, all participants have the option of buying CFIs  anonymously and all transaction prices must be reported so that CCX can  post prices on its trading platform.", "The House Appropriations Committee, in its June 19, 2007, report on the  2008 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill, stated: \u201cThe Committee  believes it is important to offset greenhouse gases generated by the House.  In that regard, the Committee requests the Chief Administrative Officer  purchase Carbon Financial Instruments to offset carbon produced by all  House operations. These offsets should be fully transparent, verified,  American, project-based offset credits.\u201d The CAO requested and received  approval from the Committee on House Administration on August 29,  2007, to purchase offsets and submit an application to CCX with the  necessary fee. According to CAO officials, CCX was the best option for the  House because it is well established relative to the rest of the industry, has  clear verification and monitoring standards, and allows for the anonymous  purchase of offsets. The CAO requested that CCX conduct a blind auction  because the CAO did not want to decide or know which projects were  selected. According to the CAO, this approach was adopted to eliminate  any opportunity for House funds to be used to benefit one geographical  region or congressional district over another. For example, the CAO  decided not to purchase offsets on the retail market from domestic  nonprofit groups because a decision to select specific vendors or offset  projects in one location instead of another could be construed as a  political act. On October 23, 2007, CCX made a public announcement to  potential sell-side market participants that it would hold the reverse  auction on behalf of the House of Representatives and stipulated that the  projects sought had to be verified and approved CCX projects undertaken  in the United States. The auction closed on November 1, resulting in the  purchase of 30,000 metric tons for a total of $90,550 including transaction  fees. Results of the auction were announced at a public ceremony on  November 5, 2007.", "The CAO bought offsets before implementing the emissions reduction  strategies specified in the Green the Capitol Initiative. Based on  calculations performed for the Green the Capitol Initiative report by the  Department of Energy and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory,  the carbon footprint of the House is approximately 91,000 short tons.  According to the CAO, until the Architect of the Capitol\u2019s metering  program is complete, in March 2009, House emissions data are based on  historical estimates. To reach the goal of carbon neutrality, the Green the  Capitol Initiative called for two emissions reduction strategies and the  purchase of carbon offsets to compensate for whatever emissions  remained. Purchasing electricity generated from renewable sources would  decrease emissions to 34,000 short tons. Switching from burning coal, oil,  and natural gas at the Capitol power plant to burning only natural gas  would further decrease emissions to 24,000 short tons. The third strategy  to reach the goal of carbon neutrality was to purchase offsets for the  remaining carbon emissions\u201424,000 short tons. However, the first two  strategies had not been completed when the CAO purchased offsets  through CCX in November 2007. Concerning the first two strategies, the  Architect of the Capitol purchased renewable energy in June 2008, and the  CAO, in written comments, told us that the Architect of the Capitol had  purchased natural gas to account for the House\u2019s portion of energy used at  the Capitol Power Plant. According to the CAO, there was no benefit to  waiting to purchase offsets.", "The CAO used data from 2006 that GAO developed as part of a broader  characterization of greenhouse gas emissions from legislative branch  agencies and later analyzed by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to  identify the amount of offsets the CAO would purchase to reach its goal of  carbon neutrality by the end of 2008. The CAO stated that it does not have  current emissions data and that the Architect of the Capitol does not have  meters that enable it to directly monitor its energy use or emissions in real  time. According to the CAO, emissions data projected from a 2006 baseline  provide a reasonable estimate of current emissions.", "In November 2007, the CAO purchased 30,000 metric tons of offsets  through CCX, which is more than the 24,000 short tons identified in the  Green the Capitol Initiative report and a memorandum approving the  CAO\u2019s Chicago Climate Exchange application, which was signed by the  Committee on House Administration in August 2007. The CAO purchased  approximately 9,075 short tons (about 8,231 metric tons), more than  identified in the Green the Capitol Initiative, an amount valued at about  $24,447 based on the weighted average purchase price of $2.97 per metric  ton paid by the CAO. According to the House CAO and CCX, the purchase  of additional tons was an administrative error that resulted from the  difference between short and metric tons and reference to the draft report  rather than the final report. An April 2007 draft of the Green the Capitol  Initiative report identified the need to purchase 34,000 tons, but the June  2007 final report identified the need to purchase 24,000 short tons. On  March 27, 2008, the CAO requested that CCX retire 24,000 of the 30,000  metric tons. Currently, 6,000 metric tons remain in the CAO\u2019s registry  account, which, according to the CAO, may be used to offset additional  emissions generated by the operation of the House. The CAO said that the  initial purchase of carbon offsets was an approximation and plans to  reconcile the purchase in fiscal year 2009.", "Because it retired 24,000 metric tons instead of short tons, the CAO retired  about 2,460 short tons (about 2,231 metric tons) more than identified in  the Green the Capitol Initiative report. These extra tons are valued at  about $6,626 based on the CAO\u2019s purchase price. According to the CAO,  the retirement of extra tons may address uncertainties in the emissions  calculations used to determine the amount of offsets to purchase.", "Following the auction, the CAO received information from CCX about the  number and types of projects underlying its purchase. No other  information was provided by CCX or requested by the CAO. The offsets  purchased by the CAO came from a variety of project types, including  agricultural methane, agricultural soil sequestration, coal mine methane,  landfill methane, and renewable energy. The CCX auction notice required  that offsets submitted to the auction originate from U.S.-based projects,  and CCX officials said that they screened the registry accounts of auction  participants to confirm that the sellers\u2019 offsets were from U.S.-based  projects. Registry accounts maintained by CCX for market participants  track the type of information necessary to satisfy the criteria directed by  the appropriations committee report. Thus, the CAO could verify that the  offsets met the criteria, if necessary. The CAO can also request that CCX  provide additional quality assurance documentation, including detailed  verification reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Summary of Stakeholder Responses to Interview Questions", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Summaries of Selected International, Regional, and State Programs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "California Global Warming Solutions Act (Assembly Bill 32)", "paragraphs": ["On September 27, 2006, the California Global Warming Solutions Act was signed into  law.

On August 15, 2006, the participating states issued a model rule that details  the proposed RGGI program. Offset projects included in the program are initially limited  to five types of projects, including landfill methane capture and sequestration, because  these types occur within the borders of the RGGI states, among other factors. The  model rule specifies offset project requirements including criteria for additionality,  quantification and verification of emissions reductions, independent verification, and  accreditation standards for independent verifiers. Each source required to reduce  emissions would generally be able to use offsets to comply with up to 3.3 percent of its  obligation in a single compliance period. If the compliance price hits certain levels, the  use of offsets may increase to 5 or 10 percent of required reductions. The first 3-year  compliance period will begin January 1, 2009.
