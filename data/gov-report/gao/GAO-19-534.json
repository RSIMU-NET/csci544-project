However, CBP does not have complete information on infrastructure conditions at all land border crossings. Specifically, CBP assessed facility conditions at four of the 40 land border crossings it owns from 2016 through 2018. Further, CBP has not developed a plan to ensure it conducts such assessments, consistent with DHS policy which calls for them every three years. Developing and implementing a plan to ensure CBP executes its facility condition assessment program would enable CBP to collect more complete and current infrastructure information. In addition, while CBP and the General Services Administration (GSA) both assess facility conditions at 101 GSA-owned land border crossings, they do not consistently share or use each other's information. Doing so could enable CBP and GSA to improve the accuracy and completeness of their respective assessments.", "CBP prioritizes land border crossing capital projects in a five-year plan, which by statute is to be submitted with DHS's annual budget request to Congress. In fiscal years 2014 through 2018, CBP submitted two plans on time, submitted two plans more than 100 days after submission of the budget request, and did not submit a plan in one year due to delays in the plan's review and approval process. By establishing timeframes for the review process, CBP would be better positioned to identify and address sources of delay in the review process, and improve its ability to meet statutory reporting requirements by including its five-year plan with its annual budget submission to Congress.", "The 10 completed or ongoing GSA land border crossing capital projects in fiscal years 2014 through 2018 generally experienced schedule growth ranging from 0 to 59 percent, but stayed within a 10 percent cost contingency allowance.

Land border crossings vary across the northern and southern border, but  are generally designed to process some combination of pedestrian,  passenger vehicle, and commercial traffic with separate facilities for each  mode. Infrastructure and layout at each land border crossing may vary  depending on a variety of factors including the modes of traffic CBP  processes at that location, traffic volume, local climate, and area-specific  threats, among others. Many large land border crossings, including GSA\u2019s  Otay Mesa land border crossing in California, are designed to process  pedestrians, passenger vehicles, and commercial traffic and are equipped  with distinct infrastructure for each mode of traffic. Other land border  crossings are designed to process a single mode of traffic, such as San  Luis II in Arizona, which processes only commercial trucks. In general,  CBP\u2019s inspection process at land border crossings follows a standard  sequence that includes separate areas designated for preprimary  inspection, primary inspection, and secondary inspection for each mode  of traffic and a main building which houses administrative and operational  support activities, which we describe below.", "Preprimary inspection: Upon proceeding to cross the border into the  United States, pedestrians and vehicles enter the land border crossing  and are directed to preprimary inspection, where initial screening takes  place. Depending on availability, CBP may deploy officers with canines to  walk among the vehicles in preprimary waiting to reach an inspection  booth. Overhead signage may be present to help CBP actively manage  traffic by directing travelers to different lanes according to the type of  travel documents they have. For example, CBP may use signs to  designate specific lanes for travelers with Radio Frequency Identification  (RFID) or other machine readable documents (\u201cReady lanes\u201d) or for  trusted travelers. Infrastructure in the pedestrian preprimary area often  includes a space for travelers to queue prior to entering primary  inspection. Infrastructure in the preprimary area for passenger vehicle  and commercial traffic includes lanes for traffic to queue and radiation  portal monitors that are designed to detect radiation and help prevent the  smuggling of nuclear material into the United States. The passenger  vehicle preprimary area also often includes screening technologies,  including license plate readers and RFID readers to capture information  on vehicles and RFID-ready travel documents such as passport cards  and border crossing cards. At some land border crossings, CBP may  use RFID readers in the commercial preprimary inspection area to  electronically transmit identification, manifest, and other information to  CBP officers prior to entering primary inspection. See figure 1 for  examples of preprimary infrastructure.", "Primary inspection: After preprimary inspection, pedestrians enter the  primary inspection area, typically located within the main building.  Infrastructure for pedestrian primary inspection may include one or more  lanes and officer booths where CBP officers review traveler information.  Passenger vehicles and commercial traffic enter a primary inspection  area where CBP officers verify passenger identification and perform an  initial inspection of the vehicle, which may include a visual inspection of  vehicles\u2019 exterior and interior. Infrastructure supporting vehicular primary  inspection includes one or more lanes and officer booths. Each booth  may be equipped with an HVAC system to keep dangerous vehicle  emissions and other fumes from entering the workspace and maintain a  safe work environment during extreme heat and cold. Primary inspection  booths are designed to be bullet and blast resistant to ensure officer  safety. See figure 2 for examples of primary inspection infrastructure.", "Secondary inspection: If a pedestrian, driver, passenger or vehicle  gives reason for suspicion or if the CBP officer is unable to complete the  inspection at primary inspection for any reason, the officer may refer them  to secondary inspection. Infrastructure in the pedestrian secondary  inspection area is typically located within the main building and may  include a processing area and a separate secure room where CBP  officers can perform more thorough inspections for travelers suspected of  criminal activity. Infrastructure in the passenger vehicle secondary  inspection area may include work areas where CBP officers can search  vehicles, vehicle lifts, and non-intrusive inspection x-ray technologies to  identify contraband hidden in concealed compartments. Passengers may  wait in the pedestrian secondary inspection area while CBP officers  inspect vehicles. Infrastructure in the commercial secondary inspection  area may include a loading dock where CBP officers can manually  examine cargo and use x-ray technologies to identify hidden contraband.

According to CBP officials, FCAs older than three  years may not accurately reflect the current condition of infrastructure at  land border crossings. According to OFAM officials, they have not  developed a plan to ensure that CBP implements its program consistent  with the Directive by conducting FCAs on a three-year cycle going  forward due to limited resources to conduct the assessments.  Specifically, CBP officials stated that CBP has not been able to fully fund  the FCA program due to other competing facility priorities. However,  developing a plan that accounts for the new requirements under the  Directive could assist CBP in planning funding needs for the FCA  program. Further, developing and implementing a plan to ensure CBP  executes its FCA program consistent with Directive 119-02-004 would  assist CBP in making resource decisions for this program.

Among  other functions, CBP uses TRIRIGA to track infrastructure needs and the  condition of facilities at land border crossings. CBP identifies  infrastructure needs through FCAs and records these data in TRIRIGA.  CBP also identifies additional infrastructure needs as they arise and  records these data in TRIRIGA. For example, an infrastructure need may  arise at a building and be recorded in TRIRIGA in the months following a  CBP FCA. CBP uses TRIRIGA data to calculate a score reflecting the  overall current condition of infrastructure at a land border crossing. CBP  uses this score on condition to inform internal planning and prioritization  of maintenance and repair projects at the local level, according to CBP  officials. In addition, CBP\u2019s goals for facility condition data in TRIRIGA  include making facility condition information available in real time, starting  with TRIRIGA for responses to data calls and reporting, and using data in  the system for more efficient planning and decision making. However,  according to CBP officials, land border crossing facility condition data in  TRIRIGA have not been consistently reliable because some data on  infrastructure needs are duplicative, out of date, or incomplete.", "Duplicate Data: CBP officials stated that in the past, OFAM officials  responsible for entering infrastructure needs into TRIRIGA created  duplicate entries in some instances. For example, OFAM officials  have identified, and entered into TRIRIGA, infrastructure needs at  land border crossings that had already been identified and entered in  the past. As a result, TRIRIGA double-counted the costs associated  with these duplicate infrastructure needs which impacted the reliability  of the calculation of the score on facility condition for the associated  land border crossing. According to OFAM officials, they have taken  several steps to improve the TRIRIGA data entry processes. During  the course of our review, OFAM officials identified internal confusion  regarding who had the authority to remove infrastructure needs from  TRIRIGA. In response, in April 2019 OFAM developed new guidelines  clarifying roles and responsibilities for accurately entering FCA data  and removing infrastructure needs from TRIRIGA. OFAM officials  stated they expect this process to avoid duplicative data entry in the  future. Further, as described earlier, by conducting FCAs for each  CBP-owned land border crossing every three years, updating them  annually consistent with DHS Directive 119-02-004, and then entering  the results into TRIRIGA in accordance with the new guidelines for  reviewing existing infrastructure needs and removing them as needed,  CBP would be positioned to more frequently review and validate these  data in the system on an ongoing basis.", "Out of Date Data: Officials stated that FCA data for some land border  crossings in TRIRIGA originate from as early as 2013, the last time  CBP conducted an FCA at those border crossings. As a result,  TRIRIGA does not accurately reflect the current condition of these  facilities. Historically, CBP has updated TRIRIGA with facility condition  information collected through FCAs. As described earlier, DHS  Directive 119-02-004 directs CBP to conduct FCAs for each CBP- owned land border crossings every three years and update them  annually. By developing and implementing a plan to complete more  timely FCAs at CBP-owned land border crossings, CBP will be better  positioned to ensure that TRIRIGA is updated to reflect more current  condition information.

CBP  officials said that while they do identify infrastructure needs at GSA- owned land border crossings and enter related information into  TRIRIGA, the information on these needs can be incomplete. CBP  officials stated that for example, a past CBP FCA may have identified  a building roof in need of repair. Following the FCA, CBP would then  enter a record of this infrastructure need in TRIRIGA. If GSA repaired  the roof during the following year as part of its planned maintenance  work, but did not inform CBP headquarters, TRIRIGA would continue  to identify a deficient roof at the land border crossing after GSA  repaired it. CBP officials stated that GSA may conduct maintenance  or repair work to address an infrastructure need without CBP\u2019s  knowledge because CBP and GSA did not have a process for GSA to  notify CBP of maintenance and repair work the agency conducts at  land border crossings. According to OFAM officials, GSA began  sharing with OFAM monthly summary-level data on maintenance GSA  performs at land border crossings. However, these data do not  include the level of detail required to update condition data or close  out deficiencies in TRIRIGA.

As a result, CBP would have access to more complete  and accurate data to use when planning and prioritizing infrastructure  maintenance activities, improving the availability of real-time facility  condition information, and responding to data calls and reporting. For  example, more complete and accurate data in TRIRIGA would better  position CBP to identify and report to Congress on improvements  needed at land ports of entry. Specifically, the 2018 United States  Ports of Entry Threat and Operational Review Act requires CBP to  submit to Congress a threat and operational analysis that includes,  among other elements, an assessment of current and potential threats  due to security vulnerabilities and unlawful entry, and improvements  needed at ports of entry to enhance travel and trade facilitation and  reduce wait times.

These  steps are applicable to the entire land border crossing portfolio\u2014 regardless of ownership\u2014and include:  1.  Strategic Resource Assessment (SRA): According to the five-year  plan, CBP conducts SRAs cyclically to compare infrastructure  requirements across its portfolio and present a uniform picture of  capital investment needs at all land border crossings along the  northern and southern borders.  2.  Capital Project Scoring: Using data generated during the SRA, CBP  scores and ranks each land border crossing by criticality and relative  urgency of infrastructure needs.  3.  Sensitivity Analysis: CBP then applies a sensitivity analysis and  updates its initial ranking based on factors unaccounted for through  the SRA, including unique regional conditions, bilateral planning with  partners in Canada and Mexico, or interests of other federal, state, or  local agencies.  4.  Assess Feasibility and Risk: CBP coordinates with project  stakeholders\u2014including GSA for all GSA-owned land border  crossings\u2014to evaluate the feasibility, risk, and cost associated with  project implementation by completing a feasibility study. These  studies analyze alternatives and review environmental, cultural, and  historic preservation requirements as well as land acquisition  requirements and procurement risks. CBP also assesses the  likelihood of obtaining funding for the proposed project.  5.  Establish a Five-year Capital Investment Plan: After the SRA and  the scoring, analysis, and assessment phases, CBP prioritizes land  border crossing capital projects and develops a five-year capital  investment plan in coordination with GSA. CBP updates the plan  annually, taking into account the changing conditions at land border  crossings.", "Although CBP has outlined the five broad steps it uses to prioritize  projects, our analysis of CBP\u2019s five-year plans for fiscal years 2014  through 2018 identified that CBP did not follow a consistent methodology  across the years or across projects when prioritizing prospective land  border crossing projects. For example, in some five-year plans CBP  prioritized projects by comparing relative need at land border crossings  using more recent SRA data for some land border crossings and older  data for other land border crossings. In one such instance in fiscal year  2018, CBP compared relative need using 2015 data for some land border  crossings and data dating as far back as 2007 for other land border  crossings. Although CBP\u2019s five-year plan states that CBP performs SRAs  cyclically, CBP has not established the frequency at which SRAs are to  be completed.

Specifically, our analysis identified  that CBP had feasibility studies for approximately two thirds (28 of 41) of  the projects it prioritized over these years. CBP officials told us that due to  the limited shelf-life of feasibility studies (two to three years), CBP and  GSA target high-priority land border crossing projects for feasibility  studies that are likely to receive funding within the next two to three years.  However, of the top five projects CBP ranked as the highest priority in  each of its five-year plans in fiscal years 2014 through 2018, CBP  completed feasibility studies for approximately half (12 of 20) of these  projects. Further, among the 12 projects CBP ranked in the top five in its  fiscal years 2014 through 2018 five-year plans that had feasibility studies,  10 of 12 projects had a feasibility study that was more than five years old  when CBP prioritized them.", "In addition, CBP prioritized projects on each of its five-year plans by  comparing cost estimates developed through different methodologies.  Specifically, CBP prioritized projects using detailed cost estimates  developed as part of a feasibility study for some projects and order of  magnitude cost estimates for projects that do not have a feasibility study  or that had an out-of-date feasibility study. These order of magnitude  cost estimates were significantly different from the cost estimates that  were later produced for these projects through feasibility studies. For  example, CBP\u2019s fiscal year 2015 plan included an order of magnitude  cost estimate of $95 million to implement a single project at two separate  crossings\u2014San Luis I and II.

However, there is not a  detailed planning methodology that would help ensure officials  consistently and appropriately develop and assess priority projects each  year. For example, the five-year plans do not define what minimum steps  CBP personnel are to take at each step in the process, such as guidance  and procedures on which projects require feasibility studies. The plans  also do not include time frames for completing each step, such as  establishing expectations for the frequency at which CBP personnel are  to update SRA data.

CBP officials  acknowledged that they have not issued formal guidance documenting  the steps in its prioritization process or establishing procedures and time  frames for each step, but stated that they plan to do so going forward.  Specifically, officials told us that CBP plans to document its process for  prioritizing land border crossing projects to improve transparency, better  educate staff on roles and responsibilities, and help ensure CBP  consistently applies this process each year.

GSA officials reported that funding lags between project  design and construction can increase costs and extend construction  timelines. GSA has requested separate appropriations for project design  and construction using a model known as design-bid-build, which created  the potential for funding lags to occur. According to CBP and GSA  officials, the process from requesting an infrastructure project to  completing the project lasts approximately 7 years. However, GSA  experienced funding lags of up to 10 years between design and  construction. Figure 16 identifies development timelines from initial  planning through construction for our 10 selected land border crossing  capital projects.", "The cost of labor and materials can escalate when funding lags occur  between design and construction. For example, after completing design  for the Calexico West project, GSA requested construction funding in  fiscal year 2010, but did not receive funding until five years later. As a  result, estimated construction costs escalated from $78.5 to $90.8 million  (16 percent). To keep project cost estimates up-to-date during funding  lags, GSA officials explained that GSA typically increases project cost  estimates over time to account for inflation, changes in the labor market,  and the cost of materials, among other factors. To help address cost  escalation, contractors have purchased materials upfront, and GSA has  combined projects that would otherwise be constructed separately. To  address increasing materials costs for the Alexandria Bay project, the  contractor purchased steel upfront in order to avoid future cost increases  due to import tariffs, according to GSA officials. The Laredo project faced  significant labor and material cost growth due to a boom in the Texas  construction market. As a result, GSA decided to combine the two Laredo  crossings into one contract to lock in prices and avoid paying higher  prices in the future.", "According to GSA officials, funding lags between design and construction  may result in outdated project designs that do not reflect newer CBP  infrastructure requirements. In such instances, GSA must invest  additional time and resources to update project designs and incorporate  new CBP requirements, such as newer inspection technologies or  facilities. According to GSA officials, design refreshes can be challenging  due to a lack of continuity and staff turnover at the architecture and  engineering firms that originally designed the project. In some instances,  according to GSA officials, the original firms may not be available or  interested in redesigning the project and GSA may need to hire a new  firm. For example, GSA spent $3.3 million on design for the Columbus  project in fiscal years 2007 and 2009. However, the funding lag between  design and construction required a $7.4 million design refresh in fiscal  year 2014. In another example, GSA established the Calexico West  project\u2019s design concept in fiscal year 2007, but didn\u2019t receive  construction funding until fiscal year 2015. According to officials, GSA had  to spend approximately $1 million for a design refresh to account for new  CBP requirements, which resulted in a longer development timeline.", "To address risks of funding lags with the design-bid-build approach, GSA  has shifted toward using contract vehicles for land border crossing capital  projects that combine design and construction into a single  appropriation. This approach allows for more precise planning, less risk  from delays, and less time for costs to escalate, according to GSA  officials.", "Project Phasing. According to GSA officials, OMB may request that GSA  and CBP divide large projects into separate phases when high-cost  projects are unlikely to be funded in a single appropriation. For example,  of the eight border crossing locations represented across the 10 projects  in our review, CBP and GSA broke three projects at three locations into  phases to obtain approval: Alexandria Bay, Calexico West, and San  Ysidro.", "However, for similar reasons as those related to funding lags between  design and construction, breaking up projects into smaller phases can  increase overall costs and add years to project timelines. According to  GSA and CBP officials, when appropriations do not align with project  schedules, contractors may leave the site after completing a single phase  to pursue new work opportunities. Additionally, by the time GSA receives  appropriations for latter phases, the contractor must remobilize equipment  and labor, costs of labor and material may have increased, and projects  may need design refreshes, as described above. For example, after  Calexico West phase II remained unfunded two years after phase I was  completed, GSA estimated that project costs increased by $27.7 million  due to increases in labor and materials and potential redesign work. In  another example, GSA officials told us that after originally designing the  Alexandria Bay project as a single-phase in 2010, OMB directed GSA to  break the project into two phases in 2014 to increase the likelihood of  funding. According to GSA officials, redesigning Alexandria Bay as a two- phase project added as much as $16.5 million to total project costs.  Construction costs escalated by about $58.4 million from the single-phase  estimate in fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2017 when phase I construction  began, an increase of 36 percent. Further, completing the Alexandria Bay  project in two phases added an additional three years to the project  timeline.", "While breaking projects into phases can potentially lead to higher costs,  GSA officials told us that doing so can be an effective way to start work  on a large capital project when funding for the entire project is not  available in a single year and can be cost effective when GSA receives  appropriations for each phase in line with its planned schedule."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Project Challenges During Construction", "paragraphs": ["GSA and CBP have reported facing challenges constructing land border  crossing projects, including those related to CBP-requested changes,  geographical and environmental factors, and inadequate or incomplete  infrastructure in neighboring countries.", "CBP Change Requests.

These requests range from installing new  information technology and security equipment to enhancing office,  holding facilities, or public-facing areas of the port. CBP change requests  are often necessary because the span between design and construction  can last up to 10 years, according to CBP and GSA officials. While CBP  typically pays for the cost of these modifications, GSA must incorporate  changes into existing project plans, which can result in schedule growth,  according to GSA officials. CBP-requested changes led to cost and/or  schedule growth at the Calexico West, Columbus, Derby Line, Nogales  West-Mariposa, and San Ysidro land border crossing projects, according  to GSA officials.

CBP officials said that at some  southern crossings concrete may crack when it dries too quickly due to  extreme heat, requiring contractors to pour concrete in the early morning  when temperatures are cooler. However, officials said that because this  work typically occurs outside of regular business hours, it often comes at  a premium and can increase project costs. Along the northern border,  contractors may not be able to do concrete work during the winter months  because temperatures can be too cold to pour concrete. At Derby Line,  because of delays earlier in construction, work extended into an  additional winter season, contributing to cost and schedule growth  because contractors were slowed or limited by weather, according to  GSA officials.", "Environmental conditions surrounding construction sites also led to  construction challenges, and in turn, cost and schedule growth. The area  surrounding the Columbus land border crossing is prone to severe  flooding, and major flood events have forced CBP to close the port  several times a year, according to GSA officials. Officials also said  flooding posed a potential risk of deteriorating port structures. After GSA  spent $3.3 million to develop the original design, it spent an additional  $7.4 million on a design refresh to incorporate flood protection and update  CBP requirements to prepare for construction. In another example, GSA  and the contractor discovered unstable soil conditions during the Tornillo- Guadalupe project that resulted in a two month delay and $1.3 million  cost increase (about 3 percent of the project budget) to mitigate.", "GSA officials told us they may also experience challenges accessing  labor, materials, and utilities for projects at remote land border crossings.  For example, Alexandria Bay\u2019s remote location created logistical  challenges for transporting concrete to the site. Because the land border  crossing is on an island and only accessible via toll bridge, the contractor  determined it was more cost effective to construct a temporary concrete  plant onsite. GSA officials also stated the labor market in Alexandria Bay  is limited\u2014due in part to its remoteness\u2014and that labor costs were high  because the contractor had to temporarily relocate its employees to the  area. In another example, officials reported challenges with transporting  construction materials to the Tornillo-Guadalupe site due to its remote  location, contributing to 2.5 months in schedule growth.", "Natural features and dense population centers surrounding land border  crossings can create challenges for contractors during construction. For  example, the Alexandria Bay project\u2014which will triple the crossing\u2019s  footprint when complete\u2014required contractors to blast massive rock  formations to create more room for facilities. GSA officials stated the rock  removal entailed significant coordination with CBP because GSA required  CBP to temporarily halt vehicle processing for safety reasons when  GSA\u2019s contractor was using dynamite. Officials also told us that snow  removal is a challenge at Alexandria Bay because there are limited  places to put plowed snow without impeding traffic and interrupting CBP  operations.", "Corresponding international infrastructure. Inadequate or incomplete  infrastructure in neighboring countries can lead to project delays. GSA  officials explained that because land border crossings on both sides of  the border need to connect, capital infrastructure projects in the United  States are largely dependent on the readiness of Mexican or Canadian  infrastructure. For example, GSA completed the Tornillo-Guadalupe  project in October 2014, but delayed opening cargo processing facilities  due to Mexico\u2019s delays in completing its new commercial facilities and  bridge system required for commercial traffic. As a result, CBP did not  begin processing inbound cargo at Tornillo-Guadalupe until March  2016\u201416 months after it began processing passenger vehicles.  Furthermore, after processing 277 trucks in 14 months, CBP suspended  commercial inspection operations in May 2017, citing low traffic volumes.  CBP officials said that commercial transporters were unwilling to use  underdeveloped Mexican infrastructure in the region, leading to low  commercial traffic volumes, and in turn, CBP\u2019s decision to suspend  commercial operations. Similarly, GSA had to delay work for 3 months on  the Calexico West project because Mexico was behind schedule on its  infrastructure project, according to GSA officials. To address this issue,  GSA slowed work in that area and Mexico accelerated its schedule so  that GSA and Mexico could complete their sections simultaneously."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["CBP is charged with facilitating billions of dollars in trade and travel at the  nation\u2019s border, while also preventing terrorists, criminals and other  inadmissible individuals from entering the country.

Although Tornillo-Guadeloupe has commercial  processing facilities, CBP ceased using these facilities in 2017 due to low  volumes of commercial traffic.", "CBP and General Services Administration (GSA) officials reported that the  original Fabens land border crossing was unable to process high traffic  volumes and that the existing bridge connecting the United States and  Mexico was no longer structurally sound enough to support commercial  crossings. CBP ceased all commercial operations at Fabens in 2001,  limiting CBP to pedestrian and passenger vehicle traffic processing. The  number of CBP personnel at the crossing exceeded facility capacity and  the limited space hindered CBP\u2019s ability to process, interview, isolate, and  detain travelers, according to CBP officials. Further, the existing septic  system was not designed for the number of employees at the facility and  the original water system was insufficient. CBP had to haul water on site to  operate its facilities and provide bottled water for its employees and the  public to drink, according to officials.", "CBP and GSA officials reported that the recent capital project delivered  new passenger vehicle and pedestrian inspection facilities along with a  new main building. The project also included a dedicated bus inspection  area and a parking lot for seized vehicles. Commercial facilities included a  new bridge and commercial building, 10 covered secondary inspection  docks, two primary inspection lanes with a canopy, a hazardous materials  containment area, agriculture lab, and seized narcotics storage. The  project also added an additional 109 acres of donated farmland to the  original crossing\u2019s 6 acre footprint. GSA completed the $73.5 million  construction project in October 2014, about 15 months later than planned  and 19 percent above its cost baseline. Unstable soil conditions and  contractor performance issues contributed to cost and schedule growth,  according to GSA. Delays associated with infrastructure in Mexico delayed  the start of cargo processing by 16 months. Despite investing in new  commercial processing facilities at the crossing, CBP suspended cargo  processing in May 2017 after 14 months, citing low traffic volumes due to  underdeveloped infrastructure in Mexico."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the General Services Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Michael Armes (Assistant  Director) Kirk Kiester (Assistant Director), Bruce Crise (Analyst in  Charge), Lilia Chaidez, Michele Fejfar, Eric Hauswirth, Susan Hsu, Daniel  Kuhn, Jeremy Manion, Mara McMillen, Marc Meyer, and Sasan J. \u201cJon\u201d  Najmi made significant contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilitates trade and travel at the nation\u2019s 167 land border crossings.
