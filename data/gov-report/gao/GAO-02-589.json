The Corps still  lacks an overall continuity of operations plan for the CEEIS, and plans for  its major processing centers were not yet developed or were incomplete  and did not meet federal guidance. Furthermore, the draft program plan to  establish a CEEIS continuity of operations plan did not identify the full set  of activities required for effective management of this program or establish  milestones and performance measures based on recognized federal  directives and best practices. The Corps thus lacks effective mechanisms  to track the CEEIS service continuity improvement efforts and ensure  establishment of integrated plans.", "In addition, new weaknesses indicated that the Corps had not effectively  managed this area of federal requirements across its functional units.  CEFMS obtained interim approval to operate under the Corps\u2019 system  certification and accreditation process, without detailing the central role of  CEEIS in CEFMS service continuity. The Corps\u2019 Office of Internal Review  found that at least 10 facilities that depend on CEEIS and CEFMS lacked  continuity plans for their operations, and 10 more had outdated plans.

The electronic signature  system consists of a smartcard, smartcard reader, cryptographic module,  and central database containing all system user IDs. The electronic  signature system was designed to provide assurance that a document  signed by an authorized person has not been altered. This assurance relies  on Corps policy, which assumes that the electronic signature smartcard has  only been used by the individual to whom it was issued.", "We previously reported that the Corps had not adequately used CEFMS  electronic signature capabilities to help ensure data integrity for certain  transactions.

One critical requirement in implementing the  electronic signature system was that each smartcard be under the sole  control of an individual smartcard holder. However, according to tests  performed by the Army Audit Agency at one Corps site, card sharing had  occurred. As a result, authentication controls were not effective to provide  reasonable assurance that users\u2019 electronic signatures are valid.  Consequently, the Corps cannot ensure that its electronic signature system  authenticates transactions and mitigates other computer control  weaknesses identified in CEFMS.

While the  Corps has made substantial progress in resolving many of the fiscal year  1999 weaknesses that we identified and has taken other steps to improve  security, continuing and newly identified weaknesses were identified in the  Corps\u2019 information system control environment. Specifically, at the general  controls level, the Corps had not adequately (1) limited user access;  (2) developed adequate system software controls to protect programs and  sensitive files; (3) documented software changes; (4) segregated  incompatible duties; (5) addressed service continuity needs; and  (6) secured network access. At the application control level, the Corps had  not maintained current and accurate CEFMS access authorizations and  maintained CEFMS current user manuals. The weaknesses that we  identified at the two data processing centers and other sites placed the  Corps\u2019 computer resources, programs, and files at risk from inappropriate  disclosure of financial and sensitive data and programs, modification of  data, misuse of or damage to computer resources, or disruption of critical  operations.", "A primary reason for the Corps\u2019 information system control weaknesses  was that it had not yet fully developed and implemented a comprehensive  security management program. A comprehensive program for computer  security management is essential for achieving an effective general and  application controls environment. Effective implementation of such a  program provides for (1) periodically assessing risks, (2) implementing  effective controls for restricting access based on job requirements and  actively reviewing access activities, (3) communicating the established  policies and controls to those who are responsible for their  implementation, and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of policies and  controls to ensure that they remain appropriate and accomplish their  intended purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In our March 15, 2002, \u201cLimited Official Use Only\u201d report, we recommended  that you instruct the chief information officer and the deputy chief of staff  for resource management to implement corrective actions to resolve the  general and application computer control weaknesses that we identified in  that report.", "In its report on the Corps\u2019 entitywide security management and service  continuity, planned for fiscal year 2002, the Army Audit Agency plans to  address recommendations in these areas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In providing written comments on a draft of this report, the commanding  general of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agreed with our findings and  recommendations and stated that the numerous working meetings  concerning the information security weaknesses that we identified will  help expedite their corrective actions.
