Postapproval studies are ordered to obtain additional information not available before devices are marketed, such as a device's performance over the course of long-term use. In terms of study design, 69 percent of the 313 postapproval studies ordered were prospective cohort studies\u2014that is, studies in which a group using a particular device was compared to a second group not using that device, over a long period of time. Most (72 percent) of the postapproval studies were ongoing as of February 2015, 20 percent of studies were completed, and 8 percent were inactive because, for example, the device is no longer marketed. Ongoing postapproval studies that GAO reviewed had been ongoing for an average of a little more than 3 years; FDA considered most of them (182 studies) to be progressing adequately and the rest (43 studies) to have inadequate progress or to otherwise be delayed. According to FDA officials, a key reason for a study's delay may be limited patient enrollment in the postapproval study. On average, manufacturers completed postapproval studies in about 3 years, with the longest study taking almost 7 years, for the studies that GAO reviewed.", "Ninety percent of the 392 medical device postmarket surveillance studies FDA ordered from May 1, 2008, through February 24, 2015, were for orthopedic devices and devices such as certain kinds of implantable surgical mesh following concerns with these types of devices, and many were consolidated into ongoing studies. Unlike postapproval studies, FDA may order postmarket surveillance studies at the time or after a device is approved or cleared for marketing\u2014for example, if FDA becomes aware of a potential safety issue. Safety concerns about metal-on-metal hip implants, including potential bone and tissue damage from metal particles, led to an increase in such studies ordered in 2011. Forty percent of the 392 ordered studies were for implanted surgical mesh and other devices used in general and plastic surgery and obstetrics and gynecology procedures. FDA ordered most of these studies in 2012, following safety concerns associated with implanted surgical mesh, such as severe pain. Eighty-eight percent of the postmarket surveillance studies GAO analyzed were inactive as of February 2015. Inactive studies include those that were consolidated (108 studies), meaning that a manufacturer was able to combine an order for a postmarket surveillance study with other related study orders into a single study, such as combining studies of multiple device models into a single study; and those that were inactive for other reasons, such as if the order was for a device that is no longer marketed. The remaining 12 percent of the postmarket surveillance studies were either still ongoing (40 studies) or completed (8 studies). Of the 40 ongoing studies, more than half were progressing adequately, according to FDA, and had been ongoing for an average of a little less than 3 years; the rest were delayed and had been ongoing for an average of about 4 years as of February 2015.
