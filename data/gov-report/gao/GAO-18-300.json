Over the last two decades, DOD has worked to improve the  care it provides to servicemembers and others, with a goal of reducing  deaths and disabilities caused by trauma. Previous efforts included the  establishment of a Joint Trauma System, a Defense Center of Excellence  (JTS DCOE) within the U.S. Army, which has been responsible for  providing organized and coordinated capability for injury prevention, care,  and rehabilitation support of DOD trauma initiatives across the Military  Health System. A 2016 report by the National Academies of Sciences,  Engineering, and Medicine noted widespread improvements over time in  both military and civilian trauma care, but also acknowledged  inconsistencies in care that continue to result in preventable injuries and  deaths.", "To improve trauma-related care across DOD, the National Defense  Authorization Act (NDAA) directed DOD to set up a new joint trauma  system (JTS) within its Defense Health Agency (DHA) that includes  required elements such as serving as a reference body for trauma care  provided across the military health system, and establishing standards of  trauma care at military medical treatment facilities. The NDAA also  required DOD to submit an implementation plan for this effort and  included a provision for us to review this plan.

Additionally, we reviewed and assessed the implementation plan and  supplemental planning documents identified by DOD against leading  practices for planning identified in our prior work. Specifically, we  identified four leading practices that agencies may include when planning  for program implementation: (1) goals for the program, (2) strategies to  achieve goals, (3) risks that can affect goals, and (4) plans to assess  progress toward goals. We also used Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government to assess DOD\u2019s efforts. (See table 1 for more detail on these leading practices.)

The JTS DCOE uses DODTR data to conduct performance  improvement activities and to identify gaps in medical capabilities to  direct ongoing and future combat casualty care research, trauma skills  training, and combat casualty care. The JTS DCOE also provides  data from the registry to collaborating military and civilian personnel  conducting medical research. managing the development, monitoring, and review of Clinical  Practice Guidelines (CPGs). These guidelines, developed by subject  matter experts using data from DOD\u2019s trauma registry, are created to  inform medical professionals of best practices based on medical  evidence, with a goal of minimizing inappropriate variation in medical  practice and improving care for trauma injuries, specifically when  military servicemembers are deployed. The development of CPGs is  an ongoing process that takes place during times of war and peace,  according to DOD officials. developing and providing training curriculum for first responders to  trauma-related injuries.

According to DOD officials, there are currently  about 70 disparate registries, some of which collect  trauma-related information for various entities across DOD.  2) developing a common trauma lexicon\u2014a dictionary of  common trauma care terminology to assist in the  assessment of trauma-related injury data.", "Strategies: In addition to defining goals, the documents also  include some strategies to achieve those goals, such as specific  actions that DOD plans to take and target dates for accomplishing  these actions. For example, the documents outline plans to take  action to define key terms such as \u201cpreventable death,\u201d \u201cnon- survivable injury,\u201d \u201cpotentially survivable injury,\u201d and others by a  target date of July 2018.

The  documents state that DHA will conduct an organizational analysis  to determine what organizational structure, staffing needs, and  other resources are needed for implementation at a later date.  They also state that funding levels for DHA\u2019s operation of the  DODTR will be based on the existing JTS DCOE funding levels.  However, another planning document indicates that the  infrastructure for the DODTR\u2019s existing host network\u2014operated by  the United States Army Institute of Surgical Research\u2014would be  insufficient to support the planned JTS and DODTR expansion,  and that integrating even a single additional registry or component  of a registry into the DODTR would require an adjustment to the  funding for the system. Given that the planned activities for the  new JTS would require an expansion beyond the scope of the  current JTS DCOE responsibilities and activities, additional  planning for equipment and network support costs may be  necessary to ensure that the new JTS has sufficient resources to  meet its goals.", "Risks: The planning documents identify risks that could affect the  JTS\u2019s ability to serve as a trauma reference body, but the  documents do not yet specify how DOD plans to assess or  respond to these risks. For example, although one of the planning  documents identifies potential shortfalls in the DODTR host  network\u2019s ability to support an increased number of users\u2014which  are expected as the various disparate registries are  consolidated\u2014none of the documents yet address the estimated  impact of this risk on DOD\u2019s goals or how it plans to respond to  the risk.

DOD publishes CPGs to provide trauma care  providers with recommended practices for the provision of  care, based on available evidence. According to DOD  documents, the CPGs minimize variations from evidence- based best practices, which help to save lives.", "Strategies: DOD\u2019s planning documents describe how the new  JTS will continue to produce, update, and monitor adherence to  CPGs and designates JTS as the office that is primarily  responsible for leading these efforts.

DOD officials  indicated that the new JTS will develop, publish, and assess  CPGs using the same process used by the existing JTS DCOE.  DOD officials told us that CPGs are currently reviewed on an  annual basis and updated once every two years, on average.  According to DOD officials, this frequency exceeds standards  established by leading civilian organizations. Once updated,  officials disseminate CPGs by posting them on a website, sharing  them with DOD officials responsible for training trauma care  providers, and discussing them at weekly conference calls on  combat casualty care. Officials also told us that the existing JTS  lacks authority to require that trauma care providers adhere to  recommendations made in CPGs. In addition, DOD\u2019s planning  documents acknowledge that the existing process lacks sufficient  mechanisms to ensure timely updates and effective dissemination,  but do not yet indicate what plans are needed to make  improvements in these areas. Without additional planning to  improve mechanisms for CPG development and dissemination,  DOD faces uncertainty regarding the new JTS\u2019s ability to ensure  that the CPGs it produces are up to date and effectively  disseminated to military trauma care providers, which may  ultimately impact the trauma care that it provides.", "Risks: The planning documents identify risks associated with the  development and dissemination of trauma care CPGs, such as an  inconsistent process for dissemination.
