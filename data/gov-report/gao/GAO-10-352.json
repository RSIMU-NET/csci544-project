Through analysis of agency documents, interviews with agency officials and their development partners, and fieldwork in five recipient countries, GAO examined (1) the types and funding of food security programs and activities of relevant U.S. government agencies; and (2) progress in developing an integrated U.S. governmentwide strategy to address global food insecurity as well as potential vulnerabilities of that strategy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government supports a wide variety of programs and activities for global food security, but lacks readily available comprehensive data on funding. In response to GAO's data collection instrument to 10 agencies, 7 agencies reported funding for global food security in fiscal year 2008 based on the working definition GAO developed for this purpose with agency input. USAID and USDA reported the broadest array of programs and activities, while USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, Treasury, USDA, and State reported providing the highest levels of funding for food security. The 7 agencies together directed at least $5 billion in fiscal year 2008 to global food security, with food aid accounting for about half of that funding. However, the actual total level of funding is likely greater. GAO's estimate does not account for all U.S. government funds targeting global food insecurity because the agencies lack (1) a commonly accepted governmentwide operational definition of global food security programs and activities as well as reporting requirements to routinely capture data on all relevant funds; and (2) data management systems to track and report food security funding comprehensively and consistently. The administration is making progress toward finalizing a governmentwide global food security strategy--expected to be released shortly--but its efforts are vulnerable to data weaknesses and risks associated with the strategy's host country-led approach. The administration has established interagency coordination mechanisms at headquarters in Washington, D.C., and is finalizing an implementation document and a results framework. However, the lack of readily available comprehensive data on current programs and funding levels may deprive decision makers of information on available resources and a firm baseline against which to plan. Furthermore, the host country-led approach, although promising, is vulnerable to (1) the weak capacity of host governments, which can limit their ability to sustain donor-funded efforts; (2) a shortage of expertise in agriculture and food security at U.S. agencies that could constrain efforts to help strengthen host government capacity; and (3) policy differences between host governments and donors, including the United States, which may complicate efforts to align donor assistance with host government strategies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Global hunger continues to worsen despite world leaders\u2019 1996 pledge\u2014 reaffirmed in 2000 and 2009\u2014to halve hunger by 2015. In 2009, the Food  and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that more than 1 billion  people were undernourished worldwide. The food and fuel crisis of 2006  through 2008 and the current global economic downturn exacerbated food  insecurity in many developing countries and sparked food protests and  riots in dozens of them. However, official development assistance for  agriculture declined from the 1980s to 2005. To reverse this trend, in 2009  major donor countries agreed to a $22 billion, 3-year commitment for  agriculture and food security in developing countries. According to the  Department of State, the U.S. share of this commitment\u2014at least $3.5  billion\u2014includes $1.2 billion towards the administration\u2019s Global Hunger  and Food Security initiative in fiscal year 2010, representing more than  double the fiscal year 2009 budget request. Various legislative proposals  introduced in 2009 call for action to improve global food security.", "Although investments in agriculture are important for increasing food  security, we found in our 2008 review of food insecurity in sub-Saharan Africa  that neither host governments nor donors, including the United States, have  prioritized food security and agriculture as development goals. According to  the World Bank\u2019s 2008 World Development Report, promoting agriculture in  developing countries is imperative for meeting the Millennium Development  Goal of halving poverty and hunger by 2015. In our report, we concluded that  U.S. efforts to reduce hunger in sub-Saharan Africa\u2014where food insecurity is  most prevalent\u2014had been impaired by limited agricultural development  resources, a fragmented approach, and an emphasis on emergency food aid.  We recommended (1) the development of an integrated governmentwide  strategy that defines each agency\u2019s actions and resource commitments to  achieve food security, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, including improving  collaboration with host governments and other donors and developing  improved measures to monitor and evaluate progress toward the  implementation of this strategy and (2) annual reporting to Congress on  progress toward the implementation of the first recommendation.", "Since assuming office in January 2009, the President and the Secretary of  State have each stated that improving global food security is a priority for this  administration. Consistent with our first recommendation, U.S. agencies have  launched a global hunger and food security initiative, and in April 2009 the  administration renewed efforts to develop a governmentwide strategy. The  National Security Council (NSC) Interagency Policy Committee on  Agriculture and Food Security and a Department of State-led Global Hunger  and Food Security Initiative (GHFSI) working team are responsible for these  efforts. In September 2009, State issued a consultation document that  delineated a comprehensive approach to food security based on host country-  and community-led planning whereby recipient countries decide on their own  needs, solutions, and development strategies on the assumption that the most  effective food security strategies come from those closest to the problems.  The consultation document states that supporting host country-led plans  increases the long-term sustainability of investments in food security,  strengthens coordination among stakeholders, and provides an important  opportunity to learn from the experiences of others. Moreover, the  consultation document states that the U.S. strategy will support commitments  made through consultative and inclusive country-led processes by aligning  U.S. resources behind these host country-led plans. According to members of  the GHFSI working team, the comprehensive approach under development  will also include an implementation document for the strategy.", "To inform Congress in its deliberations, you asked us to review U.S. efforts to  address global food insecurity. Specifically, we examined (1) the types and  funding levels of food security programs and activities of relevant U.S.  government agencies, and (2) progress in developing an integrated U.S.  governmentwide strategy to address global food insecurity, as well as  potential vulnerabilities of that strategy. To address these objectives, we  administered a data collection instrument to the 10 U.S. agencies that are  engaged in food security activities and participated in the Food Security Sub- Policy Coordinating Committee on Food Price Increases and Global Food  Security (Food Security Sub-PCC) of the NSC in 2008. (Our data collection  instrument is shown in app. II.) The 10 agencies are the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID), Millennium Challenge Corporation  (MCC), Department of the Treasury (Treasury), U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA), Department of State (State), Department of Defense  (DOD), U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), Peace Corps, Office of  the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), and Office of Management and Budget  (OMB). In addition, we conducted fieldwork in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana,  Haiti, and Malawi on the basis of the presence of multiple active programs  addressing food insecurity, the proportion of the chronically hungry in these  countries, and geographic coverage of U.S. efforts in Africa, the Western  Hemisphere, and Asia. In these countries, we met with U.S. mission staff and  host government, donor, and nongovernmental organization (NGO)  representatives. We also visited numerous project sites funded by the U.S.  government and other donors. In addition, we attended the 2009 World Food  Summit as an observer and met with Rome-based United Nations (UN) food  and agriculture agencies\u2014namely FAO, the World Food Program, and the  International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), as well as the U.S.  Mission to the United Nations and representatives of other donor countries.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2009 to March 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Based on FAO\u2019s most recent data, Sub- Saharan Africa and South Asia had the most severe and widespread food  insecurity as of 2004-2006. Outside these two regions, Haiti, the least  developed country in the Western Hemisphere and one of the poorest  countries in the world, had extremely high levels of hunger and food  insecurity, which have been further exacerbated by the January 2010  earthquake.", "In absolute numbers, more hungry people lived in South Asia than in any  other region, whereas the most concentrated hunger was found in sub- Saharan Africa, which had 16 of the world\u2019s 17 countries where the  prevalence of hunger was 35 percent or higher. The 17th country was Haiti,  where 58 percent of the population lived in chronic hunger.

However, during  this period, the actual number of undernourished people has increased: from  169 million to 212 million in sub-Saharan Africa, from 286 million to 337  million in South Asia, and from 4.5 million to 5.4 million in Haiti\u2014a number  that is likely to grow further due to the earthquake."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The United States and Other World Leaders Have Made Longstanding Commitments to Address Global Food Insecurity", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, the United States and about 180 world leaders pledged to halve  hunger by 2015.

These include host governments,  multilateral organizations, and bilateral donors, as well as other entities  such as NGOs, philanthropic foundations, private sector organizations,  and academic and research organizations. Their roles and types of  activities include the following:    Host governments. At the country level, host governments generally lead  the development of a strategy for the agricultural sector and the  coordination of donor assistance. They typically issue a poverty reduction  strategy paper that outlines their country development plans and a  national action plan to alleviate poverty, both elements considered  indicators of national ownership of the development approach. Donors are  committed under the Paris Declaration to align their assistance with  national development strategies of the host country. Host governments  may also participate in efforts at the regional level. For example, in 2003,  members of the African Union endorsed the implementation of the  Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP), a  framework that is aimed to guide agricultural development efforts in  African countries, and agreed to allocate at least 10 percent of government  spending to agriculture by 2008.", "Multilateral organizations. Several multilateral organizations and  international financial institutions implement a variety of programs in the  areas of agricultural development and food security. IFAD and other  international financial institutions play a large role in providing funding  support for agriculture. Together, the World Bank, IFAD, and the African  Development Bank accounted for about 73 percent of multilateral official  development assistance to agriculture from 1974 to 2006 in sub-Saharan  Africa. In addition, the New York-based UN Development Program is  responsible for supporting the implementation of the UN Millennium  Development Goals. In September 2009, the Group of 20 (G20) countries  asked the World Bank to establish a multidonor trust fund to support the  L\u2019Aquila initiative to boost support for agriculture and food security. As of  January 2010, the World Bank board approved the establishment of the  Global Agriculture and Food Security Program Trust Fund, which the  World Bank will administer. According to Treasury officials, the fund will  be operational by the middle of 2010.", "Bilateral donors. Major bilateral donors include Australia, Canada,  France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the  United States, among others. At the G8 Summit in L\u2019Aquila, Italy, in July  2009, and the subsequent G20 Summit in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in  September 2009, major donor countries and the European Commission  pledged to significantly increase aid to agriculture and food security.  According to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and  Development, since the mid-1980s, aid to agriculture has fallen by half, but  recent trends indicate a slowdown in the decline, and even the prospect of  an upward trend. From 2002-2007, bilateral aid to agriculture increased at  an average annual rate of 5 percent in real terms. Organization of  Economic Cooperation and Development data show that in 2006-2007,  development assistance countries\u2019 bilateral aid commitments to  agriculture amounted to $3.8 billion, a little more than half of the L\u2019Aquila  commitment on an annual basis.", "Other entities. Other entities such as NGOs, philanthropic foundations,  private sector organizations, and academic and research organizations\u2014 often working in partnership\u2014also play a significant role in supporting  food security and agricultural development in developing countries. For  example, the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, which was  established in 2006 with initial funding from the Bill and Melinda Gates  Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, has entered into a  partnership with the New Partnership for African Development to help  link African government commitments to agricultural development with  programs in seeds, soil health, market access, and policy.

In this instrument, we asked the agencies  to indicate what types of food security activities they performed in fiscal year  2008 and the funding levels associated with them. We had to develop a  working definition of food security because there is no commonly accepted  governmentwide operational definition that specifies the programs and  activities that are food security-related. We developed our working  definition based on a framework of food security-related activities that we  established in a prior GAO report and a series of interactions with the  relevant agencies over a period of several months. Our interactions with  the agencies focused on refining the definition to ensure that it would be  commonly understood and applicable to their programs and activities to the  extent possible. The working definition that we developed included the  following elements: food aid, nutrition, agricultural development, rural  development, safety nets, policy reform, information and monitoring, and  future challenges to food security. We asked the agencies to indicate which of  these activities they performed and to provide funding data\u2014when these data  were available and reliable\u2014on the appropriations, obligations, expenditures,  and other allocations associated with these activities in fiscal year 2008.

These agencies\u2019 food security assistance, as reported in  response to our instrument, can be summarized as follows:    USAID. In addition to providing the bulk of U.S. foreign assistance  targeting global food insecurity, USAID supports more types of programs  and activities in this area than any other agency. The two types of USAID  assistance with the highest funding are the delivery of food aid and the  promotion of food security by stimulating rural economies through broad- based agricultural growth. According to USAID\u2019s most recent  International Food Assistance Report, the agency provided almost $2  billion for emergency food aid in fiscal year 2008. In addition, in response  to our instrument, USAID reported about $500 million in funding for  agricultural development and other global food security-related programs  and activities in that year. USAID\u2019s funding for agriculture would increase  significantly under the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2010 budget request to  double U.S. assistance for global food security and agricultural  development from the fiscal year 2009 request level.", "Millennium Challenge Corporation. MCC was established in 2004 and  provides eligible developing countries with grants designed to support  country-led solutions for reducing poverty through sustainable economic  growth. MCC offers two kinds of monetary assistance: (1) compacts,  which are large, multiyear grants to countries that meet MCC\u2019s eligibility  criteria in the areas of good governance, economic freedom, education,  health, and natural resource management; and (2) threshold programs,  which are smaller grants awarded to countries that come close to meeting  these criteria and are committed to improving their policy performance.  According to MCC, as of March 2009, it had obligated nearly $3.2 billion to  strengthen the agricultural and rural economies in poor countries to  promote reliable access to sufficient, safe, and affordable food. For fiscal  year 2008, MCC reported funding obligations of about $912 million for  multiyear compacts.", "Treasury. Treasury is the lead agency responsible for U.S. participation in  the multilateral development banks. It provides funding for agricultural  development through the leveraging of its contributions to the African  Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Inter-American Development  Bank and Fund for Special Operations, European Bank for Reconstruction  and Development, International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),  and World Bank. A representative from Treasury\u2019s Office of International  Affairs serves in a leadership role as a member of IFAD\u2019s Board of Directors.  Treasury reported that in fiscal year 2008 the total financing for public and  private sector investments in agricultural development, including rural  development and policy reform, from the multilateral development banks was  $4.9 billion. We estimate that the U.S. share of this financing is $817 million,  including $358 million in highly concessional loans and grants to the  world\u2019s poorest countries and $459 million in loans to middle-income and  creditworthy low-income developing countries.", "USDA. USDA provides nonemergency food aid, as well as technical and  nutritional assistance focusing on agricultural development and vulnerable  groups. USDA reported $540 million in food security-related funding in  fiscal year 2008, including $530.5 million dedicated to food aid programs\u2014 namely, Food for Progress and the McGovern-Dole International Food for  Education and Child Nutrition Program\u2014and the emergency food  commodity reserve known as the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust. The  remaining amount is used for various technical assistance programs, such  as the Cochran and Borlaug fellowships supporting international  exchanges to facilitate agricultural development.", "State. State\u2019s primary role with regard to food security is to coordinate  international communication, negotiations, and U.S. government policy  formulation. The President has asked the Secretary of State to lead the  Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative. A number of State\u2019s bureaus  and offices perform duties specific to their expertise that help promote  global food security. For example, State\u2019s Bureau of Economic, Energy,  and Business Affairs, with assistance from the Office of Policy Planning  and others, is involved in the effort to develop a whole-of-government  strategy to promote global food security. The Bureau\u2019s Office of  Multilateral Trade and Agriculture Affairs assists with food security policy  coordination, works toward a successful conclusion of the Doha Round of  trade talks in the World Trade Organization, and promotes the removal of  export restrictions on agricultural products and the reduction in trade  barriers to agricultural biotechnology. The Bureau of International  Organizations coordinates U.S. policy towards and participation in FAO  and the World Food Program. The Bureau for Population, Refugees, and  Migration coordinates with the World Food Program and USAID regarding  food assistance and food security for refugees and other populations of  concern. The Bureau of Oceans, Environment, and Science works  bilaterally and multilaterally to advance U.S. foreign policy objectives in  such areas as the sustainable use of natural resources, protection of  biodiversity and wildlife, adaptation to climate change, harnessing of  science and technology, and improvements to human health. State\u2019s Office  of the Director of U.S. Foreign Assistance (State/F) coordinates State and  USAID budgets, while the Office of Conflict Prevention acts as the  secretariat for the funding of reconstruction and stabilization projects  through the use of DOD Section 1207 funds. State reported providing  about $168 million for food security programs and activities in fiscal year  2008.", "The other five agencies that responded to our data collection instrument  are involved in supporting global food security initiatives in different ways.  USTDA and DOD provide some food security-related monetary assistance.  For fiscal year 2008, USTDA reported providing more than $9 million for  agriculture, rural development, and other types of food security assistance,  and DOD\u2019s Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) reported more  than $8 million in funding for global food security-related activities that  were part of disaster relief and humanitarian assistance efforts. The Peace  Corps estimates that many of its volunteers serving in developing  countries address the issues of hunger, malnutrition, and food insecurity,  but did not report any funding data. While USTR does not support any  food security programming, it is engaged in interagency consultations and  has recently created an interagency subcommittee at the Trade Policy  Staff Committee to coordinate trade policy elements of the  administration\u2019s global food security initiative. The 10th agency, OMB,  participates in the interagency process as part of its mission to help  formulate the administration\u2019s budget and to advise the White House and  other components of the Executive Office of the President on the  resources available to support the development of new food security  initiatives.

However, the actual total level of  funding is likely greater. We were only able to obtain these funding data  and ascertain their reliability through repeated inquiries and discussions  with the agencies over a 6-month period. The estimate does not account  for all U.S. government funds targeting global hunger and food insecurity.

In addition, the agencies used different  measures, such as planned appropriations, obligations, expenditures, and,  in Treasury\u2019s case, U.S. contributions to multilateral development banks,  which made it difficult to arrive at a precise estimate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Incomplete Funding Data Due to Lack of a Commonly Accepted Governmentwide Operational Definition and Reporting Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The agencies reported incomplete funding data due to a lack of a  commonly accepted governmentwide operational definition of what  constitutes global food security programs and activities as well as a lack of  reporting requirements to routinely capture data on all relevant funds. An  operational definition accepted by all U.S. agencies would enable them to  apply it at the program level for planning and budgeting purposes. Because  food security is an issue that cuts across multiple sectors, it can be  difficult to define precisely what constitutes a food security-related  program or activity, or to distinguish a food security activity from other  development activities. Principal planning documents, even at the  agencies with the highest levels of funding, have not recognized food  security as a distinct program area. For example, as State noted in a  written response to our data collection instrument, State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s  Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2007 to 2012, the most recent guidance  that sets these agencies\u2019 priorities, does not use the term \u201cfood security.\u201d", "We also found that the Foreign Assistance Coordination and Tracking  System (FACTS) database, which State and USAID use to collect and  report data on the U.S. foreign assistance that they implement, provides  limited guidance for identifying food security programs and activities.  The organization of the FACTS database reflects the four levels of the  standardized program structure of U.S. foreign assistance: objectives,  program areas, elements, and subelements. USAID could identify  subelements whose definitions included food security activities. After  extensive discussions with USAID, we selected 13 subelements as  primarily containing food security programs and activities and added up  funding levels associated with these subelements to estimate USAID\u2019s  global food security assistance in fiscal year 2008. However, if  subelements contained both food security and non-food security activities,  USAID could not always isolate the former from the latter. We identified  about $850 million in funding for 12 such subelements. For example, the  subelement for livelihood support, infrastructure rehabilitation, and  services, with $123 million in funding in fiscal year 2008, combines food  aid activities, such as food for work, with other activities, such as  education and income generation, but FACTS is currently not designed to  readily identify what portion of the $123 million is related to global food  security.", "The lack of a commonly accepted governmentwide operational definition  may also lead the agencies to either define food security very broadly or to  not recognize food security-related activities as such. For example, in  response to our instrument, USDA reported some of the activities  supported by USDA\u2019s Forest Service\u2014such as the migratory bird and  monarch butterfly habitat management\u2014but did not explain how they  were related to global food security. Conversely, DOD did not initially  report any global food security-related programs and activities because  food security is not recognized as part of DOD\u2019s officially defined mission.  However, in subsequent inquiries we established that some of DOD\u2019s  humanitarian assistance projects, such as those implemented by DSCA,  have food security components. DOD officials acknowledged that the  Combatant Commanders\u2019 Initiative Fund and the Commanders\u2019  Emergency Response Program likely support food security-related  projects but did not provide us with relevant data. DOD\u2019s involvement  could be significant\u2014for example, the Center for Global Development  estimates that in 2007 DOD implemented 16.5 percent of U.S. development  assistance\u2014and DSCA\u2019s $8.4 million for global food security-related  projects likely represents only a portion of DOD\u2019s total spending on food  security-related activities.", "Additionally, some agencies that support food security activities lack  reporting requirements to routinely capture data on all relevant funds. For  example, although the Peace Corps has adopted a Food Security Strategic  Plan and estimates that about 40 percent of its volunteers contribute in  some capacity to food security work through projects in agriculture, health,  and environment, the agency did not report any funding information. In an  interview, senior Peace Corps officials noted that, given the circumstances  under which Peace Corps volunteers work and live, it is impossible to  isolate what portion of volunteers\u2019 time is spent on food security.

In its initial response to our instrument, USAID, using  FACTS, reported that in fiscal year 2008 the agency\u2019s planned  appropriations for global food security included about $860 million for Food  for Peace Title II emergency food aid. However, we noticed a very large  discrepancy between the FACTS-generated $860 million and two other  sources of information on emergency food aid funding: (1) the $1.7 billion  that USAID allocated to emergency food aid from the congressional  appropriations for Title II food aid for fiscal year 2008, and (2) about $2  billion in emergency food aid funding reported by USAID in its  International Food Assistance Report for fiscal year 2008. Officials at  USAID and State/F were unaware of the discrepancy until we brought it to  their attention. As of February 12, 2010, USAID had not updated FACTS to  incorporate the missing information. In formal comments on a draft of this  report, USAID and State officials attributed this discrepancy to the fact  that Title II food aid supplemental appropriations had not been entered  into FACTS because these were made fairly late in fiscal year 2008.  USAID officials reported that the agency has checks in place to ensure the  accuracy of the regular appropriations data entered by its overseas  missions and most headquarters bureaus. However, the omission of the  supplemental appropriation information for emergency food aid, which is  USAID\u2019s food security program with the highest level of funding, raises  questions about the data management and verification procedures in  FACTS, particularly with regard to the Food for Peace program, and  seriously limits its capacity to track all food security funding.", "In another example, in its initial response to our instrument, USDA  provided us with conflicting data for the total amount of funding for its  food security programs.

In September 2009, State and the GHFSI working team issued an  initial draft of the strategy, known as the Consultation Document. The  Consultation Document delineates a proposed approach to food security  based on five principles for advancing global food security, as follows:  1.  Comprehensively address the underlying causes of hunger and  undernutrition.  2.  Invest in country-led plans.  3.  Strengthen strategic coordination.  4.  Leverage the benefits of multilateral mechanisms to expand impacts.  5.  Deliver on sustained and accountable commitments.", "These principles reflect the approach endorsed in several recent  multilateral venues, including the G8 L\u2019Aquila joint statement, the UN  Comprehensive Framework for Action, and the World Summit on Food  Security declaration. To develop the Consultation Document, the  administration engaged in a consultative process within the U.S.  government and with the global community and other stakeholders  through the NSC/IPC and the State-led GHFSI.

According to the GHFSI working team, the effort to develop an  implementation document has involved intensive interagency  consultations and meetings with donors, such as FAO, the World Bank,  and the United Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development, to  discuss implementation \u201cbest practices,\u201d the establishment of common  global guidance on the development process, and reviews of country-led  investment plans. Additionally, a number of U.S. missions overseas have  submitted draft implementation plans for fiscal year 2010 that include  staffing and budget resources required to achieve planned objectives in  core investment areas. Absent a finalized governmentwide strategy,  however, it is difficult to evaluate the subordinate implementation plans  that field missions are submitting to ensure sufficient resource and  funding levels. The GHFSI working team is also developing a whole-of- government results framework, which articulates specific objectives of the  initiative as well as causal linkages between certain objectives, their  intended results, and contribution to the overall goal. The results  framework will be accompanied by a monitoring and evaluation plan,  which identifies indicators to be used to report progress against planned  outputs and outcomes. The framework has been externally reviewed by 10  experts, is now under review by U.S. government representatives in the  field, and will be made available for public comment shortly, according to  State and other members of the GHFSI working team.", "The administration is moving forward with plans to select about 20  countries where GHFSI assistance efforts are concentrated. State\u2019s Fiscal  Year 2011 Congressional Budget Justification (CBJ) for the GHFSI  identified 12 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, 4 countries in Asia, and 4  countries in the Western Hemisphere on the basis of four criteria, as  follows:  1.  Prevalence of chronic hunger and poverty in rural communities.  2.  Potential for rapid and sustainable agricultural-led growth.  3.  Host government commitment, leadership, governance, and political  will. 4.  Opportunities for regional synergies through trade and other  mechanisms.", "According to the Consultation Document, the GHFSI focus countries will  fall into two general categories: countries in the first phase that would  benefit from technical assistance and capacity building to fully develop  investment plans, and countries in the second phase with advanced  national food security plans and already-established public and private  capacities to enable successful plan implementation. Phase I countries will  receive targeted assistance to generate a comprehensive national food  security investment plan, including assistance to increase technical  expertise, improve natural resource management, prepare inventories and  assessments of the agricultural sector, conduct reform of trade and  agricultural policies, and meet critical infrastructure needs. Phase II  countries will be considered for significant resources and have to  demonstrate sufficient capacity, have an enabling environment for  sustainable agricultural-led growth, and have a completed country plan.  According to State\u2019s Fiscal Year 2011 CBJ for GHFSI, the administration  will develop a set of objective indicators that measure both the progress  toward reforms that a country has committed to in its internal consultative  processes and a minimum set of internationally recognized cross-country  policy indicators. As of February 2010, GHFSI has identified 15 Phase I  countries (7 in sub-Saharan Africa, 4 in Asia, 4 in the Western Hemisphere)  and 5 Phase II plan countries (all in sub-Saharan Africa) that are being  considered for assistance in fiscal year 2011.

However, it is currently used only by State and USAID to  collect, track, and report standardized data for all foreign assistance that  they implement. Expanding the use of FACTS to other agencies has  proven to be difficult, in part because agencies use different data  management systems and procedures to allocate resources and measure  results. Even different units within an agency may use different data  management systems. In addition, as USAID officials in Ethiopia told us,  information sharing may have been hindered by a perception among  officials from at least one agency providing U.S. foreign assistance that  supporting the coordination effort through the State/F process created an  additional layer of work that was not regarded as a priority by other  agencies. As we discuss earlier in this report, FACTS currently has limited  capacity to track data for global food security programs and activities. We  highlight FACTS because, despite its limitations, it was originally designed  to compile and report comprehensive and comparable funding data on  assistance programs implemented by multiple agencies of the U.S.  government, and State/F and USAID could address the limitations we note  by changing their operating procedures rather than by redesigning the  system itself."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Host Country-led Approach Could Be Central to the Success of the Forthcoming Strategy but Has Key Vulnerabilities", "paragraphs": ["The administration has embraced the host country-led approach as central  to the success of the new strategy, reflecting a consensus among  policymakers and experts that development efforts will not succeed  without host country ownership of donor interventions.

At the  G8 and G20 summits in 2009, major donors pledged to direct more than  $22 billion for agriculture and food security to developing countries  between 2010 and 2012. In 2003 African countries adopted the  Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) and  pledged to commit 10 percent of government spending to agriculture by  2008. However, in December 2009, the International Food Policy  Research Institute (IFPRI) reported that only 8 out of 38 countries had met  this pledge as of 2007, namely Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea,  Malawi, Mali, Niger, and Senegal (see fig. 5).", "Despite stakeholders\u2019 endorsement of progress Rwanda has made toward  addressing agriculture and food security at the first CAADP post-compact  high-level stakeholder meeting in December 2009, an IFPRI review raised  some concerns about growth performance in Rwanda\u2019s agricultural sector,  which is nearly 50 percent below long-term targets. IFPRI found that  (1) Rwanda\u2019s aggregate agricultural growth is higher than the precompact  level and the CAADP goal of 6 percent but lower than is necessary to meet  the poverty MDG, and (2) even successfully implemented investment plans  that achieve their targets for individual sectors would only meet the  required growth objectives to realize the poverty MDG by 2020, but not by  2015.", "Second, the weak capacity of host governments raises questions about their  ability to absorb significant increases in donor funding for agriculture and  food security. According to MCC, as of the end of the first quarter of fiscal  year 2009, it had disbursed approximately $438 million in compact assistance.  Prior GAO analysis shows that this constitutes 32 percent of initially planned  disbursements for the 16 compacts that had entered into force. The 16  compacts have a total value of approximately $5.7 billion.

We had to develop a working  definition of food security because there is no commonly accepted  governmentwide operational definition that specifies the programs and  activities that are food-security related. We developed our working  definition based on a framework of food security-related activities that we  established in prior work on international food assistance, including our  2008 report, and a series of interactions with the relevant agencies over a  period of several months. Our interactions with the agencies focused on  refining the definition to ensure that it would be commonly understood  and applicable to their programs and activities to the extent possible.

Based on discussions with USAID officials about their  procedures for entering data into FACTS, we determined that, once we  had made the correction for emergency food aid, the data we received were sufficiently reliable to indicate a minimum amount that USAID had directed to food security programs and activities. However, this amount  did not include funding for USAID programs and activities that have a foo tion,  security component, but also have other goals and purposes. In addi we determined that it likely did not include all supplemental  appropriations for the agricultural and other programs and activities  reported. Hence, the total actual level of funding is likely greater.", "Overall, based on our follow-up discussions with the agencies, we  determined that their responses to the data collection instrument had  covered their major food security programs, but that there were  weaknesses in their reporting on other programs that addressed aspects o food security. We determined that the reported funding data were  sufficiently reliable to indicate the relative size of the major agencies\u2019  efforts in terms of approximate orders of magnitude, and included the  funding information provided by the agencies\u2014as amended during the  course of our follow-up inquiries\u2014in appendix III. However, due to the  limitations in the funding data reported by the agencies, we could not  make precise comparisons of the agencies\u2019 funds for food security in fisc year 2008, nor could we provide a precise total. As a result, we presented  rounded totals for funding in our discussion of our findings.", "To assess progress in developing an integrated governmentwide strategy  to address global food insecurity\u2014as well as potential vulnerabilities of  that strategy\u2014we reviewed selected reports, studies, and papers issued by U.S. agencies, multilateral organizations, research and nongovernmental  organizations.", "In Washington, D.C., we interviewed officials from the National Security  Council Interagency Policy Committee on Agriculture and Food Security  to discuss the interagency process to develop a governmentwide food  security strategy. We reviewed the initial Consultation Document that  State issued in September 2009, which is regarded as the strategy under  development. Similarly, we discussed the forthcoming U.S. global food  security strategy with the officials in the agencies that are developing it,  but were not able to fully consider the final draft for this review. At the  time of our review, the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative  working team was in the process of finalizing the strategy, along with an  implementation document and a results framework that will provide a  foundation for country selection, funding, and mechanisms to monit evaluate the strategy.", "We conducted fieldwork in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Haiti, and  Malawi. We selected these countries for fieldwork because the United  States has multiple active programs addressing food insecurity there. The  proportion of the chronically hungry in these countries\u2014based on the  Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s most recent estimates\u2014 8 percent of the population in Ghana to 58 percent in Haiti. In addition , we  also selected these countries to ensure geographic coverage of U.S . global  efforts in Africa, Asia, and the Western Hemisphere. While this selection is  not representative, it ensured that we had variation in the key facto considered. We did not generalize the results of our fieldwork beyond o ate of  selection, and we used fieldwork examples to demonstrate the st food insecurity in the countries we visited and U.S. efforts to date. In the  countries that we selected for fieldwork, we met with U.S. mission   and host government, donor, and NGO representatives. We also visited numerous project sites, smallholder farmer groups, and distribution site funded by the U.S. government and other donors. In addition, we attend the 2009 World Food Summit as an observer and met with the Rome-bas UN food and agriculture agencies\u2014namely, the Food and Agriculture  Organization, World Food Program, and the International Fund for  Agricultural Development, as well as the U.S. Mission to the United  Nations and representatives of other donor countries such as Kingdom\u2019s Department for International Development.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2009 to March 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The report recognizes the progress that U.S. agencies are making  toward the development of the strategy, Feed the Future: The Global  Hunger and Food Security Initiative Strategy. The implementation of  our recommendations, including developing an operational definition  of food security that is accepted by all U.S. agencies, will better help to  ensure the successful implementation of the evolving strategy.  2.  We compared the data in the Foreign Assistance Coordination and  Tracking System (FACTS) to data in other sources that reported  funding for food security, such as the annual International Food  Assistance Report (IFAR), and several years of congressional budget  justifications because that is a standard methodology for assessing  data reliability. Our goal, as USAID officials were aware through  months of discussion, was to collect the most complete and accurate  data possible on food security funding. With that in mind, we requested  data on supplemental appropriations and were given data tables that  included some supplemental appropriations data. In addition, when we  alerted USAID officials to the discrepancy we found in the Title II  emergency food aid data, they advised us to use the complete funding  data reported in IFAR rather than the incomplete data that were  reported in FACTS. 3.  USAID\u2019S comments confirm our finding that the FACTS data were  incomplete and did not reflect all food security funding. While FACTS  contains reasonably complete and accurate data for regular food  security-related appropriations, it lacks compete data for supplemental  appropriations. This is a serious limitation inasmuch as USAID\u2019s global  food security program with the highest funding level received a  supplemental appropriation of $850 million in fiscal year 2008.  4.  The report acknowledges the roles of all development partners,  including host governments, multilateral organizations, bilateral  donors, and other entities such as nongovernmental organizations,  philanthropic foundations, private sector organizations, and academic  and research organizations\u2014with whom U.S. agencies will have to  coordinate their efforts. As with other donors, the United States is  supporting the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development  Program (CAADP) to help ensure a coordinated approach. However,  we note in the report that the data suggest that the vast majority of  African countries have not met their own commitments to direct 10  percent of government spending to agriculture. This calls into questio  development  many of these countries\u2019 commitment to agricultural which, in turn, could impact the development of technically sound  investment strategies for food security that reflect the reality of these  countries\u2019 capacity to implement their own strategies, with donor  support and assistance. 5.  While the two-phased approach in selecting countries for GHFSI  ound development policy, we report that two of the five countries  assistance may reduce the risks associated with limited host country  s on  capacity and potential significant conflicts with U.S. perspective s currently under consideration as Phase II countries\u2014Rwanda and  Tanzania\u2014have not met their 10-percent CAADP pledges (see  comment 4). In identifying and selecting Phase I and Phase II  countries, the U.S. government should be clear on its application of th g  criteria that the GHFSI strategy has delineated, which include, amon other things, host government commitment, leadership, and  governance. 6.

We  recognize the important roles that all the relevant agencies play in the  Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative (GHFSI) currently led by  State as a whole-of-government effort. We also recognize the expertise  that agencies such as USDA and USAID offer, and encourage fully  leveraging their expertise, which is essential to U.S. efforts to help  strengthen host governments\u2019 capacity in a country-led approach.  USDA\u2019s expertise includes its relationships with U.S. land grant  colleges and university partners, as well as the science and technology  programs that the department supports. 2.
