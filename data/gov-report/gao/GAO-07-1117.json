Kidney transplant recipients must take costly medications to avoid transplant failure. Unless a transplant recipient is eligible for Medicare other than on the basis of ESRD, Medicare coverage, including that for medications, ends 36 months posttransplant. Pediatric transplant recipients, including those who were under 18 when transplanted but are now adults (transitional recipients), may be more likely than their adult counterparts to lose access to medications once Medicare coverage ends because they may lack access to other health insurance coverage. GAO was asked to examine (1) the percentage of transplant failures and subsequent outcomes--retransplant, dialysis, or death--among pediatric, transitional, and adult kidney transplant recipients and (2) how the cost to Medicare for a beneficiary with a functioning transplant compares with the cost for a beneficiary with a transplant failure. To do this, GAO analyzed 1997 through 2004 data from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS) and interviewed officials from pediatric transplant centers. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services--the agency that administers Medicare--commented that it is concerned about beneficiary outcomes and has an education program to help them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The percentage of kidney transplant recipients who experience a transplant failure varies by age group as do the percentages who experience dialysis, retransplant, or death. After the first year posttransplant, a higher percentage of transitional recipients (those younger than 18 at the time of their transplants and at least 18 as of December 31, 2004) experienced a transplant failure and subsequently received dialysis compared with their pediatric (those younger than 18 as of December 31, 2004) and adult (those at least 18 at the time of their transplants) counterparts. By 5 years posttransplant, the percentage of transitional recipients who experienced a transplant failure (33 percent) was about twice as high as pediatric recipients (16 percent) and somewhat higher than adult recipients (28 percent). The largest increase in transplant failures for each age group occurred in the first 3 years posttransplant--before the termination of Medicare coverage on the basis of ESRD--and the increase was substantially higher for transitional recipients (133 percent) than for pediatric (83 percent) and adult (100 percent) recipients. Medicare beneficiaries with functioning transplants cost substantially less per year to treat than those who experienced a transplant failure. GAO found that the median annual Medicare cost for a beneficiary whose transplant failed ($50,938) was 500 percent more than the median annual Medicare cost for a beneficiary with a functioning transplant ($8,550). This percentage difference was consistent across transplant recipient age groups. The substantial cost of treating transplant recipients who experience a transplant failure underscores the importance of maintaining functioning kidney transplants. While there are many reasons that could account for transplant failures, the large percentage increase in transplant failures from 1 year to 3 years posttransplant for transitional recipients cannot be attributed to an inability to access medications due to a lack of Medicare coverage."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Regardless of age, most individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD),  Regardless of age, most individuals with end-stage renal disease (ESRD),  the permanent loss of kidney function, are covered under Medicare.  the permanent loss of kidney function, are covered under Medicare. which remove excess fluids and wastes from  regular dialysis treatments, In the long term,  transplants, Medicare covers regular dialysis treatments.", "Generally, individuals with ESRD are eligible for benefits under Medicare if they (1) are  entitled to monthly insurance benefits under Title II of the Social Security Act (or an  annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974), (2) meet certain work requirements  under the Social Security or Railroad Retirement programs, or (3) are the spouse or  dependent child of a person who meets at least one of the first two requirements. 42 U.S.C.  \u00a7 426-1 (2000).

Transplant recipients who stop taking immunosuppressive medications  (referred to as medication noncompliance) and experience transplant  failure must, absent a retransplant, receive regular dialysis treatments in  order to survive. Transplant failures may be particularly problematic for  pediatric recipients because long-term dialysis can lead to developmental  problems, such as inhibited growth, as well as poor academic performance  and delayed social development.", "Unless a transplant recipient is eligible for Medicare other than because of  ESRD, coverage of immunosuppressive medications, along with follow-up  care, ends 36 months posttransplant. Pediatric transplant recipients may  be more likely than their adult counterparts to lose access to  immunosuppressive medications once Medicare coverage for ESRD ends  because they may lack access to other health insurance coverage. Access  to health insurance may be particularly problematic for those individuals  who are 18 or older but were under 18 at the time of their transplants\u2014for  the purposes of this report, we refer to these individuals as transitional  recipients. While some pediatric recipients may be covered by their  parents\u2019 health insurance, family insurance coverage often does not  extend to children over 18 unless they are full-time students. While a lack  of health insurance is one reason transplant recipients may stop taking  their medication, studies have reported that there are numerous other  reasons for medication noncompliance, including avoidance of adverse  side effects associated with immunosuppressive medications and difficulty  following complex treatment regimens.", "In light of these concerns, you asked us to describe certain aspects of  kidney transplant recipients, determine the extent to which they  experience transplant failure and subsequent outcomes, and calculate the  cost associated with their treatment. In this report, we (1) compare certain  demographic characteristics and types of health insurance coverage of  pediatric, transitional, and adult kidney transplant recipients; (2) examine  the percentage of transplant failures and subsequent outcomes\u2014 retransplant, dialysis, or death\u2014among pediatric, transitional, and adult  kidney transplant recipients; (3) determine how the percentage of  transplant failures and subsequent outcomes of kidney transplant  recipients compare by type of health insurance coverage; and (4) examine  how the cost to Medicare for a beneficiary with a functioning transplant  compares with the cost for a beneficiary with a transplant failure.", "To determine the characteristics of pediatric, transitional, and adult  kidney transplant recipients, we used 2004 data\u2014the latest data  available\u2014on recipient age, sex, race, and type of health insurance  coverage from the United States Renal Data System (USRDS). The USRDS  is a national data system maintained by the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 (HHS) National Institutes of Health (NIH) that contains  data on individuals with ESRD collected from many sources, including  HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that  administers Medicare, and the United Network for Organ Sharing. We used  USRDS to define three age groups: pediatric recipients are those who were  younger than 18 years old as of December 31, 2004, transitional recipients  are those who were younger than 18 years old at the time of their  transplants and at least 18 years old as of December 31, 2004, and adult  recipients are those who were at least 18 years old at the time of their  transplants. We used USRDS data to compare the distribution of sex, race,  and income levels among pediatric, transitional, and adult recipients who  had a functioning transplant as of December 31, 2004. There were 3,675  pediatric recipients, 4,608 transitional recipients, and 110,762 adult  recipients in the USRDS data who met this criterion. We also compared  the demographic characteristics of the three age groups to those found in  the general U.S. population, using data from the 2000 U.S. Census. To  estimate the income levels for recipients in each of our three age groups,  we matched recipients\u2019 zip codes and federal information processing  standards codes using the 2002 median household income for the county  of their residence as published in the 2005 Area Resource File (ARF), the  latest data available. The USRDS maintains health insurance information  under three categories: Medicare but not Medicaid, Medicare and  Medicaid, and Other. The Other category is defined as those who do not  have Medicare coverage but are covered by private health insurance,  Medicaid, or other governmental health insurance or are uninsured or  whose health insurance status is unknown. Our analysis is based on  recipients who had a functioning kidney-only transplant as of   December 31, 2004.", "To examine the percentage of transplant failures and subsequent  outcomes among pediatric, transitional, and adult kidney transplant  recipients, we used data through December 31, 2004, from the USRDS on  individuals who received kidney-only transplants from 1997 through 2000.  There were 1,218 pediatric recipients, 2,148 transitional recipients, and  49,940 adult recipients who met this criterion. We analyzed data separately  for pediatric, transitional, and adult recipients. We determined the  frequency of transplant failures among each of the three age groups at   1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 7 years after the transplant using the date of  failure reported in the USRDS, and we grouped the frequencies by age  group and these follow-up periods. For recipients whose transplants  failed, we determined the percentage who died, received retransplants, or  received dialysis during the follow-up periods, by age group. These  outcome groups are not mutually exclusive; for example, if an individual  received both dialysis and a subsequent retransplant, the individual is  counted in both groups. A recipient who died after a transplant failure  could have received dialysis or a retransplant between date of failure and  date of death. Those recipients who had dates of failure but no subsequent  treatment information or dates of death were excluded from our analysis.  We included only transplant recipients in the 50 states and the District of  Columbia.", "To compare the percentage of transplant failures and subsequent  outcomes of kidney transplant recipients by type of health insurance  coverage, we used data through December 31, 2004, from the USRDS on  individuals who received kidney-only transplants from 1997 through 2000.  The USRDS maintains health insurance information under three  categories: Medicare but not Medicaid, Medicare and Medicaid, and Other.  There were 33,702 recipients with Medicare but not Medicaid, 12,139  recipients with Medicare and Medicaid, and 7,465 recipients in the Other  category who met this criterion. Using the same three categories, we  determined the frequency of transplant failures by type of health insurance  coverage at 1 year, 3 years, 5 years, and 7 years after the transplant and we  grouped the frequencies by the follow-up periods. For recipients whose  transplants failed, we determined the percentage who died, received  retransplants, or received dialysis during the follow-up periods.

There were 669 pediatric  beneficiaries, 1,264 transitional beneficiaries, and 33,557 adult  beneficiaries who met this criterion. For beneficiaries with functioning  transplants, we summed the Medicare costs from their posttransplant  hospital discharge dates through December 31, 2004. For beneficiaries  whose transplants failed and who subsequently died, we summed the  Medicare costs from their transplant failure dates through the dates of  death and annualized any portion incurred during a period that was less  than a full year. For beneficiaries whose transplants failed but who did not  die, we summed the Medicare costs from their transplant failure dates  through December 31, 2004. For beneficiaries with functioning  transplants and for those whose transplants failed, we calculated the  median annual cost per beneficiary in each age group. For each of the four  objectives, we included only transplant recipients in the 50 states and the  District of Columbia.

We also interviewed  representatives of the National Kidney Foundation, the Forum of ESRD  Networks, and the American Society of Pediatric Nephrology. Of the 251  pediatric transplant centers in the United States, we interviewed  representatives from 6 centers that treat a high number of pediatric  recipients.

As of the end of 2004, of the approximately 480,000 adults with ESRD  (those at least 18 years old), just over one-fourth (about 130,000) had  functioning kidney transplants and two-thirds (about 330,000) were  receiving dialysis treatments. In addition, of the almost 5,700 pediatric  individuals with ESRD (those younger than 18 years old), approximately  two-thirds (about 3,800) had functioning transplants and less than one- third (about 1,700) were receiving dialysis treatments.", "A kidney transplant is the preferred method of treatment for individuals  with ESRD because it increases an individual\u2019s quality of life and  decreases long-term mortality rates compared with lifetime dialysis  treatments. Studies have reported that pediatric ESRD patients tend to  perform better developmentally with transplants than on dialysis.

Medicare also covers hospital inpatient  services and outpatient services, such as physician visits and laboratory  tests, as well as medical evaluations provided to living donors and  recipients in anticipation of transplants. In addition to Medicare,  individuals with ESRD may be covered by other public or private health  insurance, such as Medicaid or an employer-sponsored health plan. For  individuals who are eligible for Medicare on the basis of ESRD, Medicare  is the secondary payer if the individuals have employer-sponsored group  health insurance coverage during the first 30 months of Medicare  coverage. After the first 30 months, Medicare becomes the primary payer  for these beneficiaries until they are no longer entitled to Medicare.
