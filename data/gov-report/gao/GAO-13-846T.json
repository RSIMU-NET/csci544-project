It is important for DHS to address these shortcomings because the department invests extensively in acquisition programs to help it execute its many critical missions. DHS is acquiring systems to help secure the border, increase marine safety, enhance cyber security, and execute a wide variety of other operations.

It also reflects observations from ongoing work for this subcommittee. For that work, GAO is reviewing key documentation, and interviewing headquarters and component level acquisition and financial management officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO has previously established that the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) acquisition policy reflects many sound program management practices intended to mitigate the risks of cost growth and schedule slips. The policy largely reflects the knowledge-based approach used by leading commercial firms, which do not pursue major investments without demonstrating, at critical milestones, that their products are likely to meet cost, schedule, and performance objectives. DHS policy requires that important acquisition documents be in place and approved before programs are executed. For example, one key document is an acquisition program baseline, which outlines a program's expected cost, schedule, and the capabilities to be delivered to the end user. However, in September 2012, GAO found that the department did not implement the policy consistently, and that only 4 of 66 programs had all of the required documents approved in accordance with DHS's policy. GAO made five recommendations, which DHS concurred with, identifying actions DHS should take to mitigate the risk of poor acquisition outcomes and strengthen management activities. Further, GAO reported that the lack of reliable performance data hindered DHS and congressional oversight of the department's major programs. Officials explained that DHS's culture had emphasized the need to rapidly execute missions more than sound acquisition management practices. GAO also reported that most of the department's major programs cost more than expected, took longer to deploy than planned, or delivered less capability than promised. DHS has taken steps to improve acquisition management, but as part of its ongoing work, GAO found that DHS recently waived documentation requirements for 42 programs fielded for operational use since 2008. DHS explained it would be cost prohibitive and inefficient to recreate documentation for previous acquisition phases. GAO plans to obtain more information on this decision and its effect on the management of DHS's major acquisitions. DHS's July 2013 status assessment indicated that, as of the end of fiscal year 2012, many major programs still face cost and schedule shortfalls. DHS expects to provide another update in the near future.", "In December 2012, DHS's Chief Financial Officer reported that the department faced a 30 percent gap between expected funding requirements for major acquisition programs and available resources. DHS has efforts underway to develop a more disciplined and strategic approach to managing its portfolio of major investments, but the department has not yet developed certain policies and processes that could help address its affordability issues. In September 2012, GAO reported that DHS largely made investment decisions on a program-by-program and component-by-component basis and did not have a process to systematically prioritize its major investments. In GAO's work at the Department of Defense, it has found this approach hinders efforts to achieve a balanced mix of programs that are affordable and feasible and that provide the greatest return on investment. DHS's proposed Integrated Investment Life Cycle Model (IILCM) is intended to improve portfolio management by ensuring mission needs drive investment decisions. For example, a high-level oversight body would identify potential trade-offs among DHS's component agencies. GAO has recommended such an oversight body for several years. Full implementation of the IILCM may be several years away. GAO will continue to assess the department's progress in its ongoing work."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement.

Over the past  several years, our work has identified significant shortcomings in the  department\u2019s ability to manage an expanding portfolio of major  acquisitions, and in response to our recommendations, DHS has taken  steps to improve acquisition management. We believe it is important for  DHS to continue to address these shortcomings because the department  invests extensively in acquisition programs to help it execute its many  critical missions. DHS and its underlying components are acquiring  systems to help secure the border, increase marine safety, screen  travelers, enhance cyber security, improve disaster response, and  execute a wide variety of other operations.

This statement discusses (1) DHS\u2019s acquisition policy and how it has  been implemented; and (2) DHS\u2019s mechanisms for managing emerging  affordability issues. For our prior work, we surveyed all 77 major  acquisition program offices that DHS identified in 2011 and achieved a 92  percent response rate. We also reviewed all available department-level  acquisition decisions from November 2008 to April 2012 and interviewed  acquisition officials at DHS headquarters and components. To determine  the extent to which DHS has policies in place to effectively manage  individual acquisition programs, as well as the department\u2019s acquisition  portfolio as a whole, we compared our key acquisition management  practices to DHS acquisition policy, and identified the extent to which  DHS has implemented its policy. More detailed information on our scope  and methodology for our prior work can be found in the relevant reports.  To support our ongoing audit, from March to September 2013, we  reviewed key documentation and interviewed acquisition and financial  management officials at DHS headquarters and components to  understand DHS\u2019s affordability issues and the department\u2019s plans to  address these issues.

We also reported that DHS\u2019s lack of reliable performance data not  only hindered its internal acquisition management efforts, but also limited  congressional oversight. We made five recommendations to the  Secretary of Homeland Security at that time, identifying specific actions  DHS should take to mitigate the risk of poor acquisition outcomes and  strengthen the department\u2019s investment management activities. DHS  concurred with all five recommendations, and is taking steps to address  them, most notably through policy updates.", "Since that time, we have continued to assess DHS\u2019s acquisition  management activities and the reliability of the department\u2019s performance  data. We currently have a review underway for this subcommittee  assessing the extent to which DHS is executing effective executive  oversight and governance (including the quality of the data used) of a  major effort to modernize an information technology system, TECS.  TECS is a major border enforcement system used for preventing  terrorism, providing border security and law enforcement information  about people who are inadmissible or may pose a threat to the security of  the United States.

As part of our ongoing  work, we analyzed a recent PARM assessment that suggests many of the  department\u2019s major acquisition programs are continuing to struggle. In its  July 2013 quarterly program assessment, PARM reported that it had  assessed 112 major acquisition programs.

This acknowledgment  was a positive step toward addressing the department\u2019s challenges, in  that it clearly identified the need to improve the affordability of the  department\u2019s major acquisition portfolio. Additionally, the Chief Financial  Officer has required component senior financial officers to certify that they  have reviewed and validated all current-, prior-, and future-year funding  information presented in ARB materials, and ensure it is consistent with  the FYHSP. Additionally, through our ongoing work, PA&E officials told us  that the magnitude of the actual funding gap may be even greater than  suggested because only a small portion of the cost estimates that  informed the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s analysis had been approved at the  department level, and expected costs may increase as DHS improves the  quality of the estimates.

This  approach, known as portfolio management, requires companies to view  each of their investments as contributing to a collective whole, rather than  as independent and unrelated.", "With an enterprise perspective, companies can effectively (1) identify and  prioritize opportunities, and (2) allocate available resources to support the  highest priority\u2014or most promising\u2014investment opportunities. Over the  past several years, we have examined the practices that private and  public sector entities use to achieve a balanced mix of new projects, and  based on this work, we have identified key practice areas for portfolio  management. One I would like to highlight today is that investments  should be ranked and selected using a disciplined process to assess the  costs, benefits, and risks of alternative products to ensure transparency  and comparability across alternatives.", "In this regard, DHS established the Joint Requirements Council (JRC) in  2003, to identify crosscutting opportunities and common requirements  among DHS components and help determine how DHS should use its  resources. But the JRC stopped meeting in 2006 after the chair was  assigned to other duties within the department. In 2008, we  recommended that it be reinstated, or that DHS establish another joint  requirements oversight board, and DHS officials recognized that  strengthening the JRC was a top priority. Through our ongoing work, we  have identified that DHS recently piloted a Capabilities and Requirements  Council (CRC) to serve in a similar role as the JRC. The CRC began  reviewing a portfolio of cyber capabilities in the summer of 2013. The pilot  is intended to inform the department\u2019s fiscal year 2015 budget request;  therefore, it is too soon to assess the outcomes of this new oversight  body. It is also unknown at this time how DHS will sustain the CRC over  time or what its outcomes will be.", "In addition to private and public sector practices, which we discuss above,  our prior work at DOD has identified an oversight body similar to the  CRC\u2019s expected function. The Joint Requirements Oversight Council  (JROC) has a number of statutory responsibilities related to the  identification, validation, and prioritization of joint military requirements.", "This body, which has been required by law since 1997, and its supporting  organizations review requirements documents several times per year,  prior to major defense acquisition programs\u2019 key milestones. Through  these reviews, proposed acquisition programs are scrutinized prior to  their initiation and before decisions are made to begin production. The  JROC also takes measures to help ensure the programs are affordable.  In 2011, we reported that the JROC required the military services to show  that their proposed programs were fully funded before it validated  requirements for five of the seven proposed programs we reviewed. The  two other proposed programs were funded at more than 97 and 99  percent, respectively. This full funding requirement is similar to the  funding certification requirement DHS\u2019s CFO established in December  2012. While some DOD acquisition programs continue to experience cost  growth and schedule delays, as identified in our annual report on weapon  systems acquisitions, the department does have in place mechanisms  that DHS could adopt to improve the affordability of its acquisition  portfolio, and put its acquisition programs in a better position to achieve  successful outcomes.", "In September 2012, we reported that the CRC is one of several new  councils and offices that DHS would establish as part of its Integrated  Investment Life Cycle Model (IILCM), which is intended to improve  portfolio management at DHS through the identification of priorities and  capability gaps. This model, which the department proposed in January  2011, would provide a framework for information to flow between councils  and offices responsible for strategic direction, requirements development,  resource allocation, and program governance. DHS explained that the  IILCM would ensure that mission needs drive investment decisions.", "While the IILCM, as envisioned, could improve DHS management  decisions by better linking missions to acquisition outcomes, our ongoing  work indicates that its full implementation may be several years away.  From January 2011 to June 2012, the schedule for initiating IILCM  operations slipped by a year, and in May 2013, a DHS official responsible  for the IILCM told us he was unsure when the IILCM would be fully  operational. We also found that some component acquisition officials are  not aware of how the IILCM would apply to their own acquisition  portfolios. Some of the officials we interviewed told us that DHS  leadership needs to conduct more outreach and training about the IILCM  and how it is expected to work, and a DHS headquarters official told us  that the department is in the process of implementing an initial  department-wide IILCM communications strategy. We will continue to  assess the department\u2019s progress in implementing what it views as a very  important management model.", "Chairman Duncan, Ranking Member Barber, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
