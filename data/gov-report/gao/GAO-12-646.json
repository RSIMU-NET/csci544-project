Since 1972, GSA has funded its real property acquisition, operation, maintenance, and disposal through the rent it collects from tenant agencies that is deposited into the FBF. GAO has previously reported, however, that the FBF has faced difficulty providing sufficient resources to support GSA\u0092s mission.", "GAO was asked to examine (1) the factors affecting the resources in the FBF, (2) GSA\u0092s potential repair liability and the implications for the FBF, and (3) the information GSA considers when evaluating capital investments and how these practices compare to leading practices for prioritizing capital investments. GAO reviewed legislation and GSA documents and compared leading practices on making capital investment decisions from OMB and GAO capital planning guidance to GSA practices. GAO also analyzed budget and financial data from fiscal years 2006 through 2012, facility condition data from fiscal year 2011, and interviewed GSA officials and OMB staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Buildings Fund\u0092s (FBF) balance has increased from $56 million in fiscal year 2007 to $2.2 billion in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to the growing difference between the resources provided to the FBF and the General Services Administration\u0092s (GSA) use of these funds as determined through the budgeting and appropriations process. In the last 2 years, Congress has provided fewer resources than requested by the executive branch and generated by the FBF. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) staff and GSA officials stated that if GSA were able to spend all of the funds collected by the FBF each year, these funds would generally be sufficient to fund GSA\u0092s needs. However, GSA, through the annual President\u0092s Budget Request, has sought less obligational authority than the balance available in the fund. While the FBF\u0092s balance has increased, various factors have limited the fund\u0092s income. Funds from operations\u0097revenue less costs excluding depreciation\u0097that contribute to FBF income have declined from 2006 to 2011 when adjusted for inflation. Revenues have declined while costs have outstripped inflation over this time period. In addition, portions of GSA\u0092s inventory operate at a loss. For example, about 30 percent of GSA\u0092s owned assets lost money in 2011, while GSA\u0092s total leased portfolio lost about $75 million. Despite the losses in its leased portfolio, GSA continues to rely extensively on leasing. GSA is taking steps to reduce the size of its overall real estate portfolio.", "GSA has identified $4.6 billion in maintenance and repairs expected from 2012 to 2021 and anticipates that nearly a quarter of this amount is needed immediately. However, funding for maintenance and repairs has declined since 2006. GSA officials noted that reduced funding for capital reinvestments could result in deferred maintenance and repairs, and increase the cost and extent of such work in the future. These concerns are consistent with the National Research Council\u0092s findings that each $1 in deferred maintenance and repair work results in a long-term capital liability of $4 to $5.", "GSA\u0092s use of information to make capital investment decisions conforms to some leading practices from GAO and OMB guidance, but GSA lacks a transparent process for prioritizing projects and a comprehensive long-term capital plan that fully aligns with leading practices. GSA keeps a baseline of information on its assets and needs\u0097as leading practices suggest\u0097through various tools and databases. GSA\u0092s process and guidance for evaluating capital investment alternatives substantially meet leading practices as its project planning process explores alternatives to meeting investment needs. GSA\u0092s process for prioritizing capital investments partially meets leading practices, but its project prioritization transparency could be improved by laying out in its annual budget submission how it uses its criteria to determine which projects get selected for funding over others. In addition, an improved comprehensive long-term capital plan could further GSA\u0092s ability to make informed choices about long-term investment decisions. Both OMB and GAO guidance emphasize the importance of developing a long-term capital plan to guide the implementation of organizational goals. Having such a plan would enable GSA and Congress to better evaluate a range of priorities over the next 5 years. In short, more transparency through a comprehensive long-term capital plan would allow for more informed decision making by GSA and Congress among competing priorities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA (1) document in its budget submission how it prioritizes capital investments and (2) develop and annually submit a 5-year long-term capital plan to OMB and Congress.

To  provide a predictable source of revenue for the General Services  Administration (GSA) to manage its real estate portfolio, the Public  Buildings Act Amendments of 1972 established the Federal Buildings  Fund (FBF). Since that time, GSA has collected rent from tenant  agencies, deposited it into the FBF, and used that money to fund its real  property acquisition, operation, maintenance, and disposal. Currently,  funds from the FBF support nearly 10,000 assets\u2014including about 1,500  GSA-owned buildings and 8,100 GSA-leased buildings\u2014which provide  an inventory of more than 370 million square feet of workspace for 1.1  million federal employees.", "Historically, however, the fund has not generated sufficient revenues to  meet all needs. We reported in 1981 that the then 9-year-old fund faced  difficulty funding GSA\u2019s real property expenses because it did not  generate sufficient revenue from the rental of its assets. We reported in 2000 that GSA had struggled to fund the capital repairs identified at its  buildings and that GSA faced a potential repair liability of billions of  dollars.

Instead of GSA receiving  direct appropriations, the FBF operates as the primary means of financing  the operating and capital costs associated with federal space, but GSA  sometimes receives supplemental appropriations to meet repair or new  construction needs. The FBF is financed by income from rental charges  assessed to tenant agencies occupying GSA-owned and -leased space  that approximate commercial rates for comparable space and services.  GSA appraises its inventory on a 5-year cycle\u2014approximately 20 percent  of its owned inventory annually\u2014 and charges rent based on rates for  comparable assets in the private sector. GSA charges its tenants in  space leased from the private sector rates equal to the cost of the lease  plus either a 7 percent (for cancelable assignments) or 5 percent (for  noncancelable assignments) administrative fee to cover its management  costs. During fiscal year 2011, GSA deposited about $9 billion into the  fund. GSA\u2019s lease payments have increased over the last decade as  leased space has grown to comprise more than half of GSA\u2019s current total  portfolio. Starting in 2008, GSA has leased more space than it owns; at  the end of fiscal year 2011, leased square footage exceeded owned, 193  million to 182 million (51 percent).", "Congress exercises control over the FBF through the appropriations  process that sets annual limits\u2014called obligational authority\u2014on how  much of the fund can be obligated for various activities. GSA, as an  executive branch agency, requests obligational authority from Congress  as part of the annual President\u2019s Budget Request. In annual  appropriations legislation, Congress provides obligational authority to  GSA to incur obligations and make expenditures from the FBF in five  categories of activities:  1.  Rental of Space \u2013 funds leases of privately owned space or buildings  for federal agencies.  2.  Repairs and Alterations \u2013 funds repairs and alterations of existing  buildings as well as associated design and construction services.  3.  Construction and Acquisition of Facilities \u2013 funds the construction or  purchase of facilities and major extensions to existing buildings.  4.  Building Operations and Maintenance \u2013 funds services for  government-owned and -leased facilities, including cleaning, utilities  and fuel, maintenance, miscellaneous services (such as moving),  evaluation of new materials and equipment, and field and general  management and administration.  5.  Installment Acquisition Payments \u2013 funds debt incurred as the result  of building acquisition and lease purchase arrangements.", "Revenue from GSA\u2019s owned facility inventory is the main source of the  FBF\u2019s operating income used to fund repair and alteration, new  construction activities, and operations and maintenance.

The increased balance has primarily  resulted from the growing difference between the resources deposited  into the FBF and use of these funds as determined through the budgeting  and appropriations process. Specifically, the total available balance is a  function of the resources deposited into the fund, the amount of  obligational authority requested by GSA as part of the President\u2019s Budget  Request, and the actual obligational authority provided by Congress.Beginning in fiscal year 2007, the total resources deposited into the FBF  have exceeded the obligational authority provided by Congress. (See  table 1.) According to OMB staff, a portion of the growth in the FBF\u2019s  balance is attributable to inaccuracy in GSA\u2019s estimation of its rental  revenues. The result of these budgetary and appropriations actions has  been the near quadrupling of the fund balance in the last 2 years.", "In using authority to direct the expenditure of public funds and establish  priorities among federal programs, Congress decides whether to fund a  particular program or activity, and if so, sets the level of that funding. In  the case of the FBF, Congress has provided in the last 2 fiscal years less  obligational authority to GSA than was requested in the President\u2019s  Budget Request. For example, in fiscal year 2012 Congress provided  about 16 percent less than the President\u2019s Budget Request. In addition, in  both 2011 and 2012 Congress provided less obligational authority than  funds deposited into the FBF. According to OMB staff and GSA officials,  Congress provided less obligational authority than requested to balance  competing priorities among government programs and meet spending  caps.", "OMB staff and GSA officials stated that the funds collected by the FBF  might sufficiently support GSA\u2019s projects for its assets. For example,  OMB staff stated that if GSA were able to spend all of the funds collected  by the FBF each year, these funds would generally be sufficient to fund  GSA\u2019s identified repairs and alterations projects and a modest new  construction program. GSA officials noted that when Congress provides  less obligational authority than requested, repairs and alterations and new  construction projects are the most affected because available funds must  first be used to pay leasing, operations and maintenance, and debt costs.  GSA officials also stated that the authorization to obligate and spend the  balance of funds in the FBF, which it anticipates will double to $4.5 billion  by the end of fiscal year 2013, would enhance the agency\u2019s ability to  manage its real property portfolio by ensuring that operations and  maintenance are sufficiently funded and that capital investments, such as  repairs and alterations and new construction projects, can continue to be  made. However, OMB staff stressed that the current FBF balance is not  available for obligation and that in order to make additional obligations  from the fund, congressional action would be needed.", "While the appropriations process has resulted in less obligational  authority for GSA than was sought in the President\u2019s Budget Request, the  agency has not always communicated through its annual budget request  to Congress its interest in reducing the fund\u2019s balance by increasing  spending. Rather, since 2008, GSA has consistently requested  obligational authority less than the total resources available in the fund.  Also since 2008, GSA has only twice requested an amount of obligational  authority that would reduce the existing fund balance, meaning that it  requested more obligational authority than funds deposited for that year.  Specifically, GSA requested to reduce the existing FBF balance by about  30 percent in 2011 and 13 percent in 2012. GSA officials stated that in  preparing their budget requests they work with OMB to discuss their  needs in relation to competing priorities from other executive branch  agencies.

These factors include an imbalance between revenue and costs,  decreased revenue from underperforming assets, and a reliance on  leasing.", "GSA\u2019s owned assets generate most of the resources used for capital  improvements. From 2006 through 2011, the financial performance of  these assets has stagnated despite GSA\u2019s increasing the amount of  rentable square feet in its owned portfolio from 174 million to 182 million  square feet. As measured by funds from operations\u2014meaning revenue  less costs excluding depreciation\u2014GSA generated approximately $1.6  billion from its owned assets in 2006 and a nearly identical amount in  2011, though the annual amount varied during this time period. When  taking the effects of inflation into account, we found that the real value of  the funds from operations generated by GSA\u2019s owned assets and  measured in 2006 dollars has decreased by 9 percent over this time.(See fig. 1.)", "Funds from operations generated by GSA\u2019s owned assets have been  affected by declining revenue and rising costs.", "Revenue. Since 2006, revenue growth has not kept pace with  inflation. Specifically, the revenue from GSA\u2019s owned portfolio  adjusted for inflation has decreased by 2 percent. GSA officials said  that revenue generated by its owned assets is highly dependent upon  the fair annual rent appraisal of the asset which, in turn, is based on  the value of rental charges at comparable private sector properties.  GSA officials noted that from 2006 to 2011, increased commercial  office vacancies contributed to soft rental markets and minimal growth  in rental rates. According to these officials, changes in revenue  primarily reflect the downward pressure on GSA\u2019s rental rates caused  by market conditions.", "Costs. Since 2006, costs associated with operating, maintaining, and  repairing GSA\u2019s owned facilities have risen faster than inflation. GSA\u2019s  annual operating costs, representing the direct costs of operating its  facilities (including utilities, janitorial services, and routine  maintenance) have risen by about 6 percent total in constant dollars  from 2006 to 2011, though year to year these costs are volatile and  can vary significantly. GSA officials stated that reasons for the  increase in operating costs include general inflation in utilities,  maintenance, and administrative costs. Furthermore, GSA estimates  that construction costs have increased since 2005. We found that  from October 2005 to September 2011, for example, construction  costs rose by nearly 20 percent, or by nearly twice the general rate of  inflation, eroding the value of FBF resources generated to fund capital  repairs and construction.", "GSA officials also noted that, with decreased obligational authority, the  growing amount and cost of leased space in its portfolio have reduced the  proportion of obligational authority available to fund repairs and  alterations that could potentially reduce operating costs in its owned  portfolio. From 2006 through 2011, obligational authority for the  acquisition of leased space increased from $3.9 billion (49 percent of  obligational authority) to $4.8 billion (62 percent) as the amount of leased  space increased from 172 million to 193 million square feet. At the same  time, obligational authority for repairs and alterations has decreased from  $1.1 billion (14 percent of obligational authority) in 2006 to $341 million (4  percent) in 2011.", "While the FBF as a whole has generated positive funds from operations,  portions of GSA\u2019s inventory operate at a loss. For example, within its  owned portfolio, about 30 percent of GSA\u2019s assets lose money in a given  year. In fiscal year 2011, the loss from these assets was $170 million, and  GSA has incurred a similar loss on that portion of its portfolio each year  from 2006 to 2010. These assets tended to be older and smaller than  other assets in the owned portfolio.losses are attributable to about 200 assets, each of which lost more than  $100,000 in 2011. GSA officials noted that in some cases, operating an  asset at a loss can be more cost effective in the short term than the cost  of acquiring new space, moving an agency, and disposing of the asset.  GSA officials further explained that there are various reasons they retain  facilities that generate losses, for example because an asset is mission  critical, has symbolic importance, or establishes a necessary federal  presence in a sparsely populated area. For example, the Prince H.  Preston Building and Courthouse, located in Statesboro, Georgia,  provides space for the U.S. District and Bankruptcy Courts and other  agencies\u2019 facilities on an as-needed basis. However, the building has  consistently generated negative funds from operations because the  amount of space required for the federal presence in Statesboro has  decreased since the building was constructed in 1963. Specifically, while  the building was originally constructed to provide space to the Social  Security Administration and the Department of Agriculture in addition to  the Courts, both executive branch agencies have since vacated the  space. Despite the vacant space and financial losses resulting from  departure of two of its original tenants, GSA intends to retain this facility  until the Judiciary determines its long-term plan for maintaining a  presence in Southeast Georgia. GSA officials also noted that when their  managed facilities undergo major renovations, the space in those facilities  is often temporarily vacated and does not generate revenue during that  time. For example, space in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building in  Washington D.C., which is currently undergoing a multiphase renovation,  was unavailable for tenant occupancy in 2011, contributing to a $15  million operating loss for the building.", "We determined that most of these  In addition to these types of losses, GSA has formally agreed with its  tenants to provide below-market rent on about 240 assets, which has  modestly reduced revenue deposited in the FBF. In fiscal year 2011, GSA  estimated that rent restrictions reduced the revenue generated for the  FBF by about $175 million. These reduced rental rates have resulted from  a combination of GSA and congressional exemptions that have been in  place for a number of years. These exemptions were provided for a  number of reasons, including lack of funds from the tenant agencies,  agreements resulting from the sale of property from an agency to GSA,  and security concerns. For example, in 1996, GSA granted an exemption  to the Woodrow Wilson Center for the organization\u2019s use of approximately  100,000 square feet of office space in the Ronald Reagan Building and  International Trade Center in Washington, D.C. through 2026. GSA  estimates this rent exemption reduced FBF revenue by $5 million in fiscal  year 2011.", "From 2006 through 2011, as the amount of space that GSA leased from  the private sector grew from 172 million to 193 million square feet, GSA\u2019s  losses (as measured by funds from operations) on its leased assets have  increased. (See fig. 2.) Over the past 4 years, cumulative losses on its  leases have exceeded $200 million; approximately $75 million in losses  occurred in fiscal year 2011. Most of the losses in 2011 were  concentrated in about 300 leases, each of which lost more than  $100,000. Relative to the total revenue generated by its leased portfolio in  2011 ($5.6 billion), the net losses from its leased assets (about $75  million) in 2011 are comparatively small. Nevertheless, such losses  require GSA to use funds generated from other revenue sources to offset  them, which in turn decreases the funds available for investing in GSA\u2019s  owned assets.", "GSA officials noted that leasing losses have primarily resulted from  several factors, including reductions in its administrative fee, accounting  adjustments, billing and payment errors, lease buyouts and formulation  costs, and vacant space. Specifically:", "According to GSA officials, the agency reduced the administrative fee  that it charges to agencies for managing leases from the private  sector from 8 percent to 7 percent for many leases in 2008, resulting  in an estimated annual $50 million (1 percent) reduction in revenue.  According to GSA officials, because the leasing portfolio was  producing a modest surplus in 2007, GSA lowered its administrative  fee to reduce the cost of leasing for its tenant agencies. These  officials noted that, in 2011, for instances where a lease lost less than  $100,000, many of these losses are attributable to overhead  expenses that exceed revenue from administrative fees. GSA officials  explained they are currently reevaluating whether its administrative  fee is sufficient to cover the cost of the leasing program.", "According to GSA officials, their use of accrual-based accounting\u2014 where revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are  recorded when incurred, irrespective of whether any cash has flowed  in or out during the accounting period\u2014results in adjustments that  essentially level the lease payment stream throughout the life of a  lease. This adjustment can result in expenses being recorded in a  single accounting period that are greater or less than the actual lease  payment during that period. GSA estimates that, after eliminating the  impact of accounting adjustments and transactions related to the  Recovery Act, the agency lost approximately $18.5 million in the  leased portfolio during fiscal year 2011.", "Billing and other administrative errors have also contributed to losses  in its leased portfolio, according to GSA officials. For example, GSA  officials noted that the agency may begin to pay a lessor for space  before GSA has finalized the occupancy agreement with the tenant  agency and entered it into GSA\u2019s financial management system.  While GSA officials acknowledged that these funds can be recouped  from the tenant agencies after the occupancy agreement is finalized,  they estimated that these actions reduced funds from operations from  the leased portfolio by nearly $17 million in 2011.", "GSA officials also noted that lease formulation costs, lease buyouts,  and vacant space within its leased portfolio result in costs and lost  income that have contributed to losses. GSA officials explained that  when tenant agencies move out of leased space, GSA attempts to  place another tenant agency in that same space. However, between  the occupancy periods of the two tenants, GSA is responsible for  paying the cost of the space, unless GSA terminates the lease and  pays a buyout to the private sector lessor. GSA officials noted that  while the cost of a lease buyout may contribute to losses in the year of  the buyout, over the long-term, pursuing a lease buyout may reduce  the amount of vacant space in its portfolio. GSA officials noted that, as  of the end of fiscal year 2011, 2.3 percent of the space in the leased  portfolio was vacant.", "Even with these losses in its leased portfolio, GSA continues to rely  extensively on leasing to meet its tenants\u2019 increasing demand for office  space. In 2008, the amount of rentable space leased by GSA exceeded  the amount of its owned space for the first time. (See fig. 3.) GSA officials  noted that, as a result of the funding constraints in recent years discussed  earlier in this report, the agency has primarily used leasing to meet new  office space requirements of its tenant agencies. Nevertheless, our  previous work has shown that leasing often costs more than federal  building ownership, particularly if operating leases are used to meet long- term space needs.", "GSA is taking steps to manage its financial resources more effectively by  reducing the size of its overall real estate portfolio, both in terms of the  number of assets and the amount of square feet it manages. In a June  2010 memorandum, the administration directed GSA, along with other  agencies, to accelerate efforts to identify and eliminate excess properties  and to make better use of remaining real property assets. As part of these  efforts, GSA is reducing its owned assets through the sale of excess and  underutilized property and consolidation actions. For example, according  to GSA, in 2011, it disposed of 52 assets, resulting in a reduction of 3.3  million rentable square feet of space. In addition, GSA is encouraging its  tenant agencies to use alternative working arrangements, such as  teleworking and hoteling (where personnel use unassigned seating when  they are in the office) to reduce space needs. Further, GSA officials noted  that budget constraints across the executive branch have forced its tenant  agencies to reexamine their space needs and that GSA expects demand  will continue to shrink."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GSA Has Identified Billions in Repair Liability, but Decreased Funding May Increase Future Resource Demand from the FBF", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Condition of GSA\u2019s Assets", "paragraphs": ["GSA measures its investment needs for maintaining and improving the  condition of its owned facilities through its maintenance and repair  liability, which identifies the estimated aggregated cost of future  maintenance and repairs across its portfolio.

In  addition, according to GSA, more than one-fourth of its owned buildings  are listed in or eligible for the National Register of Historic Places, the  nation\u2019s listing of historic properties. According to GSA officials, these  historic buildings require comparatively more maintenance and repair  work.

These officials noted that repairs identified now  have the potential to be more expensive if they are delayed, thereby  increasing the amount of funding needed from the FBF, possibly resulting  in an array of undesirable outcomes. For example, delayed repairs can  increase the frequency of unplanned interruptions and downtime of facility  systems and components, and can decrease the useful life of real  property. GSA officials noted some instances in which funding restrictions  delayed repair and maintenance activities, increasing the cost to operate  its existing assets. For example, they explained that GSA\u2019s Heating  Operation and Transmission District system, which provides steam and  chilled water for heating and cooling operations at approximately 80  facilities in Washington, D.C., requires substantial repair work. The delay  in modernizing key components of the system has increased the risk of  service failure during the winter months. In order to ensure the reliability  of the system, GSA has required additional staff hours from its  maintenance and engineering personnel to maintain the system,  increasing the overall plant operating costs and resulting in higher steam  charges to GSA\u2019s customer agencies. Delayed repairs could also affect  the funding generated for the FBF. Specifically, if an asset\u2019s appraisal  decreases due to its deteriorated condition, the rent charged to the tenant  agency could also decrease, resulting in less revenue for the FBF.", "The concerns of GSA officials and OMB staff are consistent with those of  the National Research Council of the National Academies which has  stated that public sector organizations facing limited resources often first  defer or cut facilities investments, particularly investments in maintenance  and repairs. The National Research Council estimates that each $1 in  deferred maintenance results in a long-term capital liability of $4 to $5,  and that \u201can accumulation of deferred investments over the long term  may be significantly greater than the short-term savings that public-sector  decision makers were initially seeking.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GSA Could Better Conform Some of Its Capital Planning to Leading Practices", "paragraphs": ["Making informed capital investment decisions requires full information  about an agency\u2019s current and long-term needs, alternative courses of  action, and how potential projects compare amongst each other.

In recent years,  budgeting and appropriations decisions made by the executive branch  and Congress, respectively, have limited the amount of resources made  available to GSA to fund its real property operations. The FBF is further  constrained by other factors including the declining value of revenue,  growing operating costs, and an increased reliance on leasing, among  other things. These conditions make it increasingly difficult for GSA to  maintain its real property portfolio in an acceptable state of repair. As  GSA works to address the maintenance and repair needs of its assets  and improve the overall condition of its portfolio, it is important that the  agency base its actions on a well-conceived investment strategy. GSA  follows many leading practices to gather and evaluate information from its  assets to inform its investment decisions, but it is not clear how it  prioritizes and selects projects for funding consideration. In addition, the  agency\u2019s lack of a comprehensive long-term capital plan could limit its  ability to provide perspective on how funding for requested projects aligns  with its long-term investment strategy. Having such a plan would enable  GSA and Congress to better evaluate the full range of real property  priorities for using funds in the FBF both over the next 5 years and  annually and, should fiscal constraints so dictate, identify which might  take precedence over others. In short, more transparency would allow for  more informed decision making among competing priorities. Without more  insight into how GSA prioritizes repair and replacement of its assets, GSA  cannot ensure that decision makers within the executive branch and  Congress understand why the projects proposed by GSA merit selection  when measured against competing priorities, both within and outside of  GSA\u2019s portfolio."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance transparency, allow for more informed decision making  related to GSA\u2019s real property priorities, and make a stronger case for  using funds in the FBF to meet capital investment needs, we recommend  that the Administrator of GSA take the following two actions:", "Document in its annual budget request to OMB how GSA uses its  prioritization criteria to generate its annual and 5-year lists of  prioritized projects to ensure that Congress understands the rationale  behind prioritized project lists and that GSA is maximizing return on  FBF investments.", "Develop and publish a comprehensive 5-year capital plan and include  a summary of it annually in its budget request to OMB and Congress  to help ensure that long-term goals are fully considered when making  decisions and to document how GSA would spend needed FBF funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to GSA and OMB for review and  comment.

We also analyzed GSA information on rent  restrictions and exemptions granted to its tenant agencies to understand  how these agreements have affected the resources in the FBF.

We also analyzed information from  Pegasys, GSA\u2019s financial management system. In particular, we obtained  and analyzed information on the revenues, costs and various metrics,  including funds from operations, used by GSA to describe the financial  condition for each asset to provide a summary description of GSA\u2019s  financial performance.", "We also analyzed financial data from the FBF using indices to account for  inflation. To understand how the value of the revenue generated and cost  incurred by the FBF had changed since 2006, we used a chain-weighted  Gross Domestic Product index based on data from the averages of  quarterly indexes from U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of  Economic Analysis, National Income and Product Accounts, table 1.1.4  (last revised Jan. 21, 2012). To measure how construction costs had  changed since 2006, we used the Engineering News-Record\u2019s  Construction Cost Index to calculate the increase in construction costs  from October 2005 to September 2011.
