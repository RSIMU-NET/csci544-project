A significant proportion of software used by the Government is comprised  of either preexisting Federal solutions or commercial solutions. These  solutions include, among others, open source software (OSS). OSS is  software developed from source code that is obtained under a license  that allows it to be modified, shared, and reused. When Federal  agencies are unable to identify an existing Federal or commercial  software solution that satisfies their specific needs, they may choose to  develop a custom software solution on their own or pay for its  development. However, when agencies procure custom-developed  source code they do not necessarily make their new code broadly  available as OSS for government-wide reuse. According to the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), even when agencies are in a position to  make their source code available on a government-wide basis, they do  not make such code available to other agencies in a consistent manner.  These challenges may result in duplicative acquisitions for substantially  similar code and an inefficient use of taxpayer dollars.", "On August 8, 2016, OMB issued memorandum M-16-21 that established  requirements for federal agencies to improve the way they buy, build, and  deliver software solutions through the use of OSS code.

Two requirements establish the pilot  program: (1) releasing at least 20 percent of newly custom-developed  code each year as OSS for the term of the pilot program, and (2)  developing a metric to gauge the performance of the pilot program. The  other four requirements support the implementation of the pilot program:  (1) issuing an OSS policy, (2) conducting an OSS analysis, (3) securing  data rights and inventorying custom code, and (4) facilitating the OSS  community.

Two  requirements establish the OSS pilot program: (1) releasing at least 20  percent of newly custom-developed code each year for the term of the  pilot program, and (2) developing a metric to gauge the performance of  the pilot program. The other four requirements support the  implementation of the pilot program: (1) issuing an OSS policy, (2)  conducting an OSS analysis, (3) securing data rights and inventorying  custom code, and (4) facilitating the OSS community. We met with  officials from OMB to collect background information on the selection of  requirements for the pilot program established in memorandum M-16-21.  We also met with officials from the Office of the DOD Chief Information  Officer (CIO) and the Defense Digital Service to discuss the status of the  department\u2019s implementation of the OSS pilot program.", "We reviewed DOD\u2019s June 8, 2018 report to Congress and its October  2018 memorandum that details the department\u2019s plans to implement the  pilot program and compared them to the six requirements. To determine  the extent to which the pilot program had been implemented, we  evaluated DOD\u2019s efforts to address each of the requirements using a 3- stage gradient scale (implemented, partially implemented, and not  implemented). The requirement was assessed to be fully implemented if  DOD provided us with sufficient evidence that the requirement had been  fully met. We assessed a requirement to be partially implemented if DOD  provided us with documentation of initial plans or had initiated action  towards implementing the requirement. We determined that a  requirement was not implemented when DOD did not provide us with  documentation of planned or initiated actions to implement the  requirement.", "To address the second objective on views of various responsible DOD  officials, using professional judgement, we selected components across  the department responsible for the management and development of  OSS. The scope of stakeholders selected represent department-wide  nongeneralizable views including military components, defense agencies,  and other offices. At least one representative was selected from the  following components: (1) Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition and Sustainment, (2) Office of the DOD CIO, (3) office of a  military service CIO, (4) Military Service Software Center or Command  Center, (5) the Defense Information Systems Agency, and (6) the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. We conducted interviews  with DOD officials from the following entities: Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment; Office of the DOD  CIO; Offices of the Navy and Marine Corps CIOs; Office of the Air Force  Chief Technology Officer; Army Communications Electronics Command;  the Defense Information Systems Agency; the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  the Air Force for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.", "In order to summarize and report the views of the responsible DOD  officials, we conducted structured interviews with representatives from the  selected components.

The  contents of each interview were reviewed and summarized to identify the  general views of OSS and on the anticipated implementation of the pilot  program requirements established in OMB\u2019s memorandum. We noted  similarities and differences in the responses provided by the officials in  the use of OSS including, but not limited to, potential benefits of using  OSS, managing associated risk, and opinions on implementing the pilot  program in compliance with the OMB memorandum.", "Discussions were split into two topic areas: practices on the use of OSS,  and OMB\u2019s memorandum to establish an OSS pilot program. Specifically,  the discussion topics were presented during each meeting as follows:  Part I: Practices on the use of OSS", "Your experience or your organization\u2019s history with the practice of  using OSS as a means to achieve cost reduction or efficiencies when  buying, building, or delivering information technology and software  solutions.", "The processes or practices that you or your organization perform to  leverage open source code for projects that require the acquisition or  development of custom source code.", "The extent to which you or your organization shares or uses open  source software. For example, do you share or use open source  software: (1) within your organization only, (2) across the DOD with  other military services or defense agencies, (3) with other federal  agencies, or (4) outside the federal government with the public.
