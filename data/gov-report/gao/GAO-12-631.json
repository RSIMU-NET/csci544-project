In the seven compacts that ended in 2010 and 2011--Honduras, Cape Verde, Nicaragua, Vanuatu, Georgia, Armenia, and Benin--transportation infrastructure projects generally received about 50 percent of the compact's total funding. To measure the results of its compacts, MCC sets targets for various performance indicators--such as number of kilometers paved or volume of merchandise passing through a port--and estimates the number of beneficiaries. This report, responding to a congressional mandate, examines the extent to which MCC has, for transportation infrastructure projects, (1) achieved expected performance targets and (2) consistently estimated numbers of beneficiaries. GAO analyzed MCC documents, interviewed MCC officials, and drew on fieldwork completed for related work in four of the seven countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC)--a U.S. government corporation-- recognizes the importance of a disciplined, transparent, and accountable approach to tracking compact results. However, it reduced the scopes of its early transportation infrastructure projects and reports mixed success in meeting key performance targets. In addition, problems with data quality call into question the reliability of those reported results. GAO found the following for the seven compacts ending in 2010 and 2011, each with a road project or a port project. Road Projects: (1) MCC reduced kilometers to be paved under six compacts--Honduras, Cape Verde, Nicaragua, Vanuatu, Georgia, and Armenia--by a combined 63 percent (from about 1,800 to 600 km) because of increased construction costs and political problems in partner governments. MCC reported meeting reduced targets for five compacts. However, for three compacts, MCC did not consistently account for kilometers completed with funding from third parties. (2) MCC reported meeting revised targets for road roughness--a measure of pavement quality--for five of the compacts. However, reported data have quality issues, including the inconsistent application of measurement methodologies and calculation errors that resulted in overstated results. (3) MCC reported meeting targets for annual average daily traffic--a measure of the volume of traffic using the road--for three of the compacts. However, weaknesses in traffic baseline estimates may have affected the establishment of targets and therefore MCC's ability to measure results. Port Projects: (1) In Cape Verde, MCC funding ($53.7 million) was insufficient to construct all planned port elements. As a result, MCC reduced the project's scope and deferred measuring the results of key indicators. (2) In Benin, MCC completed most of the envisioned scope of the port project. MCC's data show that the compact met the original target for one of three key performance indicators, volume of merchandise. (The other two indicators relate to the measurement of shipping costs.) However, GAO found that MCC's estimation of this indicator's baseline may lead to overstated results. In addition, data quality reviews identified problems with the data used, which MCA-Benin did not formally address. In 2009, MCC improved its methodology for estimating beneficiaries--people who realize income gains or expenditure savings as a result of its investment--by standardizing its approach. MCC subsequently revised its beneficiary numbers for all compacts. However, the new approach did not include a formal quality review process. As a result, implementation of the new approach suffered from varying degrees of quality problems. For example, (1) MCC did not implement its beneficiary estimation methodology consistently across early transportation infrastructure projects; (2) beneficiary calculations contained incorrect formulas and numbers, and differed from supporting documents; and (3) beneficiary figures in MCC's public documents were sometimes inaccurate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["MCC should strengthen existing policies and practices regarding measuring and evaluating results data and formalize a quality review process to improve its beneficiary calculations.

MCC\u2019s core principles include assessing the results of its funding  to determine how its activities affect poverty and economic growth.

Therefore, MCC requires partner countries to create a monitoring and  evaluation plan that they update throughout the course of the compact.  The plan\u2019s monitoring component outlines the performance indicators by  which the compact results will be measured. It also establishes a  performance target for each indicator, including a baseline value (the  starting value of an indicator) and the expected year by which the target  will be achieved.

While both methods are legitimate means of  measuring roughness, they have different degrees of accuracy.  Moreover, MCC did not apply either measurement method consistently  across compacts. First, for the two countries measuring roughness  visually, Cape Verde and Vanuatu, MCC inappropriately provided the  MCAs a World Bank scale for unpaved roads to assess the paved roads.  Second, for compacts where roughness was measured mechanically, the  MCAs used different machines that had varying levels of accuracy. Third,  for three compacts\u2014Nicaragua, Honduras, and Armenia\u2014the MCAs  measured roughness on both sides of the road and then averaged these  measurements to calculate a final measure.

These varying levels of  detail suggest that the scrubs were executed in an ad hoc, rather than  consistent, manner.", "MCC uses population growth rates to estimate the number of  beneficiaries in a 20-year projection period; for each compact, MCC  publicly presents the number of beneficiaries projected for the end of the  20-year period. However, the scrub sheets we reviewed showed that  MCC sometimes computed population growth rates differently across  compacts, even when the scrubs provided the same underlying  information.", "For Honduras, MCC indicated that it took the population growth rates  for 2005, 2006, and 2007 from World Bank data and averaged the  three rates to get an average annual growth rate for the projection.", "For Georgia and Cape Verde, MCC did not use the historical growth  rates provided but instead took total population figures in 2005 and  2007 and used them to compute an average annual growth rate for  the beneficiary projection.", "For Vanuatu, MCC computed an average annual growth rate based  on four historical growth rates without specifying a source or year.", "In three of seven compacts, we found that some numbers in MCC\u2019s public  documents had not been updated or were inaccurate.", "In the case of Benin and Nicaragua, the growth rate for the year 2000 was added to the  formula. beneficiaries for the compact as a whole (143,000) was smaller than  the beneficiaries of the infrastructure project alone (300,000).", "For the Benin port project, the beneficiary estimate that appeared in a  2011 status report (8,791,832) was an original estimate from 2009  instead of the revised estimate of 16,119,058. In addition, the  supporting document accompanying the 2009 scrub spreadsheet  mistakenly reported 13,421,086 beneficiaries for the port project by  2026. However, the data in the scrub indicated that this figure referred  to the number of beneficiaries in 2020; the correct number of  projected beneficiaries for 2026 is 16,119,058.", "For Armenia, the beneficiary estimate for the road project in a 2011  publication (6,216) did not reflect a revision of the estimate done in  2009 (6,356)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["MCC recognizes the importance of a disciplined, transparent, and  accountable approach to tracking compact results to make well-informed  decisions about U.S. investments.

As such, MCC cannot confidently  compare or aggregate the results of these common indicators as  intended.", "MCC requires the establishment of baselines to measure the impact  its assistance has on partner countries. However, because some  incorrect baselines were used, results may be over- or understated.", "MCAs have not consistently fulfilled the MCC requirements that they  conduct independent data quality reviews and respond to issues the  reviews raised. As a result, MCC and its partners have missed  opportunities to improve data quality and facilitate data reporting and  aggregation.", "In addition, MCC\u2019s beneficiary calculations have problems that limit their  usefulness. Because MCC\u2019s new approach to estimating beneficiary  numbers does not include a formal quality review process, the beneficiary  estimates contain incorrect numbers and formulas and inconsistent  calculations. While the impact of these problems is generally small, the  lack of a robust, formal quality review process nonetheless calls into  question the reliability of MCC\u2019s estimates. Without a correct  representation of the compacts\u2019 results and beneficiaries, MCC,  Congress, and other key stakeholders cannot accurately evaluate the  extent to which MCC is achieving its goals of poverty reduction and  economic growth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that MCC\u2019s Chief Executive Officer take the following  four actions.", "To improve the reliability of results measurement, MCC should  improve guidance for common indicators by requiring that they are  included in data quality reviews, measured uniformly across  compacts, and reported in a standardized manner\u2014including when  third-party funding is used to complete the original scope of a project;  improve guidance for baseline measurements by requiring MCAs to  document the date, source, and methodology for establishing the  baseline; and enforce current monitoring and evaluation policy requiring MCAs to  conduct data quality reviews and to provide written comments in  response to identified issues, discussing how recommendations will  be implemented or explaining why changes may not be made.", "To ensure more accurate beneficiary numbers, MCC should  incorporate into the Guidelines for Economic and Beneficiary Analysis  a formal process for reviewing beneficiary calculations and analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, MCC stated that it agrees  with our four recommendations and outlined steps it will take or has taken  to address them.", "With respect to our first recommendation\u2014to improve guidance for  common indicators\u2014MCC stated that it has taken preliminary actions  to address it. We reviewed MCC\u2019s May 2012 Guidance on Common  Indicators and found that it defines the indicators and specifies each  indicator\u2019s unit of measurement and how each should be  disaggregated. In addition, when MCC activities are conducted jointly  with other organizations (e.g. when the activities include third-party  funding), MCC\u2019s guidance instructs MCAs to report only MCC\u2019s  contribution to a particular common indicator. In addition, the  guidance states that MCC will be explicit in reporting which changes  in outcome indicators are more likely the result of MCC investments  and which changes might also be influenced by other interventions.  However, the guidance lacks enough specificity to address other  weaknesses we identified. For example, when discussing road  roughness, the guidance does not instruct MCAs to measure both  sides of the road to account for variation in roughness from one side  of the road to the other. In addition, this guidance does not specify  that MCAs should include common indicators in their data quality  reviews.", "With respect to our second recommendation\u2014to improve guidance for  baseline measurements\u2014MCC stated that its current monitoring and  evaluation policy requires that compacts\u2019 monitoring and evaluation  plans document the date, source, and methodology for establishing  baseline measurements. MCC further stated that current MCA  monitoring and evaluation plans are compliant with this requirement.", "With respect to our third recommendation\u2014to enforce current  monitoring and evaluation policy requiring MCAs to conduct data  quality reviews and to provide written comments in response to  identified issues\u2014MCC stated that it works with MCAs to ensure that  recommendations of data quality reviews are incorporated into  monitoring and evaluation plans and then implemented.", "With respect to our fourth recommendation\u2014to incorporate a formal  process for reviewing beneficiary calculations and analysis\u2014MCC  noted that it will institute a formal process for reviewing beneficiary  calculations and address the weaknesses we identified in this report.", "MCC asserted that the results of its compact investments are not  diminished by the data quality challenges highlighted in this report. MCC  noted, for example, that more than 623 kilometers of rehabilitated roads  now serve poor and rural households in the countries we reviewed,  linking farmers to markets and bolstering important regional trade routes.  Regarding our finding that the total target for kilometers of road  completed for the six compacts was reduced by 63 percent, MCC also  noted that the final target for Honduras, Georgia, Cape Verde, and  Vanuatu would be only 19 percent below the original target if we were to  exclude the road projects that MCC terminated or discontinued as a result  of the Armenian and Nicaraguan governments\u2019 undemocratic behavior.", "We have reprinted MCC\u2019s comments in appendix V.

Because such MCA actions require MCC\u2019s  direct oversight and approval, throughout this report we attribute all  decisions related to project rescoping and compact targets to MCC.", "To assess the extent to which MCC has achieved its performance targets  for transportation infrastructure projects in compacts ending in 2010 and  2011, we reviewed MCC guidance and policy documents and analyzed  compacts, monitoring and evaluation plans, and indicator tracking tables  for the compacts with Honduras, Cape Verde, Nicaragua, Georgia,  Vanuatu, Armenia, and Benin. In assessing and reporting MCC\u2019s results,  we compared actual results achieved at the end of the compact for select  performance indicators with the original and, in some cases, revised  targets associated with each indicator. We considered the original target  to be the one first documented for each performance indicator and the  final target to be the one last documented in MCC monitoring documents.", "Given that MCC tracks several performance indicators for each compact  project, we selected a subset of indicators to examine for this report. For  the roads projects, we examined kilometers of road completed, road  roughness, and average annual daily traffic. We selected these road  project indicators because (1) they address the projects\u2019 key objectives  and (2) they are among the \u201ccommon indicators\u201d that MCC requires all  road projects to measure so that it can aggregate results across  countries. For the port projects, we examined volume of merchandise  through the port, container ship time at berth, and container ship time at  anchor. Although MCC has not established common indicators for the  port projects, we selected these port project indicators because they (1)  addressed the projects\u2019 key objectives, (2) corresponded to the common  indicators established for the roads projects, and (3) were originally  included in both port projects.", "To report the average value of targets and results for compact road  projects, we calculated a weighted average using the length of each road  segment. We performed this calculation for the average annual daily  traffic and roughness indicators for Cape Verde, Honduras, Vanuatu, and  Nicaragua because these MCAs report targets and results by road  segment. For Honduras, we did not weight the indicators using values  from sections 1 and 2 because the government of Honduras completed  these sections with funding from the Central American Bank for Economic  Integration. For Cape Verde, we did not include the average annual daily  traffic and roughness for bridge projects, because the kilometer lengths of  these sections were not available.", "To determine the amount of funding used for transportation infrastructure  projects, we reviewed MCC financial data. We included compact  implementation funding\u2014funds disbursed before entry into force to  facilitate the implementation of the compact\u2014with other projects not  related to transportation infrastructure.", "To determine which MCAs contracted for independent data quality  reviews, which transportation infrastructure indicators were evaluated,  and whether recommendations were made for common and key  indicators, we reviewed third-party data quality review reports.
