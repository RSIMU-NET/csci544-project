Without additional verification of the ASP data received from manufacturers, it is possible for the data to be inaccurate, which could result in inaccurate Medicare payment rates. In addition, CMS is unable to use or assess the accuracy of all sales price data because, as directed by statute, only manufacturers with Medicaid drug rebate agreements are required to submit sales price data to CMS.

Additionally, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) has  noted that current manufacturer reporting requirements could result in  incomplete information on drug prices being submitted to CMS. In its  report, OIG demonstrated how incomplete drug pricing information could  affect the accuracy of Part B drug payment rates.

We first identified all Healthcare Common Procedure  Coding System (HCPCS) codes, which CMS uses to determine payment  for certain Medicare services, for Part B drugs. A single HCPCS code can  cover multiple drugs with different National Drug Codes (NDC), which are  universal product identifiers assigned by the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA). We used the list of HCPCS codes to identify all  claim line items for Part B drugs during 2014. We then restricted the claim  line items to those that were paid based on ASP by removing claim line  items for drugs and facilities that were paid based on other payment  methodologies. Next, for each Part B ASP drug, we calculated Medicare  spending, defined as the total amount spent by the Medicare FFS  program and its beneficiaries, and two measures of utilization: the  number of times the drug was administered\u2014defined as the number of  claim line items for the drug\u2014and the number of unique beneficiaries who  received the drug. To examine variations in spending and utilization by  drug characteristics, such as whether the drug was a brand name or  generic drug, we used the claims data, FDA\u2019s NDC Product Summary  File, and Truven Health Analytics\u2019 RED BOOK. To examine variations  by provider characteristics, such as whether the provider was located in a  rural or urban area, we used the claims data and HHS and Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Rural-Urban Commuting Areas geographic taxonomy.", "To examine the steps CMS takes to ensure the accuracy of the sales  price data reported by drug manufacturers, we spoke with officials from  CMS and OIG about the data CMS receives from manufacturers,  including the steps the agency takes to ensure the accuracy of the data.
