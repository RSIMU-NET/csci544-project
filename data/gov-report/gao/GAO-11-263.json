The D.C. School Reform Act established the Public Charter School Board (PCSB) for the purpose of authorizing and overseeing charter schools. Congress required GAO to conduct a management evaluation of PCSB. GAO addresses the following: (1) the mechanisms in place to review the performance and operations of PCSB, (2) the procedures and processes PCSB has in place to oversee and monitor the operations of D.C. charter schools, and (3) the resources available to charter schools for their operations and facilities. GAO interviewed officials from D.C. agencies and 7 charter schools and reviewed oversight procedures for PCSB and charter schools. GAO also reviewed the processes for providing resources to charter schools and analyzed data on these resources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the Mayor appoints members to the board, PCSB has operated outside of the control of the Mayor and the Chancellor of traditional D.C. public schools; however, several agencies review PCSB's performance and operations. The D.C. Council holds annual hearings to examine PCSB's organization, personnel, budget, programs, policies, contracting, and procurement. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer oversees PCSB's budget development, operations, and financial reporting and reviews PCSB's monthly financial reports and year-end audits. Other offices monitor compliance with applicable laws and may conduct investigations or audits of PCSB when issues arise. PCSB launched its new performance accountability system to oversee the District's charter schools in school year 2009-2010. However, in October 2010, just weeks before the results were to be released, PCSB decided to withhold the results from the public due to concerns about data accuracy and plans to use the data collected to further test and develop the system. The new system, called the Performance Management Framework (PMF), is designed to assess charter schools using common measures for academic performance, compliance with applicable laws, and financial management, among other things. As it implements the new system for the 2010-2011 school year, PCSB is currently collaborating with charter schools to develop and revise the system, and has more recently begun providing more detailed information to charter schools about how it will revise the system. D.C. charter schools may receive funding from local, federal, and private sources for their operations and facilities and also have access to other District resources, including former D.C. school buildings; however, the criteria for awarding former school buildings to charter schools could be more transparent. The primary source of support for charter schools is local per-pupil funding, which is allocated to charter schools on the same basis as all public schools in the District. Charter schools also receive a per-pupil allotment from the District for facilities. In addition to local funds, charter schools are eligible to receive federal formula funding, federal discretionary grants, and private funding, such as foundation grants and commercial loans to purchase or renovate school buildings. To date, charter schools lease or will lease about half of the former D.C. school buildings that have been made available pursuant to a provision in D.C. law that provides charter schools with a right of first offer for these buildings. However, we found that the District does not include in its requests for offers all factors it may consider, such as economic development or other goals of the Mayor, when determining whether to accept or reject an offer. In addition, the District does not sufficiently document the basis for rejecting offers. Charter school officials and advocates expressed concern about the transparency and fairness in how the District makes decisions regarding former D.C. school buildings."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Mayor of the District of Columbia direct the Department of Real Estate Services to disclose all factors considered in reviewing charter school offers for former D.C. school buildings and make available to schools, in writing, the reasons the offers were rejected.

To determine the procedures and processes PCSB has in place  to oversee and monitor the operations of D.C. charter schools, we  reviewed PCSB\u2019s overall approach for monitoring charter schools\u2019  operations, including financial management, compliance with charters and  applicable laws and regulations, and academic performance. More  specifically, we reviewed PCSB\u2019s recently implemented accountability  system\u2014called the Performance Management Framework\u2014to determine  how PCSB implements its risk-based approach to monitoring charter  schools. We obtained additional information on PCSB\u2019s oversight process  through visits with charter school officials in 7 schools\u2014representing  approximately 13 percent of charter school students and 13 percent of  charter schools in the District in school year 2009-2010. We selected  charter schools to provide variation in each of several characteristics,  including location, academic and nonacademic performance, years in  operation, and type of facility (such as commercial space and former D.C.  school buildings). Our selected schools were not representative of all  charter schools, but provided some insight on how they operate. We also  conducted interviews with officials at charter school advocacy and  support organizations, including the D.C. Association of Chartered Public  Schools and Friends of Choice in Urban Schools, known as FOCUS. To  determine the resources available to charter schools for their operations  and facilities, we interviewed PCSB officials and District officials at the  Office of the State Superintendent for Education, and the Office of the  Chief Financial Officer.  We also interviewed D.C. charter school support  organizations and selected charter schools. We also collected data on local  per-pupil funding for operations for charter schools and traditional public  schools from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we  collected enrollment data for charter schools and traditional public  schools from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and enrollment audit  reports provided to the Office of the State Superintendent of Education.  To assess the reliability of these data, we interviewed knowledgeable  officials to learn about the sources of data and steps taken to ensure the  completeness and accuracy of the data. For several of the data elements  used in this report, we were able to check the data we received from  agency officials against published sources; this was done in all cases  where published sources were available. We determined these data to be  reliable for the purpose of describing local operational funds allocated to  D.C. charter schools and traditional public schools. We also identified  other sources of funding for charter schools, including funding from  federal and private sources. In addition, we collected data, interviewed  District and charter school officials, and reviewed relevant laws and  regulations regarding other, nonmonetary resources available to charter  schools for their operations and facilities, including use of former D.C.  school facilities, local city services, and personnel such as school police  officers and school nurses.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2009 to March 2011  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

In addition, charter schools are accountable for their  educational and financial performance, including the testing requirements  under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended  (ESEA).", "A wide range of individuals or groups, including parents, educators,  nonprofit organizations, and universities, may apply to create a charter  school. Charter schools in the District are nonprofit organizations and, like  other nonprofits, are governed by a board of trustees. The board of  trustees, which is initially selected by the school founders, oversees  compliance with laws, financial management, contracts with external  parties, and other school policies. School board trustees are also  responsible for identifying existing and potential risks facing the charter  school and taking steps to reduce or eliminate these risks.", "Charters to operate a school are authorized by various bodies, and may  include local school districts, municipal governments, or special  chartering boards. In 1996, Congress passed the District of Columbia  School Reform Act of 1995 (School Reform Act), creating PCSB as a  chartering authority. PCSB was established with the purpose of  approving, overseeing, renewing, and revoking charters. After granting  charters to schools, PCSB is responsible for monitoring charter schools\u2019  academic achievement, operations, and compliance with applicable laws.  While the Mayor and Chancellor of the District of Columbia Public Schools  (DCPS) oversee traditional public schools, PCSB is responsible for holding  the District\u2019s charter schools accountable for academic results and  compliance with applicable laws.", "PCSB is comprised of seven unpaid board members with expertise  relevant to charter school operation and approximately 25 employees who  implement the board\u2019s policies and oversee charter schools. Under D.C.  law, the seven-member board is appointed by the Mayor, and members of  PCSB may serve up to two 4-year terms.  To support its operations, PCSB  receives local funds through the annual D.C. Appropriations Act. PCSB  also receives administrative fees from charter schools based on the  number of students enrolled as well as revenue from grants. PCSB\u2019s  largest expenditures are for its personnel and program-related costs, such  as technology upgrades and charter school reviews that are conducted, in  part, by consultants (see table 1).", "The D.C. School Reform Act allows PCSB to grant up to 10 charters per  year. Each charter remains in force for 15 years, and may be renewed for  an unlimited number of times. PCSB is required to review each charter at  least once every 5 years to determine whether the charter should be  revoked. Each year PCSB is required to submit an annual report to the  Mayor, the District of Columbia Council, the U.S. Secretary of Education,  the appropriate congressional committees, and others that includes  information on charter renewals, revocations, and other actions related to  public charter schools.", "A total of 76 charter schools have opened in the District since BOE and  PCSB began chartering schools in 1996 and 1997, respectively. However,  between 1998 and 2010, 24 charter schools closed, many for fiscal  mismanagement discovered through PCSB monitoring. As of the 2010-11  school year, 52 charter schools across 93 campuses are in operation,  serving over 29,000 students at all education levels, including early  childhood and adult education. Charter schools in the District represent  varied instructional and academic models. For example, some schools  have a particular curricular emphasis, such as math and science, art, or  foreign language, while other charter schools focus on specific  populations, such as students with learning disabilities, students who have  dropped out or are at risk of doing so, youth who have been involved in  the criminal justice system, and adults. In addition, one charter school is a  college preparatory boarding school. See appendix I for more information  on D.C. charter school characteristics.", "Unlike traditional public schools, which are generally part of a larger local  educational agency (LEA), or school district, each D.C. charter school  operates as its own LEA for most purposes. As a result, charter schools  are responsible for a wide range of functions associated with being a local  school district, such as applying for certain federal grants and acquiring  and maintaining facilities. Charter schools may operate in a variety of  facilities, such as surplus D.C. school buildings, shared spaces with other  schools, and converted commercial buildings, including warehouses.  However, public charter schools in D.C.\u2014like charter schools across the  nation\u2014face challenges in acquiring facilities and funding facilities-related  projects. GAO has previously reported that charter schools consistently  encountered problems obtaining cost-effective and appropriate facilities.  The District provides various forms of assistance to charter schools for  facilities, including preference in leasing or purchasing former D.C. school  buildings.

The PMF is based on a common set of five academic indicators, as  well as nonacademic measures to evaluate school performance, as shown  in figure 3. Weights are assigned to each academic measure and these  academic measures are then combined to yield a final PMF score for each  school. This final score determines the level of additional support or  oversight a school receives from PCSB.", "The PMF is also designed to assess schools\u2019 nonacademic performance in  finance, governance, and compliance with ESEA and other applicable  laws.

According to  PCSB officials, although a school\u2019s PMF score does not include  nonacademic indicators, charter schools may face consequences,  including charter revocation, for poor financial performance or violations  of law discovered during governance and compliance reviews. To conduct  various academic and nonacademic reviews, PCSB uses internal staff,  consultants, and a recently established audit management unit that will  analyze and monitor schools\u2019 financial statements and audits.", "In addition, the PMF will be supported by a new electronic system to  streamline the review process and enable PCSB and charter schools to  exchange and share documents more efficiently. For example, under the  PMF, schools will submit academic performance data, annual reports, and  financial statements electronically for review. This review will allow PCSB  to identify potential issues and schools needing additional help or more  thorough, in-depth review.

Charter Schools May Receive Local, Federal, and Private Funding for Their Operations and Facilities", "paragraphs": ["D.C. charter schools may receive funding for their operations and facilities  from a range of sources. Like traditional public schools in the District, the  primary source of funding for charter schools is local appropriations,  which is allocated on the basis of a per-pupil formula that takes several  factors into consideration. As shown in table 2, the amount charter  schools and DCPS receive per pupil varies based on grade level, ranging  from $6,578 for adult students to $11,752 for preschool students in school  year 2009-2010. Schools also receive add-on amounts to account for  differences in the cost of educating certain student populations, such as  special education and limited English proficient students. For example,  schools that served kindergarten students who require more than 24 hours  per week of special education services received a total of $36,220 per pupil  for such students in school year 2009-2010. In addition, to help cover the  cost of charter school facilities, most of which are commercial buildings  around the city, charter schools receive a local per-pupil facilities  allowance. For the 2009-2010 school year, the facilities allowance was  $2,800 per pupil for nonresidential students and $8,395 per pupil for  schools that provide residential room and board.", "Although local funding for operations for both charter schools and  traditional schools is determined based on the same formula, charter  schools receive funding based on actual, or audited, enrollment while  DCPS receives funds based on projected enrollment. Charter schools  receive four payments during the fiscal year, which are reconciled based  on audited enrollment figures. For example, if a charter school\u2019s audited  enrollment is higher or lower than projected, subsequent payments will be  increased or decreased accordingly. DCPS receives spending authority at  the beginning of the fiscal year based on enrollment projections, and it is  not adjusted based on audited enrollment, according to District officials.", "Charter schools may also receive federal and private funding for their  operations and facilities. Like all public schools in D.C., charter schools  are eligible to receive federal formula grants through various programs  under ESEA and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA).  Because charter schools in the District are considered individual LEAs,  they may also be eligible to compete for federal discretionary grants from  agencies, such as the Department of Education, the Department of Health  and Human Services, and the Department of Justice. Furthermore,  between fiscal years 2004 and 2010, Congress appropriated over $104  million directly to the District to fund programs intended to expand public  charter schools. Some of the programs for which federal payments were  used included facilities financing for charter schools through which the  District awarded more than 80 grants and loans to help charter schools  build, improve, lease, or purchase facilities. In addition, charter schools  may engage in fundraising activities and accept grants and gifts from  corporations, foundations, and other organizations, as long as the gift is  not subject to any condition contrary to law or their charters. For  example, some of the charter schools we visited held yearly fundraisers  and received annual gifts from corporations.

Specifically, the RFO states that the selection panel, which is  comprised of officials from DRES and the Office of the Deputy Mayor for  Education, will evaluate offers in the context of six evaluation criteria: (1)  educational vision, (2) project vision, (3) capability of respondent to  execute its vision, (4) past experience with similar project(s), (5) financial  feasibility, and (6) best interest of the District. Although the RFO criterion  \u201cbest interest of the District\u201d is rather broad and could conceivably  encompass other factors the District may consider in evaluating offers, the  only additional information provided for this criterion in the RFO pertains  to whether the offer requires a District subsidy and maximizes community  involvement. However, the D.C. rule regarding disposition of former  school property states that the long- or short-term community  development; economic development; cultural, financial, or other goals of  the Mayor or the District may be also considered by the selection panel  when deciding whether to accept or decline charter school offers. Only  by looking at the D.C. rule would an offeror know that these additional  factors may be considered. Because the RFO does not clearly indicate that  additional factors beyond the stated criteria can affect whether a proposal  is accepted, potential offerors may not have a clear understanding of the  criteria that will be used to evaluate their offers. While District officials  felt that the criteria listed in the RFO were inclusive of all factors that may  be considered, some charter school officials and advocates we spoke with  expressed a lack of understanding and confidence in the fairness and  transparency of how the District made decisions to accept and reject  offers.", "We also found that the selection panel does not always sufficiently  document the reasons for recommending that a particular charter school\u2019s  offer be rejected. After consensus is reached on a charter school\u2019s offer,  the selection panel provides a memorandum documenting its  recommendation for accepting a charter school\u2019s offer to the Director of  DRES and Deputy Mayor for Education. According to District officials, the  Director of DRES and the Deputy Mayor for Education then make a  recommendation to the Mayor, who ultimately decides whether an offer is  accepted. For rejected offers, however, the selection panel does not  always document its recommendation, and although DRES notifies the  charter schools of its decision in writing, it does not include the reasons  that offers were rejected. While DRES officials told us that charter schools  may request a briefing to understand why their offers were rejected, the  rejection letter does not state that charter schools have this option.  Because DRES does not always document its recommendations for  rejecting charter school offers and the notification letter does not include  the reasons offers were rejected, charter schools may lack information  that could help them better understand the process and develop future  offers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In the District, charter schools, which enroll nearly 40 percent of all public  school children in the city, offer parents more educational choice. These  schools offer varied approaches to instruction and some target specific  subpopulations of students. Charter schools in the District, and in general,  were designed to operate with more autonomy and flexibility than  traditional schools, but like all schools, are accountable for ensuring that  every student receives a quality public education. PCSB has oversight over  all 52 charter schools, and its new PMF has the potential to be a valuable  tool for overseeing and monitoring charter schools. The PMF also has the  potential to provide more information to parents, school leaders, and  other stakeholders about the relative and collective performance of  charter schools across a range of indicators. As such, it is important that  PCSB take the necessary steps to ensure that its PMF is designed and  implemented well. PCSB plans to collaborate with charter schools to  develop and revise the system, and has more recently begun providing  more detailed information to charter schools about its plans for  implementing the revised system for the 2010-2011 school year. We believe  that ongoing collaboration and communication such as this is vital to the  successful implementation of the PMF.", "The District faces tough trade-offs in how it uses its resources. Former  D.C. school buildings may be attractive locations for a range of city uses,  including charter school facilities. The growing charter school population  in the District makes appropriate, affordable space to educate students a  critical resource to the success of individual charter schools and the  District\u2019s charter school movement as a whole. Therefore, it is also  important that criteria used to determine whether a charter school  receives a former D.C. school building are as transparent as possible and  that the basis for the District\u2019s decision is clear and sufficiently  documented. Additional clarity and transparency regarding how the  District decides to use former D.C. school buildings may increase charter  schools\u2019 understanding of the process and may help to avoid the  appearance of a lack of fairness among charter school officials and  advocates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the criteria for evaluating offers from charter schools to use  surplus D.C. school buildings are clear and the reasons for denial of offers  are communicated, we recommend that the Mayor of the District of  Columbia direct DRES to take the following two actions:    ensure the RFO on former D.C. school buildings clearly indicates all  factors that may be considered by the selection panel, and inform charter schools, in writing, of the reasons their offers were rejected  or of the opportunity to request a briefing to obtain such information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to PCSB, the D.C.
