NHTSA, however, lacks an evaluation plan with criteria to assess whether to expand the pilot program, as called for in leading practices. As a result, NHTSA lacks information to determine how and whether it should expand the pilot to meet the agency's data needs.", "Automakers offer a range of approaches to address pedestrian safety. For example, pedestrian crash avoidance technologies use cameras or radar to detect an imminent crash with a pedestrian and engage a vehicle's brakes to avoid a crash. GAO found that about 60 percent of the model year 2019 vehicles offered in the United States by 13 automakers had pedestrian crash avoidance technologies as standard or optional equipment.", "In 2015 NHTSA proposed pedestrian safety tests for its New Car Assessment Program (NCAP), but NHTSA has not decided whether it will include such tests in the program. NHTSA has reported that crash avoidance technologies could lead to a decrease in pedestrian fatalities. Nine automakers that GAO interviewed reported that NHTSA's lack of communication about pedestrian safety tests creates challenges for new product development. NHTSA has also not documented a clear process for updating NCAP with milestones for decisions. NHTSA officials said that updating NCAP involves many actions and can take years. However, absent a final decision on whether to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP and a documented process for making such decisions, the public lacks clarity on NHTSA's efforts to address safety risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that NHTSA (1) develop an evaluation plan with criteria for expanding its pilot program, (2) make and communicate a decision about whether to include pedestrian safety tests in NCAP, and (3) document the process for making changes to NCAP.

On average, 17 pedestrians a day  died in motor vehicle crashes in 2018, up from 12 a day in 2008. At the  same time, overall fatalities on the nation\u2019s roadways have generally been  decreasing. Many factors can affect pedestrian fatalities and injuries,  including driver and pedestrian behavior, distraction, and roadway and  vehicle design. U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) officials told us  vehicle size class is also a contributing factor, and an increasing share of  sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in the U.S. vehicle fleet may be responsible  for some of the increases in pedestrian fatalities. For example, in May  2018 the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), an independent  nonprofit scientific and educational organization sponsored by the auto  insurance industry, reported that pedestrian fatalities associated with  SUVs had increased substantially in recent years and that crashes are  increasingly more likely to involve SUVs and higher horsepower  vehicles.", "The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) within DOT  is the federal agency responsible for motor vehicle policy, regulation, and  safety enforcement. The agency\u2019s mission is to save lives, prevent  injuries, and reduce the economic costs associated with road traffic  crashes; NHTSA seeks to accomplish this mission through education,  research, safety standards, and enforcement activity. NHTSA\u2019s New Car  Assessment Program (NCAP) provides consumers with comparative  information on the safety of new vehicles to assist in vehicle purchasing  decisions and NCAP encourages motor vehicle manufacturers to make  vehicle safety improvements through testing and rating of new vehicles.", "You asked that we review issues related to pedestrian safety and motor  vehicles. This report: (1) Examines what is known about the relationship  between motor vehicles\u2019 characteristics and pedestrian fatalities and  injuries; (2) Describes approaches automakers have taken to address  pedestrian safety and discusses stakeholder perspectives on these  approaches; and (3) Evaluates actions NHTSA has taken to assess  whether pedestrian safety testing should be incorporated into the NCAP.", "To examine what is known about the relationship between motor vehicles\u2019  characteristics and pedestrian fatalities and injuries, we analyzed data  from three NHTSA databases for the period of 2008 through 2018 (the  most recent complete year of data at the time of our review). These  include: (1) Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS); (2) Crash Report  Sampling Systems (CRSS); and (3) National Automotive Sampling  System/General Estimates System (NASS/GES). FARS data are derived  from a census of fatal motor vehicle traffic crashes within the 50 states,  Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia. CRSS is a sample of police- reported motor vehicle crashes that involve all types of motor vehicles,  pedestrians, and cyclists and that is used to develop national estimates of  the number of injuries associated with motor vehicle crashes, among  other things. NASS/GES preceded CRSS and similarly obtained its data  from a nationally representative probability sample of police accident  reports. Additional information about these databases is included in  appendix I. We interviewed NHTSA officials about pedestrian safety data.  We also interviewed selected academic researchers with expertise in  human-vehicle interaction and selected automakers about pedestrian  safety and data needs. We discuss the selection of automakers below.  We reviewed documents related to a pilot program NHTSA recently  initiated to assess data collection for pedestrian injuries and discussed  this program with NHTSA officials. We assessed this program using  criteria for designing successful pilot programs developed in prior GAO  work.", "To describe how automakers are addressing pedestrian safety and to  discuss stakeholder perspectives on these approaches, we obtained  information from 13 automakers that sold vehicles in the United States.  The 13 automakers represented about 70 percent of new vehicles sold in  the United States in 2018. We used a semi-structured interview format to  obtain information from the 13 automakers about the pedestrian safety  features included on their model year 2019 vehicles sold in the United  States and the benefits and challenges of these features. We did not  assess the effectiveness of these features. Results of these interviews  are not generalizable to the universe of automakers that may sell vehicles  in the United States. We also interviewed representatives of five  companies identified by an auto industry trade association that supply  pedestrian safety related equipment, as well as officials from auto  industry trade associations, and NHTSA. Finally, we reviewed relevant  federal motor vehicle regulations related to pedestrian safety.", "To evaluate NHTSA\u2019s actions related to pedestrian safety and NCAP, we  reviewed applicable federal laws and regulations, requests for comments  published in the Federal Register on proposed NCAP changes, and  NHTSA NCAP program documents. We reviewed studies and  presentations on NHTSA\u2019s work related to pedestrian safety, including  potential pedestrian safety tests and their applicability to the U.S. vehicle  fleet, the use of various test tools, and the potential safety effects  associated with technologies intended to avoid crashes with pedestrians.  We also visited NHTSA\u2019s Vehicle Research and Test Center in East  Liberty, Ohio, and the IIHS Vehicle Research Center in Ruckersville,  Virginia, and interviewed NHTSA and IIHS officials, respectively, at those  locations. Further, we interviewed NHTSA officials about NHTSA\u2019s  process for making changes to NCAP and communicating decisions to  stakeholders. We also interviewed the automakers and auto industry  equipment suppliers discussed above, and IIHS officials about  incorporating pedestrian safety tests into NCAP. We evaluated NHTSA\u2019s  process for deciding whether to make changes to NCAP using practices  in the Project Management Institute, Inc., The Standard for Program  Management, and GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. Appendix I provides a detailed discussion of our scope and  methodology.", "We conducted our work from February 2019 to April 2020 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on  our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since 2008, both the number of pedestrian fatalities and the share of  pedestrian fatalities as a percentage of overall highway fatalities have  increased (see fig. 1). In 2008, pedestrian fatalities represented about 12  percent of overall highway fatalities, while in 2018 they represented about  17 percent. In addition to fatalities, the estimated number of pedestrians  injured in crashes has increased from about 71,000 in 2008 to about  79,800 in 2018.", "A range of factors can influence pedestrian fatalities including exposure of  pedestrians to crashes, roadway characteristics, and driver and  pedestrian behavior. According to DOT officials, there is little nationwide  information about pedestrian exposure to potential crashes and that data  may be more available on the state or local level. Some national data,  however, shows that there may have been some change in people  walking. For example, the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community  Survey estimated that in 2018, 4 million people reported walking to work  compared with an estimated 3.8 million people in 2010. Regarding  roadways, in 2018 the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)  reported that most pedestrian fatalities occur in urban areas on principal  arterial roads that carry high volumes of traffic, traveling at the highest speeds. In 2015, we noted that behavior such as distracted driving,  walking, and cycling may contribute to pedestrian and cyclist fatalities.  When drivers and pedestrians use cell phones or are otherwise  distracted, they may be less aware of their surroundings and more likely  to be involved in a crash. Finally, NHTSA data shows that most  pedestrian fatalities occurred after dark and at places other than  intersections. Specifically, in 2018, of the 6,300 reported fatalities, over  4,700 pedestrians (about 75 percent) were killed after dark and about  4,600 pedestrians (about 73 percent) were killed at non-intersection  locations. See appendix II for additional information on pedestrian  fatalities from 2008 through 2018.", "Automakers have developed vehicle features intended to avoid  pedestrian crashes and mitigate the extent of injury to pedestrians. Crash  avoidance features (also known as \u201cactive\u201d safety features) rely on  cameras, radar, and other devices to detect a pedestrian and then act to  alert a driver to take action, or automatically apply a vehicle\u2019s brakes to  slow or stop the vehicle to avoid striking a pedestrian (see fig. 2). One  pedestrian crash avoidance system is referred to as pedestrian automatic  emergency braking, which uses a camera, radar, or a combination, to  automatically apply brakes to avoid a collision.", "Crash mitigation features (also known as \u201cpassive\u201d safety features)  generally involve the use of pedestrian-friendly vehicle components that  are designed to reduce the severity of injuries should a pedestrian be hit.  Passive safety features can include energy absorbing bumper material,  hoods that provide space between the hood and the hard components in  the engine compartment, and contoured vehicle front-ends intended to  reduce harm to pedestrians (see fig. 3).", "In executing its mission, NHTSA administers NCAP and issues federal  motor vehicle safety standards (FMVSS) and the federal bumper  standard, among other things. In general, NCAP tests supplement safety  standards established in law or regulation.", "NCAP. Created in 1978, this program tests new vehicles to determine  how well they protect drivers and passengers during a crash (front  and side) and how well vehicles resist rollovers. NHTSA tests and  rates vehicles using a five-star safety rating system with five stars  being the highest safety rating and one star the lowest. NHTSA  communicates the results of its vehicle tests through window labels on  new vehicles and on its website. In 2010, NHTSA also began  recommending various safety technologies for consumers to consider  when purchasing vehicles. Recommended technologies include such  things as forward collision warning (an alert that warns drivers to  brake or steer to avoid a crash if they are too close to a car in front of  them); lane departure warning (an alert that warns drivers of  unintentional lane shifts); and automatic emergency braking, which  can automatically activate a vehicle\u2019s brakes if a driver takes no action  to avoid an imminent crash with a preceding vehicle. NHTSA has not  yet included pedestrian automatic emergency braking systems as  recommended technologies. Recommended technologies are not  included in star ratings, but rather are features NHTSA believes  consumers may wish to look for in new vehicles. Pedestrian safety  tests are not currently part of NCAP.", "FMVSS. These are minimum performance standards established in  regulation for new motor vehicles and items of motor vehicle  equipment. According to NHTSA officials, FMVSS have test  procedures and performance criteria with minimum thresholds for  motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment, such as minimum light  intensity requirements for headlamps.", "Bumper standard. In addition, while not in the FMVSS, NHTSA\u2019s  bumper standard prescribes performance requirements in regulation  for passenger cars in low-speed front-end and rear collisions.  According to NHTSA officials, the bumper standard is intended to  prevent damage to the car body and safety related equipment at  speeds equivalent to a 5 miles-per-hour (mph) crash into a parked  vehicle of the same weight. The standard applies to front and rear  bumpers on passenger cars, but not to other multipurpose passenger  vehicles, such as SUVs, minivans, or pickup trucks.", "The United States is also involved with pedestrian safety internationally.  In June 1998, the United States signed an international agreement  administered by the United Nations concerning the establishment of  global technical regulations for motor and other wheeled vehicles. The  purpose of the agreement was to establish a global process for jointly  developing technical regulations regarding such things as safety,  environmental protection, and energy efficiency of vehicles. As part of this  agreement, in 2008, Global Technical Regulation No. 9 was established  to improve pedestrian safety by requiring vehicle hoods and bumpers to  absorb energy more efficiently when impacted in a vehicle-to-pedestrian  collision. This international standard has two sets of performance  criteria: head impact requirements that ensure vehicle hoods provide  protection to a pedestrian\u2019s head when impacted; and leg protection  requirements for the front bumper that would require bumpers to subject  pedestrians to lower impact forces. According to NHTSA, as a signatory  to the 1998 agreement, the United States is obligated to consider  adopting global technical regulations, but is not obligated to adopt them.  NHTSA officials told us the agency has not yet initiated the rulemaking  process for Global Technical Regulation No. 9.", "Although pedestrian safety testing is not currently a part of the U.S.  NCAP, it is a part of similarly established new car assessment programs  in other countries. For example, since 2016 both the European New Car  Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) and a program in Japan (known  as the Japan New Car Assessment Program (JNCAP)) have tested  vehicle pedestrian crash avoidance systems using a variety of scenarios  and vehicle speeds. Euro NCAP tests include an adult dummy walking  or running perpendicular to a test vehicle and walking parallel to a  vehicle. Tests are also conducted with a child dummy running out from  parked cars (see fig. 4). Euro NCAP tests are also conducted in daylight  and at night. In the United States, two nongovernmental organizations  have also conducted pedestrian safety testing. IIHS began a program to  test pedestrian crash avoidance systems on 2018 and 2019 vehicles, and  in 2020 began using the results to help determine its Top Safety Pick  awards. The American Automobile Association (AAA) also recently  conducted tests of crash avoidance systems.", "Moreover, crash mitigation tests that measure the potential for head and  leg injuries resulting from pedestrian-motor vehicle crashes have been in  place for many years in Europe and Japan. Euro NCAP began head and  leg testing in 1997 and Japan began pedestrian head protection testing in  2003 and pedestrian leg protection testing in 2011. In general, these tests  launch projectiles designed to simulate a person\u2019s legs or head into  various locations on a vehicle\u2019s hood and bumper to assess the  effectiveness in limiting pedestrian injury (see fig. 5)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Vehicle Age, Body Type, and Speed Are Associated with Pedestrian Fatalities, But Gaps Remain in NHTSA\u2019s Pedestrian Injury Data", "paragraphs": ["We found that several vehicle characteristics including the age and body  type of the vehicle and the speed at which the vehicle was being driven at  the time of the crash are associated with the increase in pedestrian  fatalities from 2008 through 2018.

Over  that same time period, the number of pedestrian fatalities involving newer  vehicles also increased from 2,800 in 2008 to 3,044 in 2018. However,  this increase was less than fatalities involving older vehicles, and the  overall share of pedestrian fatalities involving newer vehicles decreased  from 63 to 48 percent over that period.", "The rise in the number of older vehicles involved in pedestrian fatalities  may reflect the rise in the average age of vehicles in operation.

In  comparison, the average age of passenger vehicles that struck and killed  pedestrians increased by roughly 2 years from 8.1 years in 2008 to 10  years in 2018. Another possible contributing factor to the increased share  of pedestrian fatalities resulting from crashes with older vehicles may be  the prevalence of safety features in newer vehicles compared with older  vehicles.

Research suggests that if a pedestrian is struck by a vehicle with  greater mass the crash is more likely to result in serious injuries or a  fatality than if the pedestrian is struck by a lower-mass vehicle. For  example, one study we reviewed that cited work from five other  studies found that the chief determinants for the severity of injuries in  motor vehicle collisions are vehicle size and weight.

The number of pedestrian fatalities involving vehicles  reportedly traveling at lower speeds also increased, but at a smaller  percentage (28 percent) than vehicles at higher-speed.

In total, 12 of 13  automakers that we interviewed responded that they offered one or more  2019 model year vehicles with pedestrian automatic emergency braking  as either a standard or optional feature; similarly, 12 of 13 automakers  told us they offered crash mitigation features in at least one of their 2019  model year vehicles.", "Some stakeholders we interviewed told us that a combination of crash  avoidance and crash mitigation features can be effective in minimizing  pedestrian injury. For example, NHTSA officials told us that crash  avoidance features, such as pedestrian automatic emergency braking can  slow a vehicle to a speed where it will be less damaging to a pedestrian  once struck, and if the vehicle also has crash mitigation features the  impact of the crash can be further mitigated. We found that almost half of  2019 vehicle models had some combination of both pedestrian automatic  emergency braking and crash mitigation features. For example, about 47  percent of 2019 vehicle models had pedestrian automatic emergency  braking as either standard or optional equipment along with crash  mitigation features, such as softer hoods. However, 24 percent of vehicle  models had neither of these (see fig. 9).", "Officials from the 13 automakers we interviewed identified a variety of  factors that influenced their decisions to offer vehicles with pedestrian  safety features in the United States. These include a desire to achieve  high safety ratings for their vehicles, as well as the following:", "New car assessment programs: New car assessment programs in  the United States and other countries also influence why automakers  may offer pedestrian safety features. For example, officials from nine  of 10 automakers that responded to this question in our interview  replied that Euro NCAP was a major factor to them in providing  pedestrian safety features, while seven of 10 automakers responded  that JNCAP was a major factor. In contrast, three of 11 automakers  responded that the U.S. NCAP was a major factor in their decisions to  offer vehicles with pedestrian safety features. As previously  discussed, the United States, unlike the European Union and Japan,  does not incorporate pedestrian safety tests into its NCAP.", "Independent safety testing: Independent safety testing was also a  factor in why automakers may offer pedestrian safety features on  vehicles. For example, officials from five automakers said that they  considered IIHS safety ratings to be a major factor in their company\u2019s  decision to offer pedestrian safety features on vehicles sold in the  United States. As previously discussed, IIHS began testing  pedestrian crash avoidance systems on 2018 and 2019 vehicles.  These tests are known as pedestrian automatic emergency braking  tests and in 2020 IIHS began using the results to help determine their  Top Safety Pick awards. Officials from two automakers said a  company\u2019s goal is to earn an IIHS top safety-pick rating for each of  their models.", "Cost: Cost appeared to be less of a factor influencing whether  pedestrian safety features were offered on vehicles. Officials from  seven of eight automakers who responded to this question replied that  costs either were a minor factor, or did not apply, in their decisions to  offer vehicles with pedestrian safety features. However, officials from  four automakers told us that, in general, while customers want safer  vehicles, automakers have to consider what safety features could be  included without increasing the overall cost. Further, one automaker\u2019s  representative said that as more manufacturers and customers are  buying crash avoidance systems the costs are decreasing.", "The future availability of crash avoidance features may depend on several  factors. Specifically, in 2016, 20 automakers voluntarily committed to  making automatic emergency braking systems standard in vehicles sold  in the United States by 2022. Officials from three automakers said that  they planned to incorporate pedestrian automatic emergency braking into  their vehicles\u2019 automatic emergency braking systems as part of this  commitment.", "Another factor is customer demand. One automaker said that the number  of models that include pedestrian safety features in the future would  depend on consumer demand or changes in regulation. Officials from  another automaker said their customers often ask for features they see in  Europe and ask why such features are available there but not in the  United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Auto Industry Officials Cited Various Benefits and Challenges of Commonly Available Pedestrian Safety Features", "paragraphs": ["The auto industry officials we interviewed identified benefits and  challenges with commonly available pedestrian safety features. Benefits  of crash avoidance systems include the potential of eliminating or  reducing car-to-pedestrian accidents. For example, officials from six  automakers said that crash avoidance features were more effective than  crash mitigation features because the purpose of crash avoidance  features is to prevent the collision from occurring in the first place. Almost  half of the automakers we interviewed (six of 13), however, reported that  a primary challenge with a camera-based pedestrian automatic  emergency braking system was the camera\u2019s ability to work in low lighting  or poor weather. Recently issued research has raised questions about the  overall effectiveness of crash avoidance systems. In October 2019, AAA  reported that based on its own assessment, some vehicles\u2019 pedestrian  safety systems were inconsistent at either slowing down or stopping a  vehicle to avoid hitting a pedestrian. Specifically, the association  reported that none of the crash avoidance systems on the four vehicles  they tested worked in dark conditions.", "Auto industry officials also identified benefits and challenges with  pedestrian crash mitigation features. For example, 12 of 13 automakers  reported that crash mitigation features have the overall benefit of reducing  the risk or severity of pedestrian injuries. Officials from eight automakers,  however, said that the current federal bumper standard created  challenges to offering softer, more pedestrian-friendly bumpers in the  United States. Officials from the eight automakers said they offered  softer bumpers in Europe or elsewhere\u2014where there is no similar  bumper standard\u2014but do not offer softer bumpers in the United States.  NHTSA officials told us the current bumper standard is primarily a cost  savings standard in that it is intended to reduce repair costs and not  necessarily to offer safety protection for vehicle occupants. NHTSA  officials told us trade-offs are required to establish a bumper standard that  addresses pedestrian safety, yet minimizes bumper damage and repair  costs. NHTSA officials told us they are in the process of reevaluating the  bumper damageability standard, as part of a Notice of Proposed  Rulemaking, which they expect to publish in 2020.", "Appendix III discusses the benefits and challenges of commonly available  pedestrian safety features."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NHTSA Has Proposed Pedestrian Safety Tests for NCAP, but Lacks a Clear Process for Updating the Program and Has Yet to Make or Communicate a Decision", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NHTSA Has Conducted Research and Proposed Pedestrian Safety Tests over the Last 10 Years", "paragraphs": ["NHTSA has considered pedestrian safety for many years by conducting  research, considering implementation of global regulations for pedestrian  crash mitigation tests, and proposing pedestrian crash avoidance and  mitigation tests for NCAP (see fig. 10).

This international standard, if  implemented in the United States in a domestic regulation, would require  U.S. vehicles to meet minimum performance requirements in pedestrian  crash mitigation tests. The United States approved the international  standard in 2008; however, NHTSA has yet to initiate a rulemaking to  implement it either as part of the FMVSS or adopt it as a testing protocol  through NCAP.

NHTSA  officials told us there are three important elements associated with any  safety tests (including pedestrian safety tests). These elements are (1)  creating test protocols that measure a vehicle\u2019s safety performance  objectively, (2) validating test instruments that measure human injury, and  (3) estimating the potential safety benefit of the tests. NHTSA\u2019s  pedestrian safety research includes work related to all three of these  elements, as follows:", "Objective Test Protocols. One NHTSA study developed objective  test protocols to evaluate the effectiveness of pedestrian crash  avoidance systems based on analyses of crash scenarios from real- world crash data.

Specifically, NHTSA found that \u201cglobal platform\u201d vehicles (i.e., models  that include a U.S. and European variant of the same vehicle) offered  more pedestrian safety than vehicles that are only marketed in the  United States.", "Valid Test Instruments. NHTSA has been a key contributor in the  development of pedestrian test instruments. For example, NHTSA has  presented information on mannequins for evaluating the repeatability  and accuracy of pedestrian crash avoidance systems, concluding that  mannequins should be durable, realistic, and comparable in size and  movement to humans. In addition, NHTSA found there are  instruments that produce repeatable and reproducible measurements  of pedestrian head, upper leg, and lower leg injuries on tests.", "Potential Safety Benefits. NHTSA has studied the potential benefits  of pedestrian crash avoidance, and estimated that these technologies  could reduce the number of annual vehicle-pedestrian crashes by  between 620 and 5,000, and reduce the number of annual fatal  vehicle-pedestrian crashes by between 110 and 810. NHTSA has  also reported that Europe and Japan have responded to the high  proportion of pedestrian fatalities compared to all traffic fatalities by  including pedestrian protection in their respective NCAPs and  requiring pedestrian protection through regulation. According to  NHTSA, these actions have likely contributed to a downward trend in  pedestrian fatalities in Europe and Japan.", "Further, an international study found that including pedestrian safety  testing in consumer testing programs has real world benefits by reducing  pedestrian fatalities and injuries. For example, a European study  concluded that vehicles that score well in Euro NCAP pedestrian crash  mitigation tests are less likely to severely injure pedestrians.

In this request, NHTSA also reported that it believed the  greatest gains in highway safety in coming years would result from  widespread application of crash avoidance technologies and that its  proposed safety tests for crash avoidance technologies, including  pedestrian detection and automatic emergency braking, met NHTSA\u2019s  four prerequisites for updating NCAP. Those four prerequisites include  that: a safety need is known or capable of being estimated;  vehicle and equipment designs exist (or are anticipated in prototype  design) that are capable of mitigating the safety need; a safety benefit is estimated based on the anticipated performance of  the existing or prototype design; and a performance-based, objective test procedure exists to measure the  ability of the vehicle technology to mitigate the safety issue.", "With regard to crash mitigation tests, NHTSA reported that it intended to  use the Euro NCAP test procedures rather than those used in Japan  because the European fleet make-up, including vehicle sizes and classes,  is more similar to the U.S. fleet. NHTSA also reported in its 2015  Request for Comments that including pedestrian crash mitigation tests in  NCAP is necessary to stimulate improvements in pedestrian  crashworthiness in new vehicles sold in the United States.

To ensure the accuracy of our analysis  we reviewed agency technical documentation related to these databases  and ensured that our figures matched publicly available injury and fatality  data contained in NHTSA publications such as its annual Traffic Safety  Fact Sheets. FARS data are derived from a census of all fatal motor  vehicle traffic crashes within the 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of  Columbia and provide uniformly coded, national data on police reported  fatalities. We analyzed FARS data to determine the total number of  pedestrian fatalities each year as well as the number of pedestrian  fatalities by vehicle age, vehicle body type, and vehicle travelling speed  (speed just prior to the crash). These variables were selected based on  our interviews of NHTSA officials and a review of relevant research about  the relationship between pedestrian fatalities and motor vehicle  characteristics.

According to HLDI, passenger cars include regular two-door models,  regular four-door models, station wagons, minivans, sports models and  luxury models, while SUVs are vehicles with conventional front-end  constructions and large passenger and cargo areas which can be built on  either heavy-duty chassis capable of off-road use or passenger car  platforms. HLDI definitions for vehicle body type classifications differ from  those used by NHTSA. According to HLDI officials, however, the  classifications are comparable. For our analysis, we used these data to  calculate the proportion of vehicles that were passenger cars, light trucks,  or SUVs from 2008 through 2018.", "We also conducted interviews with federal government and non- governmental organizations about the relationship between vehicle  related characteristics and pedestrian injuries and fatalities, as well as  issues related to NHTSA\u2019s pedestrian safety data and potential data gaps  and limitations. To discuss NHTSA\u2019s pedestrian safety data, we spoke  with NHTSA officials from the Data Reporting and Information Division,  Mathematical Analysis Division, and Vehicle Research and Test Center.  We also spoke with officials from the National Transportation Safety  Board, which conducts independent accident investigations and  advocates for safety improvements, including those related to pedestrian  safety and motor vehicles. Non-governmental organizations we spoke  with included IIHS and major auto industry trade associations, such as  the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Association of Global  Automakers, the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, and  the Automotive Safety Council. We also spoke with vehicle safety  advocates, such as the Governors Highway Safety Association. These  organizations were selected based on their relationship to the auto  industry, referrals from other interviewees, and recent publications on  pedestrian-motor vehicle safety issues. We also identified and reviewed  studies either published or referenced by these organizations to better  understand research related to pedestrian injuries and fatalities and motor  vehicle characteristics. Where appropriate, we conducted a  methodological review of these studies.", "Further, we spoke with academic researchers from six research centers  across four universities with expertise in human-vehicle interaction and  pedestrian-motor vehicle safety, including injury biomechanics and auto  industry data analysis. These researchers were selected based on  referrals from other interviewees and reviews of their organization\u2019s  websites to ensure that their research would be informative for our  purposes. Although these organizations had, or have, relationships with  NHTSA or the auto industry, we included them based on their expertise  with issues related to our work. Based on these criteria we interviewed  officials at the University of Virginia (Center for Applied Biomechanics);  the Ohio State University (Center for Automotive Research; Injury  Biomechanics Research Center); the University of North Carolina  (Highway Safety Research Center), and the University of Michigan  (University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute; International  Center for Automotive Medicine). We conducted interviews with these  researchers to better understand general information on the relationship  between vehicle-related characteristics and pedestrian injuries and  fatalities, uses and limitations of NHTSA data, and potential areas for  further research. Results of our interviews are not generalizable to the  universe of non-governmental organizations or researchers studying  pedestrian-motor vehicle safety. We also spoke with automakers and  equipment suppliers about pedestrian safety and data needs. The  automakers and equipment suppliers were the same as those contacted  about how automakers are addressing pedestrian safety (discussed  below).", "Finally, we reviewed documents and interviewed NHTSA officials about  the Crash Injury Research and Engineering Network (CIREN) and the  associated CIREN pedestrian pilot program NHTSA recently initiated.  This pilot will assess data collection approaches and methodologies for  pedestrian injuries resulting from motor vehicle crashes. Specifically, we  reviewed CIREN contract and methodology documents such as the 2016  CIREN Request for Proposal, 2018 CIREN Pedestrian Pilot Study  Request for Proposal, Task Orders for CIREN centers participating in the  pedestrian pilot study, CIREN Pedestrian Crash Process and Coding  Manual, and the Pedestrian Crash Inclusion Criteria. We also interviewed  NHTSA officials responsible for managing the CIREN program and the  pedestrian pilot study. We assessed this program using criteria for  designing successful pilot programs developed during prior GAO work.", "To describe the approaches automakers have taken to address  pedestrian-motor vehicle safety and discuss stakeholder perspectives on  these approaches, we contacted automakers that sell new vehicles in the  United States. Specifically, NHTSA provided us with a list of 17  automakers that participated in the 2018 New Car Assessment Program.  NHTSA officials told us they do not necessarily include automakers with  low sales volumes in NCAP testing. As a result, to better ensure that we  had a complete list of automakers that sell vehicles in the United States  we compared the names on NHTSA\u2019s listing to the membership lists of  the Alliance for Automobile Manufacturers and the Association of Global  Automakers\u2014two major trade associations of the auto industry. Officials  told us that between the two organizations we would account for most, if  not all, of the automakers that sell new vehicles in the United States.  Finally, we compared our list with 2018 market share data from Ward\u2019s Automotive to identify the automakers with the highest U.S. sales. Based  on our analysis, we identified 17 automakers to include in our work.  However, during our contacts with automakers, we determined that one of  the 17 automakers\u2014Porsche\u2014was part of the Volkswagen Group. Thus,  our final review resulted in a total of 16 automakers to contact as part of  our study (see table 2). Thirteen of the 16 automakers responded to our  request for information.", "We developed a semi-structured interview instrument to collect  information from the automakers. This instrument focused on the  approaches that automakers took to address pedestrian-motor vehicle  safety. The semi-structured interview instrument was peer reviewed by an  independent survey specialist and pretested with two automakers before  we began collecting data. Based upon on their responses, we revised and  clarified the semi-structured interview instrument. In total, 13 of 16  automakers completed and submitted the semi-structured interview  instrument. Those 13 automakers represented approximately 70 percent  of new vehicle sales in the United States for 2018. The interview  instrument asked automakers to identify pedestrian safety features on  their 2019 model year vehicles, as these vehicles would have the most  recent pedestrian safety features available at the time of our work.  Although 12 of the 13 automakers did not respond in full to all the  questions on the semi-structured interview instrument, we obtained  additional information through telephone and in-person interviews  conducted from May 2019 through October 2019. The results of these  interviews are not generalizable to the universe of automakers that may  sell vehicles in the United States. Upon completion of all the interviews, a  GAO methodologist compiled the individual responses from each of the  13 automakers into a database. We used this database to perform a  qualitative content analysis to identify common themes and the frequency  with which the automakers identified certain issues related to pedestrian  safety. A GAO analyst independently verified the themes and certain  other information we received from the automakers to ensure accuracy  and completeness.", "We also used semi-structured interview instruments to obtain information  on stakeholders\u2019 perspectives on the approaches automakers have taken  to pedestrian safety. For purposes of this report, we define stakeholders  as automakers, auto equipment suppliers, and auto industry trade  associations. These organizations develop or deploy pedestrian safety  technology in motor vehicles, or, in the case of the trade associations, are  knowledgeable about the legal and regulatory issues related to pedestrian  safety and the auto industry. In addition to interviewing 13 automakers,  we interviewed officials from five auto equipment suppliers and four auto  industry trade associations (see table 3). The five auto equipment  suppliers included in our work were identified with the assistance of the  Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association, a trade association for  auto industry suppliers. The organization provided us the names of seven  equipment suppliers, five of which agreed to participate in our semi- structured interviews. In general, these equipment suppliers develop or  produce equipment used in motor vehicle crash avoidance or crash  mitigation systems. The semi-structured interview instrument asked  questions about such things as crash avoidance and crash mitigation  technology and the benefits and challenges of this technology. We did not  assess the effectiveness of these features. Additionally, we interviewed  officials from four auto industry trade associations. We conducted  telephone and in-person interviews with these stakeholders from March  2019 through September 2019.", "In addition to automakers, equipment suppliers, and auto industry trade  associations, we also interviewed NHTSA and IIHS about crash  avoidance and crash mitigation technology and reviewed applicable  federal regulations related to pedestrian safety. These include federal  headlight and bumper standards. We also reviewed an October 2018  Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which NHTSA agreed to evaluate  proposed amendments to current federal motor vehicle headlight  requirements. We discussed with NHTSA the federal headlight and  bumper standards and how these relate to pedestrian safety, as well as  any potential changes to these standards to better accommodate  pedestrian safety. Lastly, we reviewed an October 2019 IIHS press  release and an October 2019 American Automobile Association study  discussing the results of pedestrian crash avoidance tests each  organization performed.", "To assess NHTSA\u2019s actions related to pedestrian safety and NCAP, we  reviewed applicable federal laws and regulations related to vehicle safety  as well as documents published in the Federal Register, such as  Requests for Comments, soliciting comments on proposed NCAP  changes related to pedestrian safety. NHTSA provided a high-level  summary of comments received from Requests for Comments issued in  2015 and 2018 that we reviewed. We reviewed selected comments and  supporting documents submitted to NHTSA as part of the docket in  support of the Requests for Comment, such as those provided by auto  industry trade associations, automakers, and auto equipment suppliers.  We also reviewed program documents discussing how NHTSA assesses  new car safety, performs NCAP safety tests, and reports the results to the  public. Further, we reviewed over 55 studies and presentations on the  agency\u2019s work related to pedestrian safety. NHTSA highlighted 22 of  these reports and presentations as being representative of the body of  research that supported and facilitated agency decisions and policies with  respect to pedestrian safety, including the 2015 and 2018 Requests for  Comments. We reviewed the 22 reports and presentations and  determined that 14 met our inclusion criteria, in that the reports and  presentations were focused on potential pedestrian safety tests and their  applicability to the U.S. vehicle fleet, the use of various test instruments,  and the potential safety effects associated with technologies intended to  avoid and mitigate crashes. Where appropriate, we conducted a  methodological review of these studies. In addition, NHTSA officials  provided additional studies after our interviews, which we also reviewed.", "To better understand pedestrian safety testing and issues related to  incorporating such testing into NCAP, we visited NHTSA\u2019s Vehicle  Research and Test Center in East Liberty, Ohio. We interviewed officials  there about NHTSA pedestrian safety research and how it supported  NHTSA\u2019s proposed pedestrian safety tests for NCAP. We also discussed  the applicability of pedestrian safety tests to the U.S. vehicle fleet,  including tests used by Euro NCAP. During our visit, we observed  examples of a pedestrian crash mitigation test for lower leg injury and a  rear-facing pedestrian crash avoidance test. We reviewed NHTSA\u2019s  budget documentation on pedestrian safety research from fiscal year  2008 to 2019, the most recent year for which data were available. We  also visited and discussed pedestrian safety issues with officials of IIHS\u2019  Vehicle Research Center in Ruckersville, Virginia. We observed a  forward-facing pedestrian crash avoidance test. Further, we interviewed  NHTSA officials about such things as the process for making changes to  NCAP and activities associated with this process, documentation of this  process, how NCAP changes are communicated to stakeholders, and  NHTSA plans for determining whether to incorporate pedestrian safety  tests in NCAP. Finally, we interviewed automakers, auto industry  equipment suppliers, and IIHS about incorporating pedestrian safety tests  into NCAP.", "To understand how other NCAPs address pedestrian safety, we  interviewed officials from Euro NCAP and received written responses  from JNCAP to a set of questions we sent them. We also reviewed  supporting documents from both Euro NCAP and JNCAP on pedestrian  crash avoidance and mitigation tests they perform and how such tests are  scored when determining star ratings. Further, we discussed with Euro  NCAP how it works with the auto industry to test vehicles and to develop  future changes to Euro NCAP, including the Euro NCAP roadmap. We  also reviewed selected international studies related to the real-world  benefits of pedestrian safety testing performed by Euro NCAP. We  determined those studies to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To assess how NHTSA\u2019s process for making changes to NCAP compares  to leading practices, we reviewed the Project Management Institute, Inc.,  The Standard for Program Management, and GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. The Project Management  Institute\u2019s standards are utilized worldwide and provide guidance on how  to manage various aspects of projects, programs, and portfolios. In  particular, according to The Standard for Program Management, this  standard provides guidance that is generally recognized to support good  program-management practices for most programs, most of the time.", "We conducted our work from February 2019 to April 2020 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For  example, 12 of 13 automakers reported and two of five auto equipment  suppliers said that crash avoidance features have the overall potential  benefit of eliminating or reducing car-to-pedestrian accidents. The  Highway Loss Data Institute reported in 2017 that one automaker\u2019s  pedestrian automatic emergency braking system reduced pedestrian- related bodily injury liability claims by 35 percent compared to other  vehicles manufactured by that automaker. In addition, the automaker  itself found that, in Japan, its vehicles equipped with the system  experienced 60 percent fewer accidents with injury compared to its  vehicles without the system.", "Officials from automakers and auto equipment suppliers we interviewed  also identified challenges with pedestrian crash avoidance technologies.  Specifically, stakeholders cited some distinctions between the  performance of camera-based and radar-based pedestrian automatic  emergency breaking systems. Almost half of the automakers we  interviewed (six of 13) reported that a primary challenge with a camera- based pedestrian automatic emergency braking system was the camera\u2019s  ability to work in low lighting and poor weather. As previously noted in this  report, about 75 percent of all reported pedestrian fatalities occurred in  2018 after dark.", "In contrast, several automakers stated that radar based pedestrian  detection systems are not dependent on light to function, but that they are  less effective at identifying pedestrians than camera-based systems.  Officials from another automaker said manufacturers have attempted to  offset the challenges of cameras and radar by developing \u201cfusion\u201d  systems (combination of camera and radar). These officials said,  however, these systems add complexity and processing time to the  technology because the system must manage two separate functions that  must be processed together to identify a pedestrian. Officials from  automakers said that a challenge affecting both camera- and radar-based  systems was limiting the occurrence of false positives, or the activation of  these systems when they are not required.", "Recently issued research has raised questions about the overall  effectiveness of crash avoidance systems. In October 2019, the American  Automobile Association (AAA) reported that, based on its own  assessment, some vehicles\u2019 pedestrian safety systems were inconsistent  at either slowing down or stopping a vehicle to avoid hitting a pedestrian.  For example, AAA reported that dark conditions could affect the  effectiveness of available pedestrian detection systems and that none of  the crash avoidance systems on the four vehicles they tested worked in  dark conditions.", "Automaker officials told us that the performance of crash avoidance  systems could be improved through updates to current vehicle headlight  standards. Specifically, officials from four automakers indicated that the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) should update  federal standards for headlights to permit the use of adaptive driving  beam headlights on new vehicles. Adaptive driving beam headlights are  currently in use in European and other countries, and are different from  the combination high- and low-beam systems used in the United States.  In general, adaptive driving beam headlights use advanced sensors and  computing technology to shape the headlamp beams to provide  enhanced illumination of unoccupied portions of the road and avoid  glaring other vehicles.", "In October 2018, NHTSA published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in  which it tentatively concluded that federal standards for headlights do not  permit adaptive driving beam systems because those systems would not  comply with some of the standards. NHTSA, however, has said adaptive  driving beam headlights have the potential to create significant safety  benefits in avoiding collisions with pedestrians, cyclists, animals, and  roadside objects by providing additional front-end illumination. Five  automakers we interviewed said that they offer adaptive driving beam  headlamps as a crash avoidance technology on their vehicles sold in  other countries. In its October 2018 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,  NHTSA sought public comment on amending federal standards to allow  the use of adaptive driving beam systems in response to a petition from  an automaker. NHTSA officials said that it is in the process of developing  a final rule but did not have a period for when it would be issued.", "Another challenge for crash avoidance systems is the federal standard for  bumpers. As previously discussed in this report, this standard requires  that vehicles, including their bumpers, meet specified damage criteria  when bumpers are hit at 2.5 miles-per-hour (mph). Officials from five  automakers said that this standard presented challenges with the  placement of crash avoidance sensors. On some vehicles, crash  avoidance sensors are placed in the same area where the vehicles are  tested for compliance with the bumper standard. As a result, the test  could damage or destroy the crash avoidance sensor. Two automaker  officials told us that they have addressed this challenge by relocating the  sensors to another part of the vehicle to avoid conflicts with the bumper  standard. NHTSA officials told us they are in the process of reevaluating  the bumper damageability standard, including the placement of sensors,  as part of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, which they expect to publish  in early 2020."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Crash Mitigation Benefits and Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Officials from automakers and auto equipment suppliers we interviewed  identified benefits and challenges for pedestrian crash mitigation features.

Officials from four automakers, however, said that crash mitigation  features do not protect pedestrians from the secondary impact of an  accident, such as the residual injuries from hitting the pavement.  Additionally, officials from six automakers said that crash avoidance  features were more effective than crash mitigation features because the  purpose of crash avoidance features is to prevent the collision from  occurring in the first place.", "Similar to crash avoidance, the federal bumper standard may also affect  crash mitigation systems. Officials from eight automakers said that the  bumper standard created challenges to offering additional crash  mitigation features in the United States, such as softer, more pedestrian  friendly bumpers. Officials from the eight automakers said they offered  softer bumpers in Europe or elsewhere\u2014where there is no similar  bumper standard\u2014but do not offer softer bumpers in the United States.  Some stakeholders told us the current bumper standard runs counter to  pedestrian safety, and softer bumpers would help mitigate the severity of  pedestrian injuries. Similarly, NHTSA officials told us the current bumper  standard is primarily a cost savings standard in that it is intended to  reduce repair costs and not necessarily to offer safety protection for  vehicle occupants. NHTSA officials told us that establishing a bumper  standard that addresses pedestrian safety, yet minimizes bumper  damage and repair costs requires tradeoffs.
