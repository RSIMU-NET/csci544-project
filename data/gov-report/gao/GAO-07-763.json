In particular, EPA did not include in its analysis a number of the elements recommended by OMB guidelines for assessing regulatory impacts. For example, EPA did not assess the uncertainty of key assumptions and data. In the analysis, EPA assumed that certain facilities were already complying with at least some of the rule's provisions and, as a result, they would not incur any additional compliance costs because of the amendments. However, the extent of facility compliance with the rule was highly uncertain. EPA did not analyze the effects of alternative rates of industry compliance on the estimated costs and benefits of the revised rule and, therefore, potentially misstated these amounts. Furthermore, EPA's 2002 analysis was limited in that it (1) did not analyze alternatives to the amendments, such as alternative lead times for industry to comply or alternative levels of stringency; (2) did not present the compliance costs that EPA expects facilities to incur or save in the second and subsequent years under the amendments in comparable present value terms (through discounting); and (3) provided only limited general information on the amendments' potential benefits in reducing the risk of an oil spill and its potential effects on human health and the environment. EPA's economic analysis of the 2006 amendments addressed several of the limitations of its 2002 analysis, but it also had some limitations that made it less useful than it could have been for assessing the amendments' costs and benefits. For example, EPA's 2006 analysis assessed the potential effect of industry noncompliance on the estimated costs (or cost savings) and estimated the present value of costs (or cost savings) associated with different alternatives for burden reduction. Nevertheless, as with the 2002 analysis, EPA did not estimate the potential benefits of the 2006 amendments, such as the extent to which they would affect the risk of an oil spill and public health and welfare and the environment. In addition, EPA did not have available nationally representative samples for its analysis; therefore, its estimates of the number of facilities that would be affected by the 2006 amendments may not be accurate. In particular, for one category of facilities, EPA based its estimates of the number of facilities on data available from eight states. Because facilities in these states may not have been representative of facilities nationwide, EPA's use of these data in its analysis could have introduced bias into its estimates of the number of facilities and costs for this amendment. EPA acknowledged that its analysis of the 2006 amendments was not a full accounting of all social benefits and costs but stated that the results were based on the best available information given time and resource constraints."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Billions of gallons of oil, from petroleum products to cooking oils, are  produced, distributed, and used each year in the United States. These  oils\u2014often stored in aboveground storage tanks at various types of  facilities\u2014have sometimes leaked into soil and nearby water, posing  threats to public health and to wildlife and their habitats. To prevent  certain oil spills, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the  authority of the Clean Water Act, issued the Spill Prevention, Control, and  Countermeasure (SPCC) rule in 1973. EPA estimated that, in 2005, about  571,000 facilities in industry sectors such as oil production, petroleum  bulk storage, farming, electric utilities, and manufacturing were regulated  under this rule. Facilities are subject to the rule, as amended, if they are  nontransportation related and have a total capacity of greater than (1)  1,320 gallons in aboveground oil storage tanks or (2) 42,000 gallons in  completely buried oil storage tanks, and if they could reasonably be  expected, due to their location, to discharge harmful quantities of oil into  or upon the navigable waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines.", "The SPCC rule requires each owner or operator of a regulated facility to  prepare or amend and implement a plan that describes how the facility is  designed, operated, and maintained to prevent the discharge of oil into  navigable waters or adjoining shorelines. The plan must also include  measures to control, contain, clean up, and alleviate the effects of an oil  spill so as to prevent such spills from reaching any navigable waters or  adjoining shorelines. According to industry sectors covered by the rule,  facilities may incur significant costs to develop, revise, and implement an  SPCC plan, for such actions as modifying the facility and having an  engineer review and certify these modifications. The extent of the costs  depends on, among other things, the size and type of facility and whether  the facility is a new or existing one.", "In July 2002, as part of an overall government effort to reduce regulatory  burden\u2014and to respond to recommendations made by GAO and an EPA  spills task force\u2014EPA made over 100 amendments to the rule, including  30 that it considered major. Although the intent of some of the  amendments was to strengthen the rule to better prevent oil spills as GAO  and the task force had recommended, EPA also expected that some of  these amendments would, among other things, reduce inefficiencies,  eliminate duplication of effort, reduce the number of facilities regulated by  the rule, and lower facilities\u2019 compliance costs. For example, under the  2002 amendments to the rule, EPA no longer regulates certain completely  buried tanks that are subject to underground storage tank regulations.  This change eliminated from the rule some completely buried containers  and facilities that were previously covered by both sets of regulations and,  therefore, duplicated compliance costs. In addition, the agency made  changes that, in EPA\u2019s view, clarified the rule\u2019s language to better define  which facilities are subject to the rule. However, many industry sectors  consider several of these amendments to be changes to the requirements  of the rule rather than clarifications and, in some cases, maintain that they  had not previously considered themselves subject to the rule prior to these  changes.", "In 2006, partly in response to industry concerns about the cost of  complying with the 2002 amendments, EPA made several major changes to  the rule to further reduce burden and provide owners and operators of  certain facilities a more cost-effective approach to prevent oil spills,  which, according to EPA, could potentially impact about 62 percent of the  regulated universe. For example, the 2006 amendments allowed qualified  facilities, such as those with an oil storage capacity of 10,000 gallons or  less and that meet a reportable discharge history criterion, to self-certify  their SPCC plans rather than hire a professional engineer for certification.  EPA has extended until July 1, 2009, the date by which facility owners and  operators must prepare or amend and implement SPCC plans in  accordance with the 2002 and 2006 amendments, provided that the owners  and operators of facilities in existence on or before August 16, 2002,  maintain their existing plans.", "When finalizing the 2002 and 2006 amendments to the SPCC rule, EPA  conducted economic analyses of the potential impacts that these  amendments were expected to have on the regulated community. Federal  agencies are generally required by statute and executive order to assess  the costs and benefits of significant regulatory actions, including those  that would have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more.  Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) developed  guidelines under Executive Order 12866 to encourage good regulatory  impact analysis and to standardize the way that benefits and costs of  federal regulations are measured and reported. The OMB guidelines  generally direct agencies, in analyzing the impacts of rules, to, among  other things, (1) identify and quantitatively analyze key uncertainties in  their analysis, (2) measure the potential social benefits and costs\u2014 including the effects on public health and welfare and the environment\u2014 of regulatory alternatives incremental to a \u201cbaseline,\u201d (or the conditions  that would exist in the absence of the proposed regulation), (3) identify  the regulatory alternative that would maximize net social benefits (total  benefits minus total costs), and (4) present benefits and costs that would  occur in different time periods in comparable, present value terms. OMB  guidelines further state that good regulatory analysis includes identifying  the regulatory alternative with the largest net benefits (that is, that  maximizes economic efficiency), and such information is useful for  decision makers and the public, even when economic efficiency is not the  only or the overriding public policy objective. EPA concluded, on the basis  of its economic analyses, that the 2002 and 2006 amendments were  economically justified.", "In this context, you asked us to review the reasonableness of the  economic analyses EPA performed in support of the 2002 and 2006 SPCC  amendments. To respond to this objective, we evaluated EPA\u2019s economic  analyses using, among other criteria, OMB guidelines for federal agencies  in assessing regulatory impacts. In addition, we discussed EPA\u2019s analyses  with senior officials in EPA\u2019s Office of Emergency Management, which  was responsible for conducting the analyses. We performed our work from  June 2006 to July 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. A more detailed discussion of our objectives, scope,  and methodology is presented in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of oil into or upon navigable  waters or adjoining shorelines and requires the President to establish  regulations to prevent oil spills. The President subsequently delegated this  responsibility to EPA. To fulfill this requirement, in 1973, EPA issued its  Oil Pollution Prevention Regulation, which outlined actions regulated  facilities must take to prevent, prepare for, and respond to oil spills before  they reach navigable waters or adjoining shorelines. Under this rule, as  amended through 2006, EPA seeks to prevent oil spills from storage tanks  at facilities that (1) have an aggregate aboveground storage tank capacity  of more than 1,320 gallons or a total completely buried storage capacity  greater than 42,000 gallons and (2) could reasonably be expected, due to  their location, to discharge oil in quantities that may be harmful into or  upon the navigable waters of the United States or onto adjoining  shorelines. EPA estimated that about 571,000 facilities were regulated  under the SPCC rule as of 2005. Oil production facilities (an estimated  166,000 facilities or 29 percent of the total) and farms (an estimated  152,000 facilities or 27 percent of the total) account for the largest portion  of these estimated facilities. The SPCC rule does not require facilities that  are covered under the rule to report to EPA that they are covered.", "Therefore, the agency does not have an inventory of facilities that it  regulates under the program. However, facilities are required to report  discharges of oil in quantities that may be harmful to navigable waters or  adjoining shorelines to the National Response Center (NRC), but EPA  does not consider these and other data reliable enough for EPA to  determine the number of facilities subject to the SPCC rule that have had  oil spills.", "The SPCC rule is a cornerstone of EPA\u2019s strategy to prevent oil spills from  reaching the nation\u2019s waters. The regulation requires each owner or  operator of a regulated onshore or offshore facility to prepare or amend  and implement an SPCC plan that describes the facility\u2019s design,  operation, and maintenance procedures established to prevent spills from  occurring, as well as countermeasures to control, contain, clean up, and  mitigate the effects of an oil spill that could reach navigable waters or  adjoining shorelines. Unlike oil spill contingency plans that typically  address spill cleanup measures after a spill to navigable waters or  adjoining shorelines has occurred, SPCC plans ensure that facilities put in  place containment and other measures\u2014such as regular visual inspection  and integrity testing of bulk storage containers\u2014to prevent oil spills that  could reach navigable waters or adjoining shorelines. EPA\u2019s 10 regional  offices administer an inspection program to ensure compliance with the  regulations.", "EPA proposed revisions to the SPCC rule in October 1991 and February  1993. In addition to clarifying previous regulatory language, these  proposed revisions outlined additional requirements for regulated  facilities. In December 1997, EPA proposed additional amendments to the  SPCC requirements, focusing on measures to reduce the information  collection burden on affected facilities. Many, but not all, of the  amendments to the rule proposed by EPA in 1991, 1993, and 1997, were  made final in July 2002.", "EPA made over 100 amendments to the rule in 2002, including more than  30 that EPA considers to be major. Several of these amendments changed  the scope of the rule\u2019s applicability. For example, the 2002 amendments    exempted from the rule containers with a capacity of less than 55 gallons,  completely buried storage tanks subject to all of the technical  requirements of underground storage tank regulations, permanently  closed oil tanks as defined in the regulation, and any facility or part  thereof used exclusively for wastewater treatment; and   eliminated the provision triggering the requirement for an SPCC plan when  any single container has a capacity of greater than 660 gallons but  maintained the 1,320-gallon total capacity threshold.", "The 2002 amendments also added to or changed the language of some  definitions in the 1973 rule in order, according to EPA, to clarify which  facilities are subject to the rule and facilities\u2019 responsibilities under the  rule. For example, according to EPA, the 2002 amendments clarified the  following:    A \u201cfacility\u201d may be as small as a piece of equipment\u2014for example, a  tank\u2014or as large as a military base; \u201coil\u201d includes not only petroleum oil,  but such other products as animal fats, vegetable oils, and oil mixed with  wastes, other than \u201cdredged spoil\u201d; and what \u201cnavigable waters\u201d means for  purposes of the rule.", "The SPCC rule applies to facilities that \u201cuse\u201d oil, such as in the operational  use of oil-filled equipment.", "EPA had always considered statements in the existing (1973) SPCC  regulations that a facility \u201cshould\u201d implement a specific rule provision as  meaning that a facility was required to comply with that provision or, if  circumstances warranted, undertake alternative methods to achieve  environmental protection. As a result, EPA changed \u201cshould\u201d to \u201cmust\u201d to  reflect this understanding and address any confusion that compliance with  such provisions was optional.", "According to EPA, the agency made several of these definitional changes  to clarify the types of facilities that are included under the rule and  facilities\u2019 requirements. However, many industry sectors consider several  of these amendments to be changes to the requirements of the rule rather  than clarifications and, in some cases, maintain that they had not  previously considered themselves subject to the rule prior to these  changes. (A summary of industries\u2019 views on the impacts that these and  other amendments to the SPCC rule have had or are likely to have on the  regulated community, and our analysis of these views, are included in  apps. II and III, respectively.)", "Several of the rule\u2019s amendments also changed requirements for preparing,  implementing, reviewing, and amending SPCC plans. For example, the  2002 amendments to the rule    decreased from once every 3 years to once every 5 years, the frequency  with which a facility\u2019s SPCC plan must be reviewed; required that the plan  include a diagram of the facility, and that completely buried storage tanks  located on the facility\u2014otherwise exempt from SPCC rules\u2014be included  on the facility diagram; and   gave EPA regional administrators the authority to require that any facility  within their jurisdiction amend the SPCC plan after on-site review of the  plan and extend the period of time for facilities already in operation to  amend or complete their plans.", "Other amendments to the rule in 2002 changed facility requirements  regarding the use and testing of containers, piping, and other equipment to  prevent or mitigate the effects of oil spills from containers. For example,  the 2002 amendments    amended the integrity testing requirements for aboveground containers  and required brittle fracture evaluation of field-constructed aboveground  containers that may have a risk of discharge;    added specificity to the description of secondary containment  requirements, such as detailing that the containment system, including  walls and floors, must be capable of containing oil and constructed so that   any discharge from the primary containment system is prevented from  escaping before cleanup occurs; and required a facility to conduct periodic integrity testing of containers and  piping, in addition to the other requirements\u2014i.e., contingency planning  and a written commitment of resources\u2014when the owner/operator  determines and clearly explains that the installation of specific secondary  containment structures or equipment is not practicable.", "In December 2006, EPA again made several changes to the SPCC rule,  including several major amendments to provide additional burden relief to  the regulated industries on specific rule provisions. For example, the  scope of the rule\u2019s applicability was changed, potentially reducing the  number of facilities under the rule, by excluding motive power containers  from the rule\u2019s requirements. In addition, the 2006 amendments also  changed requirements for preparing SPCC plans by providing an option for  \u201cqualified facilities\u201d to prepare a self-certified SPCC plan instead of one  that is reviewed and certified by a professional engineer. The 2006  amendments also decreased some secondary containment requirements to  reduce the burden for facilities. For example, the 2006 amendments    exempted facilities from having to construct and meet requirements for  specific sized secondary containment for mobile refuelers; and   allowed facilities to use alternatives to general secondary containment  requirements for qualified oil-filled operational equipment, such as  preparing an oil spill contingency plan and a written commitment of  resources to control and remove discharged oil, and requiring an  inspection or monitoring program.", "Although changes to the rule were finalized in 2002 and 2006, EPA  extended the date of compliance in 2003, 2004, 2006, and 2007. Currently,  owners and operators of facilities in existence on or before August 16,  2002, must continue to maintain their SPCC plans, and then must amend  them to ensure compliance with current requirements, and implement the  amended plan no later than July 1, 2009. Facilities beginning operations  after August 16, 2002, must prepare and implement a plan by July 1, 2009.  EPA made this latest extension to, among other things, allow owners and  operators of facilities the time to fully understand the 2002 and 2006  amendments and the further revisions to the rule EPA plans to make in  2008 and to make changes to their facilities and SPCC plans.", "EPA determined that the 2002 and 2006 amendments constituted  significant regulatory actions under Executive Order 12866. For significant  regulatory actions, Executive Order 12866 requires agencies to assess the  benefits and costs of, and reasonably feasible alternatives to, the planned  regulatory action. In response, EPA conducted an economic analysis to  provide estimates of the potential costs and benefits of the amendments.  In addition, the agency conducted economic analyses of the 2006  amendments, both as proposed in 2005 and as made final in December  2006.

For the purposes of its analysis, EPA assumed that the  baseline represented full compliance by regulated facilities with the  existing (1973) regulation, as well as industry behavior, practices, or  standards that exceed the existing regulation. After establishing the  baseline, EPA classified each regulatory revision or amendment into one   of five categories: baseline, cost increase, negligible increase, cost savings,  or negligible savings.", "Second, EPA estimated the total number of potentially affected facilities  covered by the regulation to account for differences in the total potential  costs for different sizes of facilities. Because estimating the economic  effects of the amendments first required information on the size of the  regulated community, EPA used a 1995 survey that it had conducted to  determine the estimated number and size of production and storage  facilities in most regulated industry sectors.", "Third, EPA estimated the costs of compliance for each regulated facility  (that is, hours multiplied by the wage rate) for certain amendments,  varying costs for each facility by its size. EPA developed costs for each  facility for amendments considered to have cost increases or cost savings  that were not negligible.", "Finally, EPA estimated the annual total compliance costs (or cost savings)  associated with the amendments by multiplying the estimated costs per  facility by the estimated number of affected facilities, taking into account  whether the facility was small, medium, or large. EPA then aggregated the  first-year and subsequent-year costs or savings incurred by all facilities.", "On the basis of this methodology, EPA estimated the costs that facilities  will incur by implementing the 2002 amendments. As shown in table 1,  EPA estimated that facilities will incur costs the first year and then save  costs in the following years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Did Not Assess the Uncertainty Associated with Key Assumptions and Data", "paragraphs": ["EPA\u2019s estimates of the economic impacts of the 2002 SPCC amendments  are based on assumptions and data that are subject to uncertainty. In  conducting its analysis of the amendments, however, EPA did not evaluate  these uncertainties, as OMB guidelines advise. For example, EPA did not  consider the uncertainties relating to its assumptions about facilities\u2019  compliance with the existing 1973 SPCC rule and the potential impacts of  revisions that were intended to clarify what types of facilities are subject  to the rule. According to EPA, many of the 2002 SPCC amendments are  either clarifications or editorial in nature, or they do not represent a  substantive change in the existing regulatory requirements. In assessing  the economic impacts associated with these amendments, EPA maintained  that the clarifications were making explicit provisions or requirements  that were already implicit in the existing SPCC rule, rather than  introducing new ones. Therefore, in its analysis, EPA assumed that all  regulated facilities were in full compliance with these existing provisions  and would not incur any additional compliance costs as a result of the  amendments. In addition, to the extent that regulated facilities were not in  compliance with the provisions being clarified, EPA assumed that any cost  they would incur to comply should be attributed in its analysis to the  baseline and not to the 2002 amendments. However, the extent to which  facilities were in compliance\u2014or would be in compliance in the future in  the absence of the amendments\u2014is highly uncertain. As a result, EPA\u2019s  cost estimates do not fully reflect the potential impacts of the  amendments.", "If, contrary to EPA\u2019s assumption, facilities were not previously in  compliance with the clarified provisions, but are brought into compliance  by the 2002 amendments, the estimated costs (or cost savings) that should  be attributed to the 2002 amendments would be higher (or lower), all else  remaining the same. For example, in commenting to EPA and OMB on the  proposed 2002 amendments, a representative of the electric utility industry  stated that, until EPA clarified in the 2002 amendments that \u201cusers\u201d of oil  are subject to the rule, the electric utility industry did not believe that the  SPCC rules applied to electrical equipment. Because of EPA\u2019s clarification,  however, facilities in this industry found that they were subject to the rule  and EPA would consider them to have been out of compliance. As a result,  the representative stated, the clarification would cause that industry to  incur substantial costs to modify its facilities to meet the requirements of  the amendments, such as installing secondary containment.", "EPA\u2019s economic analysis stated that it was possible that some facilities  misinterpreted the existing regulation and were not in full compliance  with it, but there was no practical way to measure industry compliance.  OMB guidelines indicate, however, that agencies can use uncertainty  analysis to assess the effect of multiple baselines with different  assumptions about the degree of compliance, particularly when industry  compliance with existing regulations is uncertain and when different  assumptions about compliance could substantially affect the estimated  benefits and costs. Without such an analysis, EPA excluded the potential  impact of current industry practice from its assessment of the total costs  and benefits associated with the 2002 amendments, thus potentially  misstating these amounts.", "In addition, EPA did not account for the uncertainty associated with its  estimates of the number of facilities affected by the amendments. Because  these estimates were subject to sampling error, EPA may not have  accurately presented the number of facilities subject to the amendments.  For example, for its estimates, EPA used a 1995 survey, which was based  on a statistical sample of facilities in the 48 contiguous states. On the basis  of this survey and subsequent adjustments agency officials made using  their professional judgment, EPA estimated that 51,398 facilities would no  longer be subject to the requirements of the SPCC rule as a result of the  2002 amendments. However, like estimates from all statistical samples,  EPA\u2019s estimates are subject to sampling error, which is the imprecision  that results from surveying a sample of facilities rather than surveying  every facility in the country. In its 2002 analysis, EPA acknowledged the  sampling error, stating that its estimates of the number of facilities were  accurate within plus or minus 10 percent. However, EPA did not account  for this sampling error when estimating the costs associated with the  amendments. OMB guidelines direct that the agencies ensure that their  estimates reflect the full probability distribution of potential results.  Consequently, to account for the imprecision in the estimated facilities  and costs, it would have been appropriate for EPA to analyze the  uncertainty associated with these estimates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s 2002 Analysis Had Other Limitations", "paragraphs": ["OMB guidelines direct agencies to consider the most important alternative  approaches to some or all of a rule\u2019s provisions and provide their reasons  for selecting the preferred regulatory action over such alternatives.  However, EPA\u2019s 2002 analysis did not assess alternatives to the  amendments, such as alternative levels of stringency or alternative lead  times to comply. To provide decision makers and the public with  information on how the costs and benefits might vary depending on the  regulatory approach, it would have been appropriate for EPA to assess the  effect of alternatives in its analysis of the 2002 amendments. Without  information on the benefits and costs of alternative regulatory actions, it is  difficult to confirm that EPA\u2019s preferred regulatory approach maximizes  net benefits.", "Moreover, OMB guidelines state that agencies should discount costs and  benefits that accrue in different time periods to present values. As  depicted in table 1, EPA did not present the total cost estimate (costs  incurred minus cost savings) of the amendments in comparable, net  present value terms. Instead, EPA estimated the costs that would be  incurred in the first year that the rule is in effect and the cost savings that  facilities would achieve in the second and subsequent years. EPA officials  stated that the present value of estimated costs is not significantly  different from the cost estimates in the simple analysis it conducted  absent the discounting. Nonetheless, since EPA estimated costs incurred  and cost savings in the first year and each subsequent year over the life of  the amendments, it would have been appropriate for EPA to present the  total net costs in comparable present value terms. To compute present  value, the agencies are directed to discount the estimated benefits and  costs using interest rates recommended by OMB.", "Finally, OMB guidelines direct agencies to quantify and monetize the  benefits (including the benefits of risk reductions) associated with the  regulatory action, whenever possible. Moreover, when benefits are  difficult to monetize, the OMB guidelines state that acceptable quantitative  estimates of benefits and costs are preferable to qualitative descriptions.  In cases where quantification is difficult, the guidelines direct the agencies  to present any relevant quantitative information and describe the  unquantifiable effects. In its analysis of the 2002 amendments, however,  EPA did not monetize or quantify the potential benefits expected to result  from any of the amendments. In addition, EPA\u2019s qualitative discussion of  the potential beneficial aspects of the 2002 amendments was very limited.  For example, the agency discussed the general risk of an oil spill and the  general damage that might be caused to public health and welfare and the  environment. EPA stated that it assumed that the amendments would have  minimal effects on the risks of a spill, lessen the burden to the regulated  community, and maintain the existing level of protection to public health  and welfare and the environment. Nonetheless, some of the 2002  amendments are more stringent than the existing SPCC rule, possibly  reducing the risk of an oil spill, while other amendments are less stringent  (that is, burden reducing), possibly increasing the risk of an oil spill.  Without more substantive information on the potential effect of the  amendments on the risk of an oil spill and the resulting effect on public  health and welfare and the environment, it is difficult to confirm that the  benefits of the amendments exceed their costs, as EPA concluded."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Economic Analysis of the 2006 SPCC Amendments Improved on the Earlier Study but Also Had Limitations", "paragraphs": ["EPA\u2019s economic analysis of the 2006 amendments to the SPCC rule  addressed several of the limitations in the agency\u2019s 2002 analysis.

In addition, because  EPA did not have data on the precise number of facilities that would be  affected by the amendments, EPA assessed the uncertainty associated  with its estimates using arbitrarily developed scenarios for three of the  major components of the rule. Based on this approach, EPA assumed that  various percentages of the facilities would be affected by the regulatory  changes in the rule. For example, for facilities with qualified oil-filled  operational equipment, EPA analyzed the cost savings under different  assumptions about the number of facilities that would be affected by the  rule, ranging from 25 percent to 75 percent of the total number.", "Moreover, unlike its 2002 analysis, EPA\u2019s 2006 analysis also analyzed and  discussed some regulatory alternatives. For example, for the version of  these amendments that were proposed in 2005, EPA proposed an  exemption on the oil-filled operational equipment requirement for  facilities that had no reportable discharges from their equipment within  the prior 10 years of the date of their SPCC plan certification. Partly in  response to comments on the proposed rule, EPA narrowed the restriction  in the 2006 final rule to owners and operators that have not had a  discharge exceeding 1,000 gallons or two discharges exceeding 42 gallons  within a 12-month period in the 3 years prior to SPCC plan certification.  Oil spills that are the result of natural disasters are not subject to these  limitations. In its economic analysis of the 2006 final rule, EPA discussed  the differences between the cost estimates for the restriction proposed in  2005 and the estimates for the restriction adopted in 2006. EPA estimated  that the final rule cost savings would be greater under certain conditions  (that is, if 75 percent of facilities are affected by the amendment), than  estimated in the proposed version."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s 2006 Analysis Also Had Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Despite the improvements over its 2002 analysis, EPA\u2019s analysis of the  2006 amendments also had some limitations that made it less useful than it  could have been for assessing the economic trade-offs associated with the  amendments. For example, EPA did not quantify or monetize the potential  impacts of the 2006 amendments on the risk of an oil spill and on public  health and welfare and the environment. Instead, EPA provided only a  very limited qualitative discussion of the general risk of an oil spill and the  general potential damages that it might cause. EPA reported that the  reduced compliance costs will translate to net social benefits, but that  these benefits might be partially offset by the potential increase in the risk  of an oil spill (because of the less stringent requirements of the 2006  amendments compared with the existing requirements). EPA also stated  that quantifying net benefits (benefits minus costs) associated with the  2006 amendments was not possible due to unknown future impacts of the  rule, but it concluded that cost savings resulting from the amendments will  not be offset by any significant losses in environmental protection.  Nonetheless, it is difficult to affirm EPA\u2019s conclusion without more  substantive information on the potential effect of the amendments on the  risk of an oil spill and the resulting effect on public health and welfare and  the environment.", "In addition, because EPA\u2019s estimates of the number of facilities that would  be affected by the 2006 amendments were not based on nationally  representative samples, the results may not be accurate. In particular, for  the one amendment that would reduce the burden for certain SPCC- regulated facilities, EPA based its estimates of the number of facilities that  would be affected by this amendment on data drawn from eight states:  Florida, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota, New York, Oklahoma, Virginia, and  Wisconsin. Because facilities in these states may not have been  representative of facilities nationwide, EPA\u2019s use of these data in its  analysis could have introduced bias into its estimates of the number of  facilities and costs for this amendment. Furthermore, EPA excluded from  its analysis more than half of the facilities in these eight states because the  industrial category for these facilities could not be determined and could  not be matched to an additional database. By not including such a high  proportion of facilities on a nonrandom basis, additional error was likely  introduced into EPA\u2019s estimates of the number of SPCC-regulated  facilities. It is, therefore, unclear whether the facilities that EPA included  in the analysis are even representative of the universe of facilities within  these eight states. EPA acknowledged these limitations in its analysis and  stated that the analysis provided the best possible results given time and  resource constraints. However, the actual number of U.S. facilities, and  hence the resulting cost impacts, could be greater or less than EPA  estimated.", "Overall, EPA reported that its analysis did not fully comply with OMB  guidelines for conducting economic analyses of significant regulatory  actions.

However, although EPA\u2019s 2006 analysis improved upon its 2002  analysis, both analyses had limitations that may make it difficult for  decision makers, stakeholders, and the public to verify that the agency has  fully analyzed the economic impacts of its regulatory actions. Specifically,  because EPA did not analyze key uncertainties in its analysis of the 2002  amendments, including the degree to which facilities were in compliance  with some of the revisions, the reliability of the estimated costs and cost  savings is questionable. In addition, EPA did not assess regulatory  alternatives in its analysis for the 2002 amendments, making it difficult to  confirm that EPA\u2019s preferred regulatory approach is economically  superior to other possible approaches. Moreover, because EPA did not  estimate the impact of the amendments on the potential risk of an oil spill  and on public health and welfare and the environment for either the 2002  or the 2006 amendments, EPA\u2019s economic analyses may not provide  decision makers, stakeholders, and the public with a sufficient basis for  concluding that the benefits of the amendments outweigh their costs, as  EPA did.

EPA noted that, consistent with  our recommendation, the agency has (1) activated a core SPCC Economic  Subgroup of economic and technical experts; (2) acquired additional  expert contractor support; and (3) hired an experienced senior economist  to guide these efforts, and plans to continue gathering additional data to  improve its understanding of the regulated universe and oil spill risks, and  to address uncertainty and quantify benefits.", "In addition, EPA commented that the agency believes that the economic  analyses that it conducted for the 2002 and 2006 amendments to the SPCC  rule are already consistent with, and meet the spirit and intent of, OMB  guidelines, given the limited data, time, and resources available. However,  because both the 2002 and 2006 amendments to the SPCC rule were  significant regulatory actions potentially affecting thousands of facilities  across a wide range of industries, it is important for EPA to have a  credible economic basis for selecting its preferred regulatory actions. In  particular, we found that EPA\u2019s analyses were generally not consistent  with OMB guidelines in some key areas, including accounting for the  extent to which facilities were in compliance with the existing 1973 rule  and in assessing the impact of the amendments on the risk of an oil spill  and public health and the environment.

However, their  views on the extent of the anticipated impacts varied widely depending on  the type of requirement. Overall, industry stakeholders responded that the  2006 amendments would have a positive impact on their industries and  that the 2002 amendments would have a combination of both positive and  negative impacts. We identified five categories of amendments that  increase SPCC requirements. Of these five categories, we found that  industry stakeholders view two as having a mostly negative impact on  their industry, two as having a somewhat negative impact, and one as  having a somewhat positive impact. In addition, we identified four  categories of amendments that decrease SPCC requirements. Of these four  types, we found that industry stakeholders view three as having a mostly  positive impact on their industry and one as having a somewhat positive  impact. Finally, we identified one category of amendments that both  increase and decrease requirements and another category of amendments  for which we could not determine whether the amendments either  increase or decrease the requirements.
