While the pipeline was under construction, we reviewed the status of pipeline construction and the effectiveness of federal and state monitoring efforts. These and subsequent reports, as well as congressional hearings, publicized recurring problems with the condition of the pipeline, the quality assurance program of its operator, and the effectiveness of government monitoring efforts. More recently, congressional hearings in 1993 highlighted numerous potential deviations from federal and state standards. A 1993 study of TAPS, commissioned by the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (BLM), concluded that the pipeline had deficiencies that, if left uncorrected, could pose serious safety risks for workers and potentially cause a pipeline failure.

Specific operating requirements are contained in federal grant and state right-of-way lease agreements and in additional federal and state regulations and laws. Of the remaining 46 miles of pipeline, 26 miles are administered jointly by federal and state authorities, and 20 miles are owned by private landholders.", "Six federal and six state agencies have significant jurisdiction over some aspect of the pipeline\u2019s operation or the land on which it is located (see table 1.1 for a list of agencies and the nature of their jurisdiction). The five with primary authority are the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management, which is charged with enforcing the federal right-of-way agreement on federal lands; the Alaska Department of Natural Resources (ADNR), which enforces the state\u2019s right-of-way agreement on state-owned lands and the federal agreement on certain state-owned lands; the Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of Pipeline Safety, which is responsible for overseeing the operational safety of the entire pipeline under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act; and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which are responsible for enforcing environmental regulations along the pipeline and at the terminal. EPA is also the federal On-Scene Coordinator for responding to on-shore oil spills.

This office has since become the focal point for overseeing TAPS. Begun with a small staff from the two agencies, JPO had grown to an authorized staff of 84 in April 1995 with staff assigned or on loan from 8 of the 12 agencies with significant oversight responsibility for TAPS. BLM and ADNR are jointly responsible for JPO\u2019s operations. However, in July 1993, the then-director of BLM testified, in response to whistleblowers\u2019 complaints and other investigations that reported lax regulation practices for pipeline workers\u2019 health and safety, that \u201cWhenever and wherever needed, BLM, as lead agency, will assume the responsibility of ensuring that the mandate of the JPO is carried out fully.\u201d Subsequently, the Executive Council was formed and it has taken the lead in providing focused policy guidance to JPO.

Some deficiencies were considered serious in that they have potential for causing severe safety and environmental impacts. Other deficiencies were of a less serious nature: For example, the studies \u2022 criticized Alyeska for being reactive and not focused on building in quality; identified systemic hardware problems that raise questions about the integrity of the TAPS electrical system; and identified hundreds of specific items, such as not having developed procedures for the qualification of inspection personnel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Quality Technology Company Study Highlighted Broad, Systemwide Deficiencies", "paragraphs": ["In response to concerns raised by whistleblowers, safety issues identified by congressional staff, and concerns for how JPO was regulating TAPS, the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, held hearings in July 1993. The hearings highlighted a number of potential problems with TAPS. At these hearings, the Director of BLM acknowledged the problems and told the Subcommittee that BLM, which has primary authority for administering the right-of-way agreement on federal lands, was going to take charge and make sure that the problems were corrected. Subsequently, BLM began a program designed to identify and resolve such problems. As part of the effort, BLM in August 1993 contracted with Quality Technology Company (QTC), an independent consulting firm, to investigate the physical condition of TAPS and the management of operations provided by Alyeska and its contractors. QTC conducted a 6-week on-site review that included visits to the Valdez terminal and three of the pipeline\u2019s pump stations.", "QTC\u2019s final report, issued in November 1993, was highly critical of Alyeska\u2019s management of the pipeline and pointed out that some glaring deficiencies were present in Alyeska\u2019s management and the condition of TAPS\u2019 equipment. QTC identified 22 broadly scoped deficiencies, which were further grouped into three classes according to their potential threat to the safe operation of the pipeline or to the safety of the public and the environment: \u2022 Six deficiencies were considered most threatening because of their potential for causing severe impacts, including death or an oil spill. These deficiencies included a lack of management focus on anticipating and correcting potential problems, a \u201cdysfunctional\u201d quality management program, and massive electrical code violations. \u2022 Nine deficiencies presented moderate threats because of their potential for causing impacts, including severe injury or an oil spill. Examples included the lack of accurate drawings describing the pipeline\u2019s safety system and an inadequate safety inspection program at the Valdez terminal. \u2022 Seven deficiencies fell in the lowest class of threats because their potential impacts were limited to such effects as loss of work time due to injuries or loss of oil.

Since 1990, Alyeska and its regulators have conducted or contracted for more than 40 such studies. Together, they have identified about 500 action items.", "On September 9, 1993, the TAPS owners contracted with Arthur D. Little, Inc. (ADL), an independent consulting firm, to provide a comprehensive independent assessment of TAPS\u2019 operations. Unlike the studies described so far, this one involved a detailed, facility-by-facility review of the entire pipeline and its attendant systems. The assessments were conducted by teams led by ADL personnel and composed of experts from five of the companies that own TAPS and from ADL. The assessments focused on compliance with the requirements and management systems relating to operational integrity. The result of the 9-month review was a list of more than 4,200 site-specific deficiencies, issued in two reports (December 1993 and July 1994). The following are examples of the kinds of deficiencies the study identified: \u2022 At pump station 4, the fire alarm system was not in full working order. It did not provide an immediate sitewide alarm that was audible/visible in all areas of the pump station. \u2022 At the main equipment maintenance facility in Fairbanks, Alyeska and contractor employees working with hazardous materials lacked specific hazard training, and the chemical inventory lists were out of date. \u2022 Alyeska\u2019s quality assurance and inspection process did not have a management system defining responsibilities sufficiently to avoid duplication or omission of critical tasks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Studies Also Showed Problems With Federal and State Regulatory Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In 1991, we reported that federal and state monitoring agencies had not effectively overseen TAPS\u2019 operations. BLM officials told us at that time that JPO was not a regulator. Instead, the agencies relied on Alyeska to police itself. We noted that, for example, the regulators did not systematically or independently assess Alyeska\u2019s corrosion or leak detection systems, nor did they require that Alyeska demonstrate that it could respond adequately to a large-scale pipeline oil spill. We concluded that absent effective monitoring, the regulators could not ensure the safe operation of TAPS. We also reported that regulatory efforts had been hampered by a lack of coordination between the various agencies. We concluded that the recent establishment of JPO was a positive step but that its success was potentially hindered unless leadership, firm commitments from all regulatory agencies, and secure funding sources were in place.", "In 1994, a study by Booz-Allen & Hamilton, an independent consulting firm, concluded that weaknesses in regulatory activity were still present. The study found that JPO was not effectively addressing the prevention of pipeline hazards. More effective oversight, the study concluded, could have precluded many of the problems that QTC had found in its review of Alyeska\u2019s operations.

During 1994, Alyeska continued to transport almost 1.6 million barrels of oil per day through the pipeline, conduct normal maintenance, and carry out numerous projects to upgrade the pipeline system. Alyeska estimates that in 1994, it spent about $81 million on upgrades in three broad areas. About $23.7 million was devoted to programs aimed at ensuring that Alyeska\u2019s operations did not adversely affect the environment through spills or air emissions. About $34.6 million was devoted to improving the protection of the pipeline\u2019s integrity through enhanced corrosion prevention and detection. About $20.2 million was devoted to improving Alyeska\u2019s ability to respond to emergencies related to tanker transport.", "During 1994, Alyeska also reorganized the company from a centralized, functionally structured organization to an organization in which more of the responsibilities are now decentralized to \u201cbusiness units.\u201d The purpose of the reorganization was to provide the business units with increased control over the resources they need to operate and to provide greater accountability for operations.

To assess the reliability of Alyeska\u2019s reports, we (1) reviewed the procedures that Alyeska\u2019s quality assurance staff uses to monitor corrective actions and the documents certifying completion of various steps in the process, (2) reviewed JPO\u2019s procedures for verifying corrective actions and the documents certifying completion of various steps in the process, (3) accompanied JPO inspectors on field visits to observe inspections as they were being made, and (4) performed on-site reviews of a number of the reported corrections. However, because the number of action items was so extensive and because many of the actions taken were still under way, we did not systematically verify the accuracy of Alyeska\u2019s entire list of corrections.
