GAO used CMS and VA data to develop an estimate of VA spending on Medicare-covered services. GAO reviewed CMS documentation and interviewed CMS and VA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2010, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system provided $2.4 billion in inpatient and outpatient services to the 833,684 veterans enrolled in Medicare Advantage (MA), a private plan alternative to Medicare fee-for-service (FFS). While the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), generally pays Medicare FFS providers separately for each service provided, MA plans receive a monthly payment from CMS to provide all services covered under Medicare FFS. These monthly payments are based in part on a bidding target, known as a benchmark, and risk scores, which are used to adjust the payment amount to account for beneficiary demographic characteristics and health conditions. Both the benchmark and risk scores are calibrated based on Medicare FFS spending. Therefore, VA's provision of Medicare-covered services to veterans enrolled in Medicare FFS likely resulted in lower Medicare FFS spending and, in turn, lower overall payments to MA plans. However, the extent to which these payments reflect the expected utilization of services by the MA population remains uncertain. Specifically, payment amounts may still be too high or could even be too low, depending on the utilization of VA services by veterans enrolled in MA plans and veterans enrolled in Medicare FFS. If, for example, veterans enrolled in MA receive a greater proportion of their services from VA relative to veterans enrolled in Medicare FFS, then the benchmark may be too high. Conversely, payments may be too low if MA-enrolled veterans tended to receive fewer Medicare-covered services from VA relative to veterans enrolled in Medicare FFS. Assessing these possible differences would require data on the services veterans receive from MA. CMS began collecting these data in 2012 but, as of August 2015, had yet to take all the steps necessary to validate the accuracy of the data, as GAO has previously recommended.", "CMS also lacks data on VA diagnoses and utilization that may improve its methodology for determining if an adjustment to the benchmark is needed to account for VA's provision of Medicare-covered services to veterans enrolled in Medicare FFS. Federal standards for internal control call for management to have the operational data it needs to meet agency goals to effectively and efficiently use resources and to help ensure compliance with laws and regulations. While CMS determined that no adjustment was necessary for 2010 through 2016 based on a 2009 study it performed, CMS's methodology did not account for services provided by and diagnoses made by VA, which can only be identified using VA's data. CMS officials updated the agency's study in 2016 using the same methodology, but with more recent data. CMS officials told GAO that they did not plan to incorporate VA utilization and diagnoses data into their analysis because (1) they do not currently have such data and (2) incorporating these data would introduce additional uncertainty into the analysis. However, if an adjustment is needed but not made or if an adjustment is too low due to limitations with CMS's methodology, it could result in some plans being paid too much and others too little. If CMS does revise its methodology and determines that an adjustment to the benchmark is necessary, it may need to make additional adjustments to MA plan payments, as discussed in this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["CMS should (1) assess the feasibility of revising its methodology for determining if an adjustment to the benchmark is needed by obtaining diagnoses and utilization data from VA and (2) make any additional adjustments to MA plan payments as appropriate.

Unlike in  Medicare FFS, where providers are generally paid separately for each  service provided, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)  pays MA plans a fixed per member per month (PMPM) payment to  provide all services covered under Medicare FFS. This payment does  not vary on the basis of the individual services beneficiaries receive.  Veterans enrolled in an MA plan can also enroll in the Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system and may receive Medicare- covered services from either source. A 2012 study estimated VA  provided $13 billion in covered services to 1.2 million veterans who were  also MA enrollees between 2004 and 2009. The authors characterized  VA spending on Medicare-covered services as \u201cduplicate federal  payments,\u201d although they stated that they were unable to quantify the  amount of excess federal payments to MA plans on behalf of VA  enrollees because they did not have access to data needed to determine  how the services provided by VA affect CMS payments to MA plans.  Information on this relationship is critical because any potential excess  federal payments could be reduced, or eliminated, if MA payments were  sufficiently lower as a result of MA-enrolled veterans obtaining care  through VA instead of their MA plans.", "VA\u2019s provision of Medicare-covered services could also result in PMPM  payments to some individual MA plans that are too low.

When veterans  from those counties are enrolled in Medicare FFS but receive Medicare- covered services from VA, average per capita Medicare FFS spending is  lower than it otherwise would have been if veterans received all of their  services from Medicare FFS; this can lower the benchmark and  correspondingly lower PMPM payments to MA plans. The resulting  PMPM payment would be the same for both veterans and nonveterans.  However, the amount may, on average, be too high for veterans and too  low for nonveterans. As a result, individual MA plans that enroll a  disproportionately high number of nonveterans may receive a PMPM  payment that is too low.", "To address the possibility that PMPM payments for nonveterans are too  low, CMS is required to adjust payments to MA plans, as appropriate, to  account for the effect of VA\u2019s provision of Medicare-covered services.

This amount is based in part on a plan\u2019s bid, which is its projection of the  revenue it requires to provide a beneficiary with services that are covered  under Medicare FFS, and a benchmark, which CMS generally calculates  from average per capita Medicare FFS spending in the plan\u2019s service  area and other factors.

In  general, for those counties in the highest Medicare FFS spending  quartile, benchmarks will be equal to 95 percent of county per capita  Medicare FFS spending, and for those counties in the lowest Medicare  FFS spending quartile, benchmarks will be equal to 115 percent of per  capita Medicare FFS spending. Prior to 2012, benchmarks in all  counties were at least as high as per capita Medicare FFS spending, but  were often much higher. For example, while counties generally had  benchmarks that were derived from per capita county Medicare FFS  spending, the benchmarks were generally increased annually by a  minimum update equal to the national growth rate percentage in Medicare  FFS spending. In cases where the growth rate used to update the  benchmark was greater than the rate at which per capita Medicare FFS  spending grew within a county, it would result in a benchmark that was  higher than the average per capita county Medicare FFS spending rate.  In addition, some urban and rural counties had benchmarks that were  \u201cfloor\u201d rates, which were set above per capita county Medicare FFS  spending rates to encourage insurers to offer plans in the areas.

As a result, any VA spending on  Medicare-covered services for veterans enrolled in Medicare FFS that  is related to these diagnoses would be excluded when the model is  calibrated. In addition, MA plans would generally not have access to  diagnoses made by VA. Therefore, when VA identifies and treats a  diagnosis not identified by the veteran\u2019s MA plan, it would not be  incorporated into the veteran\u2019s risk score.

Per  capita county Medicare FFS spending rates serve as the basis of the  benchmarks used in determining MA payment rates. To determine  whether an adjustment was needed, CMS obtained data from VA  showing veterans who are enrolled in VA health care and Medicare FFS  (that is, enrollment data). CMS then estimated the effect of VA spending  on Medicare FFS spending by calculating average per capita county  Medicare FFS spending for nonveterans and comparing it to the average  per capita county Medicare FFS spending for all Medicare FFS  beneficiaries, after adjusting for beneficiaries\u2019 risk.

Excluding those services could have the effect of deflating  veterans\u2019 risk-adjusted Medicare FFS spending and therefore total per  capita county Medicare FFS spending.", "Conversely, estimates of per capita county Medicare FFS spending  for all beneficiaries, including veterans, may be too high because  excluding diagnoses identified only by VA could result in Medicare risk  scores that are too low, which would have the effect of inflating  veterans\u2019 risk-adjusted Medicare FFS spending and therefore total per  capita county Medicare FFS spending.", "Thus, depending on the number and mix of services provided by and the  diagnoses made by VA, risk-adjusted Medicare FFS spending for  veterans may either be higher or lower than it would be if CMS accounted  for VA-provided services and diagnoses.", "Second, because CMS\u2019s study was done in 2009, it did not account for  changes to the benchmark calculation that occurred under PPACA and  that are to be phased in from 2012 through 2017. CMS noted in 2009 that  only 45 of the 3,127 counties nationwide would have had per capita  county Medicare FFS spending rate increases after accounting for VA  spending. According to CMS, the number of affected counties was as low  as it was in part because many counties had payment rate minimums,  which often resulted in benchmarks that were higher than per capita  county Medicare FFS spending. However, as noted earlier in this report,  PPACA revised the benchmark calculation to more closely align  benchmarks with average per capita county Medicare FFS spending  rates. As these revised benchmark calculations are implemented,  counties will no longer have benchmarks set based on minimum updates  or floor rates.

HHS indicated that it will continue  to review the need for incorporating additional data or for methodology  changes in the future. As we note in the report, only VA\u2019s utilization and  diagnosis data can account for services provided by and diagnoses made  by VA. Depending on the number and mix of services provided by and the  diagnoses made by VA, risk-adjusted Medicare FFS spending for  veterans may either be higher or lower than it would be if CMS accounted  for VA-provided services and diagnoses. Therefore, relying exclusively on  Medicare FFS spending to estimate the effect of VA spending on  Medicare FFS-enrolled veterans could result in an inaccurate estimate of  how VA spending on services for Medicare FFS-enrolled veterans affects  per capita county Medicare FFS spending. While there may be  challenges associated with incorporating VA utilization and diagnosis data  into CMS\u2019s analysis, we maintain that CMS should work to do so given  the implications that not incorporating the data may have on the accuracy  of payment to MA plans. We continue to believe that an important first  step would be for CMS to assess the feasibility of incorporating VA  utilization and diagnosis data in a way that can overcome the challenges  identified by CMS and potentially lead to a more accurate adjustment.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

VA provided us with an enrollment file that  included veterans enrolled in VA health care for at least 1 month in fiscal  year 2010 and whom VA had identified as having at least 1 month of  Medicare private plan enrollment. To determine months of MA enrollment  in fiscal year 2010, we matched the VA enrollment file to Medicare\u2019s  calendar year 2009 and 2010 Denominator Files based on whether  beneficiaries had the same Social Security number and either the same  date of birth, sex, or both. We excluded those beneficiaries who did not  have at least 1 month of overlapping MA and VA health care enrollment.  In addition, we excluded veterans in the VA enrollment file that did not  have a VA enrollment start date, were listed as having died prior to fiscal  year 2010, or were not enrolled in one of the four most common MA plan  types. After all exclusions, we identified 833,684 veterans with at least 1  month of overlapping enrollment in an MA plan and VA health care in  fiscal year 2010.", "We identified all inpatient and outpatient services provided by VA to those  veterans in our population during fiscal year 2010. VA can provide  inpatient and outpatient services directly at one of its medical facilities or  it can contract for care, known as VA care in the community; we received  inpatient and outpatient utilization files for both types of VA-provided care.  We excluded prescription drug services from our analysis, as payments to  MA plans for coverage of Part D services are determined differently than  are payments for other Medicare-covered services. We also excluded  services that were received during a month when the veteran was not  enrolled in both VA health care and an MA plan. We considered an  inpatient stay, which can last multiple days, to be during a month when  the veteran was enrolled in both VA health care and an MA plan if 1 or  more days of the stay occurred during a month in which the veteran was  enrolled in VA health care and an MA plan. In some instances, hospital  stays had an admittance date prior to fiscal year 2010 or a discharge date  after it, and in those cases, we included only the portion of the stay that  occurred during fiscal year 2010.", "We excluded those inpatient and outpatient services that were provided  by VA but were not covered by Medicare. For inpatient services directly  provided by VA, we used the category of care assigned to each service  by VA to exclude service categories not covered by Medicare, such as  intermediate and domiciliary care. In addition, we excluded services  provided by VA that went beyond Medicare benefit limits. Because MA  plans may have different benefit limits than Medicare fee-for-service  (FFS), we analyzed the benefits offered by a sample of 45 MA plans for  2014 for services covered by Medicare FFS that have benefit limits. We  identified the most common benefit limits for those services and used  those as our benefit limits for VA services. In cases where some or all MA  plans had service categories with lifetime reserve days (e.g., inpatient  days beyond the 90 days Medicare covers per benefit period, up to an  additional 60 days per lifetime), we made the assumption that  beneficiaries had 25 percent of their lifetime reserve days remaining. For  inpatient services provided through VA care in the community, we  excluded hospice services; services with cancelled payments; and  services with a classification of dental, contract halfway house, pharmacy,  reimbursement, or travel. For outpatient services directly provided by VA,  we excluded services that were not included in the Medicare physician  fee schedule; ambulance fee schedule; clinical lab fee schedule; durable  medical equipment, prosthetics/orthotics, and supplies fee schedule;  anesthesiology fee schedule; or ambulatory surgical center fee schedule.  We also excluded services that had a Medicare physician fee schedule  status code indicating they were a deleted code, a noncovered service,  had restricted coverage, or were excluded from the physician fee  schedule by regulation. For outpatient services provided through VA care  in the community, we made the same exclusions as for outpatient  services provided by VA and also excluded hospice care services and  services with cancelled payments.", "We calculated total VA spending and CMS payments to MA plans for  beneficiaries for months in which they were enrolled in both VA health  care and an MA plan in fiscal year 2010 and evaluated how, if at all, VA  spending on these services affects CMS payments to MA plans. To  calculate VA\u2019s estimated spending, we assigned all Medicare-covered  services directly provided by VA a cost, using VA\u2019s average cost data;  and for services provided through VA care in the community, we used the  amount that VA disbursed to the service provider. We calculated total MA  spending for veterans enrolled in MA and VA using actual CMS payments  to MA plans for our population in fiscal year 2010. To evaluate how VA  spending on Medicare-covered services affects CMS payments to MA  plans, we reviewed CMS documentation and interviewed CMS officials.", "To evaluate the extent to which CMS has the data it needs to determine  an appropriate adjustment, we reviewed CMS documentation and  interviewed CMS officials. As part of this effort, we also evaluated CMS\u2019s  methodology for a study it used as the basis of its decision to not adjust  county per capita Medicare FFS spending rates for VA spending on  Medicare-covered services. Our evaluation was based on a review of  CMS documentation and an interview with CMS officials.", "To assess the reliability of the data we used in our analyses, we reviewed  related documentation, interviewed knowledgeable officials from CMS  and VA, and performed appropriate electronic data checks. This  assessment allowed us to determine that the data were reliable for our  objectives.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2013 to April 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
