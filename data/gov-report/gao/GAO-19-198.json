In fiscal year 2018, DODIG received over 12,000 contacts from potential whistleblowers related to fraud, waste, abuse, employee misconduct, or other violations. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 included a provision for GAO to review the integrity of DOD's whistleblower program. This report assesses the extent to which DODIG and the military service IGs (1) met and took steps to achieve key fiscal year 2018 timeliness and quality goals, (2) established processes to protect whistleblower confidentiality, and (3) are able to safeguard sensitive information necessary to handle whistleblower complaints.

For example, DODIG met its goals related to referring complaints to the appropriate agency within a certain number of days. All IGs also generally met goals related to the quality of investigations. However, about 85 percent of DODIG reprisal and senior official misconduct investigations exceeded statutory and internal timeliness goals. Further, military service IGs did not meet most goals for handling cases within prescribed timeframes. For example, the service IGs averaged between 17 and 84 days to notify DODIG of their receipt of whistleblower reprisal allegations, exceeding the 10-day goal. The IGs have various initiatives underway to improve timeliness, such as a Naval IG program to reduce timeframes for initial credibility determinations. However, additional actions could provide a more targeted approach to improving performance against unmet timeliness goals\u2014such as for senior official misconduct investigations\u2014and better assure whistleblowers that their cases will be handled expeditiously.", "DODIG and the military service IGs have policies to protect whistleblower confidentiality, but some gaps exist. For example, DODIG guidance for protecting whistleblowers who report internal DODIG misconduct does not specify key steps investigators should take to protect confidentiality, such as not identifying complainants during interviews with case subjects. Also, Air Force, Naval, and Marine Corps IG guidance does not specify when whistleblower identities can be disclosed without consent. Without updated guidance, the IGs cannot ensure the consistent implementation of confidentiality protections.", "The IGs have taken steps to safeguard whistleblower information in their information technology (IT) systems and applications, such as by restricting access to case information through unique user permissions and by taking actions to follow DOD's IT risk management process. However, between 2016 and 2018, employees in all of the IGs have been able to access sensitive whistleblower information without a need to know. For example, DODIG determined that numerous restricted whistleblower records in its document repository were accessible to DODIG personnel without a need to know. Similarly, the Air Force IG's application did not restrict users from other DOD components from viewing Air Force IG case descriptions and complainant identities, while the Army IG's application and the Naval IG's system did not restrict personnel within those IGs from viewing allegations or investigations involving other personnel within those IGs. Additionally, employees in Marine Corps IG offices were able to see whistleblower cases assigned to other IG offices without a need to know. While some actions have been taken to address these issues, additional steps are needed to restrict access to case information in order to mitigate ongoing risks to whistleblower confidentiality.", "DODIG generally met key documentation requirements for the 125 cases it dismissed without investigation involving civilian DOD Presidential appointees with Senate confirmation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making 12 recommendations, including that the IGs take additional actions to improve timeliness, develop additional procedures to protect whistleblower confidentiality, and take steps to further limit IG employee access to sensitive whistleblower information.

The  survey achieved an 80 percent response rate.", "For the third objective, we reviewed documentation and interviewed  officials on the extent to which DODIG and the military service IGs have  developed, implemented, and assessed key information technology (IT)  security controls, and authorized the IT systems and applications used to  process, store, and transmit sensitive whistleblower information. These  reviews were based on requirements and standards prescribed by  DOD, the Office of Management and Budget,  and the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Comments  from DODIG and the Air Force, Army, and Marine Corps IGs are  reproduced in appendix V; the Naval IG concurred in an email. These IGs  also provided technical comments, which we have incorporated as  appropriate.", "In its comments, DODIG stated that it will seek to implement the  recommendations. In addition to highlighting recent and planned  improvements, DODIG provided additional comments on some of the  report\u2019s findings and statements. In particular, DODIG noted that the  report understated its improvements in timeliness, such as by stating that  DODIG did not meet timeliness goals related to average days of senior  official and military reprisal intakes, and average days for reprisal  oversight reviews. Citing figure 2, DODIG further stated that it met its  timeliness goals in more than 60 percent of all senior official and reprisal  intake cases, including 87 percent of senior official oversight review  cases, and that it met its 15-day goal in more than 70 percent of senior  official intakes. We agree that DODIG achieved these percentages and  present the associated data in figure 2. However, as described in the  report, and shown in figure 2, DODIG did not meet its goals for the  average days of senior official misconduct and military reprisal intakes,  and the average days for reprisal oversight reviews. Nonetheless, it is  encouraging that DODIG has taken and planned actions to improve  timeliness as its caseload has increased, including by increasing its staff  by about 29 percent since fiscal year 2016, during which time it reported  that its caseload similarly increased by about 26 percent.", "DODIG also noted that the report presented some information in a  manner that could create an incomplete impression of the agency\u2019s  commitment to protecting whistleblower confidentiality. Specifically, DOD  stated that the report\u2019s presentation of survey data related to DODIG  employee concerns about internal DODIG processes may give a  misleading impression because of the focus on the small number of  respondents who had a negative impression. In particular, DODIG noted  that more than 80 percent of respondents either believed that DODIG\u2019s  internal process for reporting misconduct protected confidentiality  somewhat or very well, or did not know if it did so. However, a positive  perspective cannot be inferred from the respondents that reported not  knowing whether or not DODIG\u2019s internal process protects confidentiality  (42 percent). Also, it should be recognized that the respondents that held  negative views on DODIG\u2019s process for reporting internal misconduct (16  percent) accounted for a substantial proportion of respondents (28  percent) that held either positive or negative views on this issue.  Importantly, these and other survey information presented in the report  also provide valuable information on the degree to which DODIG  employees have confidence in the integrity of these important internal  processes, and, as mentioned, align with other information obtained  during our review. As such, this information may help to inform DODIG\u2019s  efforts in addressing our recommendation to issue formal guidance  documenting procedures for protecting the confidentiality of  whistleblowers throughout its internal misconduct process, along with any  future efforts to instill employee confidence in internal misconduct  reporting mechanisms.", "DODIG also noted that portions of the report addressing restrictions on  DODIG employee access to sensitive whistleblower records need further  context, stating specifically that no DODIG employees outside of the  Administrative Investigations directorate, Office of Professional  Responsibility, and Office of General Counsel had access to any of the  records, and that there was no evidence that any person without a need  to know accessed any such records. However, information provided to us  by DODIG does not show that accessibility was limited in all instances to  employees within one of those DODIG offices. Also, the ability of any  employee to access records that were specifically restricted to protect  complainant identities or internal records belonging to the Office of  Professional Responsibility is problematic given the increased sensitivity  of such records. Further, while DODIG did not identify instances in which  anyone without a need to know accessed the records, DODIG did not  provide evidence that all cases of improper access were thoroughly  investigated, as we state in our report, and the instances included in the  report are examples and not inclusive of all instances of improper access  identified by the DODIG. Nevertheless, it is positive that DODIG has  reported taking corrective action to address instances of improper  accessibility. It is also encouraging that DODIG plans to implement our  recommendations, as the potential for unauthorized access will persist  until it establishes cross-directorate controls in the case management  system and enhances its processes for periodically reviewing user  privileges for its whistleblower case management system and document  repository.", "All of the military service IGs concurred with the recommendations  directed to them. The Air Force and the Army IGs also provided  comments on some of the report findings. In particular, the Air Force IG  noted in relation to our third recommendation that language in Air Force  Instruction 90-301, updated in December 2018, is essentially the same as  5 U.S.C. Appendix \u00a7 7, and that this language precludes Air Force  officials at any level from waiving the requirement to inform complainants  and employees of the requirement to not disclose their identities without  their consent, unless the Inspector General determines such disclosure to  be unavoidable. However, as stated in our report, Air Force guidance did  not include requirements outlined in DOD Instruction 7050.01 related to  the specific conditions under which information disclosures may be made  without complainant consent. These include circumstances wherein a  complainant has made it known outside IG channels that he or she  submitted the complaint, there is an emergency situation or health or  safety issue, or the allegation is being transferred outside of DOD to  another IG. As a result, we continue to believe that without updated  policies and procedures that fully implement confidentiality standards, the  Air Force IG may not be able to ensure the consistent implementation of  confidentiality protections.", "Separately, in relation to IG employee access of information, the Army IG  stated that the processes it has in place provide judicious access and  control of whistleblower information to achieve an appropriate balance  between efficient operations and minimized risk. As stated in our report,  DODIG\u2019s 2018 quality assurance review of the Army IG found that the  Army IG\u2019s application did not restrict personnel without a need to know  from accessing allegations involving Army IG personnel, contrasting with  NIST guidelines, which predicate user access on the need to accomplish  assigned tasks. Army IG officials acknowledged this issue, but stated that  the Army IG had elected to not use existing resources to further develop  its case management application in light of the enterprise system being  developed by DODIG. As a result, we continue to believe that by  considering actions prior to the advent of the enterprise system\u2014which is  not expected to be released to the Army IG until fiscal year 2021\u2014the  Army IG could mitigate risks to whistleblower confidentiality by reducing  the potential for unauthorized IG employee access of whistleblower  records.", "We are sending copies of this report to congressional committees; the  Acting Secretary of Defense; the Department of Defense Principal Deputy  Inspector General performing the duties of the Inspector General; the  Inspectors General of the Air Force, the Army, the Navy, and the Marine  Corps; the Office of Special Counsel; and other interested parties.

We also reviewed the results  of DODIG\u2019s quality assurance reviews of the Air Force (2017), Army  (2018), and Naval (2016) IGs. We performed a web-based survey of the  entire population of 108 DODIG Administrative Investigations directorate  employees directly involved with the handling of whistleblower cases to  ascertain whether, in their view, confidentiality processes are being  implemented in accordance with guidance and standards, identify  potential confidentiality violations, and to gather perceptions on the  integrity of the internal process for reporting misconduct, among other  things. We removed four employees from our initial population of 112  employees because two employees left DODIG prior to the initiation of  our survey and two employees were new to the organization and  therefore likely not familiar with the issues covered by the survey.", "To conduct the survey, we developed 27 questions covering (1) access to  and protection of sensitive and classified whistleblower information; (2)  confidentiality guidance, safeguards and identity disclosures; (3) resolving  internal conflict through DODIG\u2019s Office of the Ombuds; and (4) reporting  misconduct through the internal DODIG process for DODIG employees to  report misconduct. A survey specialist helped to develop these questions,  and another survey specialist provided independent feedback on the  questions to ensure that content necessary to understand the questions  was included and that the questions could be answered accurately and  completely. To minimize errors that might occur from respondents  interpreting our questions differently than we intended, we pretested our  survey with seven DODIG employees to ensure the clarity and  reasonableness of the questions. During the pretests, conducted in  person and by phone, DODIG employees read the instructions and each  question out loud and told us whether (1) the instructions and questions  were clear and unambiguous, (2) the terms we used were accurate, and  (3) they could offer a potential solution to any problems identified. We  also asked them for a mock answer to ensure that the questions were  understood as intended. We noted any potential problems identified by  the reviewers and through the pretests and modified the questionnaire  based on the feedback received. A full listing of survey questions is  provided in appendix IV.", "We conducted the survey between June 14, 2018, and July 6, 2018. To  maximize  our response rate, we sent reminder emails and contacted non- respondents by telephone to encourage them to complete the survey. In  total, we received responses from 86 DODIG employees, achieving a  response rate of 80 percent. Although not required, we assessed the  potential for non-response bias by analyzing differences in the percent of  DODIG employees per directorate and job position (e.g., investigator) that  responded to our survey and the percent of potential DODIG respondents  in each directorate and position. We found no meaningful differences  between respondents and our population of potential respondents,  indicating no evidence for non-response bias. Also, we took steps in the  development of the survey, data collection, and data analysis to minimize  nonsampling errors and help ensure the accuracy of the answers that  were obtained. For example, a social-science survey specialist helped to design the questionnaire, in collaboration with analysts having subject- matter expertise. Then, as noted earlier, the draft questionnaire was  pretested to ensure that questions were relevant, clearly stated, and easy  to comprehend, and it was also reviewed by another specialist with  expertise in survey development.", "We calculated the frequency of responses to our closed-ended survey  questions and performed content analysis on the open-ended questions  to identify common themes from across the responses and to determine  their frequencies. The quantitative analysis was performed by one analyst  and independently reviewed by another analyst. For the qualitative  analysis, a standard coding scheme was developed to identify common  themes and determine their frequencies. We also used professional  judgment to identify other themes that were determined to be important  based on our review of case files, discussions with DODIG management,  and review of guidance and relevant standards.", "To determine the extent to which DODIG and the military service IGs are  able to access and safeguard classified and sensitive information  necessary to handle whistleblower complaints, we reviewed  documentation and interviewed officials on the extent to which DODIG  and the military service IGs have developed, implemented, and assessed  key information technology (IT) security controls, and authorized the  systems and applications used to process, store, and transmit sensitive  whistleblower information per requirements and standards prescribed by  DOD, the Office of Management and Budget,  and the National Institute  of Standards and Technology. Collectively, these documents delineate  an array of documentary and procedural requirements related to the  assessment of IT security controls and the authorization to operate IT  systems and applications. We also reviewed plans and interviewed  cognizant officials on the development and implementation of the  Defense Case Activity Tracking System enterprise (D-CATSe)\u2014DOD\u2019s  future system for managing whistleblower information across DODIG and  the military service IGs, and reviewed DODIG\u2019s quality assurance reviews  of the Air Force (2017), Army (2018), and Naval IGs (2016).

We selected data  covering this period of time because they constituted the most recent and  reliable data available, and because DODIG officials told us that data  prior to fiscal year 2013 were unreliable. We also reviewed fiscal year  2013\u20132018 complaint data from the Office of Special Counsel and the  CIGIE Integrity Committee in order to identify possible violations of  confidentiality standards or retaliatory investigations. We assessed the  reliability of DODIG and service IG data by administering questionnaires,  interviewing cognizant officials, and reviewing the methods used to query IG case management systems for this information. We determined the  data to be sufficiently reliable for the limited purpose of identifying  potential confidentiality violations and retaliatory investigations.", "To evaluate the extent to which select misconduct and reprisal cases  involving civilian DOD Presidential appointee with Senate confirmation  (PAS) officials met key documentation and reporting requirements, we  reviewed all 125 administrative misconduct and reprisal cases involving  Senate-confirmed civilian official subjects that were dismissed by DODIG  in fiscal years 2013 through 2017. We chose to review cases from this  period because they constituted the most recent and complete data in  DODIG\u2019s case management system and would therefore most accurately  reflect the extent to which the majority of DODIG\u2019s cases included  required documentation. Also, DODIG officials informed us that  information on cases prior to the implementation of the current case  management system in fiscal year 2013 were both incomplete and  unreliable. During the course of our review, we removed five out-of-scope  cases from the original population of 130 cases, reducing the number of  cases in our population from 130 to 125. Four cases were removed  because the related allegations were investigated, and one case was  removed because it was a record used to track an investigation occurring  at a military service IG.

Core elements of this instrument were shared with DODIG officials to ensure the instrument aligned with  the policies and practices in place when the cases were dismissed. These  core elements represented individual documents and data elements. We  incorporated DODIG\u2019s feedback into our instrument before commencing  the file review. Examples of elements in our review that represent key  data in DODIG\u2019s database or constitute documentation of key steps of the  case-handling process include the following: case open date, case close date, disposition of the matter at intake, dismissal rationale.", "To validate the data collection instrument and ensure consistency in its  application, we developed and followed standard procedures to review a  test sample of 11 case files that were selected from each stratum of  cases (e.g., misconduct) to ensure that each case type was tested at  least once. In reviewing the sample, we adjusted the relevant case file  elements for each case based on its type and circumstances and  captured responses in our data collection instrument accordingly. To help  ensure the accuracy of the information we collected, one analyst  reviewed each casefile and coded for the presence of required  information using the data collection instrument, and another analyst  reviewed the first analyst\u2019s work. In the event that disagreement between  the two analysts occurred, the analysts discussed and resolved the  disagreement by identifying and reviewing supporting database  information or documentation, and obtaining the input of a third analyst, if  necessary, until a final resolution was made.
