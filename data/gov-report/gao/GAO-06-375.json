To address this challenge, USCIS has initiated efforts, both long and near term, to automate the A-Files. The long-term effort is now being re-examined within the context of a larger USCIS organizational transformation initiative. In the near term, USCIS has begun a digitization program, which it estimates will cost about $190 million over an 8-year period to electronically scan existing paper files and store and share the scanned images.

Nevertheless, GAO believes that USCIS's recent decision to re-examine prior agency plans for a strategic A-Files automation solution within the context of an agencywide transformation strategy appropriately recognizes the integral support role that information technology plays in organizational and business transformation. GAO also believes that the success of USCIS's organizational transformation depends on other key supporting practices, such as having a comprehensive and integrated transformation plan (goals and schedules) and results-oriented performance measures. With respect to USCIS's near-term A-Files automation effort, known as the Integrated Digitization Document Management Program (IDDMP), effective planning is not occurring. In particular, USCIS has not developed a plan governing how it will manage this program and its contractors, and it has not developed an evaluation plan for its ongoing digitization concept of operations pilot test, even though it has either awarded or plans to award contracts totaling about $20 million for this pilot. In addition, USCIS officials told us they do not yet know which A-Files immigration forms will be scanned.

To address  this challenge, USCIS plans to pursue both long-term and near-term A-Files  automation efforts. While the scope, content, and approach to its long-term  efforts have not yet been defined, in the near-term, USCIS has begun the  Integrated Digitization Document Management Program (IDDMP), which it  estimates will cost about $190 million over an 8-year period. This program  provides for electronically scanning paper forms and associated  documents contained in the A-Files, storing the resulting electronic images,  and providing user access to the images. Thus far, USCIS has either  awarded, or plans to award, five contracts to pilot test a digitization  concept of operations.

To perform this mission,  staff dispersed among approximately 89 of USCIS\u2019s field offices require,  among other things, access to an alien applicant\u2019s case history information.  Currently, this information resides primarily in the paper-based A-Files.", "To improve the reliability and currency of the A-Files, as well as their  accessibility to geographically and organizationally dispersed users, USCIS  intends to automate the A-Files, beginning with scanning certain forms  contained in the A-Files and storing the resulting electronic images. While  these automation efforts were to be part of their IT Transformation  Program, both A-Files automation and the IT Transformation Program  were recently incorporated into an agencywide organizational and business  transformation effort referred to as the USCIS Transformation Strategy."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A-Files Are Important to Mission Operations of USCIS and Other Agencies", "paragraphs": ["A-Files are a critical component of the USCIS mission of ensuring the  integrity of the immigration system. These files are used by USCIS staff to  make immigration and citizenship decisions. Maintaining the currency of  these files and distributing them in a timely manner has been a long- standing challenge.", "An A-File is the set of records USCIS maintains on certain individuals to  document their interaction with USCIS in actions prescribed by the  Immigration and Nationality Act and other regulations. The single most  important set of records kept by USCIS are A-Files. An A-File contains  between one and hundreds of pages of documents and forms, such as  submitted benefits and naturalization forms, photographs, fingerprints, and  correspondence from family members or third-party sponsors. According  to USCIS, A-File information is used to  grant or deny immigration-related benefits,  capture subsequent status changes,  prosecute individuals who violate immigration law,  document chain of custody for enforcement,  control and account for records in compliance with the code of federal   certify the existence or nonexistence of records.", "USCIS estimates that it currently has more than 55 million of these paper- based files, each of which is to be maintained for a 75-year period.", "Generally, USCIS processes for adjudicating alien benefit requests vary by  type of application or form, and may involve creating, searching,  transporting, obtaining, examining, updating, or storing the A-File. Figure 1  is an example of one such process: the Family-Based Adjustment of Status,  also referred to as the Application to Register Permanent Residence, or  Form I-485. The process of submitting this form involves both manual and  automated steps.", "As illustrated in figure 1, the alien submits the I-485, along with the required  fee and supporting information, to a USCIS \u201clock box\u201d in Chicago that is  operated by the Department of the Treasury on behalf of USCIS. Treasury  then captures the form electronically and creates an extract file containing  selected I-485 data elements that it sends in an electronic format to the  USCIS National Benefits Center (NBC), along with the original paper form  and supporting information. NBC prepares a daily upload file of all cases  that need biometric appointments. This information is used to schedule an  interview and direct the applicant to the Application Support Center, where  biometrics, such as fingerprints, will be captured. NBC obtains the paper  application and the selected electronic data elements, and inputs the data  elements into the Computer Linked Application Management System 3  (CLAIMS 3). In addition, NBC searches a USCIS electronic index system,  known as the Central Index System (CIS), to determine whether an A-File  already exists for the individual. If an A-File does not exist, one is created.  If one does exist, NBC determines its location by accessing an additional  system called the National File Tracking System (NFTS), which tracks the  physical location of the A-File. When NBC obtains the requested A-File, it  merges the Form I-485 into the A-File. NBC then performs an initial name  check using the Interagency Border Inspection System and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI) National Name Check Program, and updates  the A-File with the results.", "While NBC is processing the application, the Application Support Center is  collecting the applicant\u2019s biometrics and sending the data electronically to  the FBI, where a criminal background check is performed on the applicant.  When the FBI has completed the background check, it sends the results to  NBC, which then prints the results and adds them to the A-File.", "When the A-File contains the I-485 application, biometrics, and background  check results, it is transported to the USCIS local office closest to the  applicant for a ruling on the applicant\u2019s request. The local office reviews  the file, interviews the applicant, and makes a decision on the permanent  residence request. The A-File is then transported to the National Records  Center in Missouri for storage (see fig. 2).", "According to a recent report by the DHS Inspector General (IG), this paper- based process is costly. For example,  the estimated costs for copiers and  copy paper for one USCIS service center is more than $400,000 per year.  Further, according to senior USCIS officials, the agency spends  approximately $13 million each year transporting A-Files within USCIS and  to other bureaus and agencies.", "Besides USCIS\u2019s need for A-Files, DHS\u2019s Immigration and Customs  Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S.  Visitor and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) need access  to either the data in the A-Files or the A-Files themselves, as do agencies  external to DHS, including the FBI, the Department of State, and state and  local governments. For example, USCIS officials told us that the FBI uses  A-Files data in performing law enforcement activities. In addition, USCIS  documentation shows that ICE uses A-Files as the principle source of  information for prosecuting aliens who have committed crimes and for  immigration removal proceedings; CBP uses A-Files when it interviews and  arrests aliens; and the Department of State uses data within the A-Files  when issuing visas to alien visitors. According to USCIS officials, obtaining  access to these A-Files has been a long-standing problem."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USCIS Intends to Address Limitations in Its IT and Data-Sharing Environments", "paragraphs": ["The limitations in the USCIS IT and data-sharing environments are not  confined to the A-Files. According to a recent report by the DHS IG, USCIS  uses duplicative, nonintegrated, and inefficient data systems that have  limited information sharing, resulting in data integrity and reliability  problems. For example, adjudicators may need to access more than a  dozen systems using between 5 and 17 passwords, and may have to restart  these systems multiple times to process a given application. In addition, the  IG reported that the networks and hardware platforms across USCIS  offices are outdated and inconsistent. The IG also reported that past  problems in this IT environment have led to small, disparate business  process re-engineering initiatives that were narrowly focused and were not  sufficiently coordinated across the organization to enable standardized  processes.", "To address these limitations, USCIS began an IT Transformation Program  in March 2005 that was led by the agency\u2019s Office of the Chief Information  Officer (OCIO) and was intended to move USCIS progressively toward a  paperless environment that facilitates information sharing. In January 2006,  USCIS reported that this IT transformation effort was being subsumed into  a new, long-term organizational and business transformation effort,  referred to as the USCIS Transformation Strategy. Under this strategy,  according to USCIS officials, long-term solutions to its A-Files automation  needs will be pursued within the context of business process re- engineering.", "In the interim, however, USCIS still intends to reduce the volume of paper  associated with its existing A-Files through a program called the Integrated  Digitization Document Management Program (IDDMP). According to  USCIS, the goals of the IDDMP are to  comply with laws governing electronic information storage and access   reduce the backlog of immigration benefit requests, ensure timely  access to files, and reduce paper-based file storage and transportation  costs; and  respond to a statement in The 9/11 Commission Report that all points in  the border system\u2014from consular offices to immigration services  offices\u2014will need appropriate electronic access to an applicant\u2019s file.", "To accomplish these objectives, IDDMP is to convert paper forms and  documents in existing A-Files to electronic images and manage the  retrieval, movement, retention, and disposition of these images. The  program is not intended to change existing USCIS core business processes,  but rather to merely reduce the amount of paper associated with these  business processes and improve user access to these scanned forms and  documents. The program is estimated to cost about $190 million over 8  years, which includes planning, acquisition of hardware and software  products and services, and operations and maintenance.", "As part of the IDDMP, USCIS initiated a digitization and storage pilot to  scan approximately 1 million A-Files that include adjudicated I-485 forms  and supporting documents (each containing about 100 pages). The  purpose of the pilot is to validate that the digital format satisfies user  needs, to identify network storage requirements, and to provide insight into  potential scanning and storage problems. According to USCIS program  officials, the pilot involves five separate contracts, three of which are  primarily funded from $20 million that Congress had designated for \u201cthe  historical records project to convert immigration records into an  electronic, digitally-accessible format.\u201d The other contracts were awarded  using other USCIS funding. Officials told us that they needed to move  quickly to obligate these funds before they were due to expire at the end of  September 2005, so they awarded four of the contracts in September 2005.  A description of each of the contracts follows.", "Records digitization facility. According to program officials, this  contract is intended to set up a facility for scanning the piloted number of  A-Files and for scanning future A-Files. The contract is to cover preparing  the documents for scanning, scanning the documents, and performing  quality assurance checks on the captured images. It also is to cover  indexing the scanned images using the meta-data standards defined in the  requirements definition contract portion of the digitization pilot and  temporarily storing the images in a staging server until they are accessed  under the enterprise document management service contract. According to  officials, this contract was originally awarded in September 2005, and a  protest was filed in October 2005. During the course of the protest, the  agency took corrective action, which included re-evaluation of the  proposal; the protest was dismissed, the original award was vacated, and a  new award is expected in March 2006. The estimated value of the new  contract is $14 million.", "Enterprise document management service. This contract, awarded in  September 2005, is to gather technical requirements for the design and  implementation of a system to electronically manage the scanned images  created by the records digitization process. In addition, the contractor is to  design and implement a system capable of ensuring image and data quality  and compliance with the DHS document management standard. It also  includes development of a Web infrastructure and implementation of user  interface software components. The value of this contract is about $2.3  million.", "Storage facility infrastructure. Under this contract, awarded in  September 2005, the contractor is to provide hardware, software, and a  wide area network for the digitization and storage process.

These elements  begin with strong, sustained executive leadership to direct and oversee  organizational reforms. Other elements include a comprehensive and  integrated business transformation plan, strategic management of human  capital, effective processes and related tools (such as an enterprise  architecture to provide a business and technology blueprint and associated  road map), and results-oriented performance measures that link  institutional, unit, and individual personnel goals, measures, and  expectations.", "Until recently, USCIS had high-level, technology-focused plans for  modernizing its information systems environment, including plans for  automating its A-Files. These plans were part of the OCIO\u2019s IT  Transformation Program, which included four components: (1)  establishing and evolving a mature CIO organization; (2) improving the IT  infrastructure; (3) implementing an information-based architecture to  facilitate information standardization, security, and sharing; and (4)  providing new business capabilities. However, agency officials told us in  January 2006 that the IT Transformation Program has been reconsidered  and will now be incorporated into a broader effort referred to as the USCIS  Transformation Strategy. While this broader organizational and business  transformation strategy has yet to be formally documented, officials told us  that the strategy will, among other things, align IT modernization with  broader organizational and business process changes. Restated, the IT  modernization will be neither separate from nor the driver of  organizational transformation. Rather, it will support and enable  organizational transformation. To illustrate, one approach to long-term A- Files automation could potentially involve doing away with both paper  forms and electronic images of these forms and instead provide for the  electronic capture of data when the applications are filed using Web-based  services and management of the captured data via corporate data  warehouses to facilitate data access and sharing.", "USCIS\u2019s more broadly based organizational and business transformation  concept, in which IT modernization will be treated as an enabler rather  than an independent undertaking or a driver, is more consistent with  effective transformation practices employed by successful organizations.  However, our experience has shown that successful organizations also  perform other key elements related to organizational and business  transformation.
