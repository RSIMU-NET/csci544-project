Medicaid\u2014 a joint federal-state health care financing program covering certain  categories of low-income individuals\u2014is the largest payer of long-term  care services and accounted for 32 percent of nursing home expenditures  in 2012. As the number of elderly Americans continues to grow and more  individuals are likely to need long-term care, Medicaid spending for  nursing home care is projected to increase, placing additional burden on  already strained federal and state resources.", "Medicaid offers health care coverage, including coverage for long-term  care services, to individuals whose assets\u2014both income and resources\u2014 are insufficient to meet the costs of necessary medical services.  Individuals applying for Medicaid coverage for long-term care must meet  certain financial and functional eligibility criteria. To meet the financial  eligibility criteria, individuals must have assets that fall below established  standards, which vary by state, but are within standards set by the federal  government. Not all assets are countable in determining financial  eligibility for Medicaid. For example, states generally exclude\u2014within  specified limits\u2014the value of an individual\u2019s primary residence, car, and  prepaid burial arrangements. Additionally, federal law includes provisions  to discourage individuals from reducing their countable assets\u2014for  example, by transferring them to family members\u2014in order to establish  financial eligibility for Medicaid coverage.

The processing of Medicaid applications is  generally performed by local or county-based eligibility workers. Our  previous work found that, to determine eligibility, states generally required  applicants to submit applications and provide documentation of certain  assets. States varied, however, in the amount of documentation required  from applicants, the information they obtained from third parties to verify  the accuracy of applicants\u2019 reported assets, and in the proportion of  applicants whom they identified as having transferred assets for less than  FMV during the look-back period. Some of the variation we found raised  questions about whether states had sufficient information about  applicants\u2019 assets to implement federal requirements.

Most recently, the  Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), enacted in February 2006, amended  some existing provisions regarding asset transfers and introduced new  requirements related to financial eligibility for Medicaid coverage for long- term care. For example, the DRA extended the look-back period from   36 months to 60 months for transfers occurring on or after its enactment,  changed the calculation and timing of the penalty period for those  transfers, and introduced new requirements for how certain types of  assets\u2014such as an individual\u2019s primary residence and an annuity\u2014 should be considered when determining Medicaid eligibility.

The  length of the penalty period is calculated based on the value of the gift  and the private payment rate for nursing home services in the state or  locality. However, our interviews identified mechanisms that either  reduce the length of the penalty period after it has started or provide  funds to pay for care during the penalty period. These mechanisms are  referred to as \u201creverse half-a-loaf\u201d because they can be used to preserve  at least half of an individual\u2019s resources.", "A \u201creverse half-a-loaf\u201d mechanism that reduces the length of the penalty  period involves gifting countable assets to someone else and then, after  eligibility has been determined and the penalty period begins, having a  portion of the gift returned to the applicant. This option only works in  states that choose to consider a partial return of transferred assets in  recalculating the penalty period. According to CMS, states can choose  whether or not to consider a partial return of transferred assets. In states  that consider partial returns, the original length of the penalty period  would be shortened in proportion to the amount of assets returned.", "Another \u201creverse half-a-loaf\u201d mechanism involves an applicant gifting a  portion of their countable resources, incurring a penalty, and converting  other countable resources into an income stream for the applicant\u2014such  as through an annuity or promissory note\u2014to pay for nursing home care  during the penalty period. The amount of income generated from the  annuity or promissory note would be equivalent to the shortfall between  the applicant\u2019s other monthly income, such as Social Security and  retirement income, and the cost of his/her nursing home care during the  penalty period. A representative from one law office we spoke to in an  undercover capacity suggested that the applicant could gift about   50 percent of her resources, and while serving a penalty period, the  applicant would use monthly income from a promissory note plus other  monthly income to pay for the nursing home care. Another representative  from a law office mentioned that the larger the applicant\u2019s income, the  larger the amount that the applicant can gift. This is because an applicant  with higher income would need less additional income from an annuity or  promissory note to cover the costs of nursing home services during the  penalty period. Thus, an applicant with higher income would need to  place a smaller amount of their countable resources into an annuity or  promissory note, allowing them to gift more of their countable resources  even if it may result in a longer penalty period.", "Reverse Half-a-Loaf  One applicant who appeared to use the  \u201creverse half-a-loaf\u201d mechanism gifted  $62,470 to his children and was assessed a   6 month penalty period.

The most  commonly unreported asset those eligibility workers reported finding  in bank statements were life insurance policies. Specifically, eligibility  workers from 7 of the 12 counties in which we conducted interviews  reported that life insurance policies are commonly not reported and  may be found while reviewing itemized bank statements because the  statements may show a payment for the life insurance premium.

All the eligibility workers we interviewed,  however, said they ask for additional information if they see large  withdrawals in the bank statements that were submitted. For example,  eligibility workers from one county that requires only a single month of  documentation said if there is questionable information in the  documentation they will request that the applicant submit additional  months of documentation.

For example, eligibility workers from one county stated that  they require applicants to provide 5 years of tax returns. These workers  indicated that income tax returns include much information that workers  would otherwise not be able to access, such as information about  ownership of life insurance policies, stocks, or any other asset that earns  dividends.
