Factors associated with this growth include reduced private-sector financing following the financial crisis and Ex-Im's authorization of direct loans--a product not offered by export credit agencies in some other countries--to fill the gap in private-sector lending.", "Ex-Im's processes for determining credit subsidy costs, loss reserves and allowances, and fees account for multiple risks. To implement the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 and other requirements, Ex-Im calculates subsidy costs and loss reserves and allowances with a loss model that uses historical data and takes credit, political, and other risks into account. Consistent with industry practices, Ex-Im added factors to the model in 2012 to adjust for circumstances that may cause estimated credit losses to differ from historical experience. Opportunities exist to further improve the model. For example, Ex-Im uses a 1-year forecast of certain bond defaults to predict possible changes in loss estimates from changed economic conditions. However, a short-term forecast may not be appropriate for adjusting estimated defaults for longer-term products. Ex-Im's fees are generally risk-based and, for medium- and long-term products (about 85 percent of Ex-Im's exposure), guided by international agreements that set minimum fees that account for credit and political risk.", "As of December 2012, Ex-Im reported an overall default rate of less than 1 percent. However, Ex-Im has not maintained data needed to compare the performance of newer books of business with more seasoned books at comparable points in time, a type of analysis recommended by federal banking regulators. Also, without point-in-time data showing when defaults occur, the precision of Ex-Im's loss model may be limited. Ex-Im has been self-sustaining since 2008 and has generated receipts for the government. But, because Ex-Im's portfolio contains a large volume of recent transactions, the long-term impact of this business on default rates and the federal budget is not yet known.", "Ex-Im has been developing a more comprehensive risk-management framework but faces operational risks. Ex-Im manages credit and other risks through transaction underwriting, monitoring, and restructuring. Ex-Im also started addressing recommendations by its Inspector General (IG) about portfolio stress testing, thresholds for managing portfolio concentrations, and risk governance. GAO\u2019s review of internal control standards and industry practices indicates that the IG\u2019s recommendations represent promising techniques that merit continued attention. Ex-Im has not yet made plans to report its stress test scenarios and results to Congress, although doing so would aid congressional oversight and be consistent with internal control standards for effective external communication. Ex-Im faces potential operational risks because the growth in its business volume has strained the capacity of its workforce. Ex-Im has determined that it needs more staff, but it has not formally determined the level of business it can properly manage. GAO internal control standards state that agencies should develop a risk-management approach based on how much risk can be prudently accepted. Without benchmarks to determine when workload levels have created too much risk, Ex-Im\u2019s ability to manage its increased business volume may be limited."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im should (1) assess whether it is using the best available data for adjusting the loss estimates for longer-term transactions to account for global economic risk, (2) retain point-in-time performance data to compare the performance of newer and older business and to enhance loss modeling, (3) report stress testing scenarios and results to Congress, and (4) develop benchmarks to monitor and manage workload levels.

To comply with this requirement, Ex- Im must manage the wide variety of risks associated with providing export  financing. The recent growth in Ex-Im\u2019s exposure has heightened interest  in ensuring that Ex-Im has proper controls in place to minimize these risks  while meeting the needs of U.S. exporters. Furthermore, a report issued  in September 2012 by Ex-Im\u2019s Inspector General (IG) identified  weaknesses in Ex-Im\u2019s risk-management policies and procedures and  made several recommendations for improvement. As with any credit  institution, Ex-Im expects that some portion of the credit it offers will not  be repaid, and it estimates these future losses to establish loss reserves  and allowances reported in its financial statements and to comply with  federal budgeting requirements in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990  (FCRA).

We examined  information on the tools and processes Ex-Im uses to determine subsidy  costs and loss reserves and allowances, including Ex-Im\u2019s loss estimation  model, and interviewed Ex-Im officials about their implementation. We  also reviewed international agreements that govern fees charged by  ECAs and reviewed Ex-Im analyses used to support fee adjustments.  Further, we interviewed officials from the four foreign ECAs cited  previously and officials from other selected U.S. federal credit agencies  about their practices for estimating costs, reserving for losses, and setting  fees.", "To assess how Ex-Im\u2019s financial portfolio has performed and the  budgetary impact of its programs, we analyzed Ex-Im\u2019s default rates by  product type and for the portfolio as a whole. We examined end-of-fiscal- year data for 2006 through 2012 and data as of December 31, 2012. We  also reviewed federal banking regulator guidance on monitoring default  rates. Additionally, we examined an Ex-Im analysis of the funds it  received and sent to the Department of the Treasury (Treasury) from  1990 through 2012. We reviewed supporting information in appropriation  acts, the President\u2019s budgets, and Ex-Im\u2019s financial statements for the  same years and determined Ex-Im\u2019s analysis was reasonable.", "To assess the extent to which Ex-Im has a comprehensive risk- management framework, we reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s practices for managing  risks at the transaction and portfolio levels. We reviewed a 2012 report by  the Ex-Im IG on portfolio risk management and determined what actions  Ex-Im had taken in response to the report\u2019s recommendations. We also  identified relevant criteria in our internal control standards and from  practices identified by financial industry groups. In addition, we reviewed  information related to potential operational risks stemming from trends in  Ex-Im\u2019s business volume and workload. We limited our work in this area  to Ex-Im\u2019s human capital management. We analyzed Ex-Im data on the  number of full-time equivalents (FTE) and the number and dollar volume  of transactions authorized from 2006 through 2012.

Official ECAs are organizations that provide  export credits with explicit government backing, where either the  government or the government-owned ECA assumes all or a portion of  the risk. Export credits are financing arrangements designed to mitigate  risks to buyers and sellers associated with international transactions.  Buyers and sellers in international transactions face unique risks, such as  foreign exchange risk, difficulties in settling disputes when damages to  shipments occur, or instability in the buyer\u2019s country. For these reasons,  private lenders may be reluctant to finance a buyer\u2019s purchase of foreign  goods or finance a seller\u2019s operations. Export credit products are meant  to facilitate international transactions by mitigating these risks.", "An international agreement, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD) Arrangement on Officially Supported Export  Credits (the OECD Arrangement), governs various aspects of U.S. and  other member countries\u2019 ECAs. The OECD Arrangement aims to provide  a framework for the use of officially supported export credits; promote a  level playing field, where competition is based on the price and quality of  the exported goods and not the financial terms provided; and provide  transparency over programs and transactions. For example, the OECD  arrangement sets minimum transaction fees. Participants include  Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, South Korea, New  Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United States. The OECD  Arrangement applies to officially supported export credits with repayment  terms of 2 years or more.", "Congress has placed specific requirements on Ex-Im\u2019s operations. For  example, Ex-Im\u2019s charter states that it should not compete with the  private sector. Rather, Ex-Im\u2019s role is to assume the credit and country  risks that the private sector is unable or unwilling to accept. In addition,  Ex-Im must submit annual reports to Congress on its actions to provide  financing on a competitive basis with other ECAs, and to minimize  competition in government-supported export financing. Furthermore, Ex- Im must make available at least 20 percent of its authorized aggregate  loans, loan guarantees, and insurance (export financing) each fiscal year  for the direct benefit of small businesses. Congress also has given Ex-Im  instructions on the share of its financing for environmentally beneficial  exports, including renewable energy, and to expand the promotion of its  financing in sub-Saharan Africa.", "Ex-Im offers a number of export financing products, including direct loans,  loan guarantees, and export credit insurance. Ex-Im makes fixed-rate  loans directly to international buyers of goods and services. These loans  can be short-term (up to 1 year), medium-term (more than 1 year up to 7  years), or long-term (more than 7 years). Ex-Im also guarantees loans  made by private lenders to international buyers of goods or services,  promising to pay the lenders if the buyers default. Like direct loans, loan  guarantees may be short-, medium-, or long-term. Additionally, Ex-Im  provides export credit insurance products that protect the exporter from  the risk of nonpayment by foreign buyers for commercial and political  reasons. This allows U.S. exporters the ability to offer foreign purchasers  the opportunity to make purchases on credit. Credit insurance policies  can cover a single buyer or multiple buyers and can be short- or medium- term. Insurance policies are also available to cover lenders and exporters  that finance purchases by foreign buyers. Ex-Im\u2019s short-term insurance  covers a wide range of goods, raw materials, spare parts, components,  and most services on terms up to 180 days. Medium-term insurance  policies protect longer-term financing to international buyers of capital  equipment or services, covering one or a series of shipments. Financing  under medium-term insurance policies generally can extend up to 5  years.", "Some of Ex-Im\u2019s short-term products are geared toward U.S. small  businesses that have the potential to export but lack sufficient funds to  support export efforts and include direct loans and loan guarantees to  provide these businesses with working capital. Working capital loans are  fixed-rate loans that provide exporters with 6- or 12-month revolving lines  of credit. Working capital guarantees generally cover 90 percent of the  principal and interest on a loan made to an exporter by a private lender.  The guarantees are typically 1 year, but can extend up to 3 years and be  used on a single transaction or on a revolving basis. Ex-Im delegates the  authority for underwriting most of these transactions directly to Ex-Im- approved private-sector lenders.", "Ex-Im\u2019s long-term products are often used in project finance transactions,  what Ex-Im terms \u201cstructured finance\u201d transactions, and aircraft  transactions. These transactions involve complicated financing  arrangements, and Ex-Im has separate divisions to handle them. These  transactions also generally involve a direct loan or loan guarantee and  their value is usually greater than $10 million. Project finance is an  arrangement in which Ex-Im lends to newly created project companies in  foreign countries and looks to the project\u2019s future cash flows as the  source of repayment instead of relying directly on foreign governments,  financial institutions, or established corporations for repayment of the  debt. The projects involve a large number of contracts for completion and  operation. Project finance transactions have repayment terms up to 14  years (18 years for renewable energy transactions) and typically include  the financing of development of a new facility in a foreign country, such as  a factory or power plant, or significant facility or production expansions.  Most of Ex-Im\u2019s project finance transactions have been oil and gas and  power sector projects. In structured finance transactions, Ex-Im provides  direct loans or loan guarantees to existing companies located overseas  based on these companies\u2019 balance sheets plus credit enhancements,  such as escrow or reserve accounts, subject to Ex-Im\u2019s control; special  insurance requirements; and letters of credit pledged to Ex-Im through a  bank or other third party. Structured finance transactions generally have  repayment terms of 10 years (12 years for power transactions). Among  others, Ex-Im has completed structured transactions for oil and gas  projects and air traffic control, telecommunications, and manufacturing  entities. Finally, Ex-Im provides long-term direct loans and loan  guarantees that support the purchase of aircraft.

Credit programs incur subsidy costs when estimated  payments by the government (such as loan disbursements or claims paid  on defaulted loans) exceed estimated payments to the government (such  as principal repayments, fees, interest payments, and recoveries), on a  net present value basis over the life of the direct loan or loan guarantee,  excluding administrative costs.when the present value of estimated payments by the government  exceeds the present value of estimated payments to the government  (collections). When credit programs have a positive subsidy cost, they  require appropriations. Conversely, negative subsidy programs are those  in which the present value of estimated collections is expected to exceed  the present value of estimated payments.", "Credit programs have a positive subsidy  FCRA requires that agencies have budget authority to cover credit  subsidy costs before entering into credit transactions. For their annual  appropriation requests, agencies estimate credit subsidy costs by  cohort. To estimate their subsidy costs, credit agencies estimate the  future performance of direct loans and loan guarantees. Agency  management is responsible for accumulating relevant, sufficient, and  reliable data on which to base these estimates. To estimate future credit  performance, agencies generally have models that include assumptions  about defaults, prepayments, recoveries, and the timing of these events  and are based on the nature of their credit programs. In addition to  assumptions based on agencies\u2019 programs, agencies also must  incorporate economic assumptions included in the President\u2019s budget for  credit subsidy calculations. An agency\u2019s credit subsidy costs can be  expressed as a rate. For example, if an agency commits to guarantee  loans totaling $1 million and has estimated that the present value of cash  outflows will exceed the present value of cash inflows by $15,000, the  estimated credit subsidy rate is 1.5 percent.", "Under FCRA, agencies generally must produce annual updates of their  credit subsidy estimates\u2014known as reestimates\u2014of each cohort based  on information about the actual performance and estimated changes in  future credit performance. This requirement reflects the fact that  estimates of credit subsidy costs can change over time. Beyond changes  in estimation methodology, each additional year provides more historical  data on credit performance that may influence estimates of the amount  and timing of future cash flows. Economic assumptions also can change  from one year to the next, including assumptions on interest rates. When  reestimated credit subsidy costs exceed agencies\u2019 original credit subsidy  cost estimates, the additional subsidy costs are not covered by new  appropriations but rather are funded from permanent, indefinite budget  authority.", "In addition to estimating credit subsidy costs for budgetary purposes, Ex- Im calculates future credit losses for its annual audited financial  statements.

Over  the same period, annual authorizations for long-term products grew from  $8.5 billion to $26.6 billion\u2014a more than three-fold increase\u2014and  accounted for almost 75 percent of the authorizations Ex-Im made in  2012. In particular, annual authorizations for new project and structured  finance transactions, almost all of which used long-term loan guarantees  and direct loans, increased from $1.9 billion in 2008 to $12.6 billion in  2012, or almost half of the long-term authorizations that Ex-Im made in  2012.", "By region, annual authorizations grew most rapidly in Asia and Oceania  (see fig. 3). For example, Ex-Im authorizations for export financing to Asia  grew from $3.6 billion in 2008 to $13.5 billion in 2012, an increase of  about 275 percent.

For example, officials from Ex-Im\u2019s Policy and Planning Group  and industry representatives told us that the growing reluctance of  commercial banks to provide export financing in the wake of the financial  crisis was a primary driver of Ex-Im\u2019s growth. They explained that the  financial crisis diminished the availability of commercial lending and that  Ex-Im provided financing to fill the void. Officials from the foreign ECAs  we contacted described similar effects on their business activity. For  example, officials from the ECAs in Canada and France explained that as  commercial banks withdrew from the trade finance market, their own  export credit activities grew as they made efforts to fill the resulting gap.", "Officials from Ex-Im, industry trade and research organizations, and other  ECAs we interviewed, also said that the ongoing and future  implementation of international banking standards further limited private- sector financing, contributing to growth in ECA activities. For example,  officials cited the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \u201cBasel III\u201d  standards for banking institutions that include risk-based capital and other  requirements. As of December 2012, U.S. regulators were preparing to  finalize rules for implementation of these standards. Ex-Im\u2019s 2011 report  to Congress on export credit competition notes that the transition to Basel  III practices would require most banks to increase prices for export and  other types of financing, and consequently, direct loans from ECAs  became the preferred mechanism for some long-term trade deals.five representatives from industry trade associations and research groups  with whom we discussed this issue agreed that the ongoing  implementation of Basel regulations could further constrain private-sector  export financing in the already tightened lending environment following  the financial crisis. Similarly, officials from Canada\u2019s ECA noted that their  business increased partly in response to banks\u2019 plans for implementing  Basel requirements.", "Commercial bank lending trends in the United States and Europe broadly  demonstrate the reduced availability of private-sector financing during the  2007-2009 financial crisis, including for U.S. small businesses. As shown  in figure 5\u2014which shows the percentage of lenders that tightened or  eased credit standards at different points in time\u2014credit standards  generally tightened during the financial crisis. Following the crisis, more  U.S. banks began to ease rather than tighten credit standards, while more  banks in the euro area continued to tighten standards, though not as  dramatically as they had during the crisis.", "In emerging markets, following the onset of the 2007-2009 financial crisis,  perceptions of risk and the cost of credit in corporate bond markets also  jumped\u2014dramatically for higher-risk borrowers. As shown in figure 6, risk  premiums for corporate bonds spiked in late 2008 and early 2009 and  remain above precrisis levels.", "Ex-Im and officials from industry trade associations and foreign ECAs  noted the significance of Ex-Im\u2019s direct loan product to Ex-Im\u2019s recent  growth. For example, in its 2011 report to Congress on export credit  competition, Ex-Im noted the competitive advantage that direct loans\u2014a  product not offered by some other ECAs\u2014gave Ex-Im and other ECAs  with similar products. As previously shown in figure 2, long-term direct  loan authorizations grew from $356 million in 2008 to almost $12 billion in  2012. Representatives from industry trade associations noted that Ex- Im\u2019s ability to offer direct loans helped Ex-Im to fill the gap in private- sector lending following the financial crisis and implementation of more  stringent banking regulations. Other ECAs also pointed to direct lending  as contributing to their ability to fill financing gaps following the recent  financial crisis. Of the four foreign ECAs we interviewed, two (Canada  and Japan) had existing direct lending capability prior to the 2007-2009  financial crisis. Both agreed that their capability to make direct loans was  an important factor in their ability to fill trade financing gaps.", "Ex-Im officials and representatives from industry trade associations and  research groups identified other possible drivers of Ex-Im\u2019s business that  may have contributed to the recent growth trend. These include increased  demand for U.S. goods and services from emerging markets, increased  production by significant Ex-Im customers, Ex-Im\u2019s outreach efforts to  small businesses and key export markets, and Ex-Im\u2019s response to  growing competition from foreign ECAs. First, Ex-Im has suggested that  demand for U.S. exports, particularly from industrializing emerging  markets (such as in Asia), adds to demand for Ex-Im services.

Ex-Im recently launched  several new small business products and opened four new regional  Export Finance Centers throughout the United States to support small  business exporters. These efforts stem from Ex-Im\u2019s mandate to make available at least 20 percent of annual authorizations to small businesses.  Ex-Im officials explained that outreach efforts are important because  meeting the 20 percent small business requirement has been increasingly  difficult as Ex-Im\u2019s overall portfolio has grown. In addition to its small  business outreach, Ex-Im has been identifying private-sector and public- sector buyers, financial institutions, and key governmental agencies for  each of nine foreign \u201ckey markets\u201d where it expects U.S. export growth to  be strongest in the near future. In its 2010-2015 strategic plan, Ex-Im  cites these country outreach efforts as a way to focus limited Ex-Im  resources in areas with high potential for furthering the agency\u2019s mission  of supporting exports and the jobs they provide. Ex-Im selected the key  markets based on a number of factors, including the size of the export  market for U.S. companies, projected economic growth, anticipated  infrastructure demand, and the need for Ex-Im financing. According to Ex- Im officials, some of these efforts already have produced new  transactions in markets such as Brazil.", "Lastly, according to Ex-Im and representatives from industry trade  associations and research groups, Ex-Im\u2019s activity may continue to grow  in response to increased competition from other ECAs, particularly those  in non-OECD countries, but none of the other ECAs we spoke with  suggested that this was a significant factor. Ex-Im\u2019s 2012 Annual Report  emphasizes the importance of its role in ensuring that U.S. exporters  have a fair opportunity to compete with foreign exporters. While the  OECD Arrangement governs various aspects of U.S. and other member  ECAs\u2019 activities, non-OECD ECAs sometimes offer financing terms more  favorable than the terms permitted under the OECD Arrangement. Ex-Im  can respond to foreign competition in export financing by notifying OECD  that it is meeting terms offered by other ECAs in order to preserve U.S.  exporters\u2019 competitiveness. But, because these ECAs are not beholden to  the transparency requirements of the OECD Arrangement, it can be  difficult to confirm the terms and conditions of non-OECD ECA export  financing transactions. Some representatives from industry trade  associations and research groups we interviewed agreed that Ex-Im\u2019s  response to competition from non-OECD ECAs, particularly China, may  have been, and likely would continue to be, a significant factor in  increased Ex-Im activity. Others, such as officials from the Berne Union (a  worldwide association for export credit and investment insurers) noted  that while competition based on financing terms might be a significant  determinant for a small number of international trade transactions,  importers primarily base purchase decisions on the equipment or services  that best meet their needs.

Ex-Im also  excluded any long-term transactions that were within 3 years of the  obligor\u2019s first payment. In addition, Ex-Im removed all transactions that  had not been disbursed as of June 30, 2012, because some transactions  are never disbursed and therefore never have the opportunity to default.

Ex-Im also  developed a concentration factor for obligors in the aircraft sector,  which accounted for 46 percent of Ex-Im\u2019s exposure at the end of  2012. For example, this factor increases the loss rate for an aircraft  transaction if the estimated loss given default (based only on the  market value of the aircraft and the transaction amount) is larger than  the loss given default predicted by the model (which incorporates  other factors).

Over the same period, Ex- Im sent about $15.6 billion to Treasury as a result of credit subsidy  reestimates ($12 billion), cancelled authority ($1.6 billion), returned  collections ($1.3 billion), and rescissions ($675 million).billion of the $5.8 billion net return to Treasury occurred from 2008  through 2012.", "We determined that Ex-Im\u2019s figures for appropriations received and amounts sent to  Treasury were reasonable based on our analysis of Ex-Im appropriations acts, budget  appendixes, and financial statements from 1992 through 2012. downward reestimates in the early- to mid-2000s were due primarily to a  switch from standard loss rates prescribed by OMB to loss rates that  reflected Ex-Im\u2019s historical experience, which tended to be lower. Ex-Im  officials attributed the upward reestimates in 2010 to changes they made  that year in their loss estimation model to account for increased loss  experience in 2009 and uncertainty stemming from the global financial  crisis. Ex-Im officials said that the upward reestimates for 2011 and 2012  for direct loans stemmed from declines in obligor interest rates, which  reduce estimated cash flows. In addition, Ex-Im officials said they  expected further upward reestimates due to modeling changes they made  in 2012, including the addition of the qualitative factors discussed  previously. These modeling changes will be reflected in the subsidy  estimates and reestimates in the 2014 budget.", "The extent to which Ex-Im will continue to send more funds to Treasury  than it receives in appropriations and permanent, indefinite budget  authority will depend partly on future credit subsidy reestimates. Credit  subsidy estimates are based, in part, on economic assumptions that are  uncertain and can change from year to year. In addition, the estimates  are developed using Ex-Im\u2019s loss estimation model, which is not intended  to capture the impact of unexpected economic scenarios that could  substantially affect Ex-Im\u2019s losses. Therefore, changes in underlying  assumptions or adverse economic events could result in upward subsidy  reestimates that may require drawing on permanent and indefinite budget  authority."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ex-Im Faces Operational Risks from Its Growing Portfolio", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ex-Im Uses Various Techniques to Manage Transaction Risks", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im uses a number of risk-management techniques throughout the  different stages of a transaction, which include underwriting, monitoring  and restructuring, and claims and recovery. In January 2013, Ex-Im  completed a comprehensive revision of its policies and procedures  manual that covers each stage.", "Ex-Im manages risks through the underwriting process in several ways.  First, Ex-Im produces a Country Limitation Schedule (CLS) that specifies  the types of transactions eligible for financing in each country and the  conditions under which they are eligible. For example, in some countries,  Ex-Im will not provide financing because the credit and political risks are  deemed to be too high or because of legal prohibitions. In countries  where Ex-Im does business, Ex-Im may only provide financing for  transactions of certain durations or for either public- or private-sector  borrowers. Ex-Im has basic eligibility requirements for obligors. For  example, an obligor must not have been suspended or debarred from  doing business with the U.S. government and may be required to have  been in the same line of business for a specified number of years.  Requirements for obligors also vary by product type and transaction  length.", "For transactions that meet CLS and eligibility requirements, Ex-Im  assigns a risk rating used to determine whether there is a reasonable  assurance of repayment. As previously discussed, the ratings range from  1 (least risky) to 11 (most risky). For transactions conveying the full faith  and credit of a foreign government, Ex-Im officials apply the ICRAS  sovereign risk rating. ICRAS ratings for sovereign obligors are based on  macroeconomic indicators, such as indebtedness levels, balance-of-  payments factors, and political and social factors. For most private-sector  transactions, Ex-Im officials use the private-sector ICRAS rating as a  baseline and adjust that rating depending on their assessment of the  obligor\u2019s creditworthiness and other factors. ICRAS ratings for private- sector transactions in a country are based on qualitative and quantitative  assessments of the depth of private-sector business activity in a country,  the strength of private-sector institutions, foreign exchange availability,  political stability, and other factors. Ex-Im officials assess obligors\u2019  creditworthiness by reviewing information including financial statements  and corporate credit ratings. For more complex transactions, Ex-Im  considers additional information to develop the risk rating. For example,  for project finance transactions, Ex-Im considers the allocation of risk  among project participants, the financial strength of the project, and  market pricing of project inputs and outputs. Ex-Im generally does not  authorize transactions with risk ratings over 8.", "In addition to the CLS and risk rating, Ex-Im uses other processes,  standards, and conditions in underwriting transactions. Examples of these  include the following:", "Due diligence process. Ex-Im reviews information related to the  integrity of the transaction and the character and reputation of the  participants. For example, Ex-Im determines whether it has had  adverse prior experience with a participant or if the participant  presents a risk due to poor references or investigations by local legal  or regulatory authorities.", "Collateral standards. As applicable, Ex-Im requires assets to secure  the transactions and prefers the asset value to exceed the loan value  in most transactions. For example, working capital loan guarantees  must be secured by raw materials, finished goods, accounts  receivable, or other specified assets. Additionally, each Ex-Im aircraft  transaction is secured not only by the aircraft being financed under  that transaction, but also by any other aircraft Ex-Im is currently  financing for the obligor.", "Risk-sharing conditions. These conditions require lenders and  exporters to share a percentage of the credit risk with Ex-Im. For  example, for working capital loan guarantees, Ex-Im guarantees 90  percent of the principal and interest on a loan issued by a private  lender. In the event of a claim, Ex-Im reimburses the lender for 90  percent of both the outstanding principal balance of the loan and  accrued interest, and the lender is responsible for the remaining 10  percent.", "Ex-Im monitors the performance of all medium-term direct loan, loan  guarantee, and insurance transactions and long-term direct loan and loan  guarantee transactions above $1 million to help contain risk. Ex-Im  conducts ongoing reviews of these transactions to identify and address  any deterioration in credit quality before the obligor defaults. This includes  assessment of the operating environment and financial condition of the  obligor to determine whether or not there have been changes that might  increase or decrease credit risk. Ex-Im updates a transaction\u2019s risk rating  at least annually to reflect any changes in credit risk, which, in turn,  affects the estimated credit subsidy cost and loss reserve or allowance  associated with the transaction. Specific monitoring activities include  evaluating the capacity of obligors to repay their debts, reviewing the  value of pledged collateral, and staying abreast of actions by the obligor  to respond to adverse market changes, and on-site visits at crucial project  milestones (as applicable). Through the monitoring process, Ex-Im  develops a Watch List, which tracks transactions that show signs of  impairment, and an Obligors of Concern List, which tracks transactions  that are impaired. These transactions are subject to more frequent  monitoring than other transactions. In addition, monitoring staff share  these lists with the Office of the Chief Financial Officer and other senior  management to keep them informed of emerging credit issues.", "According to Ex-Im, no lenders failed the 156 examinations conducted from 2008  through 2012.", "Im. Further, in 2012, Congress directed Ex-Im to improve and clarify its  due diligence procedures.expected to have the revised procedures completed by the summer of  2013.", "In response, Ex-Im officials said they  Ex-Im restructures transactions with credit weaknesses to help prevent  defaults and increase recoveries on transactions that do default.  According to Ex-Im, restructuring can involve substantial revision of  transaction terms and conditions. For example, in 2012, Ex-Im  restructured a defaulted project finance transaction into a direct loan with  the implicit backing of a foreign government. Restructuring can also  involve the addition of credit enhancements such as extra collateral or  third-party guarantees. According to Ex-Im, the agency restructures as  many as eight transactions per year. According to Ex-Im officials, the  agency is developing a dedicated restructuring team to help reduce the  workload of staff currently responsible for both monitoring and  restructuring tasks. In addition, they indicated that restructuring staff  inform underwriting staff of trends in credit deteriorations or problems with  particular borrowers to help ensure that any lessons learned are applied  to future transactions.", "Ex-Im pays claims when a loan that it has guaranteed or an insurance  policy that it has issued defaults. Ex-Im tries to minimize losses on  claims paid by pursuing recoveries. For example, Ex-Im takes steps to  collect on the assets of the obligors, which can include the collateral  backing a transaction. For all products combined, Ex-Im\u2019s recovery rate\u2014 the total amount recovered divided by the total amount of claims paid plus  recovery expenses\u2014was about 50 percent on average from 1994 through  2012. In addition, when Ex-Im pays a claim for a loan guarantee that is  denominated in a foreign currency, Ex-Im manages its foreign-currency  risk by purchasing the foreign currency to pay the claim to the lender and  then seeks recovery on the U.S. dollar equivalent, which represents the  obligor\u2019s debt obligation. This policy effectively shifts the foreign-currency  risk from Ex-Im to the obligor after a claim has been paid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ex-Im Has Started Developing a More Comprehensive Risk- Management Framework", "paragraphs": ["In September 2012, the Ex-Im IG issued a report on Ex-Im\u2019s management  of risk at the overall portfolio level. On the basis of industry best  practices, the report made a number of recommendations to improve Ex- Im\u2019s portfolio management in areas such as stress testing, portfolio  concentrations, and risk governance. Our review of federal internal  control standards and industry practices suggests that the IG\u2019s  recommendations in these areas represent prudent risk-management  techniques. Ex-Im has begun to implement some of the IG\u2019s  recommendations and is in the process of analyzing others to determine  their applicability to Ex-Im and the risk-management benefits that could  be gained from them.", "The Ex-Im IG recommended that Ex-Im develop a systematic approach to  stress testing its portfolio that would be conducted at least annually as  part of the process for reestimating credit subsidies. A stress test is a  \u201cwhat-if\u201d scenario that is not a prediction or expected outcome of the  economy. Stress testing is one tool to measure the vulnerability of  portfolios to unexpected losses\u2014that is, losses associated with extreme  yet plausible events. The IG stated that in light of concentrations in Ex- Im\u2019s portfolio, stress testing would provide Ex-Im information on how its  portfolio would react to shocks in financial markets. Ex-Im agreed to  implement this recommendation.", "Stress testing is consistent with our internal control standards and  industry practices. For example, our internal control standards state that  agencies should have adequate mechanisms to identify risks arising from  external factors and analyze the possible effects of these risks.addition, in its best practices manual on credit portfolio management, the   In  International Association of Credit Portfolio Managers (IACPM) states that  institutions should conduct stress testing to inform management about the  portfolio\u2019s vulnerabilities and to establish the portfolio\u2019s sensitivity to risk  factors. Similarly, guidance from regulators of federal financial  institutions notes that the recent financial crisis underscored the need for  banking organizations to incorporate stress testing into their risk- management practices.credit agencies with which we spoke conduct stress testing on their  portfolios. For example, officials from one ECA told us that they conduct  stress tests every 6 months using scenarios related to current world  issues to determine the impact those scenarios would have on obligors.", "Furthermore, the foreign ECAs and U.S. federal  Ex-Im officials stated that they have conducted ad hoc stress tests in the  past, but have been developing a systematic approach. This approach  will involve assessment of (1) how the entire portfolio or portions of the  portfolio would be affected by extreme economic events and (2) the  impact that particular adverse scenarios may have on specific obligors.  Ex-Im officials told us that they will first stress test the aircraft portfolio,  which accounts for about 50 percent of the agency\u2019s exposure. According  to Ex-Im, the stress test results will be included in a quarterly internal  report on the financial status of Ex-Im\u2019s portfolio. Ex-Im officials stated  that the results of the stress testing will be used to inform the loss  modeling process and will be used by senior management in making  decisions about the agency\u2019s resource allocations and strategic planning  efforts. Ex-Im officials also indicated that they intend to share their stress  testing and loss modeling methodologies with other federal credit  agencies so that others may benefit from Ex-Im\u2019s efforts.", "Ex-Im has not yet made plans to report its stress scenarios and stress  test results to Congress. Such reporting could help Congress oversee Ex- Im\u2019s activities by providing additional information on Ex-Im\u2019s risk  exposure. Through provisions in the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization  Act of 2012, Congress has required Ex-Im to provide analysis of the  agency\u2019s default rates and risk of loss associated with its increased  exposure limits. Information on Ex-Im\u2019s stress testing would  complement that analysis by disclosing the magnitude of losses that Ex- Im could face under adverse scenarios. Additionally, reporting such  information would be consistent with our internal control standards, which  indicate that communications with external parties, including Congress,  should provide information that helps them better understand the risks  facing the agency.", "As previously discussed, Ex-Im\u2019s portfolio is concentrated in certain  industries, regions, and obligors. These concentrations expose Ex-Im to  the risk associated with negative events in those market segments. In  light of these concentrations, the Ex-Im IG recommended that Ex-Im  implement \u201csoft portfolio concentration sublimits\u201d\u2014that is, informal  thresholds for the portion of total exposure within different segments of  the portfolio. The IG recommended that Ex-Im set the soft portfolio  sublimits by industry, geography, or transaction risk rating and use them  as internal guidance to inform future pricing and portfolio risk- management decisions (e.g., ways to diversify the portfolio). According to  IG officials, the establishment of soft portfolio sublimits (as opposed to  hard limits) would help Ex-Im manage portfolio concentrations without  restricting its ability to meet exporters\u2019 demand for financing or adversely  affecting Ex-Im\u2019s competitiveness with other ECAs.", "Portfolio sublimits represent one technique for managing a \u201crisk  appetite\u201d\u2014that is, the amount of risk an institution is willing to accept.  Setting a risk appetite is consistent with our internal control standards,  which state that agencies should develop an approach for risk  management based on how much risk can be prudently accepted.  Additionally, industry best practices identified by the Committee of  Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), the  Institute of International Finance (IIF), and IACPM cite the establishment  of risk appetite, including through portfolio sublimits, as a sound risk- management practice.including the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and two  foreign ECAs, set a risk appetite by establishing limits on the volume of  financing they provide to different industries, countries, or obligors.  Setting a risk appetite can help senior management determine the point  at which the institution\u2019s exposure has reached a level that may require  implementation of additional risk controls.", "Some organizations with which we spoke,  As of December 2012, Ex-Im had not established soft portfolio sublimits.  However, Ex-Im officials said that they were evaluating whether this  practice was suitable for the agency in light of potential implications for  Ex-Im\u2019s ability to meet client demands and competitiveness with other  ECAs. Given the potential benefits of this risk-management practice,  following through on this evaluation will be important for Ex-Im.  Furthermore, if it determines that soft portfolio sublimits are appropriate,  following industry guidance for setting a risk appetite will also be  important. For example, guidance issued by COSO in January 2012  states that in developing a risk appetite an institution should consider its  existing risk profile (current level and distribution of risks); risk capacity  (the amount of risk that an organization is able to support); risk tolerance  (the acceptable level of variation an organization is willing to accept); and  stakeholders\u2019 attitudes towards growth, risk, and return.", "In its September 2012 report, the Ex-Im IG also stated that Ex-Im\u2019s risk  governance structure was not commensurate with the size, scope, and  strategic ambitions of the institution. Among other things, the IG noted that Ex-Im lacked an official responsible for managing the full spectrum of  risks facing the agency and developing risk-management strategies. The  IG recommended that Ex-Im create the position of chief risk officer (CRO)  to oversee the design and implementation of an enterprisewide risk- management function.", "Industry best practices and corporate governance principles of the Basel  Committee on Banking Supervision highlight the importance of having  focal points for all the activities required to manage enterprisewide risks.  For example, best practices published by IIF state that financial firms  should assign responsibility for risk management to an officer at a senior  level, in most cases a CRO. The Global Association of Risk Professionals  has indicated that the typical roles of a CRO include establishing risk- management policies and procedures consistent with entitywide policies,  reviewing and approving models used for pricing and risk measurement,  measuring risk on a global basis as well as monitoring exposures and  changes in risks, and communicating risk-management results to senior  management. OPIC and some foreign ECAs with which we spoke have  CROs and cited benefits of this function, including risk assessment that is  independent from other business functions. For example, OPIC officials  said that OPIC\u2019s CRO function is carried out by a small unit led by a  Director of Risk Management that reports directly to the agency\u2019s Chief  Financial Officer.", "Ex-Im does not have a centralized CRO function and instead distributes  responsibilities for risk management to several parts of the organization,  including the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Office of General  Counsel, Credit Management Group, and Credit Policy Committee. For  example, the Office of the Chief Financial Officer\u2019s responsibilities include  loss modeling, determining credit subsidy estimates, and portfolio  monitoring. The Office of General Counsel\u2019s responsibilities include  conducting due diligence on transaction participants to manage  reputational risk and assisting in documenting transactions. The Credit  Management Group takes the lead in reviewing and recommending broad  credit policy and underwriting standards. Finally, the Credit Policy  Committee is responsible for formulating, coordinating, and making  recommendations to Ex-Im\u2019s Board of Directors in the areas of country  risk, sovereign and private-sector risk, changing or modifying CLS, and  addressing other risk issues.", "As of February 2013, Ex-Im officials told us that they were analyzing the  possibility of establishing a more centralized CRO function. The officials  said that in performing this analysis, they were reviewing other  organizations that have a CRO, including OPIC, the World Bank, the  International Finance Corporation, and the African Development Bank.  Careful consideration of the potential benefits of a CRO function and the  extent to which the agency\u2019s current structure comprehensively  addresses enterprisewide risks is critical given Ex-Im\u2019s growing financial  exposure. Further, taking into account the potential expansion of its risk- management activities, such as the implementation of soft sublimits and  regular stress testing, will be important for Ex-Im\u2019s analysis.", "In addition to the three recommendations discussed previously, the IG  recommended that Ex-Im: (1) develop a systematic approach for  modeling portfolio risk, including identifying appropriate qualitative risk  factors; (2) with the assistance of external experts, implement a formal  framework for the use of financial models, including procedures for model  validation; (3) review risk metrics and reporting procedures to enhance  transparency and to better inform key stakeholders; and (4) amend its by- laws to provide for oversight of an agencywide risk-management function  by Ex-Im\u2019s Board of Directors. Ex-Im has taken actions to address the  first three of these recommendations. As already noted, Ex-Im  incorporated qualitative risk factors into its loss estimation model. In  addition, Ex-Im hired a contractor to serve as an external expert in  reviewing and analyzing Ex-Im\u2019s loss estimation model and plans to  conduct external validation of future financial models. Ex-Im also began  issuing a quarterly default report and is identifying portfolio management  best practices\u2014including risk metrics and reporting procedures\u2014through  a review conducted by subject-matter experts. Ex-Im disagreed with the  fourth recommendation. Ex-Im stated that the agency\u2019s charter does not  provide this oversight function to the Board of Directors, but rather  provides the President of Ex-Im broad operational authority for the  management of Ex-Im, including oversight of all of Ex-Im\u2019s risk- management functions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ex-Im Has Not Yet Determined the Volume It Can Prudently Manage", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im\u2019s annual authorizations increased from about $12 billion in 2006 to  nearly $36 billion in 2012, an increase of about 195 percent. Over the  same period, Ex-Im\u2019s staff level, as measured by full-time equivalents  (FTE), increased from 380 to 390 FTEs, about 3 percent (see fig. 9).", "The rapid increase in business volume, coupled with a modest growth in  FTEs, creates potential operational risks for Ex-Im. If demand for Ex-Im\u2019s  services exceeded its capacity, the agency\u2019s ability to properly underwrite  and monitor transactions might suffer. Agencywide, the average dollar  amount of annual authorizations per FTE rose from $32 million in 2006 to  about $92 million in 2012, an increase of more than 150 percent. Over the  same period, the number of transactions per FTE rose from 7.0 to 9.7, an  increase of 38 percent. Ex-Im acknowledged that its current resources  would not be sufficient for the high levels of activity it expected to see in  the coming years. In addition, Ex-Im division managers with whom we  spoke noted the strain of the increased and increasing workloads on  employees and said they could use additional staff. Ex-Im officials stated  that risks to the agency have been increasing as a result. While the  officials told us that the increased business volume primarily had affected  the underwriting function, the impact had been mitigated somewhat by the  agency\u2019s delegation of some underwriting to private lenders for working  capital loan guarantees. However, the officials said that Ex-Im\u2019s other  transaction-related functions, including legal and monitoring activities,  were expected to have significantly higher workloads as transactions  complete the underwriting phase and move on to other phases.", "Ex-Im has taken some steps to manage its increased workload. Ex-Im  asked for additional administrative resources in its annual budget  requests, in part to hire more staff. For example, in its 2013 budget  request, Ex-Im requested a $7 million increase in administrative  resources to support underwriting and small business outreach. While  acknowledging the constrained federal budget environment, Ex-Im  officials said that future budget requests likely also would request  resources for additional staff. In the interim, Ex-Im officials said that when  vacancies occurred, they allocated the positions to areas of highest need  rather than automatically refilling the vacancies. Ex-Im also hired a  consultant to identify best practices for improving operational efficiency of  the monitoring function. In addition, Ex-Im officials said they planned to  update the agency\u2019s 2009-2012 Human Capital Plan following a  forthcoming revision to Ex-Im\u2019s strategic plan. Ex-Im\u2019s workforce planning  process involves assessing its current workforce, anticipating future  needs, analyzing gaps, and developing strategies to address those gaps.", "Although Ex-Im has acknowledged growing risks associated with its  increasing workload, it has not formally determined the level of business it  can prudently manage\u2014either agencywide or within specific functional  areas\u2014with a given level of resources. For example, while Ex-Im has  reported the average number and dollar amount of authorizations per  FTE, officials stated that they have not determined the level at which  operational risks are too high. Additionally, Ex-Im officials within different  functional areas were unable to provide formal, documented assessments  of resource needs. As previously noted, our internal control standards  state that agencies should develop an approach for risk management  based on how much risk can be prudently accepted. In addition, these  standards indicate that agencies should decide upon specific control  activities to manage or mitigate risks entitywide and at each activity level.  Ex-Im officials said the dramatic increase in business was not anticipated  and that the agency historically did not need to make major workforce  adjustments because its business volume was stable. However, without  benchmarks to determine when workload levels have created too much  risk, Ex-Im\u2019s ability to monitor and manage operational risks associated  with its already increased business volume may be limited. Monitoring  workloads against such benchmarks would help Ex-Im determine when  additional steps\u2014such as tightening underwriting standards or increasing  requirements for lender participation\u2014may be needed to mitigate Ex-Im\u2019s  increased risk. Moreover, legislated increases in Ex-Im\u2019s exposure limits  provide room for additional increases in Ex-Im\u2019s business volume, and  thus Ex-Im could continue to experience strains on its workforce."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, Ex-Im has assumed an increased role in supporting the  export of U.S. goods and services. In part, this increase resulted from a  decline in the availability of private-sector credit that accompanied the  2007-2009 financial crisis. For several years, Ex-Im has been self- sustaining for budgetary purposes, although the long-term cost of Ex-Im\u2019s  new business is not yet known. In addition, Ex-Im has made recent  improvements to its risk management, including enhancements to its loss  estimation model and plans for a more systematic approach for stress  testing its portfolio. However, the growth in Ex-Im\u2019s portfolio and the  spectrum of risks Ex-Im faces underscore the need for continued  improvements in risk management. Recommendations made by the Ex- Im IG in September 2012 and further supported by our work point to  additional steps that Ex-Im could take to strengthen its risk-management  framework. These steps include establishing soft portfolio sublimits and  assessing the benefits of a more centralized CRO function. Following  through on these recommendations will be critical to help manage the  risks and challenges associated with the agency\u2019s greater financial  exposure.", "In addition, our work identified other opportunities for Ex-Im to improve  how it monitors, manages, and reports on the risks it faces. First, while  Ex-Im added qualitative factors to its loss model in 2012, the factor that  adjusts loss estimates for potential changes in global economic conditions  uses a 1-year forecast for speculative-grade corporate bond defaults for  all its transactions, regardless of their length. Because many of Ex-Im\u2019s  transactions span multiple years, a 1-year default forecast may not  represent the best available data for making default adjustments for these  transactions. The use of default forecasts or other economic data with a  longer time horizon may produce more reliable loss estimates and would  be consistent with FASAB guidance on using the best available data for  developing cash flow projections. Second, Ex-Im has not maintained the  data necessary to conduct vintage analysis, a technique federal banking  regulators have cited as useful for monitoring growing portfolios. Once a  sufficient amount of data has been retained, such an analysis could help  Ex-Im to assess the early performance of new books of business by  providing comparisons to seasoned books at a comparable point in time.  It could also provide Ex-Im an additional early warning indicator to assist  Ex-Im in taking timely actions to mitigate emerging risks. Such data also  have the potential to strengthen Ex-Im\u2019s future loss modeling efforts by  providing additional information about when defaults occur over the life of  a transaction. Third, Ex-Im has made progress toward implementing a  systematic approach to stress testing its portfolio, but has not yet made  plans to report the scenarios and results to Congress. Providing this  information to Congress\u2014potentially as part of Ex-Im\u2019s annual report\u2014 would be consistent with federal internal control standards for effective  external communication and would aid congressional oversight of the  agency. Finally, although Ex-Im has recognized and taken some steps to  address workload challenges, it has not developed benchmarks for the  level of business it can properly support with a given level of resources.  This is contrary to federal internal control standards, which indicate that  agencies should develop a risk-management approach based on how  much risk can be prudently accepted. Ex-Im\u2019s workload challenges may  continue to grow because of increases in Ex-Im\u2019s exposure and exposure  limit, coupled with resource constraints in the current budgetary  environment.

We examined Ex-Im\u2019s total exposure levels for each year from 1990  through 2012 to identify growth trends both in nominal and inflation- adjusted terms. We also examined Ex-Im\u2019s annual authorizations for each  year from 2006 through 2012. We chose that period in order to cover Ex- Im\u2019s pre- and post-financial crisis business activity. We analyzed trends in  the dollar volume of Ex-Im\u2019s total authorizations each year, the volume of  total U.S. exports, as well as Ex-Im authorization levels disaggregated by  product type, region, and industry sector. To identify possible reasons for  trends in Ex-Im\u2019s business activity, we reviewed a variety of Ex-Im  documents, including annual reports, competitiveness reports, the  agency\u2019s strategic plan for 2010-2015, and reports issued by Ex-Im\u2019s  Office of Inspector General (IG). We also reviewed relevant reports by the  Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, academics, and foreign export  credit agencies (ECA). Because Ex-Im can play a countercyclical role in  export finance (i.e., expanding when private sector credit is retrenching),  we also analyzed data related to the availability and cost of credit from  2006 through 2012. In particular, we analyzed (1) calendar 2006-2012  survey data from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  and the European Central Bank on the percentage of commercial lenders  that were tightening or easing lending standards and (2) calendar 2006- 2012 data on corporate bond risk premiums from Bank of America-Merrill  Lynch. We also analyzed International Monetary Fund data on the volume  of U.S. exports over fiscal years 1990 through 2012 in order to compare  changes in export volume with changes in Ex-Im authorizations.  Additionally, we interviewed Ex-Im officials and six representatives of  industry trade associations and research organizations about reasons for  changes in the agency\u2019s business volume. We selected the trade  association and research organization representatives to interview on the  basis of a literature review of relevant published articles, prior GAO work  on Ex-Im and international trade issues, and recommendations from  knowledgeable federal agency and industry officials about individuals with  expertise on Ex-Im\u2019s activities or export financing generally. Our literature  review focused on publications that cited Ex-Im, export credit agencies,  trade finance, and export finance. Three of the entities we interviewed  represented industry trade associations (the Coalition for Employment  through Exports, the Berne Union, and the Bankers\u2019 Association for  Finance and Trade and International Financial Services Association) and  three represented research groups (Peterson Institute for International  Economics, the Rhodium Group, and the Research Division of the U.S.  International Trade Commission). Further, to obtain perspectives on ECA  growth generally, we conducted telephone interviews with officials from  four foreign ECAs: Export Development Canada (Canada), Compagnie  Fran\u00e7aise d\u2019Assurance pour le Commerce Ext\u00e9rieur (France), UK Export  Finance (United Kingdom), and Japanese Bank for International  Cooperation (Japan). We selected theses ECAs based on their similarity  to Ex-Im in terms of: (1) their role in supplementing rather than competing  with private markets for export credit support, (2) the types of export  credit products they offer, and (3) the presence of a small business  directive or mandate.", "To examine how Ex-Im determines subsidy costs, loss reserves and  allowances, and product fees, and how these processes account for  different risks, we reviewed relevant requirements and guidance. This  included the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990; the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-11 (Preparation,  Submission, and Execution of the Budget); the Statement of Federal  Financial Accounting Standards No. 2 (Accounting for Direct Loans and  Loan Guarantees); the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board\u2019s  Federal Financial Accounting and Auditing Technical Release 6  (Preparing Estimates for Direct Loan and Loan Guarantee Subsidies  under the Federal Credit Reform Act); and the Organisation for Economic  Cooperation and Development Arrangement on Officially Supported  Export Credits (OECD Arrangement). We identified types of risks  applicable to Ex-Im by reviewing Ex-Im\u2019s documents, including annual  reports and policy manuals, as well as prior GAO work on credit programs  and risk management. To examine how Ex-Im accounts for these risks,  we reviewed information on the tools and processes Ex-Im uses to  determine subsidy costs and loss reserves and allowances, including Ex- Im\u2019s loss estimation model. We reviewed documentation on the structure  of the model, updates made to the model in 2012, and findings and  recommendations made by the Ex-Im IG and Ex-Im\u2019s independent  financial statement auditor about the model. We also reviewed relevant  workpapers from the independent auditor\u2019s audit of Ex-Im\u2019s 2012 financial  statements. We also reviewed Congressional Budget Office and OMB  reports on discounting methodologies for federal credit programs. To  obtain additional information about Ex-Im\u2019s subsidy cost and loss reserve  and allowance calculations, we interviewed Ex-Im and Ex-Im IG officials,  representatives from Ex-Im\u2019s independent financial statement auditor, and  OMB officials responsible for approving Ex-Im\u2019s subsidy cost estimation  methodology. In addition, we spoke with other federal agencies that  provide international credit\u2014including the Small Business Administration,  the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Foreign Agricultural Service and Farm  Service Agency, and the Overseas Private Investment Cooperation  (OPIC)\u2014and the four foreign ECAs cited previously about their processes  for estimating program costs and reserving for future losses. To obtain  information about how Ex-Im sets product fees and what risks they  account for, we reviewed fee-setting requirements contained in the OECD  Arrangement and Ex-Im analyses used as a basis to adjust fees for  different products. An assessment of the appropriateness of the fee levels  resulting from the OECD Arrangement was outside the scope of our  review. We interviewed Ex-Im officials and officials from the U.S.  Department of the Treasury responsible for negotiating for the United  States at OECD, including negotiations on minimum premiums. We also  discussed with the four foreign ECAs how they set product fees.", "To assess how Ex-Im\u2019s financial portfolio has performed and the  budgetary impact of its programs, we reviewed agency data and  documentation\u2014including Ex-Im performance data, annual reports,  financial statements, and quarterly default reports\u2014and information  contained in the President\u2019s budgets and Federal Credit Supplements.  Specifically, to determine how Ex-Im\u2019s portfolio has performed, we  analyzed data Ex-Im compiled from the Ex-Im Bank Reporting System on  active transactions\u2014including authorized and disbursed amounts,  amounts in arrears, claims paid, and recoveries\u2014to calculate overall  default rates and default rates by product type. We examined end-of- fiscal-year data for 2006 through 2012 and data as of December 31,  2012. We reviewed federal banking regulator guidance on default  monitoring, including vintage analysis, and determined whether Ex-Im  conducted or maintained data to perform such an analysis. In addition, we  reviewed data on the ratio of Ex-Im\u2019s impaired assets to total exposure  from 2008 through 20012. To determine the budgetary impact of Ex-Im\u2019s  programs, we reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s analysis of the funds it has been  appropriated and the funds it has sent to the U.S. Treasury (the net of  upward and downward credit subsidy reestimates, cancelled authority,  returned collections, and rescissions) from 1992 through 2012. To do this,  we compared Ex-Im\u2019s analysis to data contained in appropriation acts, the  President\u2019s budgets, and Ex-Im\u2019s financial statements for the same years.", "Based on this comparison, we determined that Ex-Im\u2019s analysis was  reasonable. Additionally, we analyzed Ex-Im\u2019s annual credit subsidy  reestimates for 1992 through 2012 using information in the President\u2019s  budgets. We discussed the performance and budget data with  knowledgeable Ex-Im officials to ensure that we interpreted the data  correctly.", "To assess the extent to which Ex-Im has a comprehensive risk- management framework, we reviewed the practices Ex-Im uses to  manage risks at the transaction, portfolio, and agency level. At the  transaction level, we reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s policies and procedures related to  the underwriting, monitoring and restructuring, and claims and recovery  functions. We also interviewed Ex-Im senior management and division  managers responsible for various products about these procedures. To  assess how Ex-Im manages risks at the portfolio level, we reviewed a  September 2012 report by the Ex-Im IG on Ex-Im\u2019s portfolio risk  management and followed up with Ex-Im officials to determine the actions  they had taken in response to the report\u2019s recommendations. We also  identified relevant criteria in GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government and Internal Control Management and Evaluation  Tool and documents from financial industry groups describing sound   Additionally, we discussed  practices for managing financial portfolios.portfolio and general risk-management practices with officials from the  federal credit agencies and foreign ECAs cited previously, a  representative from the International Association of Credit Portfolio  Management, and Ex-Im officials. Finally, we reviewed information related  to potential operational risks stemming from Ex-Im\u2019s increasing business  volume and workload and identified relevant criteria from our internal  control standards. We limited our work in this area to Ex-Im\u2019s human  capital management. Specifically, we analyzed Ex-Im data on the number  of full-time equivalents and the number and dollar volume of transactions  authorized from 2006 through 2012. We also reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s Human  Capital Plan for 2009-2012, Reauthorization Act of 2012 Business Plan,  and congressional budget justifications from 2008 through 2013, and  internal Ex-Im analyses of agency workloads. Additionally, we interviewed  Ex-Im officials responsible for resource management.", "To assess the reliability of the data provided by Ex-Im, including exposure  and authorization amounts and performance statistics, we (1) reviewed  information related to data elements, system operations, and controls; (2)  performed electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness; (3) compared data to published documents; and (4)  interviewed Ex-Im officials knowledgeable about the data. To assess the  reliability of data we used to describe capital market conditions and U.S.  exports, we (1) reviewed related documentation, (2) interviewed  knowledgeable officials about the data, and (3) performed electronic  testing and inspected the data for missing observations and outliers. We  concluded that the data elements we used were sufficiently reliable for  purposes of describing Ex-Im\u2019s growth and financial performance.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2012 to March 2013 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Export- Import Bank", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Steve Westley, Assistant  Director; Daniel Alspaugh; Kathryn Bolduc; Marcia Carlsen; Pamela  Davidson; Cole Haase; Michael Hoffman; Christine Houle; Susan Irving;  Risto Laboski; Felicia Lopez; Colleen Moffatt Kimer; Melissa Kornblau;  Robert Pollard; Barbara Roesmann; Jessica Sandler; Eva Su; and Celia  Thomas made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
