In 2010, it  called for agencies\u2019 major investments to deliver functionality every 12  months and, since 2012, every 6 months. However, we recently reported  that less than half of selected investments at five major agencies planned  to deliver capabilities in 12-month cycles. Accordingly, we  recommended that OMB develop and issue clearer guidance on  incremental development and that selected agencies update and  implement their associated policies. Most agencies agreed with our  recommendations or had no comment.", "In January 2010, the Federal CIO began leading TechStat sessions\u2014 face-to-face meetings to terminate or turn around IT investments that are  failing or are not producing results. These meetings involve OMB and  agency leadership and are intended to increase accountability and  improve performance. OMB reported that federal agencies achieved over  $3 billion in cost savings or avoidances as a result of these sessions in  2010. Subsequently, OMB empowered agency CIOs to hold their own  TechStat sessions within their respective agencies.", "We have since reported that OMB and selected agencies held multiple  TechStats, but additional OMB oversight was needed to ensure that these  meetings were having the appropriate impact on underperforming  projects and that resulting cost savings were valid. We concluded that  until OMB and agencies develop plans to address these investments, the  investments would likely remain at risk. Among other things, we  recommended that OMB require agencies to address high-risk  investments. OMB generally agreed with this recommendation.", "However, as of October 28, 2015, OMB has only conducted one TechStat  review in the last 2 years. In particular, between March 2013 and October  2015, OMB held one TechStat on the Department of State\u2019s legacy  consular systems investment in July 2015. Moreover, OMB has not listed  any savings from TechStats in any of its required quarterly reporting to  Congress since June 2012.", "To help the government achieve transparency while managing legacy  investments, in June 2009, OMB established a public website (referred to  as the IT Dashboard) that provides detailed information on major IT  investments at 27 federal agencies, including ratings of their performance  against cost and schedule targets. Among other things, agencies are to  submit ratings from their CIOs, which, according to OMB\u2019s instructions,  should reflect the level of risk facing an investment relative to that  investment\u2019s ability to accomplish its goals.", "As of August 2015, according to the IT Dashboard, 163 of the federal  government\u2019s 738 major IT investments\u2014totaling $9.8 billion\u2014were in  need of management attention (rated \u201cyellow\u201d to indicate the need for  attention or \u201cred\u201d to indicate significant concerns).

Most agencies agreed with  our recommendations or had no comment.", "In addition to spending money on new IT development, agencies also  plan to spend a significant amount of their fiscal year 2016 IT budgets on  the operations and maintenance (O&M) of legacy (i.e., steady-state)  systems. From fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2016, this amount has  increased, while the amount invested in developing new systems has  decreased by about $7.1 billion. (See figure 2.) This raises concerns  about agencies\u2019 ability to replace systems that are no longer cost- effective or that fail to meet user needs.", "Of the more than $79 billion budgeted for federal IT in fiscal year 2016,  26 federal agencies plan to spend about $60 billion, more than three- quarters of the total budgeted, on the O&M of legacy investments. Figure  3 provides a visual summary of the relative cost of major and nonmajor  investments, both in development and O&M.", "Given the size and magnitude of these investments, it is important that  agencies effectively manage the O&M of existing investments to ensure  that they (1) continue to meet agency needs, (2) deliver value, and (3) do  not unnecessarily duplicate or overlap with other investments. To  accomplish this, agencies are required by OMB to perform annual  operational analyses of these investments, which are intended to serve  as periodic examination of an investment\u2019s performance against, among  other things, established cost, schedule, and performance goals.", "However, we have reported that agencies were not consistently  performing such analyses and that billions of dollars in O&M investments  had not undergone needed analyses. Specifically, as detailed in our  November 2013 report, only 1 of the government\u2019s 10 largest O&M  investments underwent an OMB-required operational analysis. We  recommended that operational analyses be completed on the remaining 9  investments. Most agencies generally agreed with our recommendations.", "To improve the efficiency, performance, and environmental footprint of  federal data center activities, OMB established the federal data center  consolidation initiative in February 2010. In a series of reports, we found  that, while data center consolidation could potentially save the federal  government billions of dollars, weaknesses existed in the execution and  oversight of the initiative.", "Most recently, we reported that, as of May 2014, agencies collectively  reported that they had a total of 9,658 data centers; as of May 2015,  they had closed 1,684 data centers and were planning to close an  additional 2,431\u2014for a total of 4,115\u2014by the end of September 2015.  We also noted that between fiscal years 2011 and 2017, agencies  reported planning a total of about $5.3 billion in cost savings and  avoidances due to the consolidation of federal data centers. In  correspondence subsequent to the publication of our report, DOD\u2019s Office  of the CIO identified an additional $2.1 billion in savings to be realized  beyond fiscal year 2017, which increased the total savings across the  federal government to about $7.4 billion. Further, since our May 2014  report we received additional information from other agencies about their  actual 2014 cost savings and revised plans for future savings. This  information is shown in table 1, which provides a summary of agencies\u2019  total data center cost savings and cost avoidances between fiscal years  2011 and 2017, as well as DOD cost savings and cost avoidances to be  realized beyond 2017.", "However, in our September 2014 report, we noted that planned savings  may be understated because of difficulties agencies encountered when  calculating savings and communicating their estimates to OMB. We made  recommendations to ensure the initiative improves efficiency and  achieves cost savings. Most agencies agreed with our recommendations  or did not comment.", "To better manage existing IT systems, OMB launched the PortfolioStat  initiative, which requires agencies to conduct an annual, agency-wide IT  portfolio review to, among other things, reduce commodity IT spending  and demonstrate how their IT investments align with the agency\u2019s mission  and business functions. In November 2013, we reported that agencies  continued to identify duplicative spending as part of PortfolioStat and that  this initiative had the potential to save at least $5.8 billion through fiscal  year 2015; however, weaknesses existed in agencies\u2019 implementation of  the initiative, such as limitations in the CIOs\u2019 authority. We made more  than 60 recommendations to improve OMB\u2019s and agencies\u2019  implementation of PortfolioStat. OMB partially agreed with our  recommendations, and responses from 21 of the agencies varied, with  some agreeing and others not.", "In April 2015, we reported that agencies decreased their planned  PortfolioStat savings to approximately $2 billion\u2014a 68 percent reduction  from the amount they reported to us in 2013. Additionally, although  agencies also reported having achieved approximately $1.1 billion in  savings, inconsistencies in OMB\u2019s and agencies\u2019 reporting made it difficult  to reliably measure progress in achieving savings. Among other things,  we made recommendations to OMB aimed at improving the reporting of  achieved savings, with which it agreed.", "We have also recently reported on two additional key areas of agency\u2019s  IT spending portfolio: software licensing and mobile devices.", "Regarding software licensing, we recently reported that better  management was needed to achieve significant savings government- wide. In particular, 22 of the 24 major agencies we reviewed did not  have comprehensive license policies, and only 2 had comprehensive  license inventories. We recommended that OMB issue needed  guidance to agencies and made more than 130 recommendations to  the agencies to improve their policies and practices for managing  software licenses. OMB disagreed with the need for guidance.  However, we believe that without such guidance, agencies will likely  continue to lack the visibility into what needs to be managed. Most  agencies generally agreed with the recommendations or had no  comments.", "We have also reported that most of the 15 agencies in our mobile  devices review did not have an inventory of mobile devices and  associated services, and only 1 of the 15 agencies we reviewed had  documented procedures for monitoring spending. Accordingly, we  recommended that the agencies take actions to improve their  inventories and control processes and that OMB measure and report  progress in achieving cost savings. OMB and 14 of the agencies  generally agreed with the recommendations or had no comment. The  Department of Defense partially agreed, and we maintained that  actions were needed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Actions Needed to Address High-Risk Area", "paragraphs": ["In our February 2015 high-risk report, we identified actions that OMB and  the agencies need to take to make progress in this area. These include  implementing the recently enacted statutory requirements promoting IT  acquisition reform, as well as implementing our previous  recommendations, such as updating the public version of the IT  Dashboard throughout the year. As noted in that report, we have made  multiple recommendations to improve agencies\u2019 management of their IT  acquisitions, many of which have been discussed in this statement. In the  last 6 years we made approximately 800 recommendations to multiple  agencies. As of October 2015, about 32 percent of these  recommendations had been implemented.", "Also in our high-risk report, we stated that OMB and agencies will need to  demonstrate measurable government-wide progress in the following key  areas:  implement at least 80 percent of GAO\u2019s recommendations related to  the management of IT acquisitions and operations within 4 years. ensure that a minimum of 80 percent of the government\u2019s major  acquisitions deliver functionality every 12 months. achieve no less than 80 percent of the planned PortfolioStat savings  and 80 percent of the planned savings planned for data center  consolidation.", "In conclusion, with the recent passage of IT reform legislation, the federal  government has an opportunity to improve the transparency and  management of IT acquisition and operations, and strengthen the  authority of CIOs to provide needed direction and oversight. Further, by  identifying the management of IT acquisitions and operations as a new  government-wide high-risk area we are bringing necessary attention to  several critical IT initiatives in need of additional congressional oversight.
