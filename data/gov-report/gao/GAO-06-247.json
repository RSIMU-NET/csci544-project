Officials from the ninth state reported no actions were taken because the state had such a registration list in place prior to HAVA. State election officials reported they took steps to verify information provided on voter registration applications and maintain their voter lists as required by HAVA. States either completed or were in the process of completing the required matches of voter registration information with state motor vehicle agency (MVA) or Social Security Administration (SSA) records. Officials from all nine states reported conducting the list maintenance activities required by HAVA: eliminating duplicate registrations and coordinating the voter list with state agency records on felons and the deceased to identify and remove the names of ineligible registrants. According to officials from four states, implementing HAVA improved the accuracy of the voter lists, for example, by correcting errors in voter information before they were entered into the statewide list. Officials from the other five states reported little to no improvements to the accuracy of their lists in part, some said, because they had established systems similar to those required by HAVA prior to the enactment of the law. State election officials reported they faced challenges and learned lessons while implementing the HAVA requirements. For example, officials from seven states reported their experiences taught them that collaborating with local officials to develop the computerized statewide systems later helped them successfully implement the systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Confidence in the electoral process to produce free and fair elections is of  the utmost importance to a legitimate democratic political system.

The Help America Vote Act of 2002  (HAVA) was enacted, in part, to help ensure that only eligible persons are  registered to vote. This law provides that, among other things, as of  January 1, 2004, states are to create computerized statewide voter  registration lists that serve as official rosters of legally registered voters  for elections for federal office. Under this provision, most states are also  to verify the accuracy of information provided on voter registration  applications by matching it with information contained in the state motor  vehicle agency\u2019s (MVA) database or the Social Security Administration\u2019s  (SSA) records, as appropriate. In addition, states are to perform list  maintenance on statewide voter lists by coordinating them on a regular  basis with state records on felony status and deaths, in order to identify  and remove names of ineligible voters.", "Under HAVA, states could apply to the Election Assistance Commission  (EAC) by January 1, 2004, for a waiver, postponing the effective  implementation date of the statewide voter registration list requirement  for 2 years until January 1, 2006. All but nine states exercised the waiver  option. The nine states that were to implement the HAVA requirements  described above, by the original 2004 deadline were Alaska, Arizona,  Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, Minnesota, South Carolina, South Dakota, and  West Virginia. This report discusses the experiences of these nine states as  they implemented these HAVA requirements, in particular, the actions that  state election officials reported taking to (1) establish computerized  statewide voter registration lists and (2) verify the accuracy of information  on voter registration applications and maintain accurate computerized  voter lists. In addition, we report what states told us regarding (3) the  challenges they faced and lessons they learned while implementing these  requirements.", "In addition to this report, we have issued or plan to issue reports this year  on other specific election issues. These reports, as did our earlier work  issued in 2001, in general focus on the people, processes, and technology  associated with the preparation for and administration of elections.  Specifically, in June 2005, we issued a report on the efforts of selected  state and local election officials in seven states to ensure that voter  registration lists are accurate. In September 2005, we issued two reports,  one on the efforts of selected local election officials in these same seven  states on managing voter registration and ensuring eligible citizens can  vote and the other on significant security and reliability concerns that  have been identified for electronic voting systems. Later this year, we plan  to issue a report on the Department of Defense\u2019s implementation of the  Federal Voting Assistance Program to facilitate absentee voting by military  personnel during the November 2004 election. These reports respond to  congressional requests made prior to the November 2004 election. In  addition, we are undertaking a broader, more comprehensive review of  election administration processes related to the November 2004 general  election. This comprehensive study, which we plan to issue in 2006, will  address activities and challenges\u2014people, processes, and technology\u2014 associated with each major stage of election administration to include  registration, absentee and early voting, election day preparation and  activities, and vote counting and certification.", "To meet our objectives for this report, we conducted structured telephone  interviews with state election officials in each of the nine states. We also  interviewed officials with and obtained documents from the EAC and the  Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Rights Division, which is responsible for  enforcing parts of HAVA. In addition, we reviewed relevant state and  federal laws.", "We did not independently verify the responses to questions posed to state  officials during our telephone interviews. However, state election officials  were provided the opportunity to verify the accuracy of their responses for  this report. We also provided relevant sections of the report to EAC and  DOJ officials to verify the accuracy of the information they provided.  Appendix I provides a more detailed description of our scope and  methodology.", "We conducted our work from January 2005 through December 2005 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As election officials manage voter registration processes and voter lists,  they must balance two competing goals. On the one hand, officials seek to  minimize the burden on eligible people registering to vote. On the other  hand, they also seek to ensure that the voter lists are accurate, a task that  involves including the name of each eligible voter on the voter list,  removing names of ineligible voters, and having safeguards in place so that  names of voters are not removed in error from the list.", "Congress has passed legislation relating to the administration of both  federal and state elections, pursuant to its various constitutional powers,  including processes related to maintaining voter lists. The constitutional  framework for elections contemplates both state and federal roles. States  are responsible for the administration of both their own elections and  federal elections. States regulate various aspects of the election process,  including, for example, ballot access, registration procedures, absentee  voting requirements, establishment of polling places, provision of election  day workers, and counting and certifying the vote. The states in turn incur  the costs associated with these activities. Although the states are  responsible for running elections, Congress has authority to affect the  administration of elections. Congress\u2019 authority to regulate elections  depends upon the type of election. With regard to federal elections,  Congress has constitutional authority over both congressional and  presidential elections. In addition, with respect to federal, state, and local  elections, a number of constitutional amendments authorize Congress to  enforce prohibitions against specific discriminatory acts.", "Most recently, HAVA was enacted in 2002, and among other things,  mandated that each state establish a computerized statewide voter  registration list to serve as the official voter registration list for conducting  elections for federal office in each state. The voter registration list is to  serve as a secure, centralized, and interactive database that is coordinated  with other state agency databases and grants state and local election  officials immediate electronic access to enter and update voter  information. States and territories were to implement a computerized  statewide voter registration database by January 1, 2004. States could  apply to EAC by January 1, 2004, for a waiver of the effective date until  January 1, 2006. Nine states and one territory\u2014Alaska, Arizona, Georgia,  Hawaii, Kentucky, Minnesota, South Carolina, South Dakota, West  Virginia, and Guam\u2014did not apply for a waiver.", "States subject to HAVA must also take steps to ensure that the statewide  voter registration lists are accurate. Under HAVA, states are to perform list  maintenance on a regular basis by removing ineligible voters from the  statewide voter list. States are to coordinate the computerized list with  their state agencies\u2019 records on felony status and death to verify voters\u2019  eligibility. For example, states must cross-reference the voter registration  list with their state\u2019s records on felons to remove the names of ineligible  voters and records on death to remove deceased registrants. States are  also required to remove duplicate registrants, that is, names of voters that  appear more than once on the statewide voter list. HAVA, in general,  leaves it to the states\u2019 discretion to determine the type and frequency of  actions to implement this list maintenance requirement.", "In addition to undertaking list maintenance, states are required under  HAVA to verify voter registration application information. For federal  elections, a voter registration application may not be processed or  accepted by a state unless it contains the applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license  number or the last four digits of the Social Security number. If the voter  has neither of these numbers, the state must assign the voter a voter  identification number. Voter registration information is to be matched  with motor vehicle agency (MVA) records or Social Security  Administration (SSA) records, depending on the information provided by  the applicant. Certain state laws require applicants to provide their full  Social Security number on voter registration applications. HAVA provides  that for those states requiring full Social Security numbers on such  applications, in accordance with Section 7 of the Privacy Act of 1974, the  HAVA voter registration verification requirements are optional. Of the nine  states that did not receive waivers, four\u2014Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, and  South Carolina\u2014collect the full Social Security number and, therefore, are  not subject to this HAVA requirement, according to state officials.", "Under HAVA, the state MVA must enter into an agreement with SSA to  verify the applicant information when applicants provide the last four  digits of their Social Security number rather than a driver\u2019s license number  on voter registration applications. HAVA additionally requires SSA to  develop methods to verify the accuracy of information on the voter  registration applications by matching the name, date of birth, and the last  four digits of the Social Security number provided on the voter registration  application with SSA records. SSA is to determine whether SSA records  indicate the individual is deceased.", "Figure 1 provides an example of how a computerized statewide voter  registration list could verify voter eligibility through matching registration  applications with MVA and SSA, matching the statewide list with state  records on felons and death notices from the state courts and the state  vital statistics agency, and identifying duplicate registrants in the  statewide list.", "To assist states with implementing these federal mandates, HAVA  authorizes funding to states for the creation and maintenance of the  computerized statewide voter lists. In turn, HAVA requires states to  provide such support as may be required to local jurisdictions to enable  them to use the computerized voter list. HAVA also established EAC and  charged it with, among other things, providing voluntary technical  guidance on the administration of federal elections, serving as a national  clearinghouse for information on election administration, and providing  federal funding to the states to implement the HAVA provisions. Also, DOJ  has enforcement authority with respect to the uniform and  nondiscriminatory implementation of certain HAVA requirements such as  those relating to the statewide voter registration list and verifying  information on voter registration applications. According to DOJ officials,  following the passage of HAVA, it was unnecessary to take enforcement  actions against any of the nine nonwaiver states. DOJ officials also  reported working with the states to address initial challenges and provide  informal guidance while EAC awaited staff and resources.

Officials from Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii, South  Carolina, and South Dakota reported modifying their existing  computerized statewide voter registration systems; officials from  Minnesota said the existing computerized voter registration system was  replaced; and officials from Arizona and West Virginia said their states  created computerized statewide voter registration systems for the first  time. Although these eight states reported taking different steps to  establish computerized statewide voter registration systems, election  officials reported that all of these systems met the HAVA provisions that  called for computerized statewide voter registration lists. According to  officials, these computerized lists served as centralized and interactive  databases containing the names of all legally registered voters in the state  and granted election officials immediate electronic access to query,  update, and enter voter information. They also said these computerized  lists were capable of generating official voter registration lists. Figure 2  summarizes the actions that eight of the nine states reported taking to  establish computerized voter registration lists.", "Election officials from six states, Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky,  South Carolina, and South Dakota, said their states\u2019 existing computerized  statewide voter registration systems, in place in some cases for many  years prior to HAVA, allowed state and local election officials to share and  maintain an interactive database of registered voters and generate official  voter registration lists. As a result, officials from Kentucky reported they  were required to make no change to their existing system to implement the  HAVA requirements. Officials from these other states reported that they  were required to only modify their existing systems, in some cases making  only minor changes, in order to implement HAVA. For example, in Hawaii,  election officials reported their state has operated a computerized  statewide voter registration system since 1982 and only made minor  technical changes as a result of HAVA, such as adding the ability to flag  inactive voters. In addition, since Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, and South  Carolina collect voters\u2019 full Social Security numbers on voter registration  applications, they are not subject to the HAVA provisions for verifying  information on voter registration applications by matching it with MVA  and SSA records, officials reported. Accordingly, officials said they did not  have to modify their existing systems to provide this matching capability.  Alaska and South Dakota are subject to HAVA\u2019s data matching provisions.  These states also had computerized statewide voter lists in place prior to  HAVA, and their election officials said they modified them as a result of  HAVA. Alaska election officials reported that they added new data fields to  the computerized statewide voter registration system to capture the last  four digits of the voters\u2019 Social Security numbers and to identify first-time  voters who registered by mail, which required little or no effort. South  Dakota election officials reported making similar changes as well as  adding the capability to match voter registration applications with MVA  and SSA records, actions that required a moderate level of effort, they  said.", "In the three remaining states, officials reported creating new systems in  order to implement HAVA. Officials from Minnesota said their state  operated a computerized statewide voter registration system prior to  HAVA. Their state replaced rather than modified this system. Arizona and  West Virginia election officials reported that their states did not have  computerized statewide voter lists in place prior to HAVA and that they  expended a significant level of effort to create such systems. Prior to  HAVA, some counties and local jurisdictions in these states had  computerized voter registration systems in place. However, the systems  were not interconnected to create statewide databases of legally  registered voters. Election officials in Arizona said that creating the  computerized list was also complicated because state and county election  officials lacked the legal authority to access state records they were to  match with the statewide voter list. The state had to pass new statutes and  amend others so that election officials could receive information from  state agencies, such as felony records, according to a senior election  official.", "Some officials told us that in addition to the capabilities required by HAVA  their states\u2019 computerized voter registration systems provide election  management tools that help them prepare for and conduct elections. For  example, West Virginia election officials told us their computerized voter  registration list is also able to identify voters who wished to serve as poll  workers and produce reports on absentee ballots, early voters, poll  workers, and election data statistics. Minnesota state election officials said  that their computerized voter registration list includes a module that  centrally tracks absentee ballots provided to military personnel or other  citizens residing overseas.", "Some state officials are planning to enhance their systems\u2019 election  management features. For example, Arizona plans to award a contract to  implement an updated version of its current system, which is to include  the ability to track out-of-state moves by voters and manage issues such as  petitions, provisional ballots, poll workers, and poll locations. Kentucky  election officials told us that they wish to upgrade their system to provide  more election management tools to counties, including a new function to  identify poll workers and complete absentee ballot forms. See appendixes  III through XI for more information on each state\u2019s current computerized  statewide voter registration system and future plans.", "Federal funds are available to states to assist them as they implement the  HAVA provisions. In turn, HAVA requires states to provide such support  as may be required to local jurisdictions to help them use the  computerized voter lists. Officials from six states we interviewed\u2014Alaska,  Arizona, Minnesota, South Carolina, South Dakota, and West Virginia\u2014 reported receiving federal funds to establish computerized voter lists;  these states said they spent a combination of federal and state funds  totaling about $8.4 million to establish their computerized lists. As  required by HAVA, each of the nine states, except Alaska, where the state  is solely responsible for entering and maintaining voter registration  information, provided some type of support to local jurisdictions to help  them operate the computerized statewide voter registration systems,  according to officials.

As of November 2005, Arizona and South Dakota were  matching information on the applications with state MVA or SSA records,  according to election officials. The remaining states were in various stages  of implementing the matching requirement. All nine states conducted  regular voter list maintenance activities to purge duplicates and remove  names of persons ineligible to vote, such as deceased registrants, as  required by HAVA, officials also reported. Officials from four of the nine  states we reviewed said that implementing the HAVA requirements led to  some or great improvement in the accuracy of their voter lists.

Officials from all nine states reported that their  systems check for duplicate registrants to ensure that voters are not listed  in the statewide voter list more than once. When applications are entered  into the statewide database of registered voters, some states\u2019 systems  automatically screen the applications on a real-time basis, that is, as the  data are entered, to ensure that they do not duplicate an existing  registration; other states screen the entire list on a regular basis.

This result likely occurred, some of these  officials said, because their states have had well-established computerized  statewide lists, similar to those required by HAVA, in place for many years  prior to HAVA. Officials from Georgia, Hawaii, and Kentucky also  attributed this result to their states\u2019 ability to require the full Social  Security number on voter registration applications.

In part this is because of the inherent  risks of managing a dynamic body of information that is constantly  changing as voters move, change names, come of age to vote, or become  ineligible to vote. Managing these risks has challenged election officials  across the country for some time, as we have documented in a series of  past reports. In October 2001 we issued a report that described the  operations and challenges associated with each stage of the election  process, including list maintenance. We reported that, judging from our  national survey of local election officials, officials were challenged by  continually updating and deleting information from voter registration lists  and had concerns related to obtaining accurate and timely information to  keep voter lists accurate. In June 2005 we reported on the processes   14 local voting jurisdictions from seven states used to verify voter  registration eligibility and the challenges officials faced in maintaining  accurate voter lists. We reported that while some of these challenges,  such as reducing duplicate registrations among jurisdictions within the  state, may be resolved when HAVA is fully implemented, others may  continue to be issues. Problems identifying voters who are registered  concurrently in more than one state and problems using incomplete,  untimely, or hard-to-decipher felony, death, and other information could  also continue to hinder efforts to maintain accurate voter lists. In  September 2005 we issued a report that described the experiences of  selected local election officials in the same seven states as they processed  voter registration applications. We reported that officials in these  jurisdictions face a number of challenges, such as processing incomplete  or inaccurate applications received from voter registration drives  sponsored by nongovernmental organizations.", "Some of the concerns highlighted in our October 2001, June 2005, and  September 2005 reports remain issues in states we discussed in this report,  even after these nine states implemented the HAVA-required computerized  lists. For example:  Duplicate voter registrants. Echoing concerns reported in our previous  work, the majority of state election officials interviewed for this report  said that their states might not receive information about residents who  leave the state and reregister to vote in another state. As a result, voters  could be registered and vote in two states concurrently. One senior  election official described this type of duplicate registration as a  \u201cuniversal\u201d problem affecting all states. States are not required to share  information that would allow them to identify persons registered in more  than one state, although some states voluntarily notify other states when  a voter relocates and reregisters in that state, officials said. Officials from  Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Minnesota, South Carolina, South  Dakota, and West Virginia told us they notify other states of voters who  relocate and then reregister. However, such notifications are possible only  if voters disclose on their voter registration application they have  relocated from another state, officials also told us. This issue, caused in  part by a lack of consistently available information, poses an inherent risk  to the accuracy of voter lists and may not be resolved solely by  implementing the HAVA-required computerized list requirement.", "Deceased registrants. We previously reported that concerns regarding  timeliness and completeness of vital statistics data on deceased persons  used to match against voter lists may continue to be an issue, even after  the HAVA requirements for a computerized list are implemented.  However, the election officials we interviewed in most of the states did not  share concerns about the timeliness of information their offices receive on  deceased persons from the vital statistics office. One official observed that  the vital statistics office may not receive timely information from coroners  or funeral home directors. Officials in a majority of the states we reviewed  observed that data on deceased persons may not be complete because  states are not able consistently to identify and remove names of deceased  registrants if the deaths occur out of state. According to an official in  South Dakota, some states are prohibited by state laws from sharing  information on deaths, a fact that has, in part, prevented this issue from  being resolved. Even in states that share such information, unless officials  are aware that the deceased was registered to vote in a certain state,  officials are not able to pass the information to the appropriate election  office. This issue, related in part to the unavailability of information, poses  an inherent risk to the accuracy of voter lists and is not resolved by  implementing the HAVA-required computerized list requirement.", "Felons. While HAVA requires coordinating the voter list with state  information on persons convicted of a felony, election officials we  interviewed in several of the states expressed concerns similar to those  reported in our previous work that the criminal information they receive is  incomplete, not timely, or difficult to decipher. This issue, similar to  concerns related to the availability, timeliness, and quality of other types  of voter registration information, poses an inherent risk to the accuracy of  lists because it could limit the ability of officials to identify and remove  names of felons ineligible to register to vote from the computerized voter  lists.", "U.S. citizenship. In addition to having concerns regarding felony status,  election officials from two states also expressed concerns regarding the  willingness of registrants to self-attest that they were U.S. citizens and  therefore eligible to vote under state eligibility requirements, concerns that  are consistent with those documented in our previous work. The HAVA- required unique identifying numbers, such as driver\u2019s license numbers or  Social Security numbers, are not useful for this purpose because neither is  generally accepted as evidence of U.S. citizenship. This lack of information  poses an inherent risk to the accuracy of lists, as illustrated by an example  from Minnesota. Officials told us that they discovered 30 noncitizens on  the Minnesota voter list during the November 2004 general election despite  having the HAVA-required computerized statewide voter list in place.  Minnesota\u2019s MVA has since added visa expiration dates to the driver\u2019s  licenses of noncitizens to indicate their citizenship status. South Dakota  officials reported their MVA provides similar information on driver\u2019s  licenses. To address this concern, Arizona officials told us that their state  no longer accepts the registration applicants\u2019 self-attestation of  citizenship; all voter registration applicants are now required to provide  proof of citizenship. As we reported in our June 2005 report, federal jury  administrators could identify possible noncitizens on the basis of  information that potential jurors provide when identifying themselves as  noncitizens on their jury service questionnaire. We recommended that  the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts determine the feasibility and  steps necessary for U.S. district court jury administrators to provide notice  to state election officials of potential jurors who identify themselves as  noncitizens. Officials from Hawaii reported that their state periodically  checks the voter list with this type of information and other citizenship  indexes.", "Receiving voter registration applications. Officials from Georgia, South  Carolina, and South Dakota said that their state received voter registration  applications from registration drives that contained inaccuracies such as  fictitious names, a problem that we had identified in past reports. South  Carolina officials also said that only a small number of such applications  are generally received. Officials from a majority of the nine states we  reviewed reported that they received a small number of complaints from  voters who said that they had registered through a registration drive but  that their names did not appear on the voter list on Election Day."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State Election Officials Reported Numerous Challenges and Lessons Learned while Implementing HAVA Requirements for Their Statewide Voter Registration Lists", "paragraphs": ["Creating statewide computerized lists required by HAVA presented a  number of challenges and resulted in lessons learned, officials told us, as  they developed their computerized statewide voter registration systems,  made them operational, and later managed them. The challenges and  lessons learned they shared are consistent with those that our past  research has shown to be important to effectively acquiring, developing,  and implementing information systems in public and private sector  organizations. Officials shared their experiences as they developed their  systems, for example:    Election officials from Minnesota and West Virginia reported that meeting  the time frames they established for developing their computerized lists  was challenging, in part because of limited staff available to complete the  work.", "Designing a system with the appropriate scope was an issue raised by  Arizona, Hawaii, Kentucky, and Minnesota officials. This challenge  involved determining the functional requirements of the system, for  instance, the number of election management features the system should  provide, if any, in addition to the capabilities required by HAVA. A senior  Minnesota official reported Minnesota reduced the scope of its new  system from what it had initially planned because of resource and time  constraints, keeping the necessary elements but eliminating some election  administration functions. Officials said this experience taught them that  the functional requirements of the system should be prioritized as early as  possible to differentiate features that are necessary from those that would  be nice to have. Arizona officials addressed this design challenge by  initially implementing a system that performed only the basic tasks  required under the HAVA provisions, they reported. In the near term, they  told us, local officials used the computerized statewide system to manage  voter registration information while continuing to use their local  computerized systems to manage elections. This decision minimized  changes to the way counties historically managed elections, officials said.  The state plans to expand the scope of its new statewide system in the  future, providing counties with additional election management  capabilities, an official told us. Their plan, officials said, is to draw upon  local and state officials\u2019 experiences with the statewide system to identify  and prioritize what additional features to add to their system. The  Kentucky official offered a lesson learned as well, suggesting that election  officials, as they define the capabilities the system is to offer, should be  mindful of selecting a system that the state can afford now and in the  future.", "Converting data on registered voters from the old system to the new  system was time-consuming and required processes to ensure that data  were accurately entered into the new system, election officials from  Arizona, Minnesota, and West Virginia observed. This work was  complicated, in part, because of inaccurate information in existing records  such as misspelled street addresses or duplicate registrations that needed  to be resolved before inputting the corrected data into the new systems\u2019  databases. Minnesota officials said that to help local officials with this  work, they developed a tool that allowed them to compare old records of  voter information with the new ones on a case-by-case basis.", "Officials from Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Kentucky, South Carolina, South  Dakota, and West Virginia also said that as states develop their  computerized systems, they should adopt a collaborative approach,  working with local officials to design, develop, or implement the systems  in order to obtain local officials\u2019 cooperation. The state officials provided  various reasons for emphasizing the importance of maintaining  cooperative relationships with local officials. For example, West Virginia  officials told us local officials resisted moving from their county-based  systems to the statewide system, which made implementing the system  more difficult. Local officials resisted in part because many of them  viewed the new statewide system as an intrusion into a domain of election  administration that had been a local\u2014not a state\u2014responsibility, state  officials told us. Involving county officials in designing and implementing  the system, the state officials said, might have addressed this issue and  simplified implementation of the new system. Arizona and South Carolina  officials said they involved local officials by convening a working group  composed of both local and state officials that was responsible for  developing the system. Hawaii state officials told us that frequent, regular  communication helped their state maintain a cooperative relationship with  local officials; for instance, this state holds quarterly meetings with county  officials in order to coordinate activities such as completing list  maintenance and data entry before poll books and voter lists are printed.  Kentucky officials said the key to their success was the cooperative  working relationship they cultivated with local officials by keeping them  involved.", "Officials also shared challenges and lessons learned while making their  systems operational. For example, West Virginia officials said that their  system became operational in every county on the same day. However, it  may have been beneficial for their state, they stated, to introduce the  system incrementally county by county rather than bringing every election  jurisdiction online the same day. They reasoned that such a staggered  rollout schedule might have been easier on the state election officials,  given their staffing constraints. Officials from some states also told us that  prior to putting systems into service, it is important to train staff to use the  new system. In order to provide local officials access to the most current  information, Minnesota officials said they provide the user\u2019s manual  online.", "State election officials also shared their lessons learned from their  experience managing computerized voter registration systems once they  were operational. Officials from Hawaii and Kentucky, two states that  have managed computerized voter registrations systems for some years,  observed that as technology develops, officials may decide to enhance  their systems, as both of their states have done over the years. These  officials offered lessons to keep in mind as states contemplate system  upgrades: be mindful that selecting upgrades to the system may require  compromises among local jurisdictions that may have competing needs or  different administrative or technical constraints and that changes to the  system affect all local jurisdictions equally. Hawaii officials shared another  issue they encountered while managing their system; they could not use  the computerized system while updating voter information. To address  this issue, officials from Hawaii said their staff created a shadow system  so that the system could be updated and available at the same time. Hawaii  officials also recommended that states establish uniform processing  procedures among their jurisdictions so that all jurisdictions function as  one.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days after the  report date.

Specifically, our objectives were to  describe the actions election officials from nine states reported taking to  (1) establish computerized statewide voter registration lists and (2) verify  information provided on voter registration applications and maintain the  statewide voter lists. In addition, we describe what these state officials  told us regarding (3) the challenges they faced and lessons they learned  while implementing these requirements. Most states obtained a waiver  from the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to postpone  implementation of this HAVA requirement until January 1, 2006. However,  these nine states did not obtain a waiver and, therefore, were to implement  these HAVA requirements by the original deadline, January 1, 2004.", "To meet our objectives, we reviewed HAVA provisions related to the  establishment of statewide computerized voter registration list  requirements. We then identified the proper points of contact within each  state and conducted telephone interviews using a structured interview  format. Among other things, we asked election officials in the nine states  to describe when their computerized systems had been developed; the  capabilities of their systems; what actions, if any, their states took to  implement the HAVA requirements for a computerized list; what level of  effort was required to make any HAVA-related modifications; what effect  implementing these changes, if any, might have had on the accuracy of  their statewide voter lists; and what challenges they faced and lessons they  learned while implementing these HAVA requirements. We did not  independently verify the accuracy of state election officials\u2019 responses.  However, state election officials were provided the opportunity to verify  the accuracy of their responses for this report, and on the basis of the  comments we received, we made technical changes where appropriate. As  part of our interviews, we also asked state officials how much federal and  state money was spent on their computerized statewide systems in order  to implement the HAVA requirements. We did not independently verify the  amounts they reported to us. However, we attempted to compare the  amounts of money the states reported that they spent with data reported  by them to EAC on the implementation of all HAVA requirements. Because  of variations in the way these amounts were reported by the states, we  could not identify the amounts spent solely on implementation of the  computerized list requirement.", "Our work focused primarily on the states, since most of the  responsibilities for implementing HAVA statewide computerized list  provisions took place at the state level. We did, however, communicate  with officials from the EAC and Department of Justice (DOJ) Civil Rights  Division to obtain information about and documentation on their roles and  responsibilities related to the HAVA statewide computerized list  provisions.

HAVA established EAC to,  among other things, serve as a national clearinghouse for information on  election administration and provide information and guidance with  respect to laws, procedures, and technologies affecting the administration  of federal elections.", "On August 4, 2005, EAC released its final version of the Voluntary  Guidance on Implementation of Statewide Voter Registration Lists. The  purpose of the voluntary guidance was to assist states in their efforts to  develop and maintain a statewide voter registration list pursuant to HAVA  Section 303(a). The guidance describes a set of specifications and  requirements states may use to implement the HAVA provisions, such as  establishing real-time access to all registration data, securing the  registration list, synchronizing the statewide list with local databases at  least every 24 hours, and coordinating with other databases for the  purpose of performing voter registration verification and list maintenance.  EAC\u2019s guidance also contains recommendations on dealing with outcomes  that may result from the verification process, the type of voting history  information states should track, and the type of system that is most closely  aligned with HAVA requirements.
