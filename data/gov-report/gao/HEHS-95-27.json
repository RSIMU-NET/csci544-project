In contrast, over the same period, U.S. health care costs have risen from 9.2 percent of GDP in 1980 to a projected 14 percent of GDP in 1994, while the portion of the U.S. nonelderly population not covered by insurance is now estimated to be 17 percent. In 1991, the annual cost per person for health care was $1,659 in Germany compared with $2,867 in the United States.", "Despite this successful history of cost control, the German federal government became concerned during 1992 about growth in health care premium costs in the Statutory Health Insurance System, which covers the great majority of the German population. As a result of this concern, in December 1992 the German federal parliament enacted a health care reform law, the Health Care Structure Reform Act of 1993.", "The reforms of this law consisted of two major parts. First, it imposed strict nonnegotiable budgets lasting up to 3 years on major sectors of the statutory system, including hospitals, ambulatory care physicians, prescription pharmaceuticals, and dentists. These budgets were intended to hold down expenditures while the details of the second part of the reform, a series of structural reforms intended to control expenditures over the longer term, were crafted and implemented over the remainder of the decade.", "While our July 1993 report discussed the nature and intent of these changes, this report covers the effects of the first year of strict budgets on cost and access to care and briefly discusses the status of some of the structural changes intended to allow the statutory system to control costs over the longer term."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["About 90 percent of the German population obtains its health insurance through one of the more than 900 Statutory Health Insurance Funds, usually called sickness funds.

Persons with incomes above the threshold may choose to remain in the statutory system, and many do.", "The German Statutory Health Insurance System is mainly financed through an income-based premium, 50 percent paid by employers and 50 percent by employees, on wages up to the statutory threshold amount mentioned above. At the beginning of 1993, this premium, called a contribution, averaged 13.4 percent of wages up to the income threshold in former West Germany.

This act imposed strict budgets beginning January 1, 1993, for periods of up to 3 years on the major sectors of the statutory health insurance system, including hospitals, ambulatory care physicians, prescription pharmaceuticals, and dentists.", "These budgets were designed to stabilize the contribution rate by restricting the rate of increase in spending to the rate of increase in the total amount of workers\u2019 wages subject to the contribution. Spending increases in each sector are subject to this restriction. If successful, this would have the effect of stabilizing the contribution rate at its current level. If any sector exceeds its budget, its payment rates may be reduced during the next year to recoup the excess spending.", "The Health Care Structure Reform Act also provided for a series of major structural reforms to be implemented over the remainder of the decade and intended to build cost control structures and incentives into the Statutory Health Insurance System.

First, about 15 percent of the decrease represents a shifting of drug costs to consumers in the form of co-payments for prescription pharmaceuticals. The Ministry of Health ascribes an additional 20 percent of savings to a combination of three factors: the effects of the reference price system for pharmaceuticals, created by the Health Care Reform Act of 1989; a 5-percent reduction in the price of prescription pharmaceuticals not under the reference price system mandated by the 1993 act; and a mandated 2-percent reduction in the price of over-the-counter pharmaceuticals also mandated by the 1993 act.", "The Ministry of Health ascribes the remainder of the decrease\u2014about DM 3 billion\u2014to changes in the behavior of physicians towards prescribing drugs.

Most of these categories contain a relatively high percentage of doubtful or inappropriately prescribed preparations. In contrast, the number of prescriptions for some pharmaceutical groups containing a high percentage of drugs considered to be both therapeutically effective and usually appropriately prescribed, such as diabetes-related drugs, antibiotics, and angiotensin converting enzyme-inhibitors, remained stable or increased slightly in 1993.", "These statistics do not support the view that the global budget for pharmaceuticals caused widespread problems of patient access to appropriate drugs in Germany in 1993. Independent experts and Health Ministry officials with whom we spoke in Germany generally agreed that the pharmaceutical budget had not caused significant access problems in 1993. Experts from the Research Institute of the Local Sickness Funds said that the pharmaceutical budget can be credited with improving quality of care because the amount of inappropriately prescribed pharmaceuticals has decreased.", "However, one physician pointed out that long-term quality effects may eventually become apparent.

Also, the Ministry found that in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate there were 215,000 fewer billable bed days than had been budgeted for in 1993.

Rates of decrease in expenditures experienced by pharmaceuticals and dentures are probably unsustainable at the 1993 rates.", "One expert told us that the cost of pharmaceuticals and dentures had also fallen dramatically in response to earlier cost control efforts, and had resumed their rate of growth in 1994. Also, some of the 1993 decrease in expenditures may have been due to increased spending on pharmaceuticals and dentures in December 1992 in anticipation of implementation of the Health Care Structure Reform Act. Moreover, since pharmaceutical expenditures for 1993 were well under the budget limits, the disincentive for drug prescribing by physicians is less threatening and may not have as constraining an effect on physicians. In addition, few of the structural reforms intended for long-term cost control are yet in place, and those that are have not had time to exert much effect.", "German government data from the first quarter of 1994 suggest that the reforms were still controlling cost growth at that time. Although spending for dentures, and to a lesser degree pharmaceuticals, was well above levels for the first quarter of 1993, overall spending was only 5 percent above 1993 levels. Furthermore, comparison with the first quarter of 1993 may be somewhat misleading because spending in that quarter was depressed due to anticipation of the effects of the Health Care Structure Reform Act. Compared with the first quarter of 1992, 2 years previously, first quarter spending was up only about 4 percent, and it was down about 3 percent from the last quarter of 1993, the quarter immediately previous.

This is being done partly to increase equity among the funds and partly as a necessary preparation for the extension of the right of blue-collar workers to choose among sickness funds, due to become effective January 1, 1997.", "The German risk-adjustment process is somewhat different from others because it includes an adjustment for sickness fund income as well as for risk of health care expenditures. This is both possible and necessary because of Germany\u2019s income-based premium structure. If a sickness fund has a disproportionate percentage of low-income members, its income will be low (or its contribution rate high) relative to a fund with a large percentage of high-income members.", "The adjustment on the expenditure side is relatively simple, covering only age and sex. In this adjustment process, all persons insured by the sickness fund (including co-insured family members, but excluding pensioners for the time being) were divided into 1-year groups by age and sex. A national average expenditure amount for each year and sex group was computed. For example, the average expenditure was computed for 20-year-old females and 60-year-old males. These amounts were then multiplied by the number of persons in each group in each sickness fund and added together to obtain the risk-adjusted financial requirements for each sickness fund. The same calculation was done to develop the risk-adjusted financial requirement for all sickness funds.", "On the income side, the total income subject to the contribution rate was determined for each sickness fund and for all sickness funds together. The ratio between the risk-adjusted financial requirements and the total income subject to the contribution rate of all sickness funds together constitutes the uniform equalization rate. The same ratio is then calculated for each sickness fund individually, and compared with the uniform equalization rate.

The Germans used this bundle of related services associated with each PMC to develop related cost weights for each PMC corresponding to the 60 procedures initially to be covered by the full case payment system.", "The PMC system also differs from DRGs in two other important respects. First, PMCs are tightly defined around a specific illness, whereas DRGs group patients whose treatments are expected to consume similar levels of hospital resources.
