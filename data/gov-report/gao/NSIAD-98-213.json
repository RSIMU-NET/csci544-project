Our calculation of attrition did not include the early separation of enlistees with 5- or 6-year contracts who were discharged in their final 1 to 2 years of service. However, because the majority of first-term contracts are for  4 years, we made our calculation at the 48-month point to include the most recent data available (fiscal year 1997). Also, like DMDC, we did not count as attrition persons allowed to separate before the end of their terms through early release programs. Because our method does not include the attrition of enlistees with 5- or 6-year contracts who were separated in their final 1 or 2 years of service and because it does not include separations under early release programs, our information on attrition rates is somewhat conservative.", "Although we did not extensively test the reliability of DMDC\u2019s database, we did discuss the Center\u2019s computation of attrition rates with DMDC officials and recalculated these rates ourselves.

However, in practice, the services have for various reasons released enlistees more than 90 days early.

However, during our interviews with first-term enlistees and their supervisors, some continue to believe that there is a \u201czero defects\u201d mentality in the services. That is, they believe that the services are not willing to work with a servicemember at any pay grade to give him or her a chance at rehabilitation. This mentality appears to be related to what some researchers have observed is the \u201cvolunteer in, volunteer out\u201d philosophy that came about when the draft ended. During the draft era, some researchers have commented, commanders believed that enlistees had an obligation to fulfill and were more likely to work with enlistees experiencing motivational problems. With the advent of the all-volunteer force, on the other hand, commanders became less patient with below-average enlistees and were more likely to separate them. One obvious result of this change in philosophy was a rise in attrition after the draft ended. units with lower attrition demonstrated concern for the individual, expected trainees to meet standards, and were generally working to produce \u201ca soldier I\u2019d accept in a . . . unit.\u201d Cadres in units with higher TDP  rates tended to be more concerned with statistical accomplishments, fulfilling the traditional drill sergeant role, and \u201cweeding out the duds.\u201d They emphasized graduating \u201cthe best soldier in the United States Army\u201d or \u201cone I\u2019d be proud to have in a . . . unit.\u201d Their philosophy produced standards beyond the norm.", "The TRADOC team also found lower attrition rates in units that had higher numbers of senior grade noncommissioned officers and effective buddy systems.", "A 1988 Rand study also suggested that management policies have an effect on attrition and reported that the Army\u2019s attrition rates decreased immediately after the TRADOC study called attention to the issues of Army leadership. The Rand study compared enlistees with similar educational levels and AFQT scores and found that the attrition of these groups depended on what geographical locations they were assigned to. The study concluded that the differences in attrition rates of similarly qualified enlistees suggest that \u201cfactors such as institutional policies and practices may have a critical effect on attrition levels.\u201d The study noted that after the TRADOC study was completed and the Army had begun to focus on attrition, the Army\u2019s attrition rates decreased in fiscal year 1985, resulting in the retention of 4 percent more high quality men and 6 percent more high quality women."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Do Not Provide Sufficiently Punitive Discharges to Prevent Enlistees From Seeking Separation", "paragraphs": ["During March 1998 testimony before the Senate Committee on Armed Services\u2019 Subcommittee on Personnel, a panel of recruiters stressed the importance of making new enlistees more aware of the commitment they make in signing contracts for military service.

During this time, the services have targeted their recruiting efforts toward enlisting high school diploma graduates who score in the upper half of the AFQT because they have lower attrition rates than recruits without these qualifications. This group continues to show lower attrition rates than other recruit groups. However, because the overwhelming majority of all recruits are now high school diploma graduates with high AFQT scores, the services must turn their efforts to encouraging more of their high-quality enlistees to complete their first terms. Reducing attrition rates will be complex and difficult. However, considering the cost of recruiting and training the thousands of enlistees who do not complete their first terms of service, the payoff of reducing attrition will be significant, since savings could then be channeled to other defense priorities.", "In reducing attrition, a first and critical step is for DOD to obtain more complete data on the magnitude of its losses. We believe that all separations\u2014including voluntary releases more than 90 days early\u2014need to be reported so that DOD and the services have a fuller and more accurate picture of their turnover rates. We are not suggesting that voluntary early release programs were not cost-effective downsizing tools. Rather, we believe that early releases should be managed and reported along with other types of first-term attrition. Releases more than 90 days early clearly result in a loss in the services\u2019 recruiting and training investment.", "Second, collecting better data on why enlistees are being separated is key to the services\u2019 ability to craft policies that increase the proportion of first-term personnel who complete their contractual obligations. In our 1997 report on attrition from basic training, we made recommendations to DOD and the services on ways to improve the use of separation codes to build a database for DOD to manage attrition. These recommendations were included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998 (P.L. 105-85), and DOD is now working to implement them. Our current work reaffirms the fact that separation codes are used inconsistently by the services and that these codes are not specific enough to capture exactly why separations are occurring. The assignment of these codes requires a degree of subjective judgment. This subjectivity may mask true reasons for separation and make it more difficult to analyze why attrition is occurring and to determine what can be done to decrease it.", "Third, data now available on the quality-of-life issues underlying attrition is not tied to the services\u2019 efforts to prevent the attrition of first-term enlistees. If the services could use the data they collect from their several surveys on the quality of military life to prioritize first-term enlistees\u2019 concerns, they could focus their attention on improvements that would have the most impact on reducing the attrition of first-term personnel.", "We believe that all the services are concerned about attrition and that service leaders are conveying this concern to their local commanders. Two services, the Army and the Air Force, have even set numerical goals for reducing first-term attrition. However, while there is research to support the positive effect of such command emphasis on finding ways to get more high-quality personnel to complete their first terms, we believe that setting numerical goals for reducing attrition without complete information on its underlying causes or guidance on what specific actions should be taken to reduce it may turn these goals into arbitrary ceilings.", "While command emphasis on attrition is critical to the services\u2019 efforts to reduce it, this emphasis must be linked to clear policy changes that target specific groups of enlistees the services wish to retain. Better guidance to commanders on what actions should be taken to deal with identified problems or what accommodations could be made to retain certain categories of enlistees is also needed. The Army\u2019s recent decision to rehabilitate enlistees with bars to reenlistment is one example of a successful policy change to reduce attrition. In this case, Army commanders targeted a group of enlistees they wished to retain\u2014primarily those with performance problems\u2014and made formal policy changes to do so. The Army will now be able to measure the effects of its policy change in terms of how many more enlistees it was able to retain and why.", "Our interviews with first-term enlistees, supervisors, and service officials indicate that other types of enlistees could be targeted for remedial action if specific mitigating actions are taken. For example, enlistees who commit minor disciplinary infractions, who fail physical fitness or career development tests, who are one-time drug users, or who become pregnant may simply need to be provided further counseling, optional testing, other job choices, or remedial training by their commissioned or noncommissioned officers.", "Finally, granting honorable discharges to enlistees who deliberately seek ways out of fulfilling their service commitments simply encourages others to do likewise. One Army unit we visited had already begun to attempt to close these \u201cescape routes\u201d and impose more punitive measures against certain enlistees, particularly those found to use drugs.
