This report examines, among other things, (1) the mental health care DOD makes available to servicemembers domestically and overseas and (2) the accessibility of mental health care provided to servicemembers domestically and overseas. GAO analyzed recent, available data on MHS mental health utilization, staffing, and appointment access and compared access data to relevant DOD standards. GAO reviewed mental health data from several DOD surveys as well as documents related to MHS mental health care. GAO also interviewed DOD and service officials and representatives from servicemember and provider associations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense's (DOD) Military Health System (MHS) makes a variety of inpatient and outpatient mental health care available to active duty servicemembers and activated National Guard and Reserve servicemembers (reservists) domestically and overseas through its TRICARE health care system. The type of care includes psychological testing and assessment, psychotherapy, medication management, and inpatient psychiatric care. This care is typically available through military treatment facilities and clinics (direct care), and it is supplemented by care provided through networks of civilian providers (purchased care). In fiscal year 2014, DOD provided 76 percent of 2.9 million outpatient mental health encounters through direct care and 69 percent of 0.2 million inpatient mental health bed days through purchased care. To deliver mental health care, the military services use a range of strategies including telehealth, embedding mental health providers within units, and integrating mental health providers in primary care. While DOD has increased the number of available mental health providers in both direct and purchased care in recent years, DOD data indicate that the military services still face shortages for certain providers, such as psychiatrists. Unlike the care available for active duty servicemembers and activated reservists, MHS mental health care for inactive reservists is generally limited to referrals to non-DOD community resources or, if eligible, the reservists can purchase coverage for health care, including mental health care, through TRICARE Reserve Select, a premium-based health plan for reservists.", "DOD data on domestic and overseas direct care from April 2014 through August 2015 show that MHS-wide DOD's access to care standards were generally met for three of four mental health appointment types. However, in the case of routine appointments\u2014initial appointments for a new or exacerbated condition\u2014data show that other than the Air Force, MHS routine mental health appointments generally did not meet the 7-day access standard. DOD and service officials attributed this to several factors, including some appointments being incorrectly coded, thus negatively impacting the routine appointment access results. They told GAO that DOD was taking steps to address the coding problem and improve oversight of mental health access. Additionally, the data show that about 59 percent of mental health appointments are follow-up appointments, which generally do not have an official DOD access standard. Federal internal control standards call for agencies to have sufficient information to monitor agency performance. By not establishing and monitoring a follow-up appointment standard, DOD cannot hold the military services accountable for the majority of mental health care provided in the direct care system. For purchased care, limited access data are available, and DOD instead relies on beneficiary surveys and complaints to monitor access\u2014consistent with methods used by civilian health plans. DOD surveys have identified access problems for some servicemembers. For example, a DOD beneficiary survey estimated that about one-third of active duty servicemembers experienced problems accessing mental health care from 2011 through 2014. Additionally, provider surveys from 2012 and 2013 found that only an estimated 37 percent of civilian mental health providers were accepting any new TRICARE patients. DOD's ongoing efforts to improve oversight of mental health access, including implementing a strategic plan, may help address some of these problems, but it is too early to tell."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD establish an access standard for mental health follow-up appointments and regularly monitor data on these appointments.

DOD  reports that between 2005 and 2013, the number of individuals who  received mental health care through DOD\u2019s MHS grew by 32 percent.  This growth has been attributed to multiple factors, including more  referrals to care from mental health screenings and increasing numbers  of servicemembers who experienced life-threatening situations while  deployed in combat since September 11, 2001 and their resulting need  for mental health treatment. Since 2001, DOD has also expanded the use  of its civilian workforce to perform combat support functions traditionally  performed by military personnel, thereby increasing these civilians\u2019 risk  for developing post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health  conditions. DOD has experienced challenges in providing mental health  care to meet the needs of its servicemembers, and these challenges have  been exacerbated by issues such as nationwide shortages of mental  health providers and the pressure to control DOD healthcare costs. In the  MHS, care is provided through TRICARE, DOD\u2019s regionally structured  health care system. Under TRICARE, active duty servicemembers  typically receive most of their care in what is known as the direct care  component\u2014that is, in military hospitals and clinics referred to as military  treatment facilities (MTF).

To examine mental health provider staffing levels and  shortages in the purchased care system, we analyzed provider network  adequacy reports from the month of December of each year for 2010  through 2014, and the report for the month of July for 2015, which was  the most recent month with complete data available for analysis. To  ensure the reliability of the data in the mental health staffing reports and  the provider network adequacy reports, we interviewed officials from the  Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs responsible  for collecting and analyzing the quarterly staffing reports, and TRICARE  Regional Office officials responsible for collecting and analyzing the  monthly network adequacy reports. In addition, we reviewed  documentation related to the production of these reports, performed data  checks on the network adequacy reports and examined the data for  missing values. On the basis of these steps as well as our prior review of  the quarterly staffing reports, we found the data to be sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report.", "To further examine the availability of MHS mental health care, we also  interviewed officials from the DOD and the military services, specifically  the Army, Army Reserve, Navy, Navy Reserve, Air Force, Air Force  Reserve, Marine Corps, Marine Corps Reserve, National Guard Bureau,  NCR Medical Directorate, Defense Health Agency (DHA), and TRICARE  Regional Offices, to learn about the mental health care available to  servicemembers and reservists.

The provider shortages were more prevalent in the  TRICARE West Region, with up to 15 percent of Prime Service Areas  contracting fewer psychiatrists than targeted and up to 11 percent of  Prime Service Areas contracting fewer behavioral health providers than  targeted for the network in certain years. In spite of the general  decrease in contracted network mental health providers from December  2011 to July 2015 in the TRICARE South Region, the region had the  fewest psychiatrist and behavioral health provider shortages, with no  more than 6 percent of Prime Service Areas experiencing psychiatrist  shortages, and no more than 2 percent of Prime Service Areas  experiencing behavioral health provider shortages during this time period.  Officials from the TRICARE South contractor told us that these shortages  were possibly due to shortages of psychiatrists, particularly child  psychiatrists, both at the national and local levels. TRICARE Regional  Office officials told us that the contractors were limited in their ability to  address these provider shortages because the provider shortages affect  the entire health system and are not specific to the TRICARE program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MHS Mental Health Care Available to Inactive Reservists is Generally Limited to Assessments and Referrals or to Care Purchased through TRICARE Reserve Select", "paragraphs": ["Unlike the mental health care made available to active duty  servicemembers, DOD generally does not make mental health care  available to inactive reservists at no cost to them.

In addition, a 2012 report from the Department of  Veterans Affairs Office of Inspector General noted that the private sector  health care organizations they studied measured follow-up appointments  by establishing a pre-determined average number of visits (e.g., four)  within the first 45\u201360 days of an initial new patient appointment, and they  also measured the length of time between subsequent visits (e.g., the  amount of time until the second, third, and fourth visits).", "DOD officials said that DHA is in the process of improving its oversight  and monitoring of access to mental health care, although it did not report  plans to develop an access standard for follow-up appointments.

Service-specific results were generally similar to the  overall results, although fewer active duty Air Force servicemembers  experienced access problems compared to the other services, with an  estimated 23 to 29 percent of Air Force servicemembers experiencing  problems over the four-year period. Similar to the results for active duty  servicemembers, about an estimated one-third of reservists experienced  problems accessing mental health treatment over the four years.", "Results from the Air Force\u2019s 2013 Community Assessment survey found  that the majority of Air Force servicemembers did not feel that various  mental health access barriers related to logistics and appointment  scheduling were applicable to them.

For example, DOD\u2019s nationwide TRICARE Standard Surveys  of Civilian Providers have found that less than half of civilian mental  health providers were accepting new TRICARE patients. (See app. II,  table 15.) As we have previously reported, surveys from 2008 through  2011 estimated that only about 39 percent of civilian mental health  providers were accepting any new TRICARE patients. Data from the  2012 and 2013 TRICARE Standard Survey of Civilian Providers provided  by DOD showed that this percentage had not improved over time, with an  estimated 37 percent of civilian mental health providers accepting new  TRICARE patients during the surveys. A TRICARE Regional Office  official suggested that the challenge of finding a civilian mental health  provider who is accepting new TRICARE patients should be less of a  concern for Prime beneficiaries, because they would typically be seeking  care from TRICARE network providers. The Regional Office official also  said that they would assist any Prime beneficiary who reported  challenges in finding a mental health provider, and a DOD official  explained that if a mental health specialist is not available, the contractor  (domestic or overseas) is contractually responsible for locating a non- network provider for Prime beneficiaries.", "Additionally, DOD\u2019s TRICARE Standard Survey of Beneficiaries, which  surveyed beneficiaries not enrolled in TRICARE Prime (that is,  nonenrolled beneficiaries), including reservists with TRS, have also found  that these beneficiaries experienced problems accessing a civilian mental  health care provider. (See app. II, table 16.) As we previously reported,  surveys from 2008 through 2011 show that an estimated 28 percent of  these nonenrolled beneficiaries experienced problems accessing civilian  mental health care providers.

For example, a 2015 RAND Corporation study  about access to behavioral health care found that active duty  servicemembers classified as living in geographically remote areas made  up to 20 percent fewer visits to behavioral health care providers than  those living closer to facilities. The RAND study also found that remote  servicemembers needing or wanting behavioral health care face  challenges similar to those faced by the rural population generally,  including a shortage of appropriate service providers, long travel times to  facilities, and few travel options. Additionally, the study found that gaps in  broadband service in rural and remote areas impede the use of telehealth  services. However, despite the high representation of reservists who live  in geographically remote areas, RAND\u2019s analyses did not find the  remoteness associated with less utilization of behavioral health care in  that population.", "Two Army-specific studies also identified some concerns with access to  mental health care. A 2010 survey of Army mental health care providers  and their patients found that while the majority of the providers reported  being able to spend sufficient time with patients (92 percent) and  schedule encounters to meet patients\u2019 needs (82 percent), the providers  also identified services for which access to treatment was more limited  and patient subgroups with an unmet need for additional clinical care or  services. For example, the providers\u2019 patients with more severe  symptoms and diagnostic and clinical complexity reported higher rates of  access problems. Additionally, a study of three samples of Army National  Guard soldiers at three time points found that while stigma was the most  frequently cited barrier to care (34 percent of soldiers overall), 31 percent  of the soldiers reported at least one significant barrier to care related to  logistics (where to get help, inadequate transport, difficult to schedule,  getting time off work, care costs too much money, no providers available,  long distances to care). One logistical barrier\u2014mental health treatment  costing too much\u2014was the most commonly reported, with 16 percent of  soldiers overall noting this barrier.", "We also learned about mental health access challenges in our interviews  with service officials representing reservists and with representatives from  an association representing Reserve officers. Both groups identified  mental health access challenges experienced by reservists. However,  service officials reported that they typically hear about these types of  access challenges anecdotally and do not systematically collect  information about access challenges faced by reservists. For example,  while activated reservists or those with line of duty mental health  conditions may have a right to DOD health care, Army National Guard  and Army Reserve officials and representatives from the Reserve Officers  Association reported that reservists\u2019 access may be limited by their  distance from an MTF or from other resources available in their area,  particularly if they live in a geographically remote area. An Army National  Guard official and a Navy and Marine Corps Reserve official noted that in  some communities reservists face challenges finding providers that will  accept TRICARE or providers that are accepting new patients. National  Guard officials and a Navy and Marine Corps Reserve official also noted  that the TRS premiums and other costs are another access barrier for  some reservists, particularly for lower ranking servicemembers or those  who are otherwise unemployed. Additionally, representatives from the  Reserve Officers Association and the Army National Guard reported  challenges associated with putting reservists on orders to receive care  related to a line of duty condition. An Army National Guard official noted,  for example, that the minimum time for orders is an 8-hour day or a 4- hour drill period, which means servicemembers would have to be put on  active duty for that day, precluding them from doing anything else,  including working their civilian jobs.", "While access problems were identified in surveys, studies, and our  interviews, DOD\u2019s current work to establish a governance structure for  mental health access oversight, which includes the implementation of the  department\u2019s mental health strategic plan, may address some of these  concerns. For example, the governance structure may improve  accountability when access standards are not being met. However, some  problems such as finding available mental health providers may remain  because, as noted previously, provider shortages affect the entire health  system and are not specific to DOD or the TRICARE program.

Mental health care in  Afghanistan was also provided in restoration clinics\u2014residential treatment  facilities designed to maximize restoration and return-to-duty for  servicemembers.

As part of the studies,  servicemembers were surveyed about various logistical barriers to  accessing mental health care, and the responses were separated by  those servicemembers who screened positive for mental health problems  and those who did not (see table 8). The MHAT studies found that the  percentage of servicemembers agreeing with the statements \u201cmental  health services aren\u2019t available\u201d and \u201cit is too difficult to get to the location  where the mental health specialist is\u201d decreased significantly since 2009.", "However, as table 8 shows, the MHAT studies from 2009 through 2013  also found that some servicemembers continued to experience barriers  accessing mental health services. For example, the MHAT studies  consistently found that a higher percentage of Army servicemembers who  screened positive for mental health problems experienced barriers to  mental health care compared with those who did not screen positive. The  studies also found that the percentage of servicemembers who  experienced some access barriers remained fairly stable from 2009  through 2013. For example, during this period the percentage of  servicemembers reporting that they would experience difficulty getting  time off work for treatment remained the highest compared to the other  access barrier questions. In addition, the MHAT studies also identified  stigma as a strong potential barrier to seeking mental health care, with  servicemembers that screened positive for mental health conditions  reporting high levels of stigma-related concerns. For example, in the 2013  study, 49 percent of Army servicemembers that screened positive for a  mental health condition reported that they agreed or strongly agreed that  they would be seen as weak if they were to seek mental health care.", "Although the MHAT studies showed that some servicemembers  continued to experience barriers accessing mental health services over  time, as noted previously, the number of servicemembers deployed to  Afghanistan has declined in recent years. Additionally, DOD reported in  February 2016 that it was working to expand its telehealth efforts there  and that efforts such as circulating providers throughout the battlefield  and organizing providers in teams had improved the utilization and  efficiency of deployed mental health providers since the last MHAT report  in 2013."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Providing our nation\u2019s military servicemembers with timely access to  mental health care is a crucial responsibility of DHA and the military  services. Recent data show that DOD is generally meeting three of its  four appointment wait time access standards in its direct care system\u2014 where the majority of outpatient mental health care is delivered. However,  recent DOD surveys also show that about a third of servicemembers  reported that they experienced problems accessing care\u2014indicating that  servicemember perceptions of access and DOD\u2019s access to care  standards may not be aligned. Our work also shows that despite federal  internal control standards that call for agencies to have sufficient  information to monitor agency performance, DOD lacks an important  standard for follow-up appointments, which represent nearly two-thirds of  the mental health care provided in the MHS\u2019s direct care system. Without  such a standard, DOD does not have a mechanism for holding MTFs or  the services accountable for providing timely access to the most common  mental health care provided in the direct care system.", "Nonetheless, DOD has efforts underway to expand the mental health  care available to its servicemembers and to improve access to that care.  For example, DOD\u2019s current work to establish a governance structure for  the oversight of mental health access, which includes the department\u2019s  mental health strategic plan, could help DOD and the military services  identify, monitor, and improve the performance of those military services  or MTFs not performing up to standards and help ensure that  servicemembers have timely access to necessary mental health care.  However, it is too soon to determine what the impact of DOD\u2019s efforts will  be on improving access. Additionally, some factors outside of DOD\u2019s  control, such as the nationwide shortage of mental health providers, may  continue to limit DOD\u2019s ability to address all identified access problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To enhance oversight of access to mental health care and help ensure  that servicemembers have timely access to mental health care, we  recommend that that Secretary of Defense direct the Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Health Affairs to establish an access standard for mental  health follow-up appointments and regularly monitor data on these  appointments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment.
