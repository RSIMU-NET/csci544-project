Concerns were expressed by representatives of local government subgrantees that more flexibility was needed in the receipt of federal funding for first responders. Congress exempted certain first responder grants from this CMIA provision in the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) fiscal years 2005 and 2006 appropriations acts. Under the exemption, grantees can receive cash advance funding and hold such funds for extended periods of time prior to payment. GAO was asked to (1) assess whether this CMIA provision, prior to its exemption in fiscal year 2005, had prevented DHS grant recipients from receiving first responder grant funds when such funds were needed; and (2) identify any key fiscal and accountability implications of the exemption."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found no substantial evidence that the CMIA provision that limits the extent to which grantees can hold federal funds before making program payments, prior to its exemption for certain first responder grants in fiscal year 2005, prevented first responders from receiving DHS grant funds when such funds were needed. The vast majority of the officials of State Administrative Agencies (SAA) and national associations contacted neither cited the CMIA as a contributing factor to funding delays nor provided information that demonstrated that the CMIA prevented state grantees or local government and other subgrantees from receiving first responder grant funding when such funding was needed. Rather, the officials generally attributed delays in first responder operations to factors other than the CMIA, such as vendor delays in delivering goods and services and problems related to a lack of human resources to deal with the large influx of grant awards after the September 11, 2001, attacks. The information GAO obtained from these officials was consistent with the findings of DHS's Homeland Security Advisory Council's Task Force on State and Local Homeland Security Funding, which found that numerous factors other than the CMIA contributed to funding delays for first responders. According to DHS, as of March 2006, state grantees and local government subgrantees had used the CMIA exemption and DHS's corresponding 120-day cash advance funding provision, which DHS established to implement the CMIA exemption, only to a minimal extent. DHS's Office of Grant Operations is working with SAAs and local government entities to determine the extent to which the CMIA exemption may be used and the impact extensive use could have on DHS. According to a DHS official, extensive use of the CMIA exemption and DHS's 120-day cash advance funding provision could create management oversight difficulties for DHS. Concerns about oversight difficulties are warranted, as DHS currently lacks the policies and procedures to track and report on specific cases of cash advance funding. Such advances are not subject to Treasury's oversight through its administration of the CMIA program. While states' single audits are a tool for oversight, such audits are not designed to replace program management's oversight responsibilities, and GAO found that they may not cover all first responder grants because of the relatively small size of the grants. Importantly, case-by-case cash advance funding can be allowed by Treasury regulations implementing the CMIA and other applicable regulations. Such funding could enable DHS to focus its oversight efforts on grantees and subgrantees that have a demonstrated need for such funding. However, regardless of whether cash advance funding is available under the CMIA exemption and DHS's corresponding 120-day cash advance funding provision, or on a case-by-case basis, proper oversight is critical to ensure that interest due the federal government resulting from cash advance funding is accurately recorded and promptly paid."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the years immediately following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the  federal government emphasized quickly disbursing federal grant funds to  \u201cfirst responders\u201d at the state and local levels to enhance their ability to  quickly address threats to our national security. Initially, certain grants for  first responders were made directly to local government entities,  bypassing the states\u2019 traditional pass-through role, which includes certain  oversight functions designed to promote accountability in grants  management. However, more recently, the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) has awarded first responder grants to states to help  improve coordination among states, local governmental entities, and  nonprofit entities in planning, managing, and accounting for limited first  responder grant funding.", "The Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) of 1990 (P.L. 101-453), as  amended, is intended to ensure greater efficiency, effectiveness, and  equity in the exchange of funds between the federal government and the  states. The CMIA requires, among other things, that federal agencies and  the states minimize the time that elapses between transfers of funds to the  states and payments for federal grant program purposes. In addition, the  CMIA requires that the federal government pay interest to the states when  it fails to disburse federal funds to them in a timely manner, and that the  states pay interest to the federal government when they fail to timely  spend federal funds.", "Concerns were expressed by certain representatives of local governments  that additional actions needed to be taken to provide more flexibility in  making grant funds available to first responders. In fiscal years 2005 and  2006, Congress exempted certain DHS grant programs from the CMIA  requirement to minimize the time elapsing between transfers of funds by  the federal government and payments by the states. Thus, the CMIA  exemption allows state grantees to draw down and hold federal grant  funds for extended periods of time prior to payout for first responder  purposes. Importantly, such grantees are not exempt from the interest  and accountability requirements of the CMIA.", "In view of the actions that have been taken by the federal government to  provide federal funding for first responders when such funding is needed,  you noted that there may be trade-offs between rapid disbursements of  federal grant funds and ensuring that such funds are spent in a manner  that is accountable and effective. Recognizing that we had previously  reported on such trade-offs and improvements needed for management of  first responder grant programs and had ongoing work on streamlining  overall federal grant management, you asked us to review the CMIA  exemption for certain DHS first responder grants. Based on discussions  with committee staff, we agreed to (1) assess whether the CMIA provision  that limits the extent to which grantees can hold federal funds before  payout, prior to its exemption for certain first responder grants in fiscal  year 2005, prevented first responders from receiving DHS grant funds  when such funds were needed; and (2) identify any key fiscal and  accountability implications of the exemption of certain first responder  grant programs from this CMIA provision."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The CMIA is critically important to the federal government\u2019s efforts to  promote accountability in the use of federal grant funds. Currently  administered by Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS), the  CMIA is the cornerstone of cash management policy for federal grants to  the states. Specifically, the CMIA requires the Secretary of the Treasury,  along with the states, to establish equitable funds transfer procedures so  that federal financial assistance is paid to states in a timely manner and  funds are not withdrawn from Treasury earlier than they are needed by the  states for grant program purposes. The act requires that states pay interest  to the federal government if they draw down funds in advance of need and  requires the federal government to pay interest to states if federal program  agencies do not make program payments in a timely manner.", "According to Treasury regulations implementing the CMIA, funding  techniques for federal financial assistance to the states should be efficient  and minimize the exchange of interest between federal agencies and the  states. Various funding techniques can be agreed to between Treasury and  the states, including cash advance funding, whereby the federal program  agency transfers the actual amount of federal funds to a state prior to the   day the state actually pays the funds out of its own account. The limit on  such cash advance funding is 3 business days prior to payout.", "Before the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the Department of  Justice (Justice) managed several grants designed to enhance the  capability of state and local first responders to handle incidents involving  nuclear, biological, and chemical terrorism. Since 1999, these programs  have grown dramatically. In March 2003, responsibility for these grant  programs shifted to DHS, and they continued to grow. Initially, DHS  provided some of these grants directly to local government entities;  however, the requirements were changed so that grants were awarded first  to states and then passed through to local governments and other  subgrantees. Despite increased funding, many local governments\u2014cities  in particular\u2014complained that they were not receiving the funds that they  expected and could not disburse them as fast as they wanted.", "In response to complaints about delays in the disbursement of first  responder grants, on March 15, 2004, the Secretary of the Department of  Homeland Security established the HSAC Task Force on State and Local  Homeland Security Funding. The task force\u2019s objective was to examine the  homeland security grant funding process and provide recommendations to  expedite the flow of homeland security funds to those responsible for  preventing and responding to acts of terrorism. The task force  recommended, among other things, that Congress exempt certain DHS  homeland security grants for fiscal year 2005 from the CMIA in order to  allow funds to be provided to state and municipal entities up to 120 days in  advance of expenditure. The task force indicated that more flexibility was  needed in providing grant funding to first responders because, in some  instances, the 3-day time frame for receiving grant funds prior to making  payments was insufficient to prevent municipal jurisdictions from having  to make payments to vendors in advance of receiving the DHS grant funds.  In other cases, the municipal jurisdictions required cash on hand in their  municipal treasuries prior to commencing the procurement process.", "Subsequent to the task force\u2019s recommendations, Congress exempted for  fiscal year 2005 certain DHS first responder grant programs from the  provision of the CMIA that limits the extent to which grantees can hold  federal funds prior to payout by requiring federal agencies and states to  minimize the time elapsing between transfer of funds from Treasury and  payment by the states. In fiscal year 2006, this exemption was made  permanent. Importantly, the CMIA exemption only pertains to the  requirement to minimize the time elapsing between transfer of funds from  Treasury and payments for program purposes. The CMIA exemption did  not exempt certain first responder grant programs from the other  provisions of the CMIA which address interest payments and  accountability.", "To implement the CMIA exemption, DHS\u2019s Program Guidelines and  Application Kit for the Fiscal Year 2005 Homeland Security Grant  Program (HSGP) and guidance for certain other homeland security first  responder grants state that grantees and subgrantees will be permitted to  draw down funds up to 120 days prior to expenditure or disbursement.  For the majority of the grant programs, the guidance requires all federal  funding to go to state grantees prior to being passed through to local  government and other subgrantees, and requires both grantees and  subgrantees to place funds received in an interest-bearing account. The  guidance states that both grantees and subgrantees must pay interest on  funding advances in accordance with federal regulations. In addition,  according to the guidance, state grantees are subject to the interest  requirements of the CMIA and its implementing regulations. The guidance  states that interest under the CMIA will accrue from the time federal funds  are credited to a state account until the time the state pays out the funds  to a subgrantee or otherwise for program purposes.", "In January 2006, DHS\u2019s Preparedness Directorate issued its Financial  Management Guide. The guide is intended to be used as a financial  policy reference for all fiscal year 2006 and future first responder grants.  Consistent with DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2005 guidance for the HSGP and certain  other first responder programs, the guide states that grant recipients may  elect to draw down funds up to 120 days prior to expenditure or  disbursement and that state grantees are subject to the interest  requirements of the CMIA.

Only  one state agency official attributed the delays directly to the CMIA.  According to that official, under the funding technique for the CMIA that  was agreed to between the state and Treasury for fiscal year 2004, the  state was to be reimbursed by the federal government for eligible grant- related expenditures. However, certain smaller subgrantees, such as  volunteer fire departments, did not have the financial resources to  purchase specialized equipment with their own funds and then wait for  reimbursement from the state. The official stated that, contrary to the  agreement with Treasury, the state began advancing federal funds to the  subgrantees to enable them to purchase the equipment.", "Generally, however, the SAA officials were more apt to tie delays in  operations related to first responders to factors other than the CMIA. For  example, officials of six of the SAAs noted that delays in the use of the  funds have been due directly to certain local governments not having the  manpower to deal with the large influx of grant funding that was  experienced in the wake of the terrorist attacks.

The official cited one case where a local  government could not spend first responder funds for a major purchase  until the city council voted and approved the purchase.

Specifically, according to the  report, the need for state, county, municipal, and tribal entities to rapidly  procure and deploy homeland security-related equipment can conflict with  state and municipal buying regulations that encourage a deliberate process  of acquisition of budgeted necessities at the lowest possible price.  Furthermore, many state and local governments lack the purchasing  power to obtain the goods and services in a timely fashion.

As such, these officials stated that DHS intends  to notify OMB that the 120-day cash advance funding provision used to  implement the CMIA exemption applies to all grant programs administered  by DHS\u2019s Office of Grants and Training so that such information can be  included in OMB\u2019s 2007 Compliance Supplement.", "It is important to note that even with comprehensive guidance for  auditors, single audits are at best only a tool for program management  oversight of grant funding. Such audits are not intended to replace  program management\u2019s overall responsibility for establishing and  maintaining internal control to achieve the objectives of effective and  efficient grant operations, reliable grant reporting, and compliance with  applicable laws and regulations. Further, single audits may not always  cover all homeland security first responder grants received by the audited  entity, as only the larger and inherently riskier programs are typically  subject to review as part of the overall audit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cash Advance Funding Can Be Allowed on a Case- by-Case Basis for Certain First Responder Grants", "paragraphs": ["Treasury\u2019s regulations implementing the CMIA are intended to provide  Treasury and states flexibility and latitude in funding grant programs.  Specifically, according to Treasury, the CMIA requires states to time their  drawdown of federal funds in a way that minimizes the time between  receipt of the funds and payments for federal program purposes. For cash  advance funding, this is defined by regulation as not more than 3 business  days prior to the date of disbursement of the funds. However, according to  Treasury officials, if it can be demonstrated that there is a program need  for funds more than 3 days, or even 120 days, in advance of payment, a  funding arrangement that allows for such cash advance funding would not  be inconsistent with the CMIA and its implementing regulations. In other  words, the CMIA does not prohibit such flexibility to be provided on a  program by program, or case-by-case, basis.", "Moreover, cash advance funding arrangements made by a state can be  extended to the state\u2019s subgrantees. Specifically, under the Uniform  Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to  State and Local Governments, grantees must monitor cash drawdowns by  their subgrantees to assure that they conform substantially to the same  standards of timing and amount as apply to advances to the grantees. As  such, cash advance funding arrangements made by the states for specific  programs that have a demonstrated need for cash advance funding in  excess of the 3-day rule, can apply to local government subgrantees on an  as-needed, or case-by-case, basis as determined by the state. Therefore,  under Treasury regulations implementing the CMIA and other applicable  regulations, cash advance funding for homeland security first responder  grants can be allowed on a case-by-case basis independent of the CMIA  exemption and DHS\u2019s 120-day cash advance funding provision."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["We found no substantial evidence that the CMIA funds transfer  requirements, prior to the exemption for certain first responder grants in  fiscal year 2005, prevented first responders from receiving DHS grant  funds when such funds were needed. However, DHS\u2019s current efforts to  monitor state grantees should help to identify problems, if any, associated  with the CMIA and the CMIA exemption, as well as other issues that  impact grant administration and first responders\u2019 ability to receive and use  DHS grant funds when needed. Going forward, these efforts should also  enable DHS to determine the extent to which cash advance funding for  first responder grants will likely be needed. This is important because DHS  lacks the policies and procedures necessary to provide adequate oversight  of cash advance funding, regardless of whether the cash advance funding  is made widely available under the CMIA exemption and DHS\u2019s  corresponding 120-day cash advance funding provision, or on a case-by- case basis as allowed under Treasury regulations implementing the CMIA.  Such oversight is critical to ensure that interest due to the federal  government associated with cash advance funding is accurately recorded  and promptly paid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We make seven recommendations to improve oversight of cash advance  funding and associated interest liabilities for homeland security first  responder grants.
