There is considerable interest regarding how Labor, along with Homeland Security and Justice, is enforcing the requirements of the program. This report describes: (1) how Labor carries out its H-1B program responsibilities; and (2) how Labor works with other agencies involved in the H-1B program. We interviewed officials and analyzed data from all three agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While Labor's H-1B authority is limited in scope, the agency could improve its oversight of employers' compliance with program requirements. Labor's review of employers' applications to hire H-1B workers is timely, but lacks quality assurance controls and may overlook some inaccuracies. From January 2002 through September 2005, Labor electronically reviewed more than 960,000 applications and certified almost all of them. About one-third of the applications were for workers in computer systems analysis and programming occupations. By statute, Labor's review of the applications is limited to searching for missing information or obvious inaccuracies and it does this through automated data checks. However, our analysis of Labor's data found certified applications with inaccurate information that could have been identified by more stringent checks. Although the overall percentage was small, we found 3,229 applications that were certified even though the wage rate on the application was lower than the prevailing wage for that occupation. Additionally, approximately 1,000 certified applications contained erroneous employer identification numbers, which raises questions about the validity of the application. In its enforcement efforts, Labor's Wage and Hour Division (WHD) investigates complaints made against H-1B employers. From fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005, Labor reported an increase in the number of H-1B complaints and violations, and a corresponding increase in the number of employer penalties. In fiscal year 2000 Labor required employers to pay back wages totaling $1.2 million to 226 H-1B workers; by fiscal year 2005, back wage penalties had increased to $5.2 million for 604 workers. Program changes, such as a higher visa cap in some years, could have been a contributing factor. In April 2006, WHD began the process of randomly investigating willful violators of the program's requirements. Labor, Homeland Security, and Justice all have responsibilities under the H-1B program, but Labor and Homeland Security could better address the challenges they face in sharing information. Homeland Security reviews Labor's certified application but cannot easily verify whether employers submitted petitions for more workers than originally requested on the application because USCIS's database cannot match each petition to Labor's application case number. Also, during the process of reviewing petitions, staff may find evidence that employers are not meeting their H-1B obligations. For example, Homeland Security may find that a worker's income on the W-2 is less than the wage quoted on the original application. Homeland Security may deny the petition if an employer is unable to explain the discrepancy, but it does not have a formal process for reporting the discrepancy to Labor. Additionally, current law precludes the Wage and Hour Division from using this information to initiate an investigation of the employer. Labor also shares enforcement responsibilities with Justice, which pursues charges filed by U.S. workers who allege they were displaced by an H-1B worker. From 2000 through 2005, Justice found discriminatory conduct in 6 out of the 97 investigations closed and assessed $7,200 in penalties."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year employers in the United States generally request more highly  skilled foreign workers than are able to come into the country under law.  The H-1B nonimmigrant visa program was established to assist U.S.  employers in temporarily filling certain positions with these workers.  Currently, the number of foreign workers authorized to enter the United  States annually through the H-1B program is 65,000, but in previous years  the cap has been as high as 195,000. The Congress is currently considering  legislation to overhaul U.S. immigration policy, which could have an  impact on the cap in future years.", "To ensure that U.S. workers are not adversely affected by the hiring of   H-1B workers, all employers must attest to meeting certain labor  conditions, such as notifying all employees of the intention to hire H-1B  workers and offering their H-1B workers the same benefits as U.S.  workers. These conditions are designed to protect both the jobs of  domestic workers and the rights and working conditions for foreign  temporary workers. The Departments of Labor (Labor), Homeland  Security (Homeland Security), and Justice (Justice) each have specifically  defined responsibilities during certain stages of the H-1B visa process,  which range from reviewing and approving an employer\u2019s request to hire  an H-1B worker, to investigating complaints from both U.S. and foreign  workers regarding employers\u2019 non-compliance with H-1B program  requirements. The Department of State also has a role in the process,  specifically, to issue the visa. These responsibilities help ensure that  employers comply with the requirements of the program.", "However, there has been considerable interest regarding how Labor, in  conjunction with the other agencies, is ensuring that employers comply  with the requirements of the H-1B program.

The H-1B visa  category was created to enable U.S. employers to hire temporary workers  as needed in specialty occupations, or those that require theoretical and  practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge. It also  requires a bachelor\u2019s or higher degree (or its equivalent) in the specific  occupation as a minimum requirement for entry into the occupation in the  United States. The Immigration Act of 1990 capped the number of H-1B  visas at 65,000 per fiscal year.", "Since the creation of the H-1B program, the number of H-1B visas  permitted each fiscal year has changed several times. Congress passed the  American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998  (ACWIA), which increased the limit to 115,000 for fiscal years 1999 and  2000. In 2000, Congress passed the American Competitiveness in the  Twenty-First Century Act, which raised the limit to 195,000 for fiscal year  2001 and maintained that level through fiscal years 2002 and 2003. The  number of H-1B visas reverted back to 65,000 thereafter. An H-1B visa  generally is valid for 3 years of employment and is renewable for an  additional 3 years.", "Filing an application with Labor\u2019s Employment and Training  Administration is the employer\u2019s first step in hiring an H-1B worker, and  Labor is responsible for either certifying or denying the employer\u2019s  application within 7 days (see app. II for the Labor Condition Application).  By law, it may only review applications for omissions and obvious  inaccuracies. Labor has no authority to verify the authenticity of the  information. Employers must include on the application information such  as their name, address, rate of pay and work location for the H-1B worker,  and employer identification number. All employers are also required to  make four attestations on the application as to:  1.  Wages:  The employer will pay nonimmigrants at least the local  prevailing wage or the employer\u2019s actual wage, whichever is  higher, and pay for nonproductive time caused by a decision made  by the employer; and offer nonimmigrants benefits on the same  basis as U.S. workers.  2.  Working conditions:  The employment of H-1B nonimmigrants will  not adversely affect the working conditions of U.S. workers  similarly employed.   3.  Strike, lockout, or work stoppage:  No strike or lockout exists in  the occupational classification at the place of employment.   4.  Notification: The employer has notified employees at the place of  employment of the intent to employ H-1B workers.", "Certain employers are required to make three additional attestations on  their application. These additional attestations apply to H-1B employers  who: (1) are H-1B dependent, that is, generally those whose workforce is  comprised of 15 percent or more H-1B nonimmigrant employees; or   (2) are found by Labor to have committed either a willful failure to meet  H-1B program requirements or misrepresented a material fact in an  application during the previous 5 years. These employers are required to  additionally attest that: (1) they did not displace a U.S. worker within the  period of 90 days before and 90 days after filing a petition for an H-1B  worker; (2) they took good faith steps prior to filing the H-1B application  to recruit U.S. workers and that they offered the job to a U.S. applicant  who was equally or better qualified than an H-1B worker; and (3) prior to  placing the H-1B worker with another employer, they inquired and have no  knowledge as to that employer\u2019s action or intent to displace a U.S. worker  within the 90 days before and 90 days after the placement of the H-1B  worker with that employer.", "After Labor certifies an application, the employer must submit to USCIS an  H-1B petition for each worker it wishes to hire (see App. III for the H-1B  petition and supplement).  On March 1, 2003, Homeland Security took over  all functions and authorities of Justice\u2019s Immigration and Naturalization  Service under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and the Homeland  Security Reorganization Plan of November 25, 2002. Employers submit to  Homeland Security the application, petition, and supporting  documentation along with the appropriate fees. When Congress passed  ACWIA in 1998, it imposed a filing fee of $500 on H-1B petitions. In 2000,  Congress passed legislation to increase the amount of filing fees to   $1,000 then increased the amount again to $1,500 in 2004. Along with a  $1,500 filing fee, an employer must also submit a $500 fraud prevention  and detection fee to Homeland Security. Information on the petition must  indicate the wages that will be paid to the H-1B worker, the location of the  position and the worker\u2019s qualifications. Through a process known as  adjudication, Homeland Security reviews the documents for certain  criteria, such as whether the petition is accompanied by a certified  application from Labor, whether the employer is eligible to employ an   H-1B worker, whether the position is a specialty occupation, and whether  the prospective H-1B worker is qualified for the position.", "The Wage and Hour Division of Labor\u2019s Employment Standards  Administration performs investigative and enforcement functions to  determine whether an employer has complied with its attestations on the  application. An aggrieved individual or entity or certain non-aggrieved  parties may file a complaint with Labor that an employer violated a  requirement of the H-1B program. To conduct an investigation, the  Administrator must have reasonable cause to believe that an employer did  not comply with or misrepresented information on its application.  Employers who violate any of the attestations on the application may be  subject to civil money penalties or administrative remedy, such as paying  back wages to H-1B workers or debarment, which disqualifies an employer  from participating in the H-1B program for a specified period of time.  Employers, the person who filed the complaint, or other interested parties  who disagree with the findings of the investigation then have 15 days to  appeal by requesting an administrative hearing.", "The Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment  Practices (OSC) of the Department of Justice also has some enforcement  responsibility. Under statutory authority created by the Immigration  Reform and Control Act of 1986, OSC pursues charges of citizenship  discrimination brought by U.S. workers who allege that an employer  preferred to hire an H-1B worker.", "Figure 1 gives an overview of the H-1B visa process.

Labor  increased the percentage of applications reviewed within the required  seven days from 56 percent in fiscal year 2001 to 100 percent in fiscal year  2005. As of January 2006, all applications must be submitted electronically  and Labor\u2019s website informs employers that it will certify or deny  applications within minutes based on the information entered. Our  analysis of Labor\u2019s data found that of the 960,563 applications that Labor  electronically reviewed from January 2002 through September 2005,   99.5 percent were certified, as shown in table 1. Not all applications  continue through the process and result in H-1B visas\u2014employers can  withdraw their applications, petitions can be denied, or the visa may not  be issued. Therefore, Labor officials told us the number of applications  submitted represents employers\u2019 interest in the H-1B program rather than  the actual number of H-1B visas that are issued.", "In addition to agreeing to certain attestations on the application,  employers must provide information about themselves, such as address  and employer identification number, as well as information about each  position they are seeking to fill, the time period they will need the worker,  the prevailing wage and location for the position, the wage the worker will  be paid, and the number of workers they want to hire. On the applications  submitted electronically from January 2002 through September 2005,  approximately 90 percent of employers requested only one worker even  though they are allowed to request multiple workers for the same  occupation on an application. Approximately one-third of the applications  were for workers in computer system analysis and programming  occupations, with the next most frequent request, for college and  university education workers, at 7 percent. About 30 percent of the  positions were located in either California or New York. See appendix IV  for more information on H-1B workers.", "Labor\u2019s review of the application is limited by law to identifying omissions  or obvious inaccuracies. Labor will not certify an application if the  employer has failed to check all the necessary boxes or not filled in  required information such as wage rate, prevailing wage or period of  intended employment. Labor\u2019s system will also deny an application if it  contains obvious inaccuracies. In addition to checks to ensure that data  fields have the correct number of digits or are numerical when required,  Labor has defined obvious inaccuracies as when an employer:  files an application after being debarred, or disqualified, from  participating in the H-1B program;    submits an application more than 6 months before the beginning date  of the period of employment;  identifies multiple occupations on a single application;    states a wage rate that is below the Fair Labor Standards Act minimum  wage;  identifies a wage rate that is below the prevailing wage on the  application; and  identifies a wage range where the bottom of the range is lower than the  prevailing wage on the application.", "Despite these checks, Labor\u2019s system does not consistently identify all  obvious inaccuracies. For example, although the overall percentage was  small, we found 3,229 applications that were certified even though the  wage rate on the application was lower than the prevailing wage for that  occupation in the specific location. Table 2 shows the wage rates and  corresponding prevailing wages from a sample of applications Labor  incorrectly certified because the wage rate was not equal to or greater  than the prevailing wage.", "Additionally, Labor does not identify other errors that may be obvious.  Specifically, Labor told us its system reviews an application\u2019s employer  identification number to ensure it has the correct number of digits and  that the number does not appear on the list of employers who are  ineligible to participate in the H-1B program. However, our analysis of  Labor\u2019s data found that Labor\u2019s review may not identify numbers that are  erroneous. For example, we found 993 certified applications with invalid  employer identification number prefixes. While an invalid employer  identification number could indicate a fraudulent application, Labor does  not consider it an obvious inaccuracy. Officials told us that in other  programs, such as the permanent employment program, Labor matches  the application\u2019s employer identification number to a database with valid  employer identification numbers; however, they do not formally do this  with H-1B applications because it is an attestation process, not a  verification process.", "According to Labor, most of the process of reviewing applications is  automated\u2014the primary reason an analyst will review an application is if  the employer\u2019s prevailing wage source is not recognized by Labor\u2019s  database. The analyst reviews the source of the prevailing wage provided  by the employer just to ensure the source meets Labor\u2019s criteria, not to  verify that the prevailing wage is correct. The employer may obtain a  prevailing wage from a state workforce agency, a collective bargaining  agreement, or another source, such as a private employment survey. If the  employer uses a private employment survey and the analyst finds the  survey meets Labor\u2019s criteria\u2014such as having been conducted in the last   2 years and using a statistically valid methodology to collect the data\u2014the  survey will be added to Labor\u2019s database and used to approve future  applications. Officials also told us that analysts review from three to five  applications per day. In an effort to promote consistency in prevailing  wage determinations, Labor has issued guidance for its state workforce  agencies as well as for employers using surveys. Labor officials told us  they always advise employers to obtain prevailing wage rates from the  state workforce agency, but they also said that because the application is  an attestation process, employers are responsible for doing the required  analysis to determine the prevailing wage and maintaining the proper  documentation to support the prevailing wage provided on the application.", "We and others have previously reported that Labor\u2019s review of the labor  condition application is limited and provides little assurance that  employers are fulfilling their H-1B responsibilities. In 2000, given Labor\u2019s  limited review of the application, we suggested Congress consider  streamlining the H-1B approval process by requiring employers to submit  the application directly to the Immigration and Naturalization Service,  now the USCIS. Similarly, in 2003, Labor\u2019s Inspector General reported  that either Labor should have authority to verify the accuracy of the  application information or employers should file their applications directly  to USCIS. While Labor officials told us they frequently review the  application process to determine where improvements can be made, they  rely on a system of data checks rather than a formal quality assurance  process because of the factual nature of the form and the number of  applications received. Additionally, they said if they conducted a more in- depth review of the applications, they could overreach their legal authority  and increase the processing time for applications. Officials also said the  integrity of the H-1B program is ensured through enforcement and by the  fact that there is actual review by staff when the employer submits the  paperwork to USCIS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Investigates Complaints and Has Begun the Process of Randomly Investigating Previous Violators", "paragraphs": ["Labor enforces H-1B program requirements primarily by investigating  complaints filed against employers. H-1B workers or certain others with  knowledge of an employer\u2019s practices who believe an employer has  violated program requirements can file a complaint with Labor\u2019s Wage and  Hour Division, which received 1,026 complaints from fiscal year 2000  through fiscal year 2005.

Labor also interviews the employer and workers, checks its  violations database to determine if the employer has any previous  violations, and assesses the employer\u2019s compliance with all H-1B program  requirements. As a result, an investigation may result in more than one  violation. Once the investigation is complete, Labor told us it meets with  the employer to explain the findings and follows up with a letter to the  employer listing violations and penalties, such as payment of back wages  due to H-1B workers who were not paid the required wage, civil money  penalties, debarment, or other administrative remedies (see table 3).", "While the number of H-1B complaints and violations has increased from  fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005, the overall numbers remain small  and may have been affected by changes to the program.

The number of cases  with violations more than doubled over the same period. The most  common violation was not paying H-1B workers the required wage. With  the increase in violations, the amount of penalties also increased. In fiscal  year 2000, 226 H-1B workers were found to be due back wages of   $1.2 million, by fiscal year 2005 the number had increased to 604 workers  with back wages due of $5.2 million. In addition to the payment of back  wages, employers were required to pay civil money penalties of more than  $400,000 over the same period.", "From fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2005, Labor requested over   50 debarment periods from Homeland Security for employers that  committed certain violations\u2014for example, willfully failing to pay an   H-1B worker the required wage\u2014that resulted in their being disqualified  from participating in the H-1B program for a specified period of time.  Labor officials told us it is difficult to attribute changes in complaints and  violations to any specific cause because of multiple legislative changes to  the program, such as the temporary increase in the number of H-1B  workers allowed to enter the country and the additional attestations for  certain employers that expired and then were reinstated.", "In addition to investigating complaints, Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour Division  has recently begun randomly investigating employers who have willfully  violated the program\u2019s requirements. Labor has had the statutory authority  to conduct random investigations of these employers since 1998. Under  this authority, Labor can subject employers on a case-by-case basis to  random investigations up to 5 years from the date the employer first  willfully violated the requirements of the H-1B program or willfully  misrepresented a material fact in the labor condition application. Officials  told us that the WHD did not schedule random H-1B investigations of  willful violators until recently because, by definition, such employers are  debarred from employing H-1B workers for a fixed number of years (they  often go out of business due to the debarment), the number of such  employers is very small (the total didn\u2019t reach 50 nationwide until late in  fiscal year 2005) and trained H-1B investigators have heavy case loads.  However, Labor said that it will initiate random investigations nationwide  in fiscal year 2006. Labor has an existing database that it plans to use for  targeting employers for investigations. The database contains information  about employers who have previously violated their obligations under the  H-1B program, including the types of violations and the penalties that were  assessed. Although cases with willful violations represent a small number  of all cases with violations, they have increased from 8 percent in fiscal  year 2000 to 14 percent in fiscal year 2005. (See fig. 3) Officials said that  they now have 59 cases on which they can follow-up to determine if the  employer has committed another violation. Labor said that, in addition to  initiating random investigations of willful violators nationwide, it will set  up a system to track the data in its database and train its employees in  fiscal year 2006.

Labor can certify applications for  multiple workers and, therefore, employers can use one application in  support of more than one petition. However, USCIS\u2019 data system, CLAIMS  3, does not match each petition to its corresponding application because  the system does not include a field for the unique number Labor assigns  each application. As a result, USCIS cannot easily verify how many times  the employer has used a given application or which petitions were  supported by which application, potentially allowing employers to use the  application for more workers than they were certified to hire. USCIS staff  told us that when employers do not provide the names of the other H-1B  workers approved using the same certified application, the adjudicator  may request it from the employer.  USCIS staff also told us that a letter is  sent to the employer requesting the information and the employer has  approximately 12 weeks to respond. Consequently, a request for  information requires staff time and slows down the adjudication process.  While USCIS told us it has attempted to add Labor\u2019s application case  number to its database, it has not been able to because of the system\u2019s  memory limitations. USCIS told us it is currently transforming its  information technology system; however, it will be several years before  the new system is operational.", "During the process of reviewing employers\u2019 petitions, USCIS may find  evidence the employer is not meeting the requirements of the   H-1B program, but current law precludes the Wage and Hour Division  from using this information to initiate an investigation of the employer.  For example, to extend an H-1B worker\u2019s stay in the United States, an  employer may submit a petition with the worker\u2019s W-2 form as  supporting documentation. USCIS staff told us they have reviewed  petitions where the wage on the W-2 form was less than the wage the  employer indicated it would pay on the original Labor application. In these  cases, USCIS asks the employer to explain the wage discrepancy. If the  employer has a legitimate explanation and documentation\u2014for example  the worker was on some type of extended leave\u2014the petition may be  approved. However, if the employer is unable to adequately explain the  discrepancy, USCIS said it may deny the petition but generally does not  report these employers to Labor for investigation. USCIS does not have a  formal process for reporting the discrepancy to Labor. According to officials  from Labor, it does not consider Homeland Security to be an aggrieved  party; therefore, Labor would not initiate an investigation based on  information received from, or a complaint filed by, Homeland Security.", "Labor and Homeland Security also coordinate when employers have  committed violations resulting in debarment. After Labor\u2019s Wage and Hour  Division determines that an employer has committed a debarrable  offense\u2014such as willfully not paying an H-1B worker the required wage\u2014 Labor notifies USCIS, which in turn provides dates for the period of time  that it will automatically deny petitions from the employer. Labor\u2019s Wage  and Hour Division then sends a letter informing the employer that it is  ineligible to sponsor workers for the H-1B program for that period of time.  A copy of the letter is sent to Labor\u2019s Employment and Training  Administration so that it will not certify any applications from the  employer for the same period.", "Both Labor and USCIS officials said they are working to improve  communication between the two agencies.

These data included all the applications filed electronically from  January 2002 through September 2005. We analyzed the data from a total  of 960,563 applications to determine (1) the number that had been  certified or denied, (2) the employers who requested the most workers,   (3) the most frequently requested occupation codes, (4) the locations of  the H-1B positions, (5) the source of the prevailing wage used by  employers, and (6) how many applications were certified with invalid  employer identification number prefixes when compared with a list of  valid prefix codes obtained from the Internal Revenue Service. We also  analyzed how prevailing wages compared to actual wage rates. The H-1B  Visa Reform Act, which was passed on December 8, 2004, requires  employers to pay H-1B workers at least 100 percent of the prevailing wage  for each specific occupation and location. Prior to the enactment of this  law, Labor\u2019s regulations permitted employers to pay actual wages that  were only 95 percent of the prevailing wage. Accordingly, to ensure we did  not incorrectly identify any applications as erroneously certified during  the time between the passage of the H-1B Visa Reform Act and Labor\u2019s  implementation of the new 100 percent requirement, our analysis only  identified those cases where the actual wage rate was less than 95 percent  of the prevailing wage.", "Additionally, we interviewed officials from ETA regarding the application  approval process, including the circumstances under which applications  are reviewed by an analyst for discrepancies, how prevailing wage sources  are determined to be legitimate, and the ETA resources that are used to  process and review applications. Additionally, we accessed the application  online system to determine when the employer would receive error  notices when filling out the application.

From fiscal  years 2000 through 2005, we analyzed the number of H-1B complaints,  violations, and the penalties assessed including the number of employees  due back wages, the amount of back wages due, civil money penalties, the  most common violation, and the trend in the number of willful violations  as a percentage of all violations. We also interviewed WHD officials on the  complaint and investigation process, the appeal process, educational  outreach to improve employer compliance, and the WHD resources used  to process and investigate complaints.
