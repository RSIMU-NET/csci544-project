The Family Support Act of 1988 requires states to obtain HHS certification that their child support enforcement systems meet federal requirements. All states were to obtain this certification by October 1, 1997, or face the possibility of substantial financial penalties for noncompliance after the deadline."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Child Support Enforcement Program was established in 1975 to help strengthen families and reduce dependence on welfare by helping to ensure that the responsibility for supporting children was placed on parents. The states operate programs to locate noncustodial parents, establish paternity, and obtain support orders, along with enforcing actual collections of those court-ordered support payments. The federal government\u2014through OCSE\u2014funds 66 percent of state administrative and operating costs, including costs for automated systems, and up to 90 percent of expenses associated with planning, designing, developing, installing, and/or enhancing automated systems.", "The Family Support Act of 1988 required that statewide systems be developed to track determination of paternity and child support collections. To address that requirement, OCSE developed regulations and guidance for conducting certification reviews. In 1993, OCSE published a certification guide, which addresses the functional requirements for child support enforcement systems. In general, the certification guide requires that the systems be operational, statewide, comprehensive, and effective and efficient. The guide also provides 53 specific requirements, which are grouped into the following categories: case initiation, location of parents, establishment of paternity, case management, enforcement, financial management, reporting, and security and privacy. (See appendix I for the system regulations and appendix II for descriptions of the guide\u2019s specific requirements by category.) The guide was developed to help OCSE\u2019s analysts ensure that certification reviews are conducted consistently\u2014using the same criteria and standards for documentation. The analysts use the certification guide in conducting certification reviews, and states refer to it in preparing for their certification reviews.", "To ensure that states are meeting the functional requirements specified in the certification guide, OCSE also developed a certification questionnaire.The questionnaire provides a series of questions for analysts\u2019 use in determining if the states\u2019 systems address the functional requirements. The format and content of the questionnaire mirror those of the certification guide. In addition to the certification guide and questionnaire, OCSE has provided supplementary guidance to (1) aid in developing and testing specific areas such as financial requirements and (2) clarify and expand upon the requirements provided in the certification guide and questionnaire.", "OCSE uses its guidance to ensure that its staff consistently perform three types of certification reviews: functional, level 1, and level 2. A functional review occurs early in the development of a system before it is operational in a pilot site. During functional reviews, analysts evaluate parts of the system against the certification requirements to inform the state of the work that remains before its system can be certified. A level 1 review occurs when an automated system is installed and in operation in one or more pilot locations. (OCSE created this level of review in 1990 due to state requests for agency guidance prior to statewide implementation.) A level 2 review occurs when the system is considered by the state to be operational statewide. This review is required for final certification. Systems are granted full certification when they meet all functional requirements and conditional certification when the system needs only minor corrections that do not affect statewide operation. According to OCSE analysts, states whose systems receive either type of level 2 certification are exempt from penalties for failing to meet system requirements imposed by the Family Support Act.", "The Family Support Act of 1988 set a deadline of October 1, 1995, for implementation and federal certification of such systems. However, when only a few states met the deadline, the Congress passed legislation extending it by 2 years, to October 1, 1997. Current law requires HHS to impose substantial financial penalties on states that did not have certified child support enforcement systems by October 1, 1997. The Congress, under the House bill HR 3130 with Senate modifications SP 2286, is considering legislation to reduce those penalties. OCSE certified 17 states by the extended deadline and another 8 states since the deadline (as of March 31, 1998).", "In June 1997 we made several recommendations designed to strengthen OCSE\u2019s oversight of child support enforcement systems. Specifically, we reported that the certification reviews are conducted too late for effective oversight. Because the reviews are conducted toward the end of the system development projects, the reviews come too late for timely redirection of systems development without significant costs being incurred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to determine (1) whether HHS\u2019 certification guidance addresses the system provisions in the Family Support Act of 1988 and implementing regulations, (2) whether HHS has consistently administered the certification process, and (3) the certification status of the state systems. Our work was done to determine whether OCSE\u2019s certification guidance completely addresses the system requirements in the act and supporting regulations; it does not determine the overall adequacy of OCSE\u2019s certification review process. This issue was addressed in our June 1997 report, in which we identified weaknesses in HHS\u2019 oversight of these systems, including the timeliness of the certification reviews.", "To document the certification process, we obtained and analyzed OCSE\u2019s guidance for certifying child support enforcement systems. To determine whether this guidance addresses the legal and regulatory requirements for child support enforcement systems, we compared the certification guide and questionnaire to the child support enforcement system regulations. We also analyzed whether the regulations addressed the system provisions of the Family Support Act of 1988.", "To determine whether OCSE consistently administered the certification process, we obtained and reviewed all certification reports issued as of March 31, 1998, and assessed how OCSE officials at headquarters and in one regional office plan, administer, and report the results of certification reviews. While we discussed this review process with these officials, we did not visit states to observe OCSE conducting certification reviews or conduct independent work to verify the information presented in OCSE\u2019s certification reports.", "We performed our work at HHS headquarters in Washington, D.C., and at the HHS regional office in Atlanta, Georgia. We conducted our work between December 1997 and April 1998, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "HHS provided written comments on a draft of this report. These comments are highlighted in the \u201cAgency Comments\u201d section of this report and are reprinted in appendix IV."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCSE Certification Guidance Addresses Law and Implementing Regulations", "paragraphs": ["OCSE\u2019s guidance for certification reviews generally complies with the system provisions in the Family Support Act of 1988 and the implementing regulations established by the Secretary of HHS. This guidance includes: (1) the certification guide, which defines systems functional requirements and (2) the certification questionnaire, which in essence, is the certification guide presented in a questionnaire format.", "Our analysis showed that the certification guide and questionnaire address key system elements of the law and implementing regulations. OCSE included references to system and program regulations in both the certification guide and questionnaire. We analyzed those references to determine whether the certification guidance addressed the regulations cited. The comparison in appendix III shows that each of the implementing regulations is addressed in OCSE\u2019s certification objectives. For example, section 307.10(b)(1) of the regulation requires that child support enforcement systems maintain identifying information on individuals involved in child support cases. Seven different certification objectives in the certification guidance address this requirement. Two of those certification objectives, A-8 and D-4, demonstrate how the guide addresses this requirement; respectively, they state that, \u201cthe system must accept and maintain identifying information on all case participants,\u201d and \u201cthe system must update and maintain in the automated case record, all information, facts, events, and transactions necessary to describe a case and all actions taken in a case.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consistent Administration of Certification Reviews", "paragraphs": ["OCSE has been consistent in the way it administers certification reviews. Specifically, it used the same types of teams, the same guidance that was discussed earlier, and the same method for certification reviews. Although the scope and length of functional, level 1, and level 2 certification reviews varied, OCSE has been generally consistent in the way that it conducted each type of review.", "OCSE\u2019s review process is as follows. It begins preparing for a certification review when the state notifies it that the state system is compliant and ready for certification. When OCSE receives the request, it requires the state to submit consistent documentation, which includes the completed certification questionnaire. After OCSE receives the documentation, it assigns a team to review the information and develop issues for discussion during the certification review. These teams consistently included at least one supervisor and two systems analysts. In some cases, regional analysts also participated in the documentation review.", "Following that review, certification teams are formed from staff who have similar background and expertise. For example, the certification team leaders are usually systems analysts from OCSE headquarters. These leaders are assisted by teams from the Administration for Children and Families regional offices responsible for the states being reviewed. The regional teams are usually a combination of staff with systems, policy, or audit expertise.", "In performing the certification reviews, these teams consistently use the certification questionnaire. OCSE used the same certification questionnaire for all of its level 1 and level 2 certification reviews except one. The first level 1 review was conducted before OCSE developed the certification questionnaire.", "OCSE analysts have also used a consistent method for conducting certification reviews. Certification review teams spend approximately 1 week on-site conducting certification reviews. (Because functional reviews and level 1 reviews are more limited in scope, those reviews do not always take a full week.) During the certification review, the review team usually holds an entrance conference at the state office and allows the state staff to provide an overview of the child support enforcement system. The next few days are spent reviewing the state\u2019s responses to the certification questionnaire and observing how adequately system screens and functions address the federal requirements. This review at the state office is often performed using a test version of the system\u2014one that does not include actual cases. To supplement the information obtained at the state office, the certification team usually spends at least one day visiting local offices to observe the system in operation. At the local offices, the team interviews staff about their use of the system and the systems training they have received. In addition, they have the staff process sample cases to ensure that the system will handle them correctly, observe the staff processing actual cases, and review reports and documents generated by the system.", "OCSE uses the certification guide and questionnaire in lieu of a manual to instruct its staff on how to conduct certification reviews and relies heavily upon on-the-job training to ensure that the reviews continue to be conducted consistently. In one instance when a new certification staff member was added, that person was paired with experienced staff for the first two or three reviews after joining the review team, to gain experience and learn how to consistently cover the issues addressed by the certification teams."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inconsistent Reporting on Certification Reviews", "paragraphs": ["OCSE began reporting on the results of its certification reviews in 1994. In general, the format and process for preparing certification reports has been standardized. However, we noted that several reports contained inconsistencies, such as including inaccurate descriptions of the criteria against which the systems\u2019 financial components were measured.", "OCSE\u2019s analysts used a standard template for preparing certification reports. As a result, we found the certification reports to be very similar in format and content. Even though the scope of the different reviews varied, the reports for functional, level 1, and level 2 reviews addressed similar topics. For example, they typically included a background section giving the history of the development of and funding for the system and describing the scope and methodology of the certification review. The reports also presented both certification findings and management findings. Certification findings are those system problems that must be addressed prior to system certification. Management findings are optional systems changes for management to consider. These findings often relate to the efficiency of the states\u2019 systems.", "OCSE used a consistent process for reviewing the draft certification reports. According to an OCSE supervisor, division management reviewed all certification reports for consistency prior to their issuance. In addition, the office requested comments from states before publishing the final reports. According to OCSE officials, the nature, extent, and timeliness of the states\u2019 comments varied and, when appropriate, states\u2019 comments were incorporated into the final certification reports.", "While OCSE published many standardized certification reports on the results of its certification reviews, we noted three types of exceptions with the reporting process. First, OCSE certified two state systems in July and December 1997, respectively, by sending a brief letter to each state instead of issuing a complete standardized written report. The division director explained that standardized reports were not prepared for those systems because the certification team found no problems with them during the review. Second, according to officials, a report was not published for one state\u2019s level 1 review because the level 2 review was requested before the earlier report was published.", "Finally, the reports for one level 1 and five functional reviews contained a qualifying statement not contained in the boilerplate language of the standardized reports. This qualifying statement said that, in order to even be conditionally certified, a system must process the financial component of all sample cases correctly, in accordance with predetermined results. In contrast, the other standardized reports\u2019 paragraph on this subject did not contain this qualification.", "The division director told us that the boilerplate language in the standardized reports was appropriate and that the qualifying language in the six reports was incorrect. She said OCSE will conditionally certify a system even though it does not process all sample cases correctly, as long as the majority of the financial transactions are processed accurately and the state has reasonable explanations for any variances. She added that none of the systems was denied level 2 certification based on the qualifying statement, and that she was unaware of any other systems that were denied certification for failing to process all test cases correctly. The division director also noted that the problem was not widespread because only one lead analyst was responsible for the incorrect language. However, the review process did not prevent the incorrect language from being incorporated into the six published reports. Finally, she said that, until we brought this issue to her attention, she was not aware that any reports included this language; and that she would act to ensure that such qualifying language did not appear in future reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Status: Many Systems Not Certified, More Reviews Scheduled", "paragraphs": ["As of March 31, 1998, OCSE had either certified or conditionally certified 25 of 54 child support enforcement systems, representing approximately 38 percent of the reported average national caseload for fiscal year 1995.
