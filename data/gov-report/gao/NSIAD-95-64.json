The items managed by DLA and service item managers are stored at depots operated and managed by DLA. Depot managers have no authority over what items are stored or whether they should be disposed of. These decisions are made by the item managers.", "The current DLA distribution depot system consists of two distribution region headquarters. They are located at New Cumberland, Pennsylvania, and Stockton, California. Each of the 27 distribution depots report to one of these regions. For fiscal year 1994, total DOD distribution costs amounted to about $1.5 billion. Figure 1 shows the locations of these depots.", "When inventory is managed efficiently, enough is stored to meet wartime and peacetime requirements and unnecessary storage costs are avoided. When the total on-hand and due-in inventory falls to or below a certain level\u2014called the reorder point\u2014inventory control points place an order for additional inventory. The reorder point includes items needed to satisfy war reserve requirements and items to be issued during the lead time (the time between when an order is placed and when it is received).", "In addition, a safety level of inventory is kept on hand in case of minor interruptions in the resupply process or unpredictable fluctuations in demand. By placing orders when the reorder point is reached, item managers ensure that inventory arrives before stock runs out.

For purchase decisions, some inventory control points use a percentage of the item\u2019s value, which can be as high as 18 to 22 percent of the value. However, DOD believes that the holding costs for items already on hand is considerably less than the 18 to 22 percent. As discussed later, DOD has an effort underway to benchmark its holding costs with private industry (see p. 17).", "The concern about unnecessary secondary inventory storage is not new.

DLA officials told us that a number of contributing factors, including Base Closure and Realignment Commission actions and its own efforts, have resulted in storage facilities being vacated and substantial reductions in storage requirements during the past 2 fiscal years. DLA projects that DOD\u2019s secondary inventory will be reduced to approximately $54 billion by 2001 and that its total requirement for covered space will be reduced to approximately 400 million cubic feet.

We believe this is a logical starting point and our report points out that we are not suggesting that DOD dispose of all stock that exceeds that level. Rather, we point out that DOD should focus its reduction efforts on stock that occupies a great deal of space and has more than 20 years of supply on hand. DOD expressed concern that the implication of using our criteria would be that this material should be disposed of and the related warehouse space eliminated. It also points out that our criteria are used for ordering stock, not for making decisions concerning whether to retain it. However, in its 1993 material management regulation, DOD used this same criteria as the maximum quantity of material to be maintained on hand or on order to sustain current operations and core war reserves. DOD stated that in hindsight it would not order much of the stock it has on hand, but wants to be careful not to dispose of any stock that might be needed in the future.", "DOD stated that it might already have disposed of much of the material we discuss in our report. We acknowledge that some of this material might have been disposed of while our review was on going. However, we do not believe that DOD had the opportunity to dispose of most of this material. We obtained the computerized records on which we based our analysis from DLA and the services as they were available. The tapes for DLA, for example, were not obtained until August 1994, and therefore, DLA would have had limited opportunity to dispose of DLA material we identified.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that DOD develop a systematic approach for reducing inventories. DOD emphasized that it already has in place a systematic approach to reducing inventory and is tracking its progress toward meeting established goals. DOD agreed that the number of storage locations should be reduced, but stated that the depot system is already being downsized. DOD indicated that its requirement for covered storage space had been reduced more than 180 million cubic feet, or 28 percent, between September 1992 and September 1994.", "In the draft of this report submitted to DOD for comment, we included a recommendation for the Secretary to consider the significant amount of inventory that exceeds current requirements when determining the number of depots to close or consolidate in the 1995 base closure and realignment process. Since the Secretary\u2019s recommendations to close and realign bases have been made, we deleted this recommendation from our final report.

The points raised in DOD\u2019s transmittal letter are addressed in the section of this report entitled agency comments and our evaluation. 2. By using the criteria we selected for assessing DOD\u2019s use of warehouse space, we do not believe that all the material we identified as exceeding current war reserve and operating requirements needs to be disposed of. As we stated in our report, many of these items may have potential future use and should be retained. 3. We agree that a certain amount of uncertainty is associated with projecting spare parts usage. DOD has insurance items to account for the fact that accidents, abnormal equipment or system failures, or other unexpected demands occur. The requirements for these items are included in operating stocks that we excluded from our analyses. 4. We believe that DOD\u2019s comment supports our position. Even after disposing of excess stock, the supply system was able to satisfy customer demand. 5. DOD commented that during hostilities, items (particularly insurance items) with more than 100 years of supply can very quickly become exhausted. Our analysis considered only items with demand. Insurance items, because they had no demand, were excluded. With respect to the noninsurance items with more than 100 years of supply, it is unlikely that all the quantities will be used. We agree, however, that DOD should focus not only on the number of years of supply on hand, but also on the space that the items occupy. 6. DOD commented that the Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s (DLA) inventory managers are authorized to dispose of stocks transferred to DLA by other services sooner, with approval from the losing service. However, DLA\u2019s item managers informed us that they do not consider disposing of such material for 2 years. 7. We reported in August 1994 that DOD\u2019s reported inventory values decreased by $31.9 billion between fiscal years 1989 and 1993, from $109.4 billion to $77.5 billion. However, because of accounting changes, the values were not comparable. When the inventory was valued on a comparable basis, we estimated that the total reduction was $11.2 billion, not $31.9 billion. We believe that there are further opportunities for inventory reductions with appropriate incentives. 8. We agree with DOD that, to date, the major incentive to reduce inventory has been imposed externally by the Congress in the form of budget reductions. We believe that internal incentives, such as DOD\u2019s future plan to charge organizations that cause inventory to be stored for storage costs, should be effective in reducing unneeded inventory. 9. We believe that DOD is capable of further inventory reductions. The statement that inventory disposals have been insufficient to offset increases in material returns is from DOD officials. Since DOD took exception with the statement, we removed it from the report. 10. DOD stated that it holds inventory that will likely never be used. In view of the number of items with more than 20 years of supply, we believe that it is unlikely that much of this inventory would have to be repurchased if DOD systematically reviewed and disposed of material for which it forecasted no need."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We visited the following sites to review policies, procedures, and documents related to retaining and disposing of inventory: the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics; the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force headquarters, Washington, D.C.; the Defense Logisics Agency, Alexandria, Virginia.", "Inventory commands: the Army Material Command, Alexandria, Virginia; the Naval Supply Systems Command, Washington, D.C.; the Air Force Material Command, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, the Defense Logistics Services Center, Battle Creek, Michigan.", "Inventory control points:", "Army\u2014Tank-Automotive Command, Warren, Michigan;", "Navy\u2014Aviation Supply Office, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the Ships Parts Control Center, Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania;", "Air Force\u2014Ogden Air Logistics Center, Ogden, Utah; Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; San Antonio Air Logistics Center, San Antonio, Texas; and Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Warner Robins, Georgia; and", "DLA\u2014Defense Construction Supply Center, Columbus, Ohio.", "Naval Fleet Industrial Supply Center, Norfolk, Virginia; the Air Logistics Centers at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma; Warner Robins Air Force Base, Georgia; Kelly Air Force Base, Texas; and Hill Air Force Base, Utah; and", "DOD Supply Depot, Columbus, Ohio.", "In conducting our work, we used the same computer files, records, and reports that DOD uses to make stocking decisions for secondary items.
