Of this total, the Office for National Capital Region Coordination (ONCRC) targeted all of the $60.5 million Urban Area Security Initiative funds for projects designed to benefit NCR as a whole. However, there was no coordinated regionwide plan for spending the remaining funds (about $279.5 million). Local jurisdictions determined the spending priorities for these funds and reported using them for emergency communications and personal protective equipment and other purchases. NCR faces several challenges in organizing and implementing efficient and effective regional preparedness programs, including the lack of a coordinated strategic plan for enhancing NCR preparedness, performance standards, and a reliable, central source of data on funds available and the purposes for which they were spent. Without these basic elements, it is difficult to assess first responder capacities, identify first responder funding priorities for NCR, and evaluate the effectiveness of the use of federal funds in enhancing first responder capacities and preparedness in a way that maximizes their effectiveness in improving homeland security."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to testify on the results of our work on the  management of first responder grants in the National Capital Region  (NCR).

We identified 25 emergency  preparedness programs that provided funding to NCR jurisdictions in  fiscal years 2002 and 2003, and we selected 16 of them for detailed review.  These 16 grants were selected to cover a range of programs, including the  largest funding sources; grants provided for general purposes, such as  equipment and training; and grants provided for specific purposes, such as  fire prevention and bioterrorism. We collected and analyzed grant data  from federal, state, and local sources; and reviewed relevant reports,  studies, and guidelines on homeland security and domestic preparedness.", "We conducted our review from June 2003 through February 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Arguably, while each at-risk locality must be provided adequate resources to effectively  fight this war, no single jurisdiction or response discipline can fight it alone.

The national  strategy highlighted the challenge of developing complementary systems  that avoid unintended duplication and increase collaboration and  coordination so that public and private resources are better aligned for  homeland security. The national strategy established a framework for this  approach by identifying critical mission areas with intergovernmental  initiatives in each area. For example, the strategy identified such initiatives  as modifying federal grant requirements and consolidating funding sources  to state and local governments. The strategy further recognized the  importance of assessing the capability of state and local governments,  developing plans, and establishing standards and performance measures  to achieve national preparedness goals. In addition, many aspects of DHS\u2019  success depend on its maintaining and enhancing working relationships  within the intergovernmental system as the department relies on state and  local governments to accomplish its mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ONCRC Responsibilities Include Assessing Capabilities and Advocating for Needed Resources", "paragraphs": ["The creation of DHS was an initial step toward reorganizing the federal  government to respond to some of the intergovernmental challenges  identified in the National Strategy for Homeland Security.

Effectively managing first responder  federal grants funds requires the ability to measure progress and provide  accountability for the use of public funds. A strategic approach to  homeland security includes identifying threats and managing risks,  aligning resources to address them, and assessing progress in preparing  for those threats and risks. As with other major policy areas,  demonstrating the results of homeland security efforts includes developing  and implementing strategies, establishing baselines, developing and  implementing performance goals and data quality standards, collecting  reliable data, analyzing the data, assessing the results, and taking action  based on the results. The purpose of these efforts with regard to first  responder grant funds to be able to answer three basic, but difficult,  questions:    For what types of threats and emergencies should first responders be  prepared?", "What is required\u2014for example, coordination, equipment, training\u2014to be  prepared for these threats and emergencies?", "How do first responders know that they have met their preparedness  goals?", "NCR is an example of the difficulties of answering the second and third  questions in particular."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Standards, Plans, and Data Limit Effective Grant Management to Guide First Responder Spending in NCR", "paragraphs": ["The region faces significant challenges in managing homeland security  dollars. ONCRC and NCR jurisdictions face three interrelated challenges  that limit their ability to jointly manage federal funds in a way that  demonstrates increased first responder capacities and preparedness while  minimizing inefficiency and unnecessary duplication of expenditures.", "First, a lack of preparedness standards for both equipment and  performance means that it is difficult to assess first responder capabilities,  identify gaps in those capabilities, and measure progress in closing those  gaps. As in other areas of the nation generally, NCR does not have a set of  accepted benchmarks (best practices) and performance goals that could  be used to identify desired goals and determine whether first responders  have the ability to respond to threats and emergencies with well-planned,  well-coordinated, and effective efforts that involve police, fire, emergency  medical, public health, and other personnel from multiple jurisdictions.", "Second, a strategic plan for the use of homeland security funds\u2014whether  in NCR or elsewhere\u2014should be based on established goals, priorities,  and measures, and align spending plans with those priorities and goals. At  the time of our review, ONCRC had developed a regional spending plan for  the Urban Area Security Initiative grants, but this plan was not part of a  broader coordinated plan for spending federal grant funds and developing  first responder capacity and preparedness in NCR. The lack of  benchmarks and performance goals may contribute to difficulties in  developing a coordinated region-wide plan for determining how to spend  federal funds and assessing the benefits of that spending.", "Third, there is no established process or means for regularly and reliably  collecting data on (1) the amounts of first responder grants available to  each jurisdiction and (2) the budget plans and criteria used for  determining spending allocations and budget priorities. Reliable data are  needed to establish accountability, analyze gaps, and assess progress  toward meeting established performance goals. Without such data, it is  difficult to verify the results of preparedness assessments and to establish  a baseline that could be used to develop plans to address outstanding  needs. It should be noted that the fragmented nature of the multiple  federal grants available to first responders\u2014some awarded to states, some  to localities, some directly to local first responder agencies\u2014may make it  more difficult to collect and maintain region-wide data on grant funds  received and the use of those funds in NCR."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Guidance, Reliable Data Needed to Assess Remaining Gaps in First Responder Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["Without national standards, guidance on likely threats and scenerios for  which to be prepared, coordinated plans, and reliable data, it is difficult  for us or ONCRC to determine what gaps, if any, remain in the emergency  response capacities and preparedness within NCR.", "Determining the existence of gaps in NCR\u2019s emergency preparedness is  difficult currently because there is little baseline data on the region\u2019s  preparedness, and DHS\u2019s Office for National Capital Region Coordination  does not have information on how NCR localities used federal grant  dollars to enhance their capacities or preparedness. Even if those data  were available, a lack of standards against which to evaluate the data  would also have made it difficult to assess any gaps. The Office for  Domestic Preparedness collected information on regional security risks  and needs for NCR jurisdictions, and ONCRC based funding decisions for  the Urban Area Security Initiative on the results. However, as already  noted, it is not clear how the Urban Area Security Initiative spending plan  links to the actual and planned uses for the other funding sources that  comprised about $279.5 million of the $340 million in federal homeland  security grants to the NCR during fiscal years 2002 and 2003.", "Each jurisdiction provided us with information on their perceived gaps  and specific needs for improving emergency preparedness. However, there  is no consistent method for identifying these gaps among jurisdictions  within NCR. Several jurisdictions told us that they identify remaining gaps  based on requests from emergency responder agencies. Other jurisdictions  said they have established emergency management councils or task forces  to review their preparedness needs and are developing a more strategic  plan for funding those needs.

The region is the home to the federal government,  many national landmarks, and military installations. Coordination within  this region presents the challenge of working with numerous jurisdictions  that vary in size, political organization, and experience with managing  large emergencies.", "According to emergency management officials we contacted, DHS\u2019 Office  for National Capital Region Coordination could play a potentially  important role in assisting them to implement a coordinated, well-planned  effort in using federal resources to improve the region\u2019s preparedness. In  our view, meeting ONCRC\u2019s statutory mandate would fulfill such a key  responsibility.", "We recognize that the Office for National Capital Region Coordination was  created about 15 months ago, and that some start-up time has been  required. To date, however, it appears that ONCRC\u2019s efforts have not  focused on assessing what has been accomplished with funds available  within NCR to date and identifying what needs remain and for what  purposes. ONCRC has concentrated its efforts on developing a  coordinated assessment and plan for the use of Urban Area Security  Initiative funds. Although we believe that those steps are important for  rationalizing and prioritizing the expenditure of homeland security dollars  designated for region-wide use, ONCRC\u2019s efforts generally do not address  expenditures from the majority of the homeland security grant dollars  received in NCR. In addition, it is difficult for the ONCRC to meet its  statutory responsibilities without an NCR emergency preparedness  baseline, a region-wide plan for prioritizing expenditures and assessing  their benefits, and reliable data on funds that are available and those have  been spent.", "According to DHS, a governance structure was approved in February 2004  that will provide the essential region-wide coordination that is necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["Our report contains several recommendations. To help ensure that  emergency preparedness grants and associated funds are managed in a  way that maximizes their effectiveness, we recommend that the Secretary  of the Department of Homeland Security take the following three actions  to fulfill DHS\u2019s statutory responsibilities in NCR:    Work with NCR jurisdictions to develop a coordinated strategic plan to  establish goals and priorities for enhancing first responder capacities that  can be used to guide the use of federal emergency preparedness funds.", "Monitor the plan\u2019s implementation to ensure that funds are used in a way  that promotes effective expenditures that are not unnecessarily  duplicative.", "Identify and address gaps in emergency preparedness and evaluate the  effectiveness of expenditures in meeting those needs by adapting  standards and preparedness guidelines based on likely scenarios for NCR  and conducting assessments based on them.", "In their comments on a draft of our report, DHS and the Senior Policy  Group generally agreed with our recommendations, but also said that NCR  jurisdictions had worked cooperatively together to identify opportunities  for synergies and lay a foundation for meeting the challenges noted in the  report. The Senior Policy Group noted the challenge and critical  importance of integrating private sector initiatives as part of the broader  effort. DHS and the Senior Policy Group also agreed that there is a need to  continue to improve preparedness by developing more specific and  improved preparedness standards, clearer performance goals, and an  improved method for tracking regional initiatives.

The urgent  nature of the security risk to the National Capital Region requires a  coordinated, well-planned approach to the expenditure of federal first  responder grants. To maximize the positive impact of such federal dollars,  duplication needs to be minimized, available resources used to the  maximum extent possible, and a strategic, region-wide plan based on an  assessment of preparedness gaps developed to guide those expenditures.  Assessments of the current status of emergency preparedness and of any  existing preparedness gaps require the existence and application of  various types of standards. DHS\u2019s Office for National Capital Region  Coordination has a significant, statutorily mandated role in meeting those  requirements. It has made a good first step in developing a region-wide  plan for the use of the Urban Area Initiative Grants.
