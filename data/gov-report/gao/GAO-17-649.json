Companies using FTZs may be warehouse distributors or manufacturers (see figure). A manufacturer, for example, that admits foreign components into the FTZ can pay the duty rate on either the foreign components or the final product, whichever is lower\u2014resulting in reduced or eliminated duty payments. Distributors can also benefit by storing goods in FTZs indefinitely and thereby deferring duty payments until the goods enter U.S. commerce.

Federal internal control standards state that management should obtain relevant data and assess and respond to identified risks associated with achieving agency goals. Without a program-wide assessment of the frequency and significance of problems identified during compliance reviews, risk levels determined, and enforcement actions taken, CBP cannot verify its assertion that the FTZ program is at low risk of noncompliance.

This  benefit provides an incentive to companies to manufacture in the United  States rather than move their manufacturing operations overseas to avoid  paying U.S. duties. Figure 3 shows an example of duty savings for a  dietary supplement product that has a 0 percent duty rate and uses  foreign status components with a 5.2 percent duty rate, representing 50  percent of the final product\u2019s value. As the figure shows, an FTZ operator  importing $1.5 million in capsules each week can save approximately $2  million in duties annually on the final product because it would be subject  to a 0 percent duty.", "Similarly, companies operating FTZs pay no duties on goods exported  from FTZs to other countries, effectively eliminating duty payments on  foreign status goods brought to FTZs either for storage or incorporation  into a manufactured product prior to export. For example, a foreign- headquartered power tool manufacturer may establish an FTZ in the  United States in order to eliminate duty payments on foreign components  in tools that it exports back to its home country.", "Actual business savings from duty reduction or elimination vary and  depend upon the proportion and dutiable value of foreign status  components that the FTZ operator incorporates into production. For  example, representatives of a consumer electronics manufacturer that we  interviewed stated that duty reduction or elimination resulted in the largest  savings associated with FTZ status. The manufacturer reported that it  admitted approximately $189 million in foreign status electronic  components into its FTZ in 2015, and according to company  representatives, these duty rates ranged from 2.5 to 5.8 percent. The  manufacturer paid no duties on these components, however, as they  were either incorporated into a duty-free final product for import into U.S.  commerce or exported duty free. Company officials stated that the cost  savings from duty reduction and elimination enable them to better  compete for U.S. market share. For other FTZ operators, the duty  savings are a less important benefit of their FTZ status. For example,  representatives of a petroleum product manufacturer stated that because  of the low duty rates on crude oil imports, cost savings from duty  reduction amounted to less than $500,000 annually, whereas other  benefits, such as tax savings (discussed below) were more significant to  this manufacturer.

FTZ operators engaged in automobile distribution  that we spoke with, for example, valued the ability to hold vehicles in the  zone for quality inspection and only pay duties on those goods whose  functionality has been verified. Similarly, distributors may also reduce  their exposure to market variability by holding goods in the zone until  seasonally advantageous market opportunities open or retailers liquidate  their current inventory. Further, a zone operator that leases space to  distributors of quota-restricted commodities, such as sugar and tuna,  discussed with us the FTZ benefit of holding onto the stock indefinitely  until import quotas are lifted.", "FTZ operators we met with did not attempt to quantify the associated  savings of indefinite storage and duty deferral. However, as our analysis  of different industries\u2019 capital costs demonstrates, companies with higher  capital costs may benefit more from deferring duty payment. Figure 4  demonstrates the potential cost savings that a company engaged in  distributing four different types of goods may obtain from deferring duty  payments for 1 or more 3-month periods. For companies importing  electronics, for example, cost savings from deferring duty payments for  an 18-month period can amount to approximately 10 percent of the value  of the deferred duty. Because companies using FTZs pay duties when  goods enter U.S. commerce rather than when these goods are admitted  to the FTZ, they are able to reduce costs by an amount equal to the  company\u2019s cost of capital over the period the payment is deferred.", "FTZ operators also can benefit from the ability to file customs entries and  pay associated MPFs for imported goods on a per-week rather than a  per-shipment basis, which can result in a lower amount of fees paid and  potentially reduce the administrative burden. Companies that import  frequently and in high volumes may benefit more from FTZs than those  that do not. For example, an automobile distributor not located in an FTZ  that is importing 10 shipments of vehicles per week and paying the  maximum MPF would make 10 MPF payments of $485 each, totaling  $252,200 per year. With FTZ status, the same distributor could make one  $485 MPF payment per week for a total annual payment of $25,220,  resulting in annual savings of $226,980. In contrast, an FTZ operator that  imports high-value items on an infrequent basis\u2014such as a heavy  machinery manufacturer that we interviewed\u2014would be less likely to see  MPF savings as significant.", "FTZ operators utilizing a U.S. seaport to admit merchandise to the zone  also pay a Harbor Maintenance Fee (HMF) on a quarterly rather than a  per-shipment basis, potentially reducing administrative work for the FTZ  operator. In contrast to the MPF, however, total HMF amounts are not  reduced through FTZ status and remain based upon the value of cargo  admitted to the FTZ in a fiscal quarter.

In  these reviews, CBP examines operators\u2019 records, procedures, and  conditions to assess compliance with laws and regulations, such as by  identifying the risk of fraud, duty evasion, or other violations that could  result from noncompliance (compliance risk). These compliance reviews  are managed at the field office level and conducted by CBP officers at the  ports, who use the agency\u2019s Compliance Review Handbook for Foreign  Trade Zones for guidance. The Compliance Review Handbook includes a  standard checklist of questions meant to identify and assess risks such as  the physical security of the FTZ merchandise and the appropriateness of  systems and procedures for inventory management. CBP assigns a risk  level to individual zone operators based on the results of the compliance  reviews and other risk factors, and the Compliance Review Handbook  directs officers to document the risk level associated with each  compliance review. These assigned risk levels then determine the  frequency of future compliance reviews. CBP guidance states that field  office personnel should conduct compliance reviews of FTZ operators at  a rate that is generally determined by the magnitude of problems found  from previous reviews \u2013 at a minimum, every 2 years when no problems  have been found, and at least twice a year if serious problems have been  found, with exceptions possible at the discretion of the Port Director.", "Enforcement actions taken based on violations found during the  compliance review are also managed at the discretion of the Port  Director. CBP officials said that their goal is to encourage compliance.  According to CBP guidance, when there is reason to believe that minor  problems can be corrected upon simple notification of the zone operator,  the Port Director may issue a verbal warning or warning letter with the  operator with no further penalty. Otherwise, the Port Director has  discretion to take a corrective enforcement action commensurate with the  seriousness of the violation. Enforcement actions can include liquidated  damages, fines, and seizures. Liquidated damages are amounts of  money that CBP assesses against FTZ operators following violations of  the operator\u2019s bond, such as violations involving FTZ inventory control  and recordkeeping systems. In addition to these civil actions, CBP may  also take actions, such as arrests, for violations of criminal law.", "CBP officials conducting compliance reviews may request support from  technical experts within the agency. For example, CBP officials stated  that they may reach out to CBP\u2019s petroleum specialists when they  encounter issues with tracking production at an oil refinery. CBP officials  stated that they may also refer findings from compliance reviews to CBP\u2019s  Regulatory Audit officials for more comprehensive audits that include  thorough reviews of FTZ operators\u2019 inventory and financial records.  Regulatory Audit officials told us that 44 audits have been conducted  involving FTZs over the past 10 years and that 7 of these audits involved  petroleum FTZs. These officials stated that the findings from the FTZ- focused audits typically involved deficiencies with FTZ operators\u2019 internal  controls over their inventory systems.

Instead of centrally  compiling compliance review information, CBP requires Port Directors to  maintain a file for each FTZ operator under their jurisdiction, which stores,  among other things, various documents associated with the compliance  review. CBP field offices that we visited employed varying practices for  storing compliance reviews, from maintaining an updated spreadsheet  containing the risk determination and compliance review documentation  for each FTZ operator to maintaining paper and electronic files without  centrally tracking compliance review results and status.

Because CBP could not provide us with  copies of compliance reviews for all the FTZs in the program in a timely  manner, we examined a generalizable random sample of compliance  reviews during this time period from 174 FTZ operator sites. In  conducting an analysis of this sample, we found that field offices  managed and stored the compliance reviews in paper files at some  locations and electronically at others. In addition, we found that the  compliance review checklists appeared in at least eight different formats.  The compliance review checklist questions were generally consistent, but  the information was recorded in various ways, some with handwritten  notes and others electronically.", "CBP headquarters officials stated that they were aware that some ports  and field offices had developed electronic systems for storing compliance  reviews that would enable more efficient access to the results than paper  files and handwritten notes.

These data show that CBP assessed 1,103  liquidated damages claims in FTZs from FY2006 through FY2015. The  causes of these liquidated damages, however, were difficult to determine  because of limitations in the way that data on liquidated damages is  categorized in SEACATS. For example, CBP officials stated that  SEACATS does not specify the type of violation, such as the operator  missing information on FTZ inventory, that triggered a given liquidated  damages claim.

Further, for an estimated  36 percent of FTZ operators, FY2015-FY2016 compliance review  documentation did not provide evidence of specific transactions reviewed,  which may limit the validity of conclusions reached in the compliance  reviews.", "CBP officials said that they had not conducted a program-wide risk  analysis of the FTZ program because it would be too time-consuming and  costly based on how compliance review and enforcement information is  currently collected and stored, and because of their assertion that the  program has a low risk of noncompliance. CBP officials also stated that  the agency had not studied trends in the frequency or cause of liquidated  damages claims because they first developed the method for identifying  FTZ-specific liquidated damages in response to our request for these  data and have considered such an analysis a low priority. Without  program-wide analyses of the frequency and significance of problems  found during compliance reviews, risk levels determined, and  enforcement actions taken, CBP cannot verify that the FTZ program is at  a low risk of noncompliance or assess the effectiveness of its internal  controls. Data systems improvements, such as the planned  enhancements to SEACATS discussed earlier, may reduce the cost of  such an analysis, and CBP could further reduce the cost by examining  representative samples.

We selected five FTZs in Maryland, Texas, and  Virginia for site visits based on factors including trade volume, industry  sector, and FTZ activity. At these sites, we interviewed representatives of  FTZ operators engaged in warehousing and manufacturing in the vehicle,  oil refinery, consumer electronics, and other industries. We also  characterized the types of benefits that FTZ operators received by  providing illustrative examples and calculations of associated savings at  the operator level, using financial and testimonial evidence obtained  through interviews with FTZ operators and CBP officials and reviewing  CBP data and industry publications.
