The Compact's economic assistance provisions were scheduled to expire in late 2001. However, the provisions will remain in effect for two more months while the United States and the two Pacific Island nations renegotiate them. Congress must renegotiate and reauthorize the expiring provisions by late 2003 for economic assistance to continue uninterrupted. The $1.6 billion provided under the Compact through 1998 has had little impact on economic development in Micronesia and the Marshall Islands and was subject to limited accountability. U.S. oversight was limited by interagency disagreements between the Departments of Interior and State, a lack of resources devoted to Compact oversight, and Interior's belief that Compact provisions restricted its ability to require accountability and withhold funds. Because of the lack of opportunities in the region, thousands of citizens in Micronesia and the Marshall Islands have migrated to the United States. Migrants to Guam, Hawaii, and the commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands generally work in unskilled, low-paying jobs. Between 1996 and 2000, the local governments have spent at least $371 million on assistance--primarily health care and education. Since 1987, several multilateral organizations and donor nations, including the United States, have given nearly $12 billion to the two Pacific island nations to promote economic self-sufficiency and alleviate poverty. The major donors believe that many Pacific Island nations will not be able to improve development without continued assistance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to testify on the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Pacific Island nations of the Federated States of Micronesia, or FSM, and the Republic of the Marshall Islands, or RMI. The United States entered into this Compact with these countries in 1986 after almost 40 years of administering the islands under the United Nations (U.N.) Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The Compact is a separate international agreement with each country. It provides direct U.S. economic assistance and extends selected U.S. domestic programs and federal services to the FSM and the RMI. Total U.S. Compact assistance\u2014direct funding, program assistance, and federal services\u2014to the two countries for fiscal years 1987 through 2001 is estimated to have been at least $2.6 billion. Further, the Compact allows for migration from the FSM and the RMI to the United States, with limited restrictions, and establishes U.S. defense rights and obligations in the region. Provisions of the Compact that deal with economic assistance were scheduled to expire in late 2001; however, they will remain in effect up to 2 additional years while the United States and each of these Pacific Island nations renegotiate the affected provisions. These expiring provisions must be renegotiated and reauthorized by the Congress by late 2003 in order for Compact economic assistance to continue uninterrupted.", "During the past 2 years, as negotiations have been underway, we have been asked to review how key Compact provisions have functioned since the agreement went into effect. My testimony today will draw on the Compact-related reports that we have published since September 2000. Specifically, I will discuss the results of our work that addressed (1) the impact of and accountability over U.S. funding provided to the FSM and the RMI for fiscal years 1987 through 1998; (2) the experience and impact of migration from the FSM and the RMI to the U.S. island areas of Guam, Hawaii, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, or CNMI; and (3) the experiences of and the assistance strategies used by other donors to Pacific Island nations. While they address separate issues, these reports are related because they provide insight into how key Compact provisions have functioned over the past 15 years and identify issues that the U.S. government might consider as it renegotiates expiring Compact provisions with the FSM and the RMI.", "Finally, before I continue, I should point out that we will publish two more Compact-related reports in January that address (1) effectiveness and accountability issues related to U.S. program assistance (such as Head Start) to the FSM and the RMI; and (2) the use of the Compact\u2019s defense and security provisions, as well as U.S. defense interests in the region.

The FSM is a grouping of 607 small islands\u2014including 65 of which are inhabited\u2014in the western Pacific totaling 270 square miles. The country, which is comprised of four states\u2014 Pohnpei, Chuuk, Yap, and Kosrae, was home to an estimated 107,000 people in 2000. The RMI, which is made up of more than 1,200 islands, islets, and atolls, has a total land area of about 70 square miles and a population that numbered 50,840 in 1999. The islands of both of these countries are spread out over vast stretches of the Pacific Ocean.", "In 1986, after 17 years of negotiations, the United States and the FSM and the RMI entered into the Compact of Free Association. This Compact represented a new phase of the unique and special relationship that has existed between the United States and these island areas since World War II. The three main U.S. goals for the Compact\u2014(1) to secure self- government for the FSM and the RMI, (2) to assure certain national security rights for all the parties, and (3) to assist the FSM and the RMI in their efforts to advance economic development and self-sufficiency\u2014 represent a continuation of U.S. rights and obligations first embodied in the U.N. trusteeship agreement that made the United States the Administering Authority of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The Trust Territory included the area that currently comprises the FSM and the RMI, as well as other Pacific islands liberated from Japan during World War II.", "The Compact of Free Association provided a framework for the United States to work toward achieving its three main goals. Two goals have been met through the Compact and its related agreements: (1) the FSM and the RMI became Freely Associated States, independent in all respects except for defense and security matters; and (2) national security rights for all the parties have been assured. Through the Compact and related agreements, the United States assumed full authority and responsibility for security and defense matters in the FSM and the RMI.", "The third objective of the Compact, promoting economic development and self-sufficiency, was to be accomplished primarily through direct financial payments from the United States to the FSM and the RMI. The provisions governing the amount and distribution of this economic assistance are due to expire, unless renegotiated and subsequently reauthorized by the Congress, in late 2003. The Department of the Interior\u2019s Office of Insular Affairs has the responsibility for disbursing and monitoring this assistance, which includes a requirement to work with the Department of State to consult annually with both countries.", "Another aspect of the special relationship between the FSM and the RMI and the United States involves the unique immigration rights that the Compact granted. Through the Compact, citizens of both nations are allowed to live and work in the United States as non-immigrants, without limitations on their length of stay. Further, the Compact exempts FSM and RMI migrating citizens from meeting U.S. passport, visa, and labor certification requirements. Unlike economic assistance provisions, the Compact\u2019s migration provisions are not scheduled to expire in 2003. In recognition of the potential adverse impacts that Hawaii and nearby U.S. commonwealths and territories could face as result of an influx in migrants, the Congress authorized Compact impact payments to address the financial impact of migrants on Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI.", "Finally, the Compact served as the vehicle to reach a full settlement of all compensation claims (past, present, and future) related to U.S. nuclear tests conducted on Marshallese atolls between 1946 and 1958. In a Compact-related agreement, the U.S. government agreed to provide $150 million to create a trust fund, targeted to produce at least $18 million in annual income to be disbursed in specified amounts over 15 years to persons displaced from the four affected RMI atolls\u2014Bikini, Enewetak, Rongelap, and Utirik\u2014and to the RMI government for health care for the population of the four RMI atolls and to fund a Nuclear Claims Tribunal.While the Compact and its related agreements represented the full settlement of all nuclear claims, it provided the RMI the right to submit a petition of changed circumstance to the U.S. Congress requesting additional compensation.

However, many business ventures and infrastructure investments did not succeed. They failed mainly because of poor planning, construction and maintenance problems, and misuse of funds.

These efforts are aimed at, among other things, decreasing their large public sectors through reductions in government personnel and wage freezes.", "In addition, the Compact did not preclude the FSM or the RMI from borrowing funds in anticipation of U.S. assistance. Using this flexibility, from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s, the FSM and the RMI issued nearly $389 million in Compact revenue-backed bonds in order to obtain greater funding in the earlier years of the Compact. Repayments on bond debt have limited the availability of Compact funds for other uses in the RMI, particularly in recent years. For example, in 1998, the RMI spent $39 million in Compact funds. Of this total amount, $25 million went to service debt. The RMI was also required to spend an additional $8 million to compensate landowners for U.S. military use of Kwajalein Atoll.

Government officials from both countries told us that investing in business ventures has been a bad strategy, and using Compact funds for this purpose had been a failure. Some examples of failed business ventures include (1) $60 million in the FSM spent on fish processing plants that were inactive when we visited in March 2000 (see fig. 2) and (2) a garment factory in the RMI that received almost $2.4 million in Compact funds but was never operated and is closed (see fig. 3)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Reasons for Infrastructure and Business Failures", "paragraphs": ["During our visit to the FSM and the RMI in March 2000, we determined that many Compact-funded projects (both infrastructure and business ventures) experienced problems as a result of poor planning and management, construction and maintenance difficulties, and misuse of funds.

A few examples of such problems included the following: Poor planning and management: The RMI government spent $9.2 million in Compact funds to build a road, or \u201ccauseway,\u201d from Ebeye, an extremely crowded island in the Kwajalein Atoll, to a planned development on a nearby island. The causeway was meant to relieve population problems on Ebeye by allowing residents to move to additional islands connected by the road. However, the causeway remains unfinished. Ebeye officials told us that the causeway is covered with water in places during high tide.", "Construction and maintenance difficulties: The capitol building in the RMI, built during the 1990s using $8.3 million in Compact funding, had visible signs of deterioration when we visited. Stairs were rusting, elevators were inoperable, and roof leaks were evident throughout the building.", "In addition, we found inadequate or nonexistent maintenance in numerous FSM schools and hospitals we visited, despite the government\u2019s spending $80 million in Compact funding designated for health and education.

For example, 5-year FSM and RMI economic development plans gave inadequate attention to broad development goals and plan implementation, as the Compact required. Further, the RMI submitted only 7 of the 13 required annual reports on development plan implementation and Compact fund expenditures. These plans inadequately described how Compact funds were used to achieve development goals and were submitted too late to be relevant for timely U.S. oversight.", "In addition, the FSM and the RMI have not demonstrated adequate control over the use of Compact funds.

Taking into account the trade-offs involved in various approaches, the major Pacific donors have adopted the following strategies to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of their assistance:   Five of the major donors have supported projects to improve governance in recipient countries, such as developing a rule of law, as a foundation for effective development.", "ADB has adopted an approach to development that tailors aid to the individual characteristics of recipients rather than applying the same strategy to all island nations. ADB has advocated a trust fund for the RMI, based on its assessment of the country\u2019s growth potential, while it has put forth a different strategy for the FSM.", "Two donors have built flexibility into their assistance strategies, which enables them to provide incentives for positive achievements or to stop assistance to recipients under undesirable conditions, such as political instability. For example, New Zealand suspended funding to the governments of Fiji, in response to a coup, and to the Solomon Islands, in response to civil unrest, while maintaining the assistance to community organizations, such as nongovernmental health providers, so that aid for basic human services could continue.", "Australia is trying a sectorwide approach to assistance. This approach consists of a pilot project in the health sector in Papua New Guinea in an effort to encourage the recipient country to take ownership of the development process on a limited basis. To reduce its administrative costs while trying to maintain aid effectiveness, Australia began moving from a portfolio of 16 individual health projects to cofunding (with other donors) sectorwide projects and programs identified in Papua New Guinea\u2019s national health plan. In exchange for giving up control over the projects, Australia gained a voice in developing the national strategy and allocating resources for health projects.", "Six of the major donors have relied on trust funds in Pacific Islands, such as Tuvalu, Kiribati, and Nauru, as a means of providing recipients with a self-sustaining source of future revenue. According to ADB, the Tuvalu and Kiribati trust funds have been successful because they were designed to protect the investment capital from misuse. The United Kingdom was able to discontinue its annual budget support for Tuvalu because the trust fund provided the means to balance the budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Lessons for Compact Assistance Strategies", "paragraphs": ["Our review of major donors\u2019 experiences in the Pacific could provide some guidance to the United States as it negotiates further economic assistance to the FSM and the RMI.

In the current Compact, the United States chose a low administrative cost strategy of providing relatively unrestricted cash transfers, which led to problems with the effectiveness of and accountability over the assistance. State and Interior officials have said that the United States will need significantly more staff to administer an assistance program to the FSM and the RMI that has increased accountability as an objective.", "Strategies tailored to specific island conditions may be more effective by better adapting to the recipient\u2019s needs, resources, and capacities. The current structure of the Compact, which generally applies the same objectives and strategies for both the FSM and the RMI, does not account for these differences.", "Flexible strategies are important to adapt assistance to changing circumstances and needs. The U.S. assistance to the FSM and the RMI through the first 15 years of the Compact was distributed according to a negotiated formula that did not allow changes in the distribution of the funds. Moreover, Interior officials believed that the provision of assistance backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the United States, combined with a lack of controls typically available with domestic grant assistance, severely limited its ability to withhold funds, even in cases of misuse.", "Well-designed trust funds can provide a sustainable source of assistance and reduce long-term aid dependence.

Many development efforts have been unsuccessful because of poor planning and management and the apparent misuse of funds. Bad investments in business ventures and the maintenance of a large public sector also limited improvements in economic development. Both the FSM and the RMI remain highly dependent on U.S. assistance and, thus, economic self-sufficiency at current living standards remains a distant goal for those countries.", "Compact migration has clearly had a significant impact on Guam, Hawaii, and the CNMI and has required government services in key areas. Compact migrants have required local expenditures in areas such as health and education and, further, have particularly affected the budgetary resources of Guam and the CNMI\u2014U.S. island locations that have relatively small populations and budgets. The budgetary impact on Hawaii can be expected to grow as Hawaii begins to absorb health care costs that the U.S. government once covered. Public health problems are also an important concern for all three U.S. island areas.", "The negotiation of new economic assistance presents an opportunity for the United States to benefit from its 15-year experience under the Compact and the experiences of other aid donors to Pacific region, in order to potentially increase the effectiveness of the assistance it provides. The United States can strengthen accountability over funds, introduce flexibility into how assistance is provided, and consider different approaches for the FSM and the RMI, such as the use of trust funds.

For example, we have recommended that funds be provided primarily through specific grants that, among other things, direct the money to mutually agreed-upon priority areas and projects and that funds, either Compact or from local revenues, be set aside for capital project maintenance;   annual reporting requirements for the FSM and the RMI be expanded and the consultation process with the United States strengthened; \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d provisions be excluded from any future economic assistance agreement; and   provisions be included that will provide that funds can be withheld from the FSM or the RMI for noncompliance with spending and oversight requirements."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
