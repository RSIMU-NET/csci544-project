EBSA enforces fiduciary standards for plan fiduciaries of privately  sponsored employee benefit plans to ensure that plans are operated in the  best interests of plan participants. EBSA also enforces reporting and  disclosure requirements covering the type and extent of information  provided to the federal government and plan participants, and seeks to  ensure that specific transactions prohibited by ERISA are not conducted  by plans. Under Title I of ERISA, EBSA conducts investigations of plans  and seeks appropriate remedies to correct violations of the law, including  litigation when necessary. IRS enforces the Internal Revenue Code (IRC)  and provisions that must be met which give pension plans tax-qualified  status, including participation, vesting, and funding requirements. The IRS  also audits plans to ensure compliance and can levy tax penalties or  revoke the tax-qualified status of a plan as appropriate. PBGC, under Title  IV of ERISA, provides insurance for participants and beneficiaries of  certain types of tax-qualified pension plans, called defined benefit plans,  that terminate with insufficient assets to pay promised benefits. Recent  terminations of large, underfunded plans have threatened the long-term  solvency of PBGC. As a result, we placed PBGC\u2019s single-employer  insurance program on our high-risk list of programs needing further  attention and congressional action.", "ERISA and the IRC require plan administrators to file annual reports  concerning, among other things, the financial condition and operation of  plans.

Currently, EBSA\u2019s national priorities involve, among  other things, investigating defined contribution pension plan and health  plan fraud. Officials in the Office of Enforcement said that national  priorities are periodically re-evaluated and are changed to reflect trends in  the area of pensions and other benefits.", "On the basis of its national investigative priorities, the Office of  Enforcement has established a number of national projects. Currently,  there are five national projects pertaining to a variety of issues including  employee contributions to defined contribution plans, employee stock  ownership plans (ESOP), and health plan fraud. EBSA\u2019s increasing  emphasis on defined contribution pension plans reflects the rapid growth  of this segment of the pension plan universe. In fiscal year 2004, EBSA had  monetary results of over $31 million and obtained 10 criminal indictments  under its employee contributions project. EBSA\u2019s most recent national  enforcement project involves investigating violations pertaining to ESOPs,  such as the incorrect valuation of employer securities and the failure to  provide participants with the specific benefits required or allowed under  ESOPs, such as voting rights, the ability to diversify their account balances  at certain times, and the right to sell their shares of stock. Likewise, more  attention is being given to health plan fraud, such as fraudulent multiple  employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs). In this instance, EBSA\u2019s  emphasis is on abusive and fraudulent MEWAs created by promoters that  attempt to evade state insurance regulations and sell the promise of  inexpensive health benefit insurance but typically default on their benefit  obligations.", "EBSA regional offices determine the focus of their investigative workloads  based on their evaluation of the employee benefit plans in their  jurisdiction and guidance from the Office of Enforcement. For example,  each region is expected to conduct investigations that cover their entire  geographic jurisdiction and attain a balance among the different types and  sizes of plans investigated. In addition, each regional office is expected to  dedicate some percentage of its staff resources to national and to regional  projects\u2014those developed within their own region that focus on local  concerns. In developing regional projects, each regional office uses its  knowledge of the unique activities and types of plans in its jurisdiction.  For example, a region that has a heavy banking industry concentration  may develop a project aimed at a particular type of transaction commonly  performed by banks. We previously reported that the regional offices  spend an average of about 40 percent of their investigative time  conducting investigations in support of national projects and almost 25  percentage of their investigative time on regional projects.", "EBSA officials said that their most effective source of leads on violations  of ERISA is from complaints from plan participants. Case openings also  originate from news articles or other publications on a particular industry  or company as well as tips from colleagues in other enforcement agencies.  Computer searches and targeting of Form 5500 information on specific  types of plans account for only 25 percent of case openings. In 1994, we  reported that EBSA had done little to test the effectiveness of the  computerized targeting runs it was using to select cases. Since then, EBSA  has scaled down both the number of computerized runs available to staff  and its reliance on these runs as a means of selecting cases.

We recently  reported that the lack of timely and complete of Form 5500 data affects  EBSA\u2019s use of the information for enforcement purposes, such as  computer targeting and identifying troubled plans. EBSA uses Form 5500  information as a compliance tool to identify actual and potential violations  of ERISA. Although EBSA has access to Form 5500 information sooner  than the general public, the agency is affected by the statutory filing  deadlines, which can be up to 285 days after plan year end, and long  processing times for paper filings submitted to the ERISA Filing  Acceptance System. EBSA receives processed Form 5500 information on  individual filings on a regular basis once a form is completely processed.  However, agency officials told us that as they still have to wait for a  sufficiently complete universe of plan filings from any given plan year to  be processed in order to begin their compliance targeting programs. As a  result, EBSA officials told us that they are currently using plan year 2002  and 2003 Form 5500 information for computer targeting. They also said  that in some cases untimely Form 5500 information affects their ability to  identify financially troubled plans whose sponsors may be on the verge of  going out of business and abandoning their pension plans, because these  plans may no longer exist by the time that Labor receives the processed  filing or is able to determine that no Form 5500 was filed by those  sponsors.", "The Form 5500 also lacks key information that could better assist EBSA,  IRS, and PBGC in monitoring plans and ensuring that they are in  compliance with ERISA. EBSA, IRS and PBGC officials said that they have  experienced difficulties when relying on Form 5500 information to identify  and track all plans across years. Although EBSA has a process in place to  identify and track plans filing a Form 5500 from year to year, problems still  arise when plans change employer identification numbers (EIN) and/or  plan numbers. Identifying plans is further complicated when plan sponsors  are acquired, sold, or merged. In these cases, agency officials said that  there is an increased possibility of mismatching of EINs, plans, and their  identifying information. As result, EBSA officials said they are unable to  (1) verify if all required employers are meeting the statutory requirement  to file a Form 5500 annually, (2) identity all late filers, and (3) assess and  collect penalties from all plans that fail to file or are late. Likewise, PBGC  officials said that must spend additional time each year trying to identify  and track certain defined benefit plans so that they can conduct  compliance and research activities. EBSA officials said they are  considering measures to better track and identify plans but have not  reached any conclusions.  Our recent report makes a number of  recommendations aimed at improving the timeliness and content of Form  5500 that will likely assist EBSA\u2019s enforcement efforts.", "In addition to problems with Form 5500 information, concerns remain  about the quality of annual audits of plans\u2019 financial statements by  independent public accountants. For many years, we, as well as the  Department of Labor\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG), have reported  that a significant number of these audits have not met ERISA  requirements. For example, in 1992 we found that over a third of the 25  plan audits we reviewed had audit weaknesses so serious that their  reliability and usefulness were questionable. We recommended that the  Congress amend ERISA to require full-scope audits of employee benefit  plans and to require plan administrators and independent public  accountants to report on how effective an employee benefit plan\u2019s internal  controls are in protecting plan assets. Although such changes were  subsequently proposed, they were not enacted. In 2004, Labor\u2019s OIG  reported that although EBSA had reviewed a significant number of  employee benefit plan audits and made efforts to correct substandard  audits, a significant number of substandard audits remain uncorrected.  Furthermore, plan auditors performing substandard work generally  continue to audit employee benefit plans without being required to  improve the quality of the audits. As a result, these audits have not  provided participants and beneficiaries the protections envisioned by  Congress. Labor\u2019s OIG recommended, among other things, that EBSA  propose changes to ERISA so that EBSA has greater enforcement  authority over employee benefit plan auditors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restrictive Statutory Requirements Limit Assessment of Fiduciary Penalties", "paragraphs": ["As we have previously reported, restrictive legal requirements have limited  EBSA\u2019s ability to assess penalties against fiduciaries or other persons who  knowingly participate in a fiduciary breach. Unlike the SEC, which has  the authority to impose a penalty without first assessing and then securing  monetary damages, EBSA does not have such statutory authority and must  assess penalties based on damages or, more specifically, the restoration of  plan assets. Under Section 502(l), ERISA provides for a mandatory  penalty against (1) a fiduciary who breaches a fiduciary duty under, or  commits a violation of, Part 4 of Title I of ERISA or (2) against any other  person who knowingly participates in such a breach or violation. This  penalty is equal to 20 percent of the \u201capplicable recovery amount,\u201d or any  settlement agreed upon by the Secretary or ordered by a court to be paid  in a judicial proceeding instituted by the Secretary. However, the  applicable recovery amount cannot be determined if damages have not  been valued. This penalty can be assessed only against fiduciaries or  knowing participants in a breach who, by court order or settlement  agreement, restore plan assets. Therefore, if (1) there is no settlement  agreement or court order or (2) someone other than a fiduciary or  knowing participant returns plan assets, the penalty may not be assessed.   For example, last year we reported that ERISA presented legal challenges  when developing cases related to proxy voting by plan fiduciaries,  particularly with regards to valuing monetary damages. As a result,  because EBSA has never found a violation that resulted in monetary  damages, it has never assessed a penalty or removed a fiduciary because  of a proxy voting investigation. Given the restrictive legal requirements  that have limited the use of penalties for violations of ERISA\u2019s fiduciary  requirements, we recommended that Congress consider amending ERISA  to give the Secretary of Labor additional authority with respect to  assessing monetary penalties against fiduciaries. We also recommended  other changes to ERISA to better protect plan participants and increase  the transparency of proxy voting practices by plan fiduciaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Scandals Highlight the Need for Better Coordination with SEC", "paragraphs": ["Recent events such as the abusive trading practices of late trading and  market timing in mutual funds and new revelations of conflicts of interest  by pension consultants highlight the need for EBSA to better coordinate  enforcement strategies with SEC.

At the time we issued our report, SEC had taken a number  of actions to address the abuses including:    charging some fund companies with defrauding investors by not  enforcing their stated policies on market timing,  fining some institutions hundreds of millions of dollars (some of this  money was to be returned to long-term shareholders who lost money  due to abusive practices),    permanently barring some individuals from future work with  investment companies, and    proposing new regulations addressing late trading and market timing.", "Separate from SEC activities, EBSA began investigating possible fiduciary  violations at some large investment companies, including those that  sponsor mutual funds, and violations by plan fiduciaries. EBSA also issued  guidance suggesting that plan fiduciaries review their relationships with  mutual funds and other investment companies to ensure they are meeting  their responsibilities of acting reasonably, prudently, and solely in the  interest of plan participants.  Although SEC\u2019s proposed regulations on late  trading and market timing could have more adversely affected some plan  participants than other mutual fund investors, EBSA was not involved in  drafting the regulations because it does not regulate mutual funds.", "In another example of how EBSA and SEC enforcement responsibilities  can intersect, SEC recently found that potential conflicts of interest may  affect the objectivity of advice pension consultants are providing to their  pension plan clients.  The report also raised important issues for plan  fiduciaries who often rely on the advice of pension consultants in  operating their plans.

Given these concerns, it is important that employees\u2019 benefits are  adequately protected. EBSA is a relatively small agency facing the  daunting challenge of protecting over $4 trillion in assets of pension and  welfare benefits for millions of Americans. Over the years, EBSA has taken  steps to strengthen its enforcement program and leverage its limited  resources. These actions have helped better position EBSA to more  effectively enforce ERISA.", "EBSA, however, continues to face a number of significant challenges to its  enforcement program. Foremost, despite improvements in the timeliness  and content of the Form 5500, information currently collected does not  permit EBSA and the other ERISA regulatory agencies to be in the best  position to ensure compliance with federal laws and assess the financial  condition of private pension plans. Given the ever-changing complexities  of employee benefit plans and how rapidly the financial condition of  pension plans can deteriorate, it is imperative that policymakers,  regulators, plan participants, and others have more timely and accurate  Form 5500 information. In addition, there is a legitimate question as to  whether information currently collected on the Form 5500 can be used as  an effective enforcement tool by EBSA or whether different information  might be needed. Without the right information on plans in a timely  manner, EBSA will continue to have to rely on participant complaints as a  primary source of investigations rather than being able to proactively  identify and target problems areas. Second, in some instances, EBSA\u2019s  enforcement efforts continue to be hindered by ERISA, the very law it is  charged with enforcing. For example, because of restrictive legal  requirements, EBSA continues to be hindered in assessing penalties  against fiduciaries or others who knowingly participate in a fiduciary  breach. Congress may want to amend ERISA to address such limits on  EBSA\u2019s enforcement authority. Finally, the significant changes that have  occurred in pension plans, the growing complexity of financial  transactions of such plans, and the increasing role of mutual funds and  other investment vehicles in retirement savings plans require enhanced  coordination of enforcement efforts with SEC. Furthermore, such changes  raise the fundamental question of whether Congress should modify the  current ERISA enforcement framework. For example, it is important to  consider whether the current division of oversight responsibilities across  several agencies is the best way to ensure effective enforcement or  whether some type of consolidation or reallocation of responsibilities and  resources could result in more effective and efficient ERISA enforcement.  We look forward to working with Congress on such crucial issues.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
