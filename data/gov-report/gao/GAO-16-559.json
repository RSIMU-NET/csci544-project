Unauthorized grazing may take various forms, such as grazing more livestock than permitted or grazing without a permit.", "GAO was asked to examine unauthorized grazing. This report (1) describes what is known about the frequency and extent of unauthorized grazing, and its effects, and (2) examines the agencies' efforts to detect, deter, and resolve unauthorized grazing. GAO analyzed 5 years of the most recent data available on incidents where the agencies had taken formal action on unauthorized grazing (grazing years 2010 through 2014); examined federal laws and agency regulations, policies, and practices; and interviewed by telephone or site visit officials in a nongeneralizable sample of 22 agency field offices in eight western states where most unauthorized grazing had occurred."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The frequency and extent of unauthorized grazing on Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and U.S. Forest Service lands are largely unknown because according to agency officials, the agencies prefer to handle most incidents informally (e.g., with a telephone call) and do not record them. The agencies' databases contained information on nearly 1,500 incidents of unauthorized grazing where formal action was taken by the agencies' range program or law enforcement staff for grazing years 2010 through 2014 (March 1 to February 28). Unauthorized grazing incidents were recorded in the agencies' databases when the agencies billed a penalty for unauthorized grazing or prepared a law enforcement report. However, agency staff told GAO that they handle most incidents informally\u2014their preferred practice\u2014and do not record them in databases or consistently in paper files, because, in part, they do not consider it a priority. As a result, the agencies have incomplete information on the extent of unauthorized grazing. Federal internal control standards call for clear documentation of all transactions and other significant events. Until the agencies require that all incidents of unauthorized grazing be recorded, including those incidents resolved informally, BLM and the Forest Service will not have a complete record of unauthorized grazing incidents with which to identify any potential pattern of violations.", "GAO found that the agencies' preferred practice of informally resolving unauthorized grazing is not provided for under agency regulations. Specifically, the regulations do not provide the flexibility to resolve incidents informally without a written notice of violation (in the case of BLM) and without charging unauthorized grazing penalties (in the case of the Forest Service). Most agency staff told GAO that informal resolution is the most effective way to resolve non-willful unauthorized grazing (e.g., when livestock stray outside of their permitted area and graze in an unauthorized area). As discussed in federal internal control standards, program operations are effective and efficient in achieving agency objectives when they produce the intended results and minimize the waste of resources. By amending regulations to establish a procedure for the informal resolution of minor infractions, the agencies could achieve the objective of efficiently resolving such incidents with minimal conflict within its regulatory authority. Alternatively, rather than amending their existing regulations to match their practices, the agencies' could change their practices to comply with their existing regulations. In addition, BLM and the Forest Service undertake similar efforts to detect and deter unauthorized grazing, such as conducting compliance inspections and assessing penalties for unauthorized grazing, but agency staff said that such efforts have limited effectiveness. For example, most of the Forest Service staff GAO interviewed said that unauthorized grazing penalties are too low to act as an effective deterrent. Under current policy, the Forest Services' unauthorized grazing penalty formula calculated a negative number or a number less than the permitted grazing fee for grazing years 2009 through 2012. By adopting an unauthorized grazing penalty structure that is, like BLM's, based on the current price of private forage, the Forest Service's unauthorized grazing penalty can better serve as a deterrent to such grazing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making six recommendations, including that the agencies take actions to record all incidents of unauthorized grazing, that they amend regulations to reflect their practices for resolving such incidents or comply with their regulations, and that the Forest Service revise its unauthorized grazing penalty structure. The agencies generally agreed with GAO's findings and recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1900s, the federal government has required ranchers to  pay a fee for grazing their livestock on millions of acres of federal land,  primarily in western states. These ranchers must obtain permits or leases  from the responsible federal agencies to graze livestock on federal lands,  and must comply with the conditions of these permits or leases, such as  grazing their livestock in the permitted numbers and locations, to help  protect and preserve the range for multiple uses, such as sustainable  grazing. Unauthorized grazing may take several forms, such as grazing  during unauthorized times of the year, grazing more livestock than  allowed by permit, or grazing outside of permitted areas or in areas  closed to livestock. Such unauthorized grazing may be unintentional,  such as when livestock stray outside of their permitted area through a  broken fence and graze in an unauthorized area. In some cases  unauthorized grazing is intentional, such as when ranchers purposely  overstay their permitted grazing period or ranchers without permits  purposely allow their livestock onto federal lands. Several recent high- profile incidents of intentional unauthorized grazing, including  confrontations between ranchers and federal officials, have drawn  attention to the extent and effects of unauthorized grazing.", "The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), within the Department of the  Interior, and the U.S. Forest Service, within the Department of Agriculture,  are responsible for managing most of the nation\u2019s public rangelands.  Under the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934 for BLM and, among other statutes,  the Organic Act of 1897 for the Forest Service, livestock grazing became  a regulated activity. Both agencies administer grazing programs that  allow ranchers to obtain permits, leases, or other permissions to graze  their livestock on federal lands. BLM has the larger grazing program,  administering about 17,600 grazing permits on 153 million acres in  grazing year 2015; the Forest Service administered about 6,200 grazing  permits on 102 million acres in grazing year 2015. As the administrators  of their grazing programs, the agencies are responsible for detecting and  deterring unauthorized grazing. In response to unauthorized grazing, the  agencies\u2019 staff may impose penalties against permittees and modify or  cancel grazing permits. In addition, the agencies\u2019 law enforcement  officers may cite permittees or nonpermittees for violations that subject  them to criminal penalties for unauthorized grazing.", "In December 1990, we reported on BLM\u2019s efforts to detect and deter  unauthorized livestock grazing on public rangelands. We found that  because many grazing areas were inspected infrequently or not at all  during the year, offenders were not likely to be detected. When offenders  were detected, BLM frequently exacted no penalties and, for the more  serious violations, seldom assessed the minimum penalties its own  regulations required. As a result, unauthorized grazing was not  adequately deterred, which could lead to degradation of public  rangelands, among other things. In our December 1990 report, we made  five recommendations to improve BLM\u2019s ability to prevent unauthorized  grazing. BLM agreed with the recommendations and implemented one of  the five. The agency took steps toward implementing some of the others,  but did not fully implement the remaining four recommendations.", "You asked us to update our December 1990 report and review BLM\u2019s and  the Forest Service\u2019s efforts to address unauthorized grazing.

Specifically, we collected data from BLM\u2019s and the Forest Service\u2019s range  management, financial, and law enforcement databases on the frequency  and extent of unauthorized grazing for grazing years 2010 through 2014,  the most recent and complete data available at the time of our review.  We assessed the data provided by the agencies based on our review of  database system documentation and discussions with agency database  stewards and found the data to be sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  We conducted in-person or telephone interviews with staff at 22 of the  218 agency field office locations in eight western states: California,  Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, and Wyoming. We  selected the 22 offices (13 BLM and 9 Forest Service offices) from among  the agency field offices that had the highest numbers of unauthorized  grazing incidents or that had been recommended by stakeholders. Of the  22 offices, we conducted site visits at 6 offices in Nevada and Wyoming  to interview agency range management and law enforcement staff about  the agencies\u2019 policies and practices for addressing unauthorized grazing,  as well as to review paper case files and observe the effects of  unauthorized grazing on federal lands. We conducted telephone  interviews with staff in the remaining 16 of the 22 BLM and Forest Service  field offices. Our interview results are not generalizable to all agency field  office locations and grazing lands and instead are illustrative cases of the  office locations reporting the highest number of unauthorized grazing  incidents.

Of the total  federal lands, BLM and the Forest Service manage about 450 million  acres for multiple uses, including grazing, timber harvest, recreation,  minerals, water supply and quality, and wildlife habitat. BLM\u2019s 12 state  offices manage nearly 250 million acres in 12 western states, and the  Forest Service\u2019s 9 regional offices manage more than 190 million acres  across the nation (see figs. 1 and 2). The majority of federal lands are  located in the western half of the country.", "The federal government has managed grazing on federal lands for more  than 100 years. Following the passage of the Taylor Grazing Act of 1934,  the Department of the Interior created the Division of Grazing, later  renamed the Grazing Service, to administer provisions of the act.  Subsequently, the Grazing Service was merged with the General Land  Office to form BLM. The act was passed to stop degradation of public  lands caused by overgrazing and soil deterioration; to provide for the  orderly use, improvement, and development of public lands; and other  purposes. The act also provided for the issuance of permits and leases  for these lands and set requirements for the distribution of funds received  from grazing. The Forest Service managed grazing under its general  authorities until 1950, when Congress enacted the Granger-Thye Act,  specifically authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grazing  permits on national forest lands and other lands under the department\u2019s  administration. Additional laws affecting grazing on both BLM and  western Forest Service lands were enacted in the 1970s.", "BLM\u2019s and the Forest Service\u2019s range grazing programs administer  livestock grazing for permittees. Agency law enforcement assists when  necessary\u2014primarily to address grazing violations by nonpermittees that  cannot be handled administratively. To provide access to grazing, the  agencies divide their rangelands into allotments, which can vary in size  from a few acres to hundreds of thousands of acres. Because of the land  ownership patterns that occurred when the lands were settled, the  allotments can be adjacent to private lands or intermingled with private  lands. Under its authorities, BLM issues permits for grazing in allotments  within its grazing districts and leases for grazing on BLM-administered  lands outside grazing districts. To be eligible for a permit or lease on one  of BLM\u2019s allotments, ranchers, among other things, are required to own or  control land or water, called a base property, to which preference for  obtaining a permit or lease is attached. The Forest Service, which does  not have grazing districts, uses permits to authorize grazing in its  allotments. To be eligible for a permit under Forest Service policy,  ranchers, among other things, must own base property and the livestock  to be permitted. The agencies\u2019 permits and leases specify the number  and type of livestock allowed on the allotments, the time and duration of  use for grazing, and special conditions or use restrictions. Agency field  office staff conduct compliance inspections to help ensure that permittees  are meeting the terms and conditions of their permits or leases. The  agencies may modify permits or leases if range conditions are being  degraded or suspend or cancel them if permit conditions are violated.", "With a few minor exceptions, permittees pay a grazing fee for the use of  the federal land. The grazing fee BLM and the Forest Service charge in  western states is based on a formula that was originally established by  law to prevent economic disruption and harm to the western livestock  industry, among other things. The formula expired after 7 years but  was extended indefinitely by Executive Order 12,548 and has been  incorporated into the agencies\u2019 regulations. The fee derived from the  formula is generally lower than the fees charged by other agencies,  states, and private ranchers. In grazing year 2016, BLM charged ranchers  $2.11 per animal unit month for horses/cattle and $0.42 for sheep and  goats; the Forest Service charged the same rates per head month.  According to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, based on the  average private grazing land lease rate per animal unit month, the  commercial value of forage in western states ranged from $9 to $39 in  grazing year 2016. As we found in September 2005, the total grazing fees  generated by federal agencies amounted to less than one-sixth of the  agencies\u2019 expenditures to manage grazing in 2004. We found that BLM  and the Forest Service use most of the grazing fee receipts for range  protection and improvements and deposit some receipts to the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s general fund, with some receipts distributed  to states and counties. See appendix II for additional information on  grazing, permits, and fees for BLM and the Forest Service.", "Unauthorized grazing includes instances in which livestock owners graze  on BLM or Forest Service allotments without a permit or lease, as well as  instances in which those with permits or leases violate the terms and  conditions of those documents, such as by grazing more livestock than  allowed by permit, grazing in areas that are closed to livestock, or grazing  during unauthorized times of the year. It may be unintentional (non-willful)  on the part of the livestock owner, such as when livestock stray through  an unlatched gate into an area where they are not permitted to graze, or  it may be intentional (willful or repeated willful) such as when a livestock  owner purposefully grazes livestock in a manner that is not allowed by a  permit or grazes livestock without obtaining a permit once or multiple  times.", "Under their applicable regulations, BLM and the Forest Service may  address unauthorized grazing by charging permittees penalties for  unauthorized grazing; revising their permits; impounding livestock; or  taking action that could lead to criminal penalties, most commonly for  nonpermittees, as follows:", "BLM\u2019s grazing regulations establish three levels of unauthorized  grazing\u2014non-willful, willful, and repeated willful\u2014with progressively  higher penalties for each level.

Under certain circumstances, BLM can approve a  nonmonetary settlement for non-willful unauthorized grazing. For  willful and repeated willful incidents, in addition to the monetary  penalties\u2014the value of the forage consumed\u2014the regulations specify  that the offender shall be charged for any damages to the land and  reasonable agency expenses incurred to resolve the violation, and  BLM shall suspend or cancel all or portions of the grazing permit for  repeated willful incidents.

BLM also has the authority to cite permittees and  nonpermittees for grazing violations that subject them to criminal  penalties.", "The Forest Service\u2019s grazing regulations require the agency, except  in certain circumstances, to determine a grazing use rate for  unauthorized grazing. The regulations define unauthorized grazing  as (1) livestock not authorized by permit to graze upon the land, (2) an  excess number of livestock grazed by permittees, or (3) permitted  livestock grazed outside the permitted grazing season or allotment.  Under the regulations, the Forest Service can cancel or suspend a  permit if the permittee does not comply with provisions and  requirements in the grazing permit or applicable regulations.

As a result, the agencies do not have complete information on  unauthorized grazing and therefore may not have the documentation  needed to deal with any instances of repeat offenders appropriately.  Federal internal control standards call for agencies to clearly document  all transactions and other significant events in a manner that allows the  documentation to be readily available for examination.

Joint BLM/Forest Service  riparian area management guidance states that compliance monitoring of  grazing is critical because just a few weeks of unauthorized grazing can  set back years of progress in restoring riparian areas\u2014such as the  narrow bands of green adjoining rivers, streams, or springs. Agency field  staff we interviewed from 17 out of the 22 offices told us that under  certain circumstances, unauthorized grazing can be more damaging than  permitted grazing, such as when livestock are allowed into closed riparian  areas during times of low precipitation or drought or graze in pastures  earlier than permitted in the spring when grass is first sprouting.  Stakeholders told us that the loss of native grass through unauthorized  overgrazing may allow invasive species such as cheatgrass to grow,  creating a potential fire hazard, or may result in a loss of habitat for  threatened species such as sage grouse. During our field visits, we  observed locations where unauthorized grazing had resulted in severely  damaged natural springs, overgrazed meadows, and trampled  streambeds. Agency field staff provided photographs showing  unauthorized grazing in protected habitat areas and the effects of  overgrazing from unauthorized use (see figs. 3, 4, and 5).", "Agency staff and stakeholders told us that unauthorized grazing can  strain relationships and cause conflicts among various groups.

Agency staff we interviewed from 15 out of  the 22 field offices told us that they are not always able to confirm and  take action on such reporting because it is not timely or lacks specificity,  and many staff said that following up to confirm such reports takes them  away from higher-priority responsibilities. Agency staff also told us that  permittees get frustrated if they do not take prompt action to stop  unauthorized grazing by others, such as nonpermittees, which can also  lead to conflicts among ranchers, for example, if a nonpermittee\u2019s stray  livestock consume the forage on a permittee\u2019s allotment through  unauthorized grazing. According to a wild horse advocate we interviewed,  the advocate had experienced threats from ranchers engaged in  unauthorized grazing on the range while the advocate was working with  BLM to protect and manage the horses.", "Agency field staff and stakeholders told us there are only a small number  of confrontational ranchers who do not recognize the agencies\u2019 authority  to manage the range and engage in willful unauthorized grazing, but they  are concerned that the problem will grow. Agency field staff we  interviewed from 5 out of the 22 field offices told us that high-profile cases  of intentional unauthorized grazing and related antigovernment protests  can affect agency decision making regarding enforcement, and staff at  4 out of the 22 field offices told us that not taking enforcement action on  violators is likely to encourage more unauthorized grazing. For example,  staff at one Forest Service office in Oregon told us that they were  prepared to suspend a rancher\u2019s permit for repeated unauthorized  grazing violations but decided not to because of the standoff by  antigovernment activists at Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Agency  staff we interviewed from 6 of the 22 field offices told us that lack of  support from higher-level managers for strong enforcement action does  not incentivize field staff to act on unauthorized grazing and, in some  cases, lowers staff morale. The leaders of two stakeholder groups,  Western Watersheds Project and Public Employees for Environmental  Responsibility, jointly wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Interior in 2015  to express concern about the lack of effective range management of BLM  lands in Nevada because of what they characterized as higher-level  pressure on local managers to accept ranchers\u2019 demands when settling  unauthorized grazing incidents; agency staff from three of the local offices  we spoke with shared this concern. BLM responded to the stakeholders\u2019  letter on behalf of the Secretary, stating that the agency is committed to  collaborating with permittees to resolve problems that reflect the interests  of affected communities while also ensuring that public lands are  managed and conserved for the future.", "Agency field staff we interviewed from 14 out of the 22 offices told us they  generally do not have safety concerns while performing their duties, or did  not mention any such concerns, even with the potential for confrontational  tactics by some ranchers. BLM and Forest Service law enforcement  officials told us that the overall trend for assaults and threats to agency  staff had been down in recent years, but they do not track assaults and  threats specifically related to grazing incidents. However, BLM field staff  in Southern Nevada were directed by the state office not to visit grazing  allotments after an armed standoff with a rancher over the agency\u2019s  impoundment of his cattle for unauthorized grazing. At one BLM field  office we visited in Northern Nevada, there was a protest site established  across the street in response to the office\u2019s efforts to enforce  unauthorized grazing regulations (see fig. 6). Field staff told us that as a  result of a statewide BLM assessment, the office upgraded its security to  include video cameras, card key locks, and entrance barricades.", "Finally, unauthorized grazing that is not detected or not formally acted on  when identified cannot be billed penalties for unauthorized grazing,  resulting in forgone revenues. The agencies track penalties for  unauthorized grazing billed and collected but do not track those forgone.  Based on information from the agencies\u2019 databases, BLM and the Forest  Service collected nearly $450,000 for unauthorized grazing in grazing  years 2010 through 2014.

However, field office staff we spoke with told us that they have  a limited number of knowledgeable staff\u2014in part because of significant  staff turnover, including transfers and retirements\u2014administering vast  acres of rangeland, and growing workloads that require multitasking and  spending significant time in the office. In addition, grazing allotments are  often in remote locations that can take hours to access by vehicle,  horseback, or hiking.

Field staff we interviewed from  6 out of the 9 Forest Service offices and 4 out of the 13 BLM offices said  that penalties for unauthorized grazing are rarely or never an effective  deterrent. As a result, some told us that there are permittees who view  the penalties for unauthorized grazing as a cost of doing business  because paying the penalties is cheaper than seeking forage elsewhere.  For example, Forest Service staff at one field location told us that they are  reluctant to send a bill for penalties for unauthorized grazing because it  shows how low the penalty is and may encourage additional unauthorized  grazing.", "We found that for grazing years 2008 through 2014, the Forest Service  penalty for unauthorized grazing was $2.51 or less per head month,  which was substantially less than BLM\u2019s penalty for unauthorized grazing.  The Forest Service calculates this penalty using the same formula that it  and BLM use each year to calculate the permitted grazing fee. The  formula for the permitted fee has a preset base value of $1.23 and other  input values, such as the prices of private forage and beef cattle, which  can vary annually. To calculate its penalty for unauthorized grazing using  this formula, the Forest Service applies a higher preset base value of  $3.80 rather than $1.23. (For more detailed information on the formula  and calculation, see app. II.) For grazing years 2009 through 2012, the  Forest Service\u2019s unauthorized grazing penalty formula calculation would  have resulted in a negative number or a number lower than the permitted  grazing fee. To address this situation, a Forest Service official told us that  the agency decided to hold the penalty for unauthorized grazing at  $2.24 per head month until the formula calculation resulted in a higher  penalty. In contrast, as shown in table 2, the BLM penalty for non-willful  unauthorized grazing\u2014based on commercial forage rates in each state\u2014 ranged from $8 to $33.50 per animal unit month for grazing years 2008  through 2014, and BLM doubled the penalty for willful incidents and  tripled it for repeated willful incidents. In addition, with higher-level  offensives (willful and repeated willful), BLM regulations require  unauthorized grazing bills to also include \u201call reasonable expenses  incurred by the United States in detecting, investigating, resolving  violations, and livestock impoundment costs.\u201d", "Compared to BLM\u2019s penalties, the Forest Service penalty for  unauthorized grazing is less likely to be a deterrent for unauthorized  grazing, and the differing penalty structures result in inconsistency  between the two federal agencies. As we noted in March 2003,  penalties generally should be designed in such a way as to serve as  a deterrent for unauthorized activities. Forest Service regulations  incorporate Office of Management and Budget guidance, which directs  that a fair market value be obtained for all services and resources  provided to the public through establishment of a system of reasonable  fee charges. By adopting a penalty structure for unauthorized grazing  use that is, similar to BLM\u2019s, based on the current commercial value of  forage (a fair market value), the Forest Service\u2019s penalty for unauthorized  grazing can better serve as a deterrent to such grazing and be consistent  with BLM\u2019s penalty.", "The Forest Service recognized that its formula for calculating its penalty  for unauthorized grazing was problematic in grazing year 2009 when the  formula produced a negative value. A Forest Service official told us that  the agency is considering options for revising the penalty as part of its  ongoing update of grazing guidance, but the update has not been  completed because of higher priorities. The Forest Service does not  have a time frame for when the penalty for unauthorized grazing will be  revised, according to agency officials.

As mentioned previously, because BLM staff generally prefer informal  resolution for most incidents of unauthorized grazing, there may not be a  paper trail documenting repeated incidents. In some offices this was  exacerbated by staff turnover.

Field staff we  interviewed from 18 of the 22 offices said that permit modifications are  always or usually an effective deterrent. In practice, field staff from 19 of  the 22 said that they generally view this as a last resort penalty and  seldom modify, suspend, or cancel permits for unauthorized grazing in  part because the warning is usually sufficient to obtain compliance. In  one example, Forest Service staff at an office in Nevada said they had  canceled only one permit, for a permittee with a particularly long record  of persistent unauthorized grazing.

We recommended in 1990 that  BLM either ensure that all penalties are assessed for non-willful  unauthorized grazing, as provided for in its regulations, or amend its  regulations to establish a procedure for informal resolution. The agency  amended its regulations to add the option for the nonmonetary resolution  of certain non-willful incidents, but the amendment did not remove the  requirement for a written notice of violation.

Management is responsible for designing the  policies and procedures to fit an entity\u2019s circumstances and building them  in as an integral part of the entity\u2019s operations. BLM and Forest Service  officials stated that handling incidental unauthorized grazing informally is  necessary and effective because they have limited staff and permittees  tend to be largely compliant.

In addition, the handbook  description of penalties differs from that in the regulations for willful  violations\u2014the regulations state that the rate is twice the value of forage  consumed, while the handbook states that the rate is three times the  value of forage consumed. Furthermore, the regulations state that the  value of damages to public lands shall be included in settlement for willful  and repeated willful violations, and the handbook states generally that the  value of damages \u201cmust be charged,\u201d without specifying which violations  must incur the charge.
