False claims of lost, stolen, or damaged passports and child substitution are among the other tactics used. Fraudulently obtained passports can help criminals conceal their activities and travel with less scrutiny. Concerns exist that they could also be used to help facilitate terrorism. State faces a number of challenges to its passport fraud detection efforts, and these challenges make it more difficult to protect U.S. citizens from terrorists, criminals, and others. Information on U.S. citizens listed in the federal government's consolidated terrorist watch list is not systematically provided to State. Moreover, State does not routinely obtain from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) the names of other individuals wanted by federal and state law enforcement authorities. We tested the names of 67 federal and state fugitives and found that 37, over half, were not in State's Consular Lookout and Support System (CLASS) database for passports. One of those not included was on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. State does not maintain a centralized and up-to-date fraud prevention library, hindering information sharing within State. Fraud prevention staffing reductions and interoffice workload transfers resulted in fewer fraud referrals at some offices, and insufficient training, oversight, and investigative resources also hinder fraud detection efforts. Any effect that new passport examiner performance standards may have on State's fraud detection efforts is unclear because State continues to adjust the standards. State began implementing the new standards in January 2004 to make work processes and performance expectations more uniform nationwide. Passport examiner union representatives expressed concern that new numerical production quotas may require examiners to \"shortcut\" fraud detection efforts. However, in response to union and examiner concerns, State eased the production standards during 2004 and made a number of other modifications and compromises."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Maintaining the integrity of the U.S. passport is essential to the State  Department\u2019s effort to protect U.S. citizens and interests at home and  abroad in the post-September 11 world.

One example identified by Diplomatic Security  investigators involved an alien using another person\u2019s identity to obtain a  U.S. passport. In 2003, a woman using a fraudulent identity claimed to be  born in Puerto Rico and provided a Puerto Rican birth certificate when  applying for a passport at a clerk of the court office in Florida.

In 1997, a naturalized  U.S. citizen born in Cuba stole a Lear jet and transported it to Nicaragua for  use in charter services. At the time of his arrest in 2003, he was using an  assumed identity and possessed both false and legitimate but fraudulently  obtained identification documents, including a U.S. passport in the name  he used while posing as a certified pilot and illegally providing flight  instruction.

He was later arrested and pled  guilty to making a false statement in an application for a passport. He was  sentenced to time served (about 7 months) and returned to California to  stand trial for murdering his wife. In a third example, a woman obtained a  U.S. passport for herself and her daughter using the assumed identity of a  friend and that friend\u2019s daughter.

This fraudulently obtained passport was used to obtain entry into  the United States 14 times in less than three years. Diplomatic Security  officials told us that another means of passport fraud is when individuals  obtain replacement passports by using expired passports containing  photographs of individuals they closely resemble. This method of fraud is  more easily and commonly committed with children, with false  applications based on photographs of children who look similar to the child applicant. Assuming the identity of a deceased person is another  means of fraudulently applying for a passport.

Using a passport with  a false identity helps enable criminals to conceal their movements and  activities, according to a State Department document. U.S. passports  provide their holders free passage into our country with much less scrutiny  than is given to foreign citizens. U.S. passports also allow visa-free passage  into many countries around the world, providing obvious benefits to  criminals operating on an international scale. According to State officials,  the most common crime associated with passport fraud is illegal  immigration. For example, one woman was recently convicted for  organizing and leading a large-scale passport fraud ring that involved  recruiting American women to sell their children\u2019s identities, so that  foreign nationals could fraudulently obtain passports and enter the United  States illegally. According to the Department of State, the woman targeted  drug-dependent women and their children, paying them about $300 for  each identity and then using the identities to apply for passports. The  woman then sold the fraudulently obtained passports to illegal aliens for as  much as $6,000 each. Other leaders of alien smuggling rings have also been  recently convicted.

State eliminated the permanent role of assistant primarily  to expand participation of senior passport examiners serving in that role on  a rotational basis; the purpose was to help the examiners gain a deeper  knowledge of the subject matter and, in turn, enhance overall fraud  detection efforts when the examiners returned to adjudicating passport applications. Prior to the permanent position being abolished, 12 of the 16  passport issuing offices had at least one assistant manager (2 offices had  two). Of the 4 offices that did not have permanent assistants, 3 did not  have them because they had relatively low workloads and 1 had been in  operation only for a few years and had not yet filled the position. Managers  at 10 of the 12 offices that had assistants told us that the loss of this  position had been harmful to their fraud detection program. In particular,  managers indicated that the loss of their assistant impacted their own  ability to concentrate on fraud detection by adding to their workload  significant additional training, administrative, and networking  responsibilities. Fraud Prevention Managers also said that taking on their  assistant\u2019s tasks had diverted their attention from their fraud trend analysis  as well as their preparation of reports to Washington, D.C., and cases for  referral to Diplomatic Security. Some managers said they are now  performing more case work than before because they lack an experienced  assistant and do not always believe they can rely on rotating staff to do this  work unsupervised.", "Fraud Prevention Managers and other State officials have linked declining  fraud referrals to the loss of the assistant fraud prevention manager  position. In the 12 offices that previously had permanent assistants, fraud  referral rates from the managers to Diplomatic Security decreased overall  by almost 25 percent from fiscal year 2003 through 2004, the period during  which the position was eliminated, and this percentage was much higher in  some offices. Fraud Prevention offices screen fraud referrals received  from examiners, perform certain checks on applicant information, and  assess the examiner\u2019s rationale for making the referral before the fraud  prevention manager can determine whether to refer the case to Diplomatic  Security for further investigation. Without their assistants helping them  with these and other duties, managers said they are making fewer fraud  referrals to Diplomatic Security because they lack the time and do not  believe they can fully rely on new rotational staff to take on this  responsibility. In one issuing office where referrals to Diplomatic Security  were down 41 percent, the manager indicated that loss of his assistant had  slowed his ability to get cases to Diplomatic Security because he had to  perform many of the assistant\u2019s duties. A Diplomatic Security agent in  another issuing office, where the fraud referral rate was down by 55  percent, said the overall effect of eliminating the assistant manager  position had been harmful to fraud detection efforts at least in part because  the permanently assigned assistants had developed valuable personal  contacts and cooperative arrangements over time with state and local law  enforcement authorities, department of motor vehicle officials, and others,  and that such relationships could not be easily developed or maintained by  rotating staff.", "Most Fraud Prevention Managers acknowledged the value of having senior  examiners rotate into the fraud prevention office for temporary  assignments; however, the managers said that rotating staff should  augment the efforts of a permanent assistant and not serve in place of that  role. Passport Services management told us they were not planning to re- establish the permanent assistant role, but that they are in the process of  filling one to two additional fraud prevention manager positions at each of  the 2 offices with the largest workloads nationwide. Both of these offices  operate multiple shifts each workday, and the new managers are intended  to provide more comprehensive fraud prevention support for all of the  shifts.

Fraud Prevention Managers at a number of issuing offices said  they had noticed that a lower percentage of fraud referrals are being  returned to them from the 3 offices that were assigned the bulk of  workload transfers from other offices. The Fraud Prevention Managers  noted that, over the course of a year, the many thousands of passport  applications originating from one particular region should generally be  expected to generate a consistent rate of fraud referrals. In fiscal year 2004,  28 percent of passport applications were transferred to 1 of these 3 offices  for adjudication, while other issuing offices adjudicated 72 percent.  Although these 3 offices received 28 percent of the applications, they  provided only 11 percent of total fraud referrals to the originating agencies;  the other 89 percent were provided by regional agency passport examiners  (74 percent) and others, including acceptance agents (15 percent). For  fiscal year 2003, the 3 processing centers adjudicated 26 percent of the  applications but provided only 8 percent of the fraud referrals. In 2004, 1 of  the issuing offices transferred out to processing centers 63 percent of its  applications (about 287,000) but received back from the processing centers  only 2 percent of the fraud referrals it generated that year. In 2003, this  office transferred out 66 percent of its workload, while receiving back only  8 percent of its total fraud referrals.", "Fraud Prevention Managers and other officials told us that one reason  fewer fraud referrals return from these 3 offices is that passport examiners  handling workload transfers from a number of different regions are not as  familiar with the demographics, neighborhoods, and other local  characteristics of a particular region as are the examiners who live and  work there. For example, some officials noted that, in instances when they  suspect fraud, they might telephone the applicants to ask for additional  information so they can engage in polite conversation and ask casual  questions, such as where they grew up, what school they attended, and  other information. The officials noted that, since they are familiar with at  least some of the neighborhoods and schools in the area, applicants\u2019  answers to such questions may quickly indicate whether their application is  likely to be fraudulent. One examiner in an office that handled workload  transfers from areas with large Spanish-speaking populations said that the  office had an insufficient number of examiners who were fluent in Spanish.  She and other officials emphasized the usefulness of that skill in detecting  dialects, accents, handwriting, and cultural references that conflict with  information provided in passport applications.

We reviewed the training programs and  materials at all 7 issuing offices we visited and discussed the programs and  materials at other offices with the remaining nine Fraud Prevention  Managers by telephone and found that the topics covered and the amount  and depth of training varied widely by office. Some had developed region- specific materials; others relied more heavily on materials that had been  developed by passport officials in Washington, D.C., much of which were  outdated.

Some Fraud Prevention  Managers occasionally invite officials from other government agencies,  such as the Secret Service or DHS, to share their fraud expertise. However,  these meetings take place when time is available and may be canceled  during busy periods. For example, officials at one issuing office said the  monthly meetings had not been held for several months because of high  workload; another manager said he rarely has time for any monthly  meetings; and two others said they do not hold such discussions but e-mail  to examiners recent fraud trend alerts and information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Sporadic Training and Limited Oversight of Acceptance Agents Constitute Significant Fraud Vulnerability", "paragraphs": ["Numerous passport-issuing agency officials and Diplomatic Security  investigators told us that the acceptance agent program is a significant  fraud vulnerability.

Officials at one issuing office said that their office often  sees the same mistakes multiple times from the same agency.", "These officials attributed problems with applications received through  acceptance agents to the sporadic training provided for and limited  oversight of acceptance agents. State has almost 7,000 passport acceptance  agency offices, and none of the 16 issuing offices provide comprehensive  annual training or oversight to all acceptance agency offices in their area.  Instead, the issuing offices concentrate their training and oversight visits  on agency offices geographically nearest to the issuing offices, those in  large population centers, those where examiners and Fraud Prevention  Managers had reported problems, and those in high fraud areas. Larger  issuing offices in particular have trouble reaching acceptance agency staff.  At one larger issuing office with about 1,700 acceptance facilities, the  Fraud Prevention Manager said he does not have time to provide  acceptance agent training and that it is difficult for issuing office staff to  visit many agencies. A manager at another large issuing office that covers  an area including 11 states said she does not have time to visit some  agencies in less populated areas and concentrates her efforts in higher  fraud areas, which tend to be in the larger cities.", "Officials at one issuing agency noted that State had worked together with  the U.S. Postal Service to develop CD-ROM training for use at Postal  Service acceptance facilities. The officials noted that, while they believed  the training had been well designed, State does not have any way of  tracking whether all postal employees responsible for accepting passport  applications actually receive the training. Additionally, issuing office  officials also said that acceptance agent staff should receive training from  outside agencies such as state departments of motor vehicles, local police,  and the FBI on document authenticity and fraud. Other issuing office  officials said acceptance agents should also receive interview training.", "Finally, while State officials told us it is a requirement that all acceptance  agency staff be U.S. citizens, issuing agency officials told us they have no  way of verifying that all of them are.

A  Diplomatic Security official told us that, after the September 11 terrorist  attacks, the bureau hired about 300 additional agents, at least partially to  reduce investigative backlogs. Diplomatic Security and passport officials  told us that, while the increased staff resources had helped reduce  backlogs to some degree, agents assigned to passport fraud investigations  are still routinely pulled away for other assignments. For example, a  significant number of agents from field offices across the country are  required to serve on \u201cprotective detail\u201d in New York when the United  Nations General Assembly convenes and at various other diplomatic  events. We found that at most of the offices we visited during our  fieldwork, few of the agents responsible for investigating passport fraud  were actually physically present. At one office, all of the agents responsible  for investigating passport fraud were on temporary duty elsewhere, and the  one agent who was covering the office in their absence had left his  assignment at the local Joint Terrorism Task Force to do so. A number of  agents were on temporary assignments overseas in connection with the  2004 Summer Olympics in Greece. Agents at one office said that five of the  eight agents involved in passport fraud investigations there were being sent  for temporary duty in Iraq, as were many of their colleagues at other  offices.", "Agents at all but 2 of the 7 bureau field offices we visited said they are  unable to devote adequate time and continuity to investigating passport  fraud because of the competing demands on their time. The agents  expressed concerns about the resulting vulnerability to the integrity of the  U.S. passport system. We noted that the number of new passport fraud  investigations had declined by more than 25 percent over the last five  years, though Diplomatic Security officials attributed this trend, among  other factors, to refined targeting of cases that merit investigation. A  number of Diplomatic Security agents pointed out that passport fraud  investigations are often \u201ctime sensitive\u201d and that opportunities to solve  cases are often lost when too much time elapses before investigative  efforts are initiated or when such efforts occur in fits and starts. The  rotation of Diplomatic Security agents to new permanent duty stations  every 2 or 3 years also makes it more difficult to maintain continuity for  individual investigations. Passport-issuing office officials told us that cases  referred to Diplomatic Security sometimes take a year or more to  investigate. The officials also said that the investigating agents often do not  have time to apprise passport-issuing offices of the status of individual  investigations and, thus, that the opportunity to convey valuable \u201creal-time\u201d  feedback on the quality of fraud referrals was lost. The Special-Agent-in- Charge of a large Diplomatic Security field office in a high fraud region  expressed serious concern that, in 2002, the Bureau of Diplomatic Security  began requiring that most cases be closed after 12 months, whether or not  the investigations were complete. This requirement was meant to reduce  the backlog of old cases. The agent said that about 400 cases at his office  were closed before the investigations were complete and that this action  had taken place over his strenuous objection. A Diplomatic Security official  in Washington, D.C., told us that, while field offices had been encouraged to  close old cases that were not likely to be resolved, there had not been a  formal requirement to close all cases that had remained open beyond a  specific time limit.", "State officials agreed that Diplomatic Security agents are not currently able  to devote adequate attention to investigating passport fraud. State officials  told us that the Bureau of Diplomatic Security plans to hire 56 new  investigative agents over the next few years to augment passport fraud  investigation resources at each Diplomatic Security field office nationwide.  According to State officials, these new investigators will be solely  dedicated to investigating passport and visa fraud and will not participate  in protective details or other temporary duties that would distract them  from their investigative work. The new hires are to be civil service  employees and will not be subject to the frequent rotations to new duty  stations that regular Diplomatic Security agents experience as foreign- service officers.", "State Department OIG officials told us that the OIG also has authority to  investigate passport fraud. However, OIG officials told us that budgetary  constraints and related staffing reductions in recent years had severely  restricted its ability to investigate such fraud. The OIG has invested more  resources in efforts to pursue visa fraud, primarily because visa fraud is  more prevalent than passport fraud. The OIG has focused most of its more  recent passport-related efforts on assessing systematic weaknesses in  fraud detection efforts.

State tested examiner production capabilities before  standardizing the passport examination process and used the test results in  conjunction with old standards to set new nationwide standards.

In an effort to identify reasonable production  standards that would be applicable nationwide, State tested examiner  production capabilities at all of its domestic passport-issuing offices.  Issuing office management in each of the 16 offices measured the number  of passport cases completed by each examiner over a two-week period in  April 2003 and computed the hourly average for their office. Management  did not inform examiners that their production rates were being measured  for the test.", "Passport Services officials set the new performance standards, but they did  not fully standardize some work processes and methods of counting  production until after the new numbers were set. After considering  nationwide test results, offices\u2019 old standards, and passport office  partnership council feedback, headquarters officials at Passport Services  decided on the new standards for both desk and counter adjudication. The  new standards were implemented in January 2004 and varied by pay grade  level. After deciding on the production standards, State standardized the  work processes and counting methods that were the basis of examiners\u2019  production averages. For example, State officials encouraged all domestic  passport offices to include expedited cases in examiners\u2019 production  averages to make examiners\u2019 work more comparable nationwide, though  some examiners and issuing office managers said expedited cases take  longer to complete because they require additional steps. Also, State\u2019s  decision to base examiner\u2019s production averages on a 7-hour day starting in  January 2004 marked a change for offices that previously had measured  production based on a 6\u00bd- or 7\u00bd-hour day.", "State\u2019s decision to measure and compile nationwide production averages  before fully standardizing the application examination process and the way  completed cases are counted at the passport-issuing offices limited the  validity of State\u2019s test results. GAO has reported that consistency is a key  element for data reliability and that the data obtained and used must be  clear and well-defined enough to yield similar results in similar analyses.  However, we found that State had attempted to uniformly measure  production capacity at its 16 issuing offices when the individual offices  were still using differing work processes and methods of counting  production. Upon visiting 7 of the 16 offices after the new standards had  been implemented, we found that several differences in passport  adjudication practices and methods for counting production still existed.  For example, at some offices, the more complex and time-consuming cases  were included in examiner production averages, while at other offices they  were not. In addition, issuing office and headquarters management told us  that contract staff at some issuing offices performed certain tasks that  helped speed up examiner production, while such tasks were performed by  examiners at other offices. State told us 5 months after they had  implemented the standards that domestic offices\u2019 requirements for  counting completed cases still varied and that this situation could make it  easier for examiners at some offices to meet their production standard.  State officials acknowledged that these processes and procedures should  be standardized to ensure that the standards are fair. If State had  standardized its work processes and procedures for measuring  performance before testing production, the test would presumably have  produced more valid results that could have been used to set uniformly  attainable production standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Production Standards\u2019 Effect on Fraud Detection Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Because State adjusted the impact of production on examiners\u2019  evaluations, the production standards implemented in 2004 placed  increased pressure on examiners to focus on production numbers. Before  State introduced the new standards, quantitative production requirements  were grouped together with qualitative measures for performance ratings.  For example, one former evaluative element paired the requirement that a  GS-11 examiner adjudicate 25 to 28 cases per hour with a qualitative  assessment of the examiner\u2019s overall knowledge of the adjudication  process. Supervisors and management officials at some of the domestic  passport offices we visited said that if in previous years examiners failed to  meet their minimum production number, the supervisor could still rate the  examiner fully successful based on better performance against qualitative  standards within the same rating element. However, the 2004 standards  separated the quantitative performance measures\u2014production numbers  and error rates\u2014from qualitative elements. Examiners not meeting the  minimum hourly production average for the year were to receive an  unsuccessful rating on that performance element, regardless of qualitative  performance. An unsuccessful rating in one element results in an  unsuccessful rating overall, even if the examiner rates outstanding in the  other three skill elements. State officials said they made this change to  clarify the criteria on which examiners were rated.", "Since the new production standards were set, State has incorporated  computer upgrades and process changes that have enhanced fraud  detection, but may have slowed the examination process. For example, at  passport office counters, State upgraded the computer system to allow  examiners to perform cashiering functions and to produce a receipt  immediately for all financial transactions, thus adding time to each case  requiring a fee. In addition, State added a page to the standard passport  application in March 2005, thus requiring more information from each new  applicant. Headquarters officials, regional office managers, and examiners  agreed that these changes enhance fraud prevention efforts. But while they  were pleased with the enhanced fraud detection capabilities, some  examiners and examiners\u2019 union representatives told us the changes may  slow production now that examiners are required, for example, to  scrutinize longer applications.", "Passport examiners and union officials argue that the new standards\u2019  emphasis on production combined with changes to the examination  process have made it more difficult to meet the new production standards  without shortcutting fraud detection efforts. Some examiners we talked to  said changes to annual evaluation criteria and to the examination process  put additional pressure on them to focus on their numbers more than their  efforts to detect fraud. Some also told us they believe the new standards  were evidence that management prioritizes quantity of work over quality.  Union representatives said examiners frequently complain that, to achieve  their number targets, they have to skip required steps in the examination  process or scrutinize applications less thoroughly than necessary to  adequately detect fraud. A number of examiners at each domestic office we  visited either stated they take shortcuts themselves or know colleagues  who do. Some said, for example, they do not thoroughly check Social  Security information provided on the computerized examination software  against the information on the individual\u2019s application. Others reported  they do not thoroughly check all \u201chits\u201d generated by the computer  software\u2014information that may help identify applicants flagged as  fugitives or raise other concerns in one of State\u2019s passport-related  databases. An examiner noted that most hits, when further scrutinized,  prove to be invalid, and thus the chances of missing a valid hit were low.  Union representatives said they are hesitant to share such examples with  passport management because examiners fear negative repercussions.", "Headquarters and regional office management said it is difficult to assess  the number or magnitude of shortcuts being taken and the impact of  shortcuts on fraud detection. Management officials at some of the offices  we visited said supervisors audit only a limited percentage of cases after  they are examined and that audits would not necessarily reveal that  examiners had taken shortcuts. The impact of shortcuts on fraud detection  is also difficult to assess because the overall incidence of detected fraud is  low. One examiner noted that if she failed to check any fraud indicators at  all and granted a passport to every applicant, she would be right more than  99 percent of the time. State data show that less than one-half of 1 percent  of applications in 2004 were identified as potential frauds.", "Because State has modified the 2004 production standards in response to  management, union, and examiner concerns, the standards\u2019 effect on fraud  detection is unclear. State officials told us that, from the outset of  implementing the production standards, they had planned to reassess the  standards regularly and to adjust them as necessary. In July 2004, State  responded to a union suggestion to reduce by one-half hour the number of  daily work hours used to calculate the hourly production average, thus  acknowledging that time examiners spend doing essential tasks, such as  reading e-mail updates, should not be factored into their hourly production  averages. Both desk and counter examination production standards were  lowered during 2004, and certain offices were exempted from either desk  or counter measurement due to regional workload variations. One such  exemption occurred in September 2004, when State informed regional  management that neither New York nor Hawaii should rate examiners on  desk examination production averages in 2004 because their desk  workloads were too low to enable a fair rating of examiners. Also,  headquarters passport management lowered the counter production  requirement for GS-9 and GS-11 passport examiners retroactive to January 1, 2004. While about 63 examiners were not achieving the required  production rate after the first quarter of 2004, all but 18 of State\u2019s  approximately 480 examiners nationwide had met the standards by the end  of the year.

We chose these fieldwork locations to  gain an appropriate mix of geographic coverage, workload, levels and types  of passport fraud, and counter-to-desk adjudication ratios. In addition, we  chose the Charleston office because it is one of the two passport  \u201cmegacenters\u201d responsible for adjudicating applications from other  regions.", "To test the electronic databases that State uses to help detect fraud, we ran  the names of 67 different federal and state fugitives against State\u2019s CLASS  name-check system. Our test was not intended to employ a representative  sample, and we did not generalize our results to the universe of wanted  U.S. citizens. The test results were intended to provide a firsthand  illustration of a problem that State and Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) officials acknowledge exists.", "We selected names of individuals with federal and state warrants from a  variety of government agencies and offices\u2014the FBI; U.S. Marshal\u2019s  Service; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives; Drug  Enforcement Administration; U.S. Postal Service; and various state and  local law enforcement offices. Many of the names were taken from  publicly available Internet sites, including those operated by the FBI and  Department of Justice.", "We verified that all of the individuals were listed as \u201cwanted\u201d in the FBI\u2019s  national criminal database as of the date of our test in December 2004.", "In December 2004, we supervised the entry of the name and date of birth  of each of the 67 fugitives into State\u2019s system by an Office of Passport  Services official. Three GAO employees verified each entry\u2019s accuracy.", "For each entry, we recorded whether State\u2019s system contained a record  of that fugitive and, if it did, we noted the type of \u201clookout\u201d that had  been entered, such as wanted person information from the U.S.  Marshal\u2019s Service or a child support \u201clookout\u201d from Health and Human  Services.", "We analyzed fraud referral statistics from the Consular Affairs Office of  Passport Services and the Bureau of Diplomatic Security for fiscal years  2000 through 2004. We reviewed the statistics and verified their accuracy  by comparing select data with the individual issuing offices\u2019 monthly  reports that are State\u2019s original source for compiling these data. Together  with Passport Services officials, we identified the methods used to capture  and compile the data and determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable and generally usable for the purposes of our study. We did not use  data elements that we did not deem reliable.", "At each of the 7 offices we visited, we conducted interviews with officials  such as the Regional Director, Assistant Regional Director, Fraud  Prevention Manager, Adjudication Manager, Customer Service Manager,  supervisors, and certain passport examiners. We interviewed some  examiners who expressed an interest in meeting with us and chose others  at random. We conducted telephone interviews with the Fraud Prevention  Managers at all 9 of the offices that we did not visit, using a list of questions  identical to that used in interviews with their counterparts at offices we  visited. We also met with Diplomatic Security agents attached to field  offices responsible for investigating fraud suspected at the offices we  visited. In addition, we interviewed cognizant officials in Consular Affairs\u2019  Office of Passport Services, Office of Consular Fraud Prevention, and  Consular Systems Division; the Bureau of Diplomatic Security; and the  Office of the Inspector General. We also met with FBI and Terrorist  Screening Center officials, including attorneys, to discuss technical and  potential legal issues that might affect interagency information sharing  arrangements with State.", "To assess the potential effect of new performance standards, which were  implemented in January 2004, on State\u2019s fraud detection efforts, we  reviewed the methodology and criteria that State used in developing the  new standards. We compared the adjudication processes that were in place  when State tested examiner production capacity with those in place when  State implemented the new standards and against which it applied them.  We interviewed passport examiner union representatives and select  examiners at the 7 offices we visited and the fraud prevention managers at  all 16 domestic passport-issuing offices to obtain their views on the  potential effect of the new standards on fraud detection efforts. We also  obtained views on the same subject from the Consular Affairs Passport  Services officials who oversaw the development and implementation of  and ongoing adjustments to the new standards.", "We conducted our work from May 2004 to March 2005 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Jeffrey Baldwin-Bott, Joseph  Carney, Paul Desaulniers, and Edward Kennedy made key contributions to  this report.
