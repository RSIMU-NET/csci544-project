These include interagency contracts--where one agency uses another's contract for its own needs--such as the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Department of Veterans Affairs multiple award schedule (MAS) contracts, multiagency contracts (MAC) for a wide range of goods and services, and governmentwide acquisition contracts (GWAC) for information technology. Agencies spent at least $60 billion in fiscal year 2008 through these contracts and similar single-agency enterprisewide contracts. GAO was asked to testify on the management and oversight of interagency contracts, and how the government can ensure that interagency contracting is efficient and transparent. GAO's testimony is based on its recent report, Contracting Strategies: Data and Oversight Problems Hamper Opportunities to Leverage Value of Interagency and Enterprisewide Contracts ( GAO-10-367 , April 2010). In that report, GAO made recommendations to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to strengthen policy, improve data, and better coordinate agencies' awards of MACs and enterprisewide contracts, and to GSA to improve MAS program pricing and management. Both agencies concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Interagency and enterprisewide contracts should provide an advantage to government agencies when buying billions of dollars worth of goods and services, yet OMB and agencies lack reliable and comprehensive data to effectively leverage, manage, and oversee these contracts. More specifically, the total number of MACs and enterprisewide contracts currently approved and in use by agencies is unknown because the federal government's official procurement database is not sufficient or reliable for identifying these contracts. Departments and agencies cite a variety of reasons to establish, justify, and use their own MACs and enterprisewide contracts rather than use other established interagency contracts--reasons that include avoiding fees paid for the use of other agencies' contracts, gaining more control over procurements made by organizational components, and allowing for the use of cost reimbursement contracts. However, concerns remain about contract duplication--under these conditions, many of the same vendors provided similar products and services on multiple contracts, which increases costs to both the vendor and the government and can result in missed opportunities to leverage the government's buying power. Furthermore, limited governmentwide policy is in place for establishing and overseeing MACs and enterprisewide contracts. Recent legislation and OMB's Office of Federal Procurement Policy initiatives are expected to strengthen oversight and management of MACs, but no initiatives are underway to strengthen approval and oversight of enterprisewide contracts. GSA faces a number of challenges in effectively managing the MAS program, the federal government's largest interagency contracting program. GSA lacks data on orders placed under MAS contracts that it could use to help determine how well the MAS program meets its customers' needs and help its customers obtain the best prices in using MAS contracts. In addition, GSA makes limited use of selected pricing tools, such as pre-award audits of MAS contracts, which make it difficult for GSA to determine whether the program achieves its goal of obtaining the best prices for customers and taxpayers. In 2008, GSA established a program office with broad responsibility for MAS program policy and strategy, but the program continues to operate under a decentralized management structure that some program stakeholders are concerned has impaired the consistent implementation of policies across the program and the sharing of information among the business portfolios. In addition, performance measures were inconsistent across the GSA organizations that manage MAS contracts, including inconsistent emphasis on pricing, making it difficult to have a programwide perspective of MAS program performance. Finally, GSA's MAS customer satisfaction survey has had a response rate of 1 percent or less in recent years that limits its utility as a means for evaluating program performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss the management and oversight of  contracts designed to leverage the government\u2019s buying power when  acquiring commercial goods and services.  To address these issues, I will  discuss our recent report that addressed the need for better data and  management to effectively oversee the awarding and use of interagency  and enterprisewide contracts. Collectively, federal agencies used these  types of contracts to buy at least $60 billion in goods and services during  fiscal year 2008. When managed properly, interagency contracting\u2014a  process by which one agency uses another agency\u2019s contract directly or  obtains contracting support services from another agency\u2014can provide  several benefits for federal agencies. These include the ability to leverage  the government\u2019s aggregate buying power for commercial goods and  services and provide a simplified and expedited procurement method.  Enterprisewide contracts, although not interagency contracts, are also  intended to leverage a particular agency\u2019s buying power and appear to  have become more popular in recent years according to procurement  officials, as internal purchasing programs established within a federal  department or agency to acquire goods and services. Benefits of  enterprisewide contracts can include the ability to reduce contracting  administrative overhead within an agency and provide information on  agency spending.", "To realize the benefits of using interagency contracts\u2014including the  multiple award schedule (MAS) program, multiagency contracts (MACs),  and governmentwide acquisition programs (GWACs)\u2014as well as single- agency enterprisewide contracts, the government will have to take steps to  address identified shortcomings in the management of and amount of data  available on both interagency and enterprisewide contracts that currently  make it difficult to determine whether they are being used in an efficient  and effective manner. A basic problem is the lack of data about the  number and sponsors of both MACs and enterprisewide contracts. Given  that there has been renewed focus on maximizing efficiencies in the  procurement process to achieve cost savings, we believe the federal  government will continue to miss opportunities to leverage its vast  purchasing power when buying commercial goods and services unless it  takes steps to improve the management and oversight of these contracts.", "In response to this Subcommittee\u2019s interest in improving the use of these  contracts, I will draw primarily on our recent report to discuss (1) issues  related to transparency and the framework for managing GWACs, MACs,  and enterprisewide contracts, and (2) management and pricing issues  associated specifically with the MAS program.", "We conducted this work at the Office of Federal Procurement Policy  (OFPP) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which has  governmentwide procurement policy responsibility.

We also met with  Senior Procurement Executives or their representiaves from these  agencies, 16 vendors that have been awarded these contracts, and 17  contracting officers from a number of the agencies in our review to obtain  their perspectives on interagency and enterprisewide contracts. The report  that formed the basis for this statement was prepared in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

These fees are  usually a percentage of the value of the procurement, which are paid to  the sponsoring agency and are expected to cover the costs of  administering the contract.", "Along with using interagency contracts to leverage their buying power, a  number of large departments\u2014DOD and DHS in particular\u2014are turning to  enterprisewide contracts as well to acquire goods and services.  Enterprisewide contracts are similar to interagency contracts in that they  can leverage the purchasing power of the federal agency but generally do  not allow purchases from the contract outside of the original acquiring  activity.", "Enterprisewide contracting programs can be used to reduce contracting  administrative overhead, provide information on agency spending, support  strategic sourcing initiatives, and avoid the fees charged for using  interagency contracts.", "All of these contracts are indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (ID/IQ)  contracts. ID/IQ contracts are established to buy goods and services when  the exact times and exact quantities of future deliveries are not known at  the time of award.

However,  the total amount of money spent in fiscal year 2008 using the three  enterprisewide contracting programs included in our review is  approaching the amount spent for GWACs during the same period. In  addition, as OMB recently reported, numerous agencies are planning to  increase their use of enterprisewide contracts as a means of addressing  the administration\u2019s goal of reducing the amount agencies spend on  contracting by 7 percent through fiscal year 2011.", "Nevertheless, GSA\u2019s MAS program is still the primary governmentwide  buying program aimed at helping the federal government leverage its  significant buying power when buying commercial goods and services. As  the largest interagency contracting program, the MAS program provides  advantages to both federal agencies and vendors. Agencies, using the  simplified methods of procurement of the schedules, can avoid the time,  expenditures, and administrative costs of other methods.

However, the initiative was a one-time effort and has not been  updated since. In conducting our review, we were not able to identify the  universe of MACs and enterprisewide contracts because the data available  in the official government contracting data system, the Federal  Procurement Data System-Next Generation (FPDS-NG), were insufficient  and unreliable.  For instance, FPDS-NG includes a data field that is  intended to identify GWACs but we found a number of instances where  known GWACs were coded incorrectly.

The  Army wanted to standardize its information technology contracts so  each contract would include the required Army and DOD security  parameters. According to the Army, GSA contracts do not  automatically include these security requirements and using a GSA  contract would require adding these terms to every order. The Army  also cited timeliness concerns with GSA contracts and GSA fees as  reasons for establishing their own contracting vehicles.  In 2005, DHS established the EAGLE and FirstSource contracting  programs.  Both involve enterprisewide contracts used for information  technology products and services. Officials stated the main reason  these programs were established was to avoid the fees associated with  using other contract vehicles and save money through volume pricing.
