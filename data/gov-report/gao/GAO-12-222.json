Trust-fund revenues come largely from taxes on airline tickets and aviation fuel. The financial health of the trust fund is important to ensure sustainable funding for FAA without increasing demands on general revenues. Current law authorizes appropriations from the trust fund equal to forecast trust-fund revenues. However, if forecasts overestimate actual revenues and Congress appropriates the forecast level, the trust fund\u0092s uncommitted balance\u0097that is, the balance in excess of what has been appropriated from the fund or authorized as contract authority\u0097is drawn down.", "Among its objectives, GAO was asked to examine (1) the accuracy of the trust-fund revenue forecasts and factors affecting forecast accuracy, (2) different options for determining appropriations from the trust fund that would reduce the risk of overcommitting the fund, and (3) the extent to which trust-fund revenues might cover planned FAA expenditures through fiscal year 2021. GAO reviewed the Department of the Treasury\u0092s (Treasury) and FAA\u0092s forecasting methods, analyzed trust-fund revenue and forecast data, and interviewed federal officials and aviation-industry and forecasting experts. The Departments of Transportation and Treasury and the Office of Management and Budget provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated into the report as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Actual trust-fund revenues fell short of FAA\u0092s revenue forecasts for 9 of the past 11 years, contributing to a decline in the trust fund\u0092s uncommitted balance from over $7 billion in fiscal year 2000 to $770 million in fiscal year 2010. Inaccurate forecasts for the taxes related to domestic passenger tickets, which account for over 70 percent of trust-fund revenues, drove the aggregate overforecast, but inaccurate forecasts for other taxes also had an effect. This inaccuracy is largely attributable to unexpected events affecting aviation, such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the recession in 2009; the budget process requiring the forecasts to be developed over a year in advance of the fiscal year; and lags in recognizing structural changes in the airline industry, such as airlines\u0092 increased reliance on ancillary fees for which excise taxes for the trust fund are not collected. Changes in the methodology for forecasting trust-fund revenues and the assumption of forecasting responsibility by Treasury, begun in fiscal year 2011, may also affect the future accuracy of forecasts, but it is too soon to tell what effect the changes will have after just 1 fiscal year.", "Alternative options for how Congress determines available resources for appropriation from the trust fund could provide for substantially greater protection against overcommitting trust-fund resources\u0097that is, help ensure that trust-fund revenues would be sufficient to cover FAA\u0092s expenditures\u0097or requiring additional general-revenue contributions than the current approach outlined in law. To this end, Congress could limit budget resources available for appropriation from the trust fund to less than the forecast revenues\u0097for example, the current House FAA Reauthorization bill has a provision that would make only 90 percent of forecast revenues available for appropriation from the trust fund as well as any prior year differences between actual trust-fund revenues and appropriations from the trust fund. Other options would make only actual revenues from the prior year available, or base appropriations on the maintenance of a target level for the trust fund\u0092s balance. However, unless a sufficiently large minimum balance is established, there would still be some risk of overcommitting trust-fund resources under these options. The alternatives could also result in greater swings in trust-fund appropriations, requiring varying levels of general revenues to maintain overall stable spending levels for FAA.", "The extent to which trust-fund revenues might cover FAA\u0092s future expenditures will depend on whether trust-fund revenue and FAA expenditure forecasts are realized. Under current revenue and expenditure forecasts, between 8 percent and 32 percent of FAA\u0092s annual expenditures for fiscal years 2013 through 2021 could have to be paid for by general revenues unless spending is reduced or additional taxes are paid into the trust fund. However, congressional decisions, including the level of FAA\u0092s appropriations; unexpected events affecting trust-fund revenues and FAA expenditures; and FAA\u0092s implementation and management of programs could significantly change forecast revenues and expenditures in future years. For example, FAA\u0092s modernization of the air traffic control system, called the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), is currently estimated to cost FAA $15 billion to $22 billion, and an additional $5 billion to $7 billion for equipping aircraft with NextGen technology, but those costs could change depending upon the speed of implementation and other factors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Established in 1970, the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (trust fund)  finances nearly all of the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) capital  investments in the airport and airway system, such as construction and  safety improvements at airports and technological upgrades to the air  traffic control system. The trust fund also provides a substantial portion\u2014 between 43 and 84 percent over the last 10 years\u2014of FAA\u2019s operations  spending, which includes the maintenance and operation of the air traffic  control system and safety inspections. The trust fund is principally funded  by a variety of excise taxes paid by users of the national airspace system,  and its financial health is important to ensure sustainable funding for a  safe and efficient aviation system without increasing demands on general  revenues. Current law requires that all of the forecast trust-fund  revenues\u2014that is, the projected amount contained in the President\u2019s  annual budget request\u2014be made available each fiscal year for  appropriation. However, in recent years, forecasting errors\u2014particularly,  several years of overestimated revenues\u2014have contributed to a  drawdown of the trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance. As the uncommitted  balance approaches zero, the trust fund could become overcommited\u2014 that is, revenues could be insufficient to cover all of the funding that  Congress has committed. This risk of overcommitting funds could create  budgetary challenges for FAA and require larger general-revenue  appropriations to fund FAA\u2019s operations spending.  For example, as we  have previously reported to this committee, Congress increased the  general-revenue appropriation for FAA\u2019s operations by nearly $1 billion in  fiscal years 2009 and 2010. If these actions had not occurred, the trust  fund would have been overcommitted.", "In this context, you asked us to examine the trust-fund revenue- forecasting process. To address your request, we examined (1) how trust- fund revenues are forecast for the budget year; (2) the accuracy of past  trust-fund revenue forecasts and the factors affecting forecast accuracy;  (3) how different options for estimating appropriations from the trust fund  might reduce the risk of overcommitting the trust fund; and (4) the extent  to which trust-fund revenues might cover planned FAA expenditures in  fiscal years 2012 through 2021.", "To determine how trust-fund revenues are forecast for the President\u2019s  budget, we interviewed FAA and Department of the Treasury (Treasury)  officials on the forecasting methods used and the forecasts developed for  fiscal years 2000 through 2011. To determine the accuracy of trust-fund  revenue forecasts, we obtained FAA\u2019s forecasts of excise tax receipts  and interest revenue for fiscal years 2000 through 2010, which we  compared to the sum of trust-fund tax receipts, as certified by the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS), and interest revenue data from FAA. We  reviewed academic literature and interviewed aviation-industry and  forecasting experts to identify factors affecting forecast accuracy. To  evaluate different options for estimating appropriations from the trust  fund, we identified four options based on our previous trust-fund work  and analyzed these options using actual and forecast trust-fund tax- receipt data for fiscal years 2000 through 2010. One of these options  includes a provision in the current House FAA reauthorization bill that  would limit the budget resources made available for appropriation from  the trust fund to 90 percent, rather than 100 percent, of forecast revenues  and apply any differences between actual trust-fund revenues and  appropriations from the trust fund to a subsequent year. The other  options include using a prior year\u2019s actual trust-fund revenue amount as  the basis for the appropriation and setting a target level for the trust fund\u2019s  uncommitted balance\u2014such as $2 billion or $3 billion. Through analyzing  these options, we determined how they might have affected the total  amount of budget resources made available from the trust fund for  appropriation and the trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance, if the options had  been followed in fiscal years 2000 through 2010. For this report, our  analysis assumes that obligations against the trust fund will equal the  amounts authorized and that FAA\u2019s outlays in a given year to liquidate  obligations equal the amounts appropriated for that purpose.", "To determine the extent to which trust-fund revenues might cover FAA  expenditures in fiscal years 2012 through 2021, we examined Treasury\u2019s  trust-fund revenue forecasts and the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s  (OMB) budget authority forecasts for FAA for fiscal years 2012 through  2021 from the President\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget request and mid- session review (the latest available forecast). We reviewed OMB budget  guidance and interviewed OMB, Treasury, and FAA officials to  understand the basis of these forecasts and potential factors affecting  forecast accuracy. We also reviewed FAA\u2019s fiscal year 2012  appropriation and the House and Senate FAA reauthorization bills and  drew from our previous work on FAA\u2019s program and acquisition  management to identify potential factors affecting forecast accuracy. We  assessed the reliability of the FAA, IRS, OMB, and Treasury data by (1)  performing electronic testing of required data elements, (2) reviewing  existing information about the data and the systems that produced them,  and (3) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. We conducted this performance audit from April 2011 to January  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

The trust fund is funded principally by a variety of excise taxes  paid by users of the national airspace system, as well as by interest  revenue. The excise taxes are imposed on airline ticket purchases and  aviation fuel, as well as the shipment of cargo. Disbursement of revenues  deposited in the trust fund is subject to congressional appropriations.  These taxes are classified in six categories or \u201ctax lines,\u201d as shown in  table 1.", "The trust fund finances capital improvements of the airport and airway  system, and to the extent funds are made available, it funds the  government\u2019s operation and maintenance of that system. Figure 1 shows  how trust-fund revenues were appropriated to FAA\u2019s operations and capital  accounts for fiscal year 2010, which generally represents the breakout of  trust-fund revenue use for recent years. FAA\u2019s three capital accounts  include (1) the Facilities and Equipment account, which funds technological  improvements to the air traffic control system, including the modernization of  the air traffic control system called the Next Generation Air Transportation  System (NextGen); (2) the Research, Engineering, and Development  account, which funds research on issues related to aviation safety, mobility,  and NextGen technologies; and (3) the Airport Improvement Program (AIP),  which provides grants for airport planning and development. In addition, the  trust fund has provided all or some portion of the funding for FAA\u2019s  operations account, which funds the operation of the air traffic control system  and safety inspections, among other activities. General revenues from the  U.S. Treasury have been used to supplement trust-fund revenues for  operations and have funded about 16 to 57 percent of FAA\u2019s operation  appropriation\u2014or 8 to 33 percent of FAA\u2019s total appropriation\u2014during fiscal  years 2001 through 2010.", "From the trust fund\u2019s creation in 1970 through the late 1990s,  appropriations from the trust fund were consistently lower than revenues  deposited into the trust fund, resulting in a growing uncommitted balance.  To ensure that revenue collected from persons and businesses paying  taxes into the trust fund are used for aviation purposes, AIR-21 and  Vision 100, which reauthorized FAA investments in the airport and airway  system, added certain provisions. These provisions require that the total  budget resources made available each fiscal year from the trust fund\u2014 that is, the appropriation from the trust fund\u2014equal the President\u2019s  baseline budget projection, or forecast, for excise taxes and interest  credited to the trust fund for the coming fiscal year (budget year).2000, appropriations from the trust fund have generally followed the  forecast amounts, but they can, and have, varied\u2014a point we discuss in  more detail later in this report.", "The budget-year trust-fund revenue forecast, and accordingly FAA\u2019s  appropriation, is based on information available in the first quarter of the  preceding fiscal year and more than 2 years before the final accounting  for the forecast year is certified by IRS. Figure 2 shows the timeline for  the fiscal year 2010 budget process, which generally reflects a typical  budget cycle for recent years. Because the President\u2019s budget is released about 8 months before the beginning of the fiscal year, the  revenue forecast for the fiscal year 2010 budget submission to Congress  was developed in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009\u2014October through  December of calendar year 2008\u2014or about a year before the start of the  fiscal year. Furthermore, the most recent available data on actual trust- fund revenues (IRS-certified tax-receipt data) for preparing this forecast  were from the first three quarters of fiscal year 2008, or through June 30,  2008. Likewise, the accuracy of the fiscal year 2010 revenue forecasts  could not be assessed against IRS-certified data until February 2011,  which was 5 months after the end of the fiscal year. In addition to the  budget-year forecast, the President\u2019s budget includes revenue forecasts  for the 9 years beyond the budget year (referred to as out-year forecasts),  which are then updated during roughly the middle of the calendar year as  part of the mid-session review.", "Through fiscal year 2010, FAA generated the trust-fund revenue forecast  for the President\u2019s annual budget request.

Budget authority forecasts represent the estimated amount  that may be requested for FAA to enter into obligations that will result in  outlays of federal funds; in this report, we refer to FAA\u2019s forecast budget  authority as its forecast expenditures. According to OMB budget guidance,  OMB forecasts the out-year budget-authority levels for agencies based on  proposed changes in legislation along with the administration\u2019s overall  policy goals and forecasts of economic growth. As this guidance indicates,  these forecasts are developed to allow an analysis of the long-term  consequences of proposed program or tax-policy initiatives.

Specifically, according to Treasury officials,  Treasury begins its forecast by estimating activity measures that reflect  aviation demand, such as domestic enplanements, international  enplanements, revenue-ton miles, and purchased gallons of fuel and   gasoline. For example, in estimating aviation demand as measured by  domestic enplanements, Treasury assumes these enplanements grow  with the economy and population and are a function of ticket prices and  certain other factors, which is consistent with economic theory. Similarly,  according to Treasury officials, Treasury forecasts all other aviation  activity measures for future years based on elements of the economy that  are likely to affect growth in those activities. In addition, Treasury  estimates average ticket prices.

According to  FAA officials, FAA developed its budget-year revenue forecast using  airlines\u2019 schedules for the upcoming several months to estimate airline  capacity\u2014most notably, available seat miles (the number of available  seats and scheduled distance). These capacity measures, along with  historical and economic data and professional judgment, enabled FAA to  forecast several activity measures, such as revenue passenger miles  and enplanements for both mainline and commuter carriers, as well as  cargo and mail revenue-ton miles. For example, FAA used its estimate of  available seat miles together with its estimate of average load factors (the  percentage of seats that are filled) to forecast revenue passenger miles.  Other capacity measures, such as available seat miles on international  flights and the size and usage patterns of the general aviation fleet,  enabled FAA to develop other aviation activity forecasts, such as  international enplanements and gallons of purchased aviation fuels,  respectively. In addition, FAA forecast pricing factors\u2014such as mainline  and commuter passenger yields as well as cargo yields\u2014based largely  on recent fares, cargo transport prices, trends, and professional  judgment. In forecasting activity measures for the out-years (the 9 years  beyond the budget year)\u2014which are not used to determine the budget  year\u2019s appropriation\u2014FAA used a demand-based econometric approach  similar to Treasury\u2019s current approach, both of which assume no limits on  capacity that would prevent demand from being met. FAA officials told  us they used a capacity-based approach for the budget-year forecast  because they viewed the airlines\u2019 recent and near-term planned capacity  as a more accurate basis for projecting aviation activity in the near term  than the demand-based econometric model they used for out-year  forecasts.", "FAA used these activity and pricing forecasts to calculate its revenue  forecasts for all nine trust-fund-related individual tax sources listed in  table 1. One notable difference from Treasury\u2019s current approach is that  FAA separately forecast enplanements involving an airport in Alaska or  Hawaii, which are taxed at a different rate from other enplanements.", "Additionally, because tickets sold through frequent-flyer programs are not  assessed passenger ticket taxes, FAA used estimates of the sales of  frequent-flyer mileage awards to augment its forecast for the domestic  passenger ticket tax for these sales and reduce estimates of all segment  taxes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "It Is Too Soon to Compare the Accuracy of FAA\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s Budget Year Forecasting Approaches", "paragraphs": ["After just 1 year and without certified receipts for the fourth quarter of  2011, it is too soon to tell whether Treasury\u2019s demand-based econometric  approach will provide more accurate revenue forecasts for the budget  year than FAA\u2019s more detailed, capacity-based approach. According to  forecasting experts that we interviewed, neither approach is necessarily  better given the inherent uncertainty associated with forecasting. Despite  these differences in Treasury\u2019s and FAA\u2019s approaches, several years of  Treasury forecasts and corresponding actual revenues would be needed  to meaningfully compare the results of the two agencies\u2019 methodologies  and gauge the efficacy of their approaches. Furthermore, comparing  forecast methods, even with several years of data, can be inconclusive.  Forecasting is inherently uncertain, and, as one forecasting expert noted,  luck can be a factor in accurate forecasting.

Because  Congress considers forecast trust-fund revenues in its appropriation from  the trust fund, this overforecasting has contributed to the decline in the  trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance. However, the effect of this inaccuracy  on the overall difference between appropriations and actual revenues\u2014 and ultimately, the trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance\u2014was smaller than it  would otherwise have been because, for fiscal years 2000 through 2010,  Congress appropriated $2.4 billion less from the trust fund than the  forecast revenues (fig. 4). More specifically, Congress can choose to  appropriate more or less than the forecast trust-fund revenues\u2014which  include forecasts of tax receipts and interest revenue and serve as the  basis for the authorized level of funding\u2014and actual revenues may be  higher or lower than forecast. For example, for fiscal year 2005,   Congress appropriated $59 million less than the forecast revenues, and  the revenue forecast was $414 million higher than the actual revenues.  Together, these effects netted a $355 million decline in the trust fund\u2019s  uncommitted balance. For fiscal years 2009 and 2010, the amount  Congress appropriated from the trust fund was substantially less than the  forecast revenues\u2014$2.7 billion\u2014which prevented the trust fund\u2019s balance  from being overcommitted. To help offset declining revenues in 2009 and  2010, Congress increased FAA\u2019s appropriations from general revenues in  these years. The net outcome of these two effects varied during fiscal  years 2000 through 2010, but together, appropriations from the trust fund  were $6.9 billion greater than actual revenues over this period.", "Inaccurate forecasts of taxes on the transportation of persons by air\u2014the  tax line composed of the domestic passenger ticket tax, the domestic  segment tax, and the mileage award tax\u2014was the major factor affecting  the aggregate forecast inaccuracy, as shown in figure 5. These taxes  account for 70 percent of trust-fund tax receipts and 73 percent of FAA\u2019s  forecast error for fiscal years 2000 through 2010. Inaccuracy in  forecasting both gasoline and fuel taxes and taxes on the transportation  of property by air accounted for a disproportionate amount of the  aggregate forecast inaccuracy. Taxes on gasoline and fuel accounted for  7 percent of total tax receipts for fiscal years 2000 through 2010, yet  forecasts for them accounted for 20 percent of the total forecast  inaccuracy. Similarly, taxes on the transportation of property by air  accounted for 5 percent of total tax receipts for the same period, but  forecasts for them accounted for 13 percent of the total forecast  inaccuracy. Furthermore, the effects of these overforecasts were offset  somewhat by underforecasts of taxes on the use of international air  facilities. For fiscal years 2000 through 2010, these taxes accounted for  18 percent of total trust-fund tax receipts, yet the forecasts for these taxes  were less than the actual revenues.", "Several factors make forecasting trust-fund revenues a challenge  including: (1) unexpected events that rapidly shift the demand for aviation  services, (2) the timing of the forecasts, and (3) the difficulty of  recognizing when apparent changes in the industry are transitory or  permanent. These factors can affect the accuracy of both activity and  pricing forecasts used to generate the revenue forecasts.", "Unexpected events causing changes in aviation demand or airline  capacity can considerably affect trust-fund revenues and the accuracy  of trust-fund revenue forecasts. For example, geopolitical events,  such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which  substantially reduced the demand for air travel and led to lower trust- fund revenues, could not have been foreseen. In fiscal year 2002,  when the attacks had their greatest effect on aviation activity, revenue  forecasts exceeded actual revenues by $2.7 billion, or 22 percent.  Additionally, rapid changes in the economy can lead to forecast  inaccuracy. In fiscal year 2009, when the effects of the recent  recession were greatest, revenues were overforecast by nearly $2.2  billion, or 17 percent. In response to high fuel prices and a weakening  economy, the airline industry reduced its domestic capacity (the  number of scheduled seats) in 2008, mostly by removing older, less- fuel-efficient aircraft from service. In fiscal year 2009, fuel and  gasoline tax receipts were overforecast by 37 percent as the reduction  in capacity led to a 13 percent decrease in fuel consumption from  fiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2009.", "According to an industry expert, the effects of certain exogenous  events\u2014events caused by factors outside the aviation industry\u2014on  demand for air travel are such that it is common for demand to drop  much more quickly in response to a negative shock than it will build in  response to overall good economic conditions. Thus, the likelihood  that there will be years when revenues are considerably overforecast  may be higher than the likelihood that there will be years when  revenues are considerably underforecast. This pattern held for fiscal  years 2000 through 2010. In fiscal years 2000 and 2007, revenues  were underforecast by $399 million and $154 million respectively. In  all other years during that decade, yearly revenues were overforecast  by between $321 million and $2.7 billion. Similarly, other factors  external to the industry and economy\u2014such as health issues like an  outbreak of a contagious virus\u2014can cause rapid shifts in demand.", "The timing of budget forecasts exacerbates the potential for  inaccurate trust-fund revenue forecasts, particularly in the face of  unexpected events. Developed over a year in advance, the forecasts  often cannot account for the effects of unexpected events, such as the  September 11 attacks or changes in economic conditions. For  example, the revenue forecast for fiscal year 2002 was developed in  the final months of calendar year 2000, almost a full year before  September 11, 2001. Additionally, because of the timing of the budget  process, the revenue forecasts incorporate early forecasts of changes  in gross domestic product (GDP), which is a critical exogenous factor  affecting airline revenues and thus forecasts. Studies have found that  predictions of, for example, recessions, are not very accurate more  than a year in advance, and so the sharp drops in demand that occur  as a result of rapidly changing macroeconomic conditions are likely to  be missed in the relevant forecast. For example, OMB\u2019s fiscal year  2009 forecast for real GDP growth from February 2008 was 3.0  percent, but real GDP actually declined by 3.5 percent, according to  the Bureau of Economic Analysis.", "The difficulty of recognizing when apparent changes in the  industry are transitory or permanent affects forecast accuracy  because long-term structural changes require adjustments to forecast  models. As we have previously reported, the airline industry has  experienced significant structural changes over the last decade, but  they were not usually apparent until well after they had occurred. Examples of apparent structural changes include the following:", "Short-distance markets (less than 250 miles between airports)  have lost a large share of passenger traffic, likely because of the  increased time required for aviation security measures  implemented since September 11, 2001, has made driving a more  viable option for short-distance routes.", "GAO, Commercial Aviation: Consumers Could Benefit from Better Information about  Airline-Imposed Fees and Refundability of Government-Imposed Taxes and Fees,  GAO-10-785 (Washington, D.C.: July 14, 2010) and Airline Deregulation: Reregulating the  Airline Industry Would Likely Reverse Consumer Benefits and Not Save Airline Pensions,  GAO-06-630 (Washington, D.C.: June 9, 2006).", "Over the past 10 years the use of the Internet for ticket purchases  has became ubiquitous and appears to have contributed to a  reduction in fare dispersion and helped to suppress average fares.

This change in pricing structure enables  airlines to keep airfares lower while bringing in additional revenue  through fees, which are not subject to excise taxes for the trust  fund.", "These various factors\u2014exogenous shocks, the timing of forecasts, and  lags in recognizing structural changes to the airline industry\u2014affect  forecast accuracy for key activity and pricing measures, such as  enplanements and ticket prices. In particular, experts told us that  estimating how these factors may affect ticket prices is particularly hard  because prices are closely tied to individual airline business decisions as  well as to aggregate demand. For example, one airline\u2019s decision to  reduce fares may easily lead to a fare war, in which competing airlines  attempt to undersell each other. Forecasters are unable to predict when  these fare wars may occur and how they may affect on ticket prices.  Similarly, forecasters are unable to predict changes airlines make to their  business models, such as the addition of baggage checking and other  ancillary fees. FAA\u2019s analysis of forecast accuracy for key activity  measures illustrates this difficulty in forecasting ticket prices. Specifically,  for fiscal years 2003 through 2009, near-term forecasts of average ticket  prices for mainline carriers were in error by an average of 3.4 percent,  compared with errors that averaged 1.6 percent for forecasts of revenue  passenger miles and 1.1 percent for enplanement forecasts."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Options Exist to Reduce, but Not Eliminate, the Risk of Overcommitting Trust-Fund Resources", "paragraphs": ["Although the trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance was used to offset lower- than-forecast trust-fund revenues in the past, the current trust-fund  balance provides less protection against overcommitting trust-fund  resources. This means that trust-fund revenues could be insufficient to  cover all of the obligations that FAA has the authority to incur if actual  trust-fund revenues continue to fall below forecast levels and Congress  appropriates funds from the trust fund at the forecast levels. The trust  fund\u2019s uncommitted balance was about $1.4 billion at the end of fiscal  year 2011\u2014up from $770 million at the end of fiscal year 2010. Despite  the lapse in collecting certain taxes from July 23 through August 7, 2011,  according to FAA, the trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance grew due to  higher-than-expected revenues in fiscal year 2011.", "A substantial decline in the trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance could lead  to budgetary challenges for FAA, if commitments from the trust fund  exceed revenues deposited into the trust fund. As we have previously  reported, a decline in the trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance toward zero  signals to FAA that revenues available to incur future obligations could be  limited, which could affect FAA\u2019s ability to move forward with planned  projects and programs. OMB, the Department of Transportation (DOT),  and FAA budget officials noted that if the trust fund were to become  overcommitted, there would be some time to determine what actions, if  any, FAA might have to take and to address this issue through the  appropriations process, given capital programs are paid for\u2014or  outlayed\u2014over several years and because the trust fund maintains a  cash balance ($9.4 billion as of the end-of-fiscal-year 2010), for which  revenues are continually paid into the trust fund. However, as we have  previously reported, in the short term, FAA officials have noted a risk of  overcommitting trust-fund resources might require them to delay  obligations for capital programs if they do not have adequate revenues in  the trust fund to cover those obligations\u2014unless additional funding was  authorized and appropriated from general revenues. uncommitted balance, better matching of actual revenues to the  appropriation from the trust fund would better ensure that trust-fund  revenues are sufficient to cover FAA\u2019s expenditures, thus reducing the  potential risk of disruptions in funding for aviation projects and programs.  For our analysis, we considered four alternative options for determining  the amount that would be made available for appropriation from the trust  fund\u2014each of which would require a change in law to implement (table  2). First, the House of Representatives\u2019 current FAA reauthorization bill  (H.R. 658) includes a provision that would limit the budget resources  made available for appropriation from the trust fund to 90 percent, rather  than 100 percent, of forecast revenues and apply any differences  between actual trust-fund revenues and appropriations from the trust fund  to a subsequent year. The second option would use a prior year\u2019s actual  trust-fund revenue amount as the basis for the appropriation since this  revenue amount would represent the level of actual revenues deposited  into the trust fund from a prior year and therefore not make funding  dependent on revenue forecasts. For example, the second preceding  year\u2019s revenue amount could be used, since it would be certified by IRS  in time for the development of FAA\u2019s budget. Finally, the third and fourth  options would target a level for the trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance\u2014 such as $2 billion or $3 billion\u2014and base appropriations on the goal of  maintaining that target level. These options would increase the likelihood  that uncommitted resources would be available to FAA if actual revenues  fell short of forecast revenues.", "Our analysis of these options shows that although they provide for  substantially greater protection to the trust fund than the provision in  current law, they do not completely eliminate the risk of overcommitting  revenues from the trust fund (table 3). For our analysis, we applied these  four approaches to the actual and forecast trust-fund revenues for fiscal  years 2000 through 2010, using the trust fund\u2019s end-of-year fiscal year  2010 uncommitted balance of $770 million as the balance for the end of  fiscal year 1999 to analyze how these options might function in starting with  a low uncommitted balance.  On the basis of this analysis, we determined  that the four options provide better protection against overcommitting  resources from the trust fund when it has low uncommitted balance than  the current law (which we refer to as AIR-21 method) would have provided  had it been followed. However, these alternatives could still result in the  trust fund being overcommitted unless Congress appropriated more  general revenues because if the uncommitted balance is close to zero,  there is no margin for error if the actual revenues fall significantly short of  the amounts appropriated. For example, in 2002 when appropriations  exceeded actual revenues by over $3.2 billion (as previously shown in fig.  4), the H.R. 658 option and the $2 billion target option, if in place during  that time, would have been insufficient to protect the trust fund\u2019s  uncommitted balance from being overcommitted.", "Our analysis of these options further shows that they\u2014particularly the  H.R. 658 provision\u2014could also lead to greater swings in trust-fund  contributions, which in turn would require greater variation in general- revenue appropriations to maintain overall stable appropriation levels for  FAA. As figure 6 shows, the H.R. 658 provision, if in place during fiscal  years 2000 through 2010, would have resulted in a wider variation in the  total amount available for appropriation from the trust fund than the other  options and current law. Because of these variations with the H.R. 658  option, general-revenue appropriations would also have to vary widely  from year to year to maintain the same appropriation levels during that  time frame. In addition, these options could result in the availability of  fewer resources for some period of time than under current law, unless a  general-revenue appropriation made up the difference."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which Trust-Fund Revenues Might Support Future FAA Expenditures Will Depend on Differing Assumptions and Other Factors", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The President\u2019s Budget Forecasts Show FAA Expenditures Continuing to Exceed Trust-Fund Revenues", "paragraphs": ["According to the President\u2019s fiscal year 2012 budget request and mid- session review, FAA expenditures (as reflected by OMB\u2019s estimates of  FAA\u2019s budget authority) are expected to continue to exceed forecast trust- fund revenues through fiscal year 2021 (see fig. 7).

Under these assumptions, total forecast FAA  expenditures would require $20 billion in general revenues to supplement  trust-fund revenues.", "OMB\u2019s forecasts base future years\u2019 general-revenue contribution for FAA  on the current budget year\u2019s (fiscal year 2012) proposed general-revenue  proportion. Specifically, OMB assumes trust-fund revenues cover about  68 percent of FAA\u2019s estimated total expenditures, and general revenues  cover the remaining 32 percent for each year of this same period. This  level of general revenue funding for FAA is among the highest levels  since fiscal year 2000 (see fig. 8). Since the assumptions behind the  President\u2019s budget forecasts keep the general-revenue and trust-fund  contributions constant in the out-years, OMB\u2019s forecasts differ from the  AIR-21 approach in that they assume all forecast trust-fund revenues are  not made available for appropriation. As a result, OMB projects a growing  trust-fund uncommitted balance\u2014from $770 million at the end of fiscal  year 2010 to almost $30 billion at the end of fiscal year 2021. Although  such growth does not reflect what has historically happened under the  AIR-21 method\u2014which makes the forecast level of receipts available for  appropriation\u2014OMB officials noted that this approach aligns with how  OMB forecasts out-year budget authority for other agencies.", "By contrast, applying the AIR-21 approach to current revenue and  expenditures forecasts would reduce the amount of additional general  revenues needed to cover forecast expenditures but would maintain the  current uncommitted balance level and still require some level of  additional general revenues or increases in aviation tax levels or sources  into the trust fund to fund FAA expenditures as compared to OMB\u2019s  approach (fig. 9). Specifically, applying the AIR-21 approach would  make approximately $27 billion more in trust revenues available for  appropriation for fiscal years 2013 through 2021 than OMB projects.  Although this approach would reduce the amount of general revenues  needed to cover forecast FAA expenditures, the assumption that all  forecast trust-fund revenues would be appropriated halts the growth in the  trust fund\u2019s uncommitted balance holding it at the most recent estimate of  $1.4 billion for fiscal year 2011 and providing limited protection against  forecast error. Additionally, projected FAA expenditures under the AIR-21  approach would still require some level of general-revenue  appropriation\u2014specifically, 20 percent for fiscal year 2013, respectively,  and then about 8 percent to 16 percent for fiscal years 2014 through  2021.", "While these forecasts provide perspectives on future FAA expenditures  and trust-fund revenues, the extent to which these forecasts are more  accurately realized in future years depends on changing economic,  technological, political, industry, and other factors. In particular,  congressional decisions, including the level of FAA\u2019s appropriations or the  trust-fund tax structure; unexpected changes affecting trust-fund  revenues and FAA expenditures; and FAA\u2019s implementation and  management of programs, such as NextGen, could significantly affect  trust-fund revenues and FAA expenditures in future years.", "In its deliberations on the appropriate level of federal revenues and  expenditures for a given year, Congress decides on the level of FAA\u2019s  appropriations\u2014which could be more or less than the President\u2019s budget  request\u2014and the level of trust-fund and general revenues to fund FAA.  As previously noted, in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, the level of  appropriations from the trust fund was reduced and the general-revenue  appropriation was increased from the President\u2019s budget request. FAA\u2019s  fiscal year 2012 appropriations generally funded the President\u2019s fiscal  year 2012 request, with the exception of the President\u2019s request for $3.35  billion in general revenues for the AIP and Facilities and Equipment  accounts for a proposed infrastructure initiative (table 4). Additionally,  FAA\u2019s fiscal year 2012 appropriations cover approximately 30 percent of  FAA\u2019s total expenditures from general revenues.
