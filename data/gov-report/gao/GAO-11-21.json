GAO was asked to assess (1) the extent to which DOD is utilizing the SBIR program to develop and transition space-related technologies; and (2) whether small businesses face challenges to participating in the space industrial base. To do this, GAO analyzed program documentation and DOD data on the SBIR program and interviewed key officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD is working to commercialize space-related technologies under its SBIR program by transitioning these technologies into acquisition programs or the commercial sector, but has limited insight into the program's effectiveness. DOD has invested about 11 percent of its fiscal years 2005-2009 R&D funds through its SBIR program to address space-related technology needs. Also, DOD is soliciting more space-related research proposals from small businesses. For example, the number of space-related research requests submitted by the military services and DOD components has increased from less than 8 percent in 2005 to nearly 14 percent in 2009. Further, DOD has implemented a variety of programs and initiatives to increase the commercialization of SBIR technologies and has identified instances where it has transitioned space-related technologies into acquisition programs or the commercial sector. For example, a small business developed an aluminum ring that enables multiple payloads to attach to a single launch vehicle. However, DOD lacks complete commercialization data to determine the effectiveness of the program in transitioning space-related technologies into acquisition programs or the commercial sector. Of the nearly 500 space-related contracts awarded in fiscal years 2005 through 2009, DOD officials could not, for various reasons, identify the total number of technologies that transitioned into acquisition programs or the commercial sector. For example, there are inconsistencies in recording and defining commercialization. Further, there are challenges to executing the SBIR program that DOD officials acknowledge and are planning to address, such as the lack of overarching guidance for managing the DOD SBIR Program. Most stakeholders GAO spoke with in the space industrial base--DOD, prime contractors, and small-business officials--generally agreed that small businesses participating in the DOD SBIR program face difficulties transitioning their space-related technologies into acquisition programs or the commercial sector. Although GAO did not assess the validity of the concerns cited, stakeholders GAO spoke with identified challenges inherent to developing space technologies, challenges because of the SBIR program's administration, timing, and funding issues and other challenges related to participating in the DOD space acquisitions environment. For example, some small-business officials said that working in the space community is challenging because the technologies often require more expensive materials and testing than other technologies. They also mentioned that delayed contract awards and slow contract disbursements have caused financial hardships. Additionally, several small businesses cited concerns with safeguarding their intellectual property."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD consider collecting data on all SBIR technologies that transition into DOD acquisitions or the commercial sector and ensure these data are defined and recorded consistently; complete efforts to develop and issue SBIR program guidance; and review the challenges identified by stakeholders in this report to assess the extent to which there are improvements that could be made to address them. DOD partially concurred to collect data, and concurred to develop and issue guidance. DOD did not agree to review the challenges identified by stakeholders.

Recognizing the  potential of small businesses to be a source of significant innovation,  Congress enacted the Small Business Innovation Development Act of  1982. The act established the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)  Program to stimulate technological innovation, use small businesses to  meet federal R&D needs, foster and encourage participation by minority  and disadvantaged persons in technological innovation, and increase  private-sector commercialization of innovations derived from federal R&D.  The act provided for a three-phased program: Phase I to determine the  feasibility and scientific and technical merit of a proposed research idea;  Phase II to further develop the idea; and Phase III to continue research and  development, or commercialize the resulting product or process with no  further SBIR funding. Commercialization occurs when a Phase II product  or process transitions into a federal acquisition program or a commercial- sector product or service. Federal agencies that have budgets of at least  $100 million for research conducted by others, called extramural research,  are required to use 2.5 percent of these budgets to establish and operate an  SBIR program.", "The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) current space systems play an  increasingly important role in military operations; however, military space  acquisition programs over the past two decades have experienced  problems that have significantly increased costs and delayed schedules.  Moreover, the supplier base for space programs has consolidated to a  point where there are just a few prime contractors that compete for new  efforts. SBIR offers one avenue for introducing new ideas and  technological innovation in the DOD space sector. Other solutions that  have been proposed to help revitalize space acquisition include programs  such as DOD\u2019s Operationally Responsive Space initiative, which focuses  on developing and launching smaller satellites in order to deliver  capability quicker, reduce technology challenges, and widen the field of  potential suppliers, as well as efforts focused on stabilizing requirements,  introducing incremental technology advancements to satellite  constellations, improving cost estimates, and strengthening program  management. There are also other types of programs within DOD that are  designed to increase small-business participation in major acquisitions.", "DOD is seeking to stimulate ideas and innovation and gain access to  cutting-edge technology by offering opportunities to small businesses to  develop technological innovations. For space, this may be particularly  necessary since government space programs tend to introduce  technological advancements well before commercial space programs.  Additionally, DOD\u2014in mission areas such as missile warning and space  surveillance\u2014has requirements that do not exist in the commercial sector.

A  2008 report for DOD states that over the past few decades, the space  industrial base has consolidated from over 50 suppliers in the early 1990s  to four prime contractors who now manage thousands of subcontractors  for DOD systems. According to a 2007 DOD study, the U.S. space industry  has had to adjust to declining demands in the areas of satellites and  launch, which has led to consolidation.

The SBIR  program budget is computed as 2.5 percent of an individual agency\u2019s  extramural R&D budget. Within DOD, each military service and DOD  component uses this percentage to determine its own SBIR budget. The  U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) communicates federal SBIR  guidance through the SBIR Policy Directive and reports on the  implementation and operation of the SBIR program at 11 federal agencies.  DOD is the largest agency participating in the SBIR program, and DOD\u2019s  fiscal year 2009 SBIR program budget was over $1.22 billion\u2014more than  half of the entire fiscal year 2009 governmentwide SBIR program budget of  over $2 billion.", "DOD\u2019s Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) oversees the DOD SBIR  program, develops DOD SBIR policy, annually collects reporting data from  each of the services and components, and oversees the topic-generation  and solicitation process.

The Director of Defense Research and Engineering, and a multiagency  integrated review team (IRT), review and approve the SBIR topics. DOD  announces SBIR project opportunities through three annual solicitations  for which small businesses can submit Phase I SBIR proposals to address  the research topics. Small businesses submit proposals electronically  through the DOD SBIR Electronic Submission Web site. DOD published  109 space-related topics throughout the 2009 fiscal year solicitation cycles.  After the solicitation\u2019s closing date, proposals are evaluated, and source- selection and contract-award decisions are made. DOD invites small  businesses with promising technologies that have completed Phase I to  submit proposals for a Phase II contract.

The Air Force had a significant need for an  integrated simulation-based operator training and rehearsal capability for  satellite-system ground control, because future generations of military  satellites will be expected to use one common ground system to operate  multiple satellite constellations. The SST is a satellite-operator  instructional simulation that supports multiple satellite systems through  the use of a system similar to a video game console, increasing efficiencies  and potentially reducing training costs. The SST can be used to support  various types of training\u2014independent qualification training, unit  qualification training, and crew training\u2014and it supports instructional  simulations that mimic the behavior of common military satellites,  subsystems, space flight, orbital mechanics, and satellite operations.  Advantages of using the SST include flexible instructor control features,  increased instructor and student productivity, quick setup, and lower  training costs. For example, with this SBIR technology, an instructor can  monitor up to six students, provide targeted instruction to any student,  and alter the events during a scenario. In addition, according to officials  from the 533rd Training Squadron, the squadron that evaluated the SST,  required instructor manpower has been reduced significantly and student  evaluation productivity has increased dramatically as a result of the SST.", "Low Shock Separation System (Lightband system): According to the  Air Force, vibration during the launch and satellite separation from the  rocket has caused government satellites to malfunction. Small satellites  are particularly susceptible to launch- and separation-related vibrations  because of the close proximity of sensors and instruments to the shock  source, necessitating a low-shock separation system. A small company  developed the Lightband system under SBIR contracts to provide a  capability that would reduce on-orbit failures. The Lightband system is the  first payload-separation system that generates significantly less vibration  during payload separation from the launch vehicle. According to the Air  Force, the Lightband system is 25 percent lighter, 50 percent smaller, 40  percent cheaper, and generates less than 5 percent of the vibration of  existing conventional separation systems, and it is estimated that this  SBIR technology could save spacecraft programs several million dollars in  life-cycle costs per spacecraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Complete Data on Commercialization Efforts", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD officials, DOD collects and maintains data on Phase I  and II of the SBIR contract process, but it does not have complete and  consistent data on Phase III.

We did not verify validity of the concerns or recommendations cited by  these officials and are not generalizing this information to the entire space  acquisitions community or the DOD SBIR program; rather we present  common opinions and observations of only those individuals interviewed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Difficulties Inherent in Developing Space Technologies", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we spoke with in the space industrial base\u2014DOD, prime  contractors, and small businesses\u2014agreed that small businesses face  inherent challenges in developing space technologies. They agreed that  some small businesses have fewer in-house resources, limited DOD  contacts, and they find working in the space community unique and  challenging. Some of the difficulties they cited follow.", "Harsh space environment: To meet DOD\u2019s requirements to be flight- ready for the harsh space environment, technologies need more expensive  materials and testing in specialized facilities. For example, flight-ready  hardware for the space environment requires electronic components that  can withstand radiation from space-derived particles or nuclear  detonations. All three groups interviewed noted that small businesses  typically do not own the appropriate testing facilities, such as thermal  vacuum chambers, that are used for testing spacecraft or parts under a  simulated space environment and instead must rely on government,  university, or large-contractor testing facilities, which can be costly.  However, an official from one prime contractor said it offers a discount on  using its testing facilities to small businesses that subcontract with it  during Phase II of the SBIR program.", "Sustaining operations through delays and cancellations: According  to a small-business official, DOD space and weapons acquisitions program  delays and cancellations can affect small businesses\u2019 ability to stay in  business. Air Force officials agree that small companies can be at a greater  disadvantage than larger companies when space acquisition programs are  delayed or system development goals are far off into the future, because  some small companies that rely on a specific government contract may not  be able to stay in business if they have to wait too long to receive the  contract award. For example, Air Force officials stated that nine SBIR  contracts may have been canceled as a result of the cancellation of the  Transformational Satellite Communications System in fiscal year 2010.", "Obtaining security clearances: Small business, DOD, and prime  contractor officials said small businesses\u2019 participation in DOD space  acquisition programs may be inhibited by their lack of security clearances.  One small business said some small businesses are unable to learn enough  about potential projects that are deemed classified to submit a proposal,  because DOD provides limited information regarding project requirements  to those companies without security clearances. However, several small  businesses noted that because security clearances are costly, many are  unable to invest in security clearances without an assured contract award.  Moreover, one told us that the development time frames for SBIR  contracts are too short to apply for and receive top-secret clearances. In  addition, two of the three prime contractors we spoke with said that the  lack of a security clearance represents a major barrier for any small  business that aspires to participate in DOD space acquisition programs.    Forging relationships: Small businesses struggle to break through the  insular culture of space system acquisitions to develop working  relationships with DOD officials and prime contractors, according to all  three groups interviewed.", "With DOD: According to small businesses we interviewed, it is  difficult to identify appropriate points of contact within DOD, and one  small business said that DOD consistently awards contracts to those  companies with whom it has previously worked, making it difficult for  new, small companies to develop similar relationships. Two small- business owners said access to the space acquisition community is  difficult because it is a cohesive network of space system developers.  Specifically, one of the small businesses noted that the domination of  the space industrial base by a few prime contractors prevents small- business participation because the prime contractors usually serve as  the lead integrators for space programs. Prime-contractor officials  acknowledged they have some of their own preferred suppliers. One  DOD official agreed that it is difficult for small businesses to forge new  relationships within the DOD space system acquisitions community  because it is difficult for DOD\u2019s SBIR program officials to convince  program managers to consider SBIR technologies as potential  solutions for technology gaps as the solutions may not be the same as  those advocated by the prime contractors. In addition, he noted that  large prime contractors partner with many of the program managers  and advise them about acquisitions concerning new technologies\u2014and  these prime contractors may see the SBIR program as a source of  competition.", "With prime contractors: Officials from all the prime contractors we  spoke with generally agreed that small businesses face challenges in  working with prime contractors for several reasons. First, DOD does  not require prime contractors to work with small businesses to  commercialize their technologies. Two prime contractors suggested  that DOD could facilitate these working relationships by providing  incentives for larger contractors to work with SBIR companies.  Second, two of the three prime contractors interviewed indicated that  they would prefer to buy a small business with a promising technology,  rather than partner with the business in question, to maintain exclusive  rights to the technologies developed. Third, one prime contractor  noted that it prefers to use established subcontractors that have a  history of being reliable, are expected to be around in the future, and  are able to manufacture the volume of units requested. Despite the  challenges noted, all the prime contractors we spoke with have  developed initiatives for working with small businesses. For example,  one prime contractor established the position of a full-time SBIR  program manager in 2005 to provide information and guidance  regarding the government\u2019s SBIR program to the entire small business  community, work with those leaders associated with research and  technology and technology integration regarding SBIR activities, and  release a bimonthly SBIR activity report.", "Risk-averse space community: All three groups we interviewed said that  small businesses find it difficult to break into the DOD space system  acquisitions environment because the space community is risk averse\u2014 DOD officials see unproven companies as risky for expensive space  programs because any delays, problems with technologies, or other issues  have significant consequences. Various small businesses we spoke with  believe that program managers prefer to award space-related contracts to  large contractors, in whose quality, practices, and longevity they have  confidence. Air Force officials we spoke with agreed that most program  managers are risk averse to integrating technologies developed by small  businesses before they have been demonstrated for a space environment  because they are trying to meet cost, schedule, and performance goals. In  addition, an official claimed the ingrained belief that only large businesses  can handle the complexities of building major space systems, such as  satellites, constituted the largest obstacle faced by those officials  attempting to implement the SBIR program. Two prime contractors agreed  that the DOD space community is highly risk averse and consider small  business technologies risky investments\u2014specifically, one noted that  technologies are perceived to be risky because of the uncertainty  associated with small businesses\u2019 ability to remain in business over the  long development cycle of a space system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aspects of SBIR Program Administration, Timing, and Funding Impede Small Business Efforts", "paragraphs": ["The three groups we interviewed\u2014small businesses, DOD officials, and  prime contractors\u2014described how SBIR program administration, timing,  and funding impede the efforts of small businesses developing space- related technologies to transition their technologies. The following reflects  the opinions of most of the interviewees.", "Inexperienced contracting staff: Small-businesses and Air Force  officials we interviewed believe issues regarding SBIR contract awards  result from, in part, inexperienced contracting staff managing SBIR  contracts in DOD. Air Force officials we spoke with acknowledged that  the SBIR program is often used as a training ground for inexperienced  contracting staff because contract award size is relatively small and the  DOD\u2019s SBIR program has a structured contract process in place. One  official noted that this practice can create problems for small companies,  because some of these inexperienced contracting officials may not  understand the intricacies of the SBIR program. Two small businesses we  spoke with indicated that they had experienced contract issuance delays  because inexperienced contracting staff managed their SBIR contracts.  Small businesses we spoke with said they experienced financial hardship  because they needed to retain employees or project teams while waiting  for contract awards. For example, one small business we spoke with noted  that it encountered a 9-month delay in the awarding of a contract after  receiving a notice of selection for a Phase II SBIR contract, and the delay  was almost devastating. Two small businesses suggested that DOD  expedite the contract-award process to limit the need for small businesses  to retain expensive technical staff prior to the start of any contract work.", "Low funding limits: According to some small businesses and DOD  officials, low SBIR funding limits may hinder space technology  development because SBIR funding limits are not adequate to fulfill the  stringent level of testing required to qualify materials for space technology  development or to mature technologies to the degree required by DOD.  Prior to March 2010, when the SBA increased SBIR funding limits for  Phase I from $100,000 to $150,000 and for Phase II from $750,000 to  $1,000,000, funding limits had remained stagnant since 1992. For example,  one small-business official noted it was unrealistic to mature a technology  to the extent some space programs require within the SBIR funding limits.  Another small business said it had the opportunity to transition its  technology if it could effectively demonstrate the subsystem, but to do so,  it needed an advanced microcircuit that cost $750,000\u2014as much as it  would receive for a typical Phase II contract award. DOD officials said a  small business typically needs additional funding to supplement its SBIR  Phase I and II contracts to be in a position to insert its technology into a  major space acquisition program. According to the SBA, DOD can award  SBIR contracts in amounts that are larger than the prescribed limits to  small businesses to help bridge the funding gap and mature their  technologies further, but DOD is required to report annually to the SBA  when it exceeds the funding limits. In addition, DOD implemented several  initiatives to stimulate additional investment in promising SBIR  technologies. For example, the Fast Track Program and Phase II  Enhancement funding utilizes matching funds from outside the SBIR  budget to help small businesses between phases of the SBIR program. One  DOD official suggested that DOD provide stable funding for space-related  SBIR technologies, because it is difficult to establish an effective  development plan for space acquisition programs when funding for space- related SBIR projects is unstable.", "Contract award disbursement amount and timing: Two small- business officials said they experience financial hardships when contract  award disbursements are misaligned with initial costs incurred to develop  their technology. According to the small businesses we interviewed, if  disbursements do not adequately match the development needs of the  small business, the small business may need to use its own money for  hiring or delay development of the product until it receives the remainder  of the contract award. Further, they said the contract award disbursement  schedule and amounts vary across and within the DOD military services  and may not coincide with the development progress and test plans of the  small business. One small businesses we spoke with noted that a larger  contract award distribution allotment is particularly important at the  beginning of a contract, because it needs the funding to hire new staff and  begin development of the technology. Two small businesses suggested  DOD distribute SBIR funding up front, instead of in equal increments  throughout the contract period.", "Synchronizing with the DOD acquisition timeline: According to small  businesses and DOD officials we interviewed, opportunities to transition  technologies are missed because the SBIR program timeline is not aligned  with the DOD acquisition timeline. DOD officials noted that opportunities  for the insertion of new technologies by means of on-ramps typically occur  when there is a new system acquisition or a system upgrade, but it may  take too long to develop an SBIR technology to address needs.  Furthermore, these opportunities are generally limited. Additionally,  inserting a technology at the right time can be difficult due to technology  freeze dates\u2014the point at which no new technologies can be added\u2014and  any SBIR technology in development would have to wait for the next  program upgrade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Small Businesses Identified Other Challenges to Participating in the DOD Space System Acquisitions Environment", "paragraphs": ["Small businesses participating in the SBIR program identified other  challenges they believe inhibit their ability to participate in DOD space  system and weapon acquisitions, such as the potential for the loss of  intellectual property and a lack of technology \u201cpull\u201d from DOD acquisition  programs. Some of these identified challenges follow.", "Loss of proprietary information: Ten small businesses we interviewed  are reluctant to enter into partnerships with prime contractors out of  concern that they could lose their proprietary information through either  an infringement from prime contractors or a mishandling of proprietary  information by DOD program officials. The three prime contractors we  spoke with said they take intellectual property rights of small businesses  seriously, and they noted that specific procedures are in place to  safeguard intellectual property rights of small businesses, such as the  signing of nondisclosure agreements. A DOD official said that the fear of  losing proprietary information is a misperception on the part of small  businesses, because DOD services and components take steps to work  with and protect the small businesses\u2019 intellectual property rights.  Additionally, the SBIR Policy Directive requires agencies to ensure SBIR  businesses\u2019 proprietary information is protected. However, according to  five small businesses we interviewed, incidents have occurred in which  DOD officials appear to have shared proprietary information with prime  contractors. For example:    One small business we interviewed disclosed that DOD hired it to  teach several prime contractors how to recreate a specific infrared  technology it had developed so that the prime contractors could  evaluate the technology. Although the prime contractors signed  nondisclosure agreements that permitted them to use the technology  for evaluation but did not give them the right to sell the technology, the  small business said a DOD military service is currently procuring  systems from the prime contractors that incorporated the technology  they developed. The small business attempted to seek recourse against  the prime contractors but could not sustain the legal fees.", "Another small business developed a system to enhance data, and  within 4 months of the successful use of the system in military  operations, the Air Force turned to a prime contractor to assess and  then expand upon the system to enable more users to access the  technology. The small business claims that the prime contractor would  not have been able to do this, however, without access to the small  business\u2019 proprietary information; thus the small business believes that  the Air Force might have allowed the prime contractor to review  documents containing proprietary information during the prime  contractor\u2019s initial assessment of the technology.", "Limited technology \u201cpull\u201d from acquisition programs: The small  businesses we interviewed cited three reasons for the limited \u201cpull\u201d\u2014 identified need and support\u2014for SBIR technologies: DOD segments may  solicit topics for SBIR technologies for which they have no validated  requirements, short tenure among DOD officials, and a lack of SBIR  knowledge and training for program managers.", "According to three small businesses we interviewed, the research  ideas or SBIR topics are not created with a specific end-user or  acquisitions customer in mind, which can limit the likelihood of  insertion into DOD acquisition programs. One small business claimed  that the DOD research laboratories use SBIR as a \u201csandbox\u201d to  research interesting ideas, reducing the benefits of the program to the  warfighter. DOD officials told us, however, that at least 50 percent of  SBIR topic solicitations must be endorsed by acquisition programs.", "Four small businesses we spoke with noted that short tenures among  DOD officials involved in developing SBIR technologies inhibits the  ability of small businesses to transition their technology because those  with decision-making authority may leave\u2014and the interest in a  technology with them. For example, one small business told us that a  DOD service agreed to sponsor its technology for Fast Track funding  but did not follow through because of a turnover in staff and a change  in priorities. Another small business claimed that an official interested  in its technology transferred, leaving it without a sponsor. According  to DOD officials we spoke with, the network for sharing SBIR  information is fractured and informal, and the short tenure of program  managers can affect the effectiveness of informal sharing networks,  making it is less likely small businesses will have the contacts needed  to keep apprised of SBIR topics and technologies worked on by other  DOD services and components. DOD officials suggested that DOD  increase coordination efforts across services and components to share  information on small-business technology development efforts. DOD  officials we spoke with agreed that short tenure for program office  officials affects small businesses trying to transition technologies into  programs of interest, but one DOD official noted that small businesses  also have a responsibility to market their product to various program  offices and should not depend solely on technology \u201cpull\u201d by a  program office or official. Several GAO reports have indicated that  short program-manager tenure has hampered technology system  acquisitions, and some of the reports noted the need to extend  program-manager tenure as a way of increasing stability and  accountability on acquisition programs.", "Two small businesses we interviewed said that program managers,  who are charged with planning and developing future and current  acquisitions, do not understand the value of using an SBIR technology  and therefore are less likely to consider it for insertion into an  acquisition program. A DOD official we spoke with who is involved  with the SBIR program agreed that some program officials lack a  thorough understanding of the SBIR program, but he noted that DOD  is currently developing training modules to address this concern. Two  small businesses suggested that DOD increase program manager  attention to SBIR technologies and improve their knowledge of SBIR  policies and contract award process."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD is using the SBIR program to provide opportunities for small  businesses to participate in the space industrial base.

Despite these efforts,  challenges remain as DOD strives to improve the program. Moreover,  there are perceived challenges for small businesses, rooted in the costs  associated with spacecraft development, the administration of the SBIR  program, as well as reluctance on the part of prime contractors and  program managers to work with new, unproven companies.

DOD agreed that collecting commercialization data on SBIR  technologies is beneficial and that it has systems to collect these data;  however, DOD also noted it would not be cost-effective to collect data on  government and commercial/private awards at the prime and lower tier  levels because DOD does not have the resources nor the responsibility to  capture all public and private data for the DOD program.", "For DOD to have a better understanding of its return on investment for  commercializing space-related and other technologies, it must strengthen  its evaluation of the SBIR program.  To do this, DOD needs more complete  data as well as data that are consistently defined and recorded, as we  recommended.   While DOD noted that it collects commercialization data  in two ways\u2014by requiring that proposing firms report prior SBIR  commercialization and through the Federal Procurement Data System\u2014 the data being reported are not always recorded consistently.  Improving  data collection efforts in these areas would substantially improve DOD\u2019s  insight into the SBIR program\u2019s effectiveness.  Regarding the collection of  commercialization data for firms no longer participating in the DOD SBIR  program, we recommended that DOD consider collecting this information.   This consideration would involve identifying the cost to capture these data  and identifying the benefit gained from better understanding the  investment.  If DOD determines that the collection of this information is  cost prohibitive, DOD should not be expected to collect it.  However, it  would still behoove DOD to assess the extent to which collecting this data  would be cost prohibitive against the potential value the data could bring  to increasing small business participation in space.", "In its comments, SBA noted that it is developing a commercialization data  collection system that will capture public and private commercialization  results for firms re-applying for awards under the SBIR program. We  believe that SBA\u2019s efforts to improve data collection and management of  SBIR data should ease the burden on DOD resources and costs to collect  comprehensive data.  While the SBA\u2019s new data system will provide  programwide data, SBA stated that it encourages agencies to explore  agency-specific approaches to collecting and measuring  commercialization results. DOD did not address how it will ensure that  commercialization data are defined and recorded consistently within the  department.  We continue to believe that inconsistencies in recording and  defining Phase III data among the military services and components will  not give DOD a good sense of what benefits industry and government are  deriving from the SBIR program.  Improvements in data collection would  provide DOD with substantive data for evaluating its SBIR investment.", "DOD agreed with our recommendation that the department complete  efforts to develop and issue SBIR program guidance to ensure military  service and component-level SBIR officials are managing the program in a  manner intended to meet the full intent of the SBIR Policy Directive. In  response, DOD stated that it suspended efforts on finalizing a DOD SBIR  Directive because of multiple delays in SBIR program reauthorization and  that draft legislation being proposed will create major changes to the  program that will significantly affect the content of the DOD SBIR  Directive. We acknowledge that the SBIR Directive may be significantly  changed. DOD commented that it intends to finalize the DOD Directive  within 180 days of issuance of the updated SBIR Policy Directive.", "DOD did not concur with our recommendation that DOD should, in the  long term, examine the challenges offered by small businesses,  government officials, and prime contractor officials in this report and  assess the extent to which there are cost-effective improvements that  could be made to address them. DOD noted that it does not concur that  the individual challenges in our report should be assessed on an individual  basis and that many of the cited challenges are issues facing the entire  small-business community. DOD further noted that it addresses the  challenges faced by SBIR program participants through an SBIR steering  committee, working groups, conferences, and training workshops.  We do  not believe that our report focuses on individual concerns or challenges  but rather examines broader challenges that DOD may want to address in  the future. We acknowledge DOD\u2019s broad-scale efforts to address issues  facing the entire small-business community. However, given the fact that  most stakeholders in the space industrial base that we spoke with\u2014DOD,  prime contractors, and small businesses\u2014generally agreed that small  businesses participating in the DOD SBIR program face difficulties  transitioning their space-related technologies into DOD acquisition  programs, it would still be in DOD\u2019s best interest to assess the extent to  which there are cost-effective improvements that could be made to  address these difficulties. While we acknowledge that some of the  transition challenges may be faced by the entire SBIR community, others,  like the high cost of testing technologies so they are flight-ready for the  harsh space environment and the high cost of obtaining security  clearances that enable small businesses to submit classified proposals,  may be more prominent to SBIR companies working in the space sector.  To assist DOD with addressing the difficulties that SBIR companies state  they are having in transitioning their space-related technologies, we  continue to believe that DOD could look to the individual military services  for ways to overcome these difficulties.", "The SBA commented that it is interested in following up on the concerns  expressed by small businesses regarding the safety of intellectual property  when working with the SBIR or DOD acquisition programs.

We reviewed SBA policies, and SBIR success  stories. We also assessed the extent to which DOD is delivering space- related warfighter capabilities through the SBIR Program, by analyzing  data and interviewing officials from the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and we  attended conferences to identify small-business development  opportunities and determine steps DOD is taking to involve small  businesses.", "We analyzed data from OSBP for fiscal years 2000 through 2009 to  determine the investment DOD makes in space-related SBIR Phase I and II  awards each year. To identify the space-related portion of total SBIR  investment, OSBP officials provided data from the Federal Procurement  Data System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG). FPDS-NG contains detailed  information on contract actions and identifies, among other data, the  contract types used by federal agencies in procuring goods and services.", "Though we have previously reported that governmentwide FPDS-NG data  are incomplete and lack internal controls, FPDS-NG is the official federal  contracting database, and is therefore one of the systems DOD uses to  track its SBIR contracts; the second system is the Company  Commercialization Report (CCR) database, a system in which the  reporting of Phase III contracts by small businesses is voluntary. DOD\u2019s  OSBP reconciles the CCR database with the FPDS-NG for its own annual  reporting requirement to the SBA. An OSBP official pulled space-related  SBIR contract information from the FPDS-NG database after we asked for  the data for our review. However, a DOD OSBP official told us that the  FPDS-NG database was not designed to extract space-related contract  data from its database. Using a keyword search query, OSBP officials  separated out all DOD SBIR efforts containing reference to \u201cspace  platforms,\u201d for fiscal years 2005 through 2009, which they explained were  the best data available for identifying DOD\u2019s space-related SBIR contracts.
