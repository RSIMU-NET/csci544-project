In 2010, the Task Force issued an Action Plan for fiscal years 2010 to 2014 to develop a comprehensive approach to restoring the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem. GAO was asked to review the GLRI. This report examines (1) how the GLRI is implemented by the Task Force agencies and other stakeholders, (2) the methods that EPA has in place to assess GLRI progress, (3) the progress identified by the Task Force agencies and nonfederal stakeholders, and (4) the views of nonfederal stakeholders on factors, if any, that may affect or limit GLRI progress.

The Action Plan includes guidance for implementing the GLRI in five focus areas (such as invasive species and habitat and wildlife protection and restoration) that encompass the most significant environmental problems in the Great Lakes. Each focus area includes, among other things, long-term goals, objectives to be achieved by fiscal year 2014, and 28 measures of progress that have annual targets for fiscal years 2010 to 2014.", "EPA uses the Action Plan's measures to assess GLRI progress. However, its methods may not produce comprehensive and useful assessments of GLRI progress for several reasons. Among them, some of the goals and objectives do not link to any measures and, as a result, it is unclear how EPA will be able to assess progress toward them. In addition, some measures track actions that may not lead to the desired GLRI goal. For example, one measure tracks the reduction in concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) in fish as part of the goal to lift all restrictions on consumption of Great Lakes fish. However, stakeholders reported that the measure is too narrow and that mercury and other contaminants need to be addressed as well. Consequently, reducing PCB concentrations in fish is not likely to lead to the desired result of lifting all Great Lakes fish consumption restrictions. Without useful measures, EPA may not be able to determine that GLRI efforts are producing the desired results.", "In spring 2013, the Task Force agencies issued two reports about GLRI progress in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, which state whether the targets for the Action Plan's 28 measures were being met (e.g., 15 of 28 measures met or exceeded in fiscal year 2011), but the reports include few specific examples of progress. As a result, GAO sought further insights into such progress by surveying nonfederal GLRI stakeholders. Overall, 87 percent of respondents cited at least one example of how one or more of their projects had, or was expected to, benefit the Great Lakes ecosystem. GAO and others have reported that quantifying overall Great Lakes restoration progress is difficult, that the environmental conditions of each lake are unique, and, according to a 2006 U.N. report, it is often impossible to attribute specific environmental changes to specific projects or programs.", "In response to GAO's survey, among the factors respondents most often cited as potentially limiting GLRI progress are several outside the scope of the Action Plan, such as inadequate infrastructure for wastewater or stormwater and the effects of climate change. These factors could negatively affect GLRI restoration efforts. For example, as a result of climate change, warming water temperatures can lead to increased numbers of aquatic invasive species and a decline in native ones, a GLRI focus area. The Action Plan touches on these factors but does not state how they will be addressed. In 2012, EPA took steps to incorporate climate change considerations into a small number of GLRI projects but has yet to decide if the GLRI will consider climate change impacts on all GLRI projects. Without addressing these factors in the next Action Plan, EPA will not be able to more fully account for their impacts on GLRI restoration efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Great Lakes form the largest system of freshwater on earth.

For example,  advisories that warn against the consumption of certain fish species have  been issued for each of the Great Lakes states due to their levels of  persistent toxic substances, such as mercury. Decades of industrial  activity in the region have left a legacy of contamination, such as from  polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), that resulted in the United States and  Canada identifying, since 1987, a list of 43 severely degraded locations in  the Great Lakes Basin as areas of concern; 26 of these areas of concern  are located wholly in the United States, and 5 are shared between the two  nations. In addition, more than 180 nonnative or \u201cinvasive\u201d aquatic  species have become established in the Great Lakes. Some invasive  species have caused extensive ecological and economic damage to the  Great Lakes. The zebra mussel, for example, outcompetes native species  for resources by removing live animals and algae that other fish eat from  water bodies, and it blocks pipes that deliver drinking water to cities and  cooling water to power plants.

Specifically, based on our analysis of the GLRI  Action Plan, some of the goals and objectives in the Action Plan do not  link to any measures of progress, which EPA uses to assess GLRI  progress. For example, one of the goals of the habitat and wildlife  protection and restoration focus area is that development activities are  planned and implemented in ways that are sensitive to environmental  considerations and compatible with fish and wildlife and their habitats.  However, we found that none of the six objectives and nine measures of  progress in this focus area link to this goal. Similarly, in its 2012 review of  the GLRI Action Plan, EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board commented on the  ambiguity in the links between the elements of the plan, such as between  the long-term goals and the objectives. The Science Advisory Board also  recommended that the Action Plan tie the measures more directly to the  goals, noting that the more clear and transparent the connection between  the measures and the goals, the easier it will be to document how well the  actions are working to meet the goals.", "EPA officials told us that the Action Plan was not intended to contain  direct linkages between every goal, objective, and measure but rather  that the measures were to serve as key indicators of success for each  focus area. They said that the rationale for that decision was to provide  some flexibility, recognizing that not all important restoration work may fall  within the measures of progress and that the Action Plan does not  represent the entirety of actions necessary for Great Lakes protection and  restoration. However, based on our review of documents on planning for  restoration of natural resources, we believe that clear linkages between a  plan\u2019s goals, objectives, and measures are critical to achieving and  assessing progress over time. For example, the National Research  Council recommended such linkages in its checklist for planning and  evaluating aquatic ecosystem restoration. Specifically, the National  Research Council recommended constructing specific performance  indicators that are directly and appropriately linked to each objective,  noting that these performance indicators are specific, measureable  quantities that reveal to what extent the objectives are being achieved.  In addition, the Department of the Interior\u2019s 2009 technical guidance on  managing natural resources emphasizes that, to be useful for decision  making and evaluation, objectives need to be unambiguous, with specific  metrics and specific target conditions.", "We recognize that it may not always be feasible or appropriate to identify  measures for every aspect of each goal or objective. Nonetheless,  although some objectives in the Action Plan describe quantifiable actions,  the Action Plan contains no measures of progress for them. For example,  two Action Plan objectives for the nearshore health and nonpoint source  pollution focus area state that, by 2014, (1) 50 percent of high priority  Great Lakes beaches will have been assessed using a standardized  sanitary survey tool to identify sources of contamination and (2) rapid  testing or predictive modeling methods (i.e., to improve the accuracy of  decisions on beach postings to better protect public health) will be  employed at 33 percent of high-priority beaches. However, because the  Action Plan contains no measures of progress that link to these  objectives, it is unclear how EPA will be able to assess annual progress  toward these and other objectives that do not have linked measures. EPA  officials told us that they recognize the need to report a more  comprehensive assessment of objectives and are considering options for  evaluating and reporting on them.", "Many of the projects funded by the GLRI do not have an Action Plan  measure of progress assigned to them, which means that the results of  those projects are not captured by the measures. Specifically, nearly 60  percent of the more than 1,450 GLRI projects reported in GLAS as of May  2013 did not have an associated Action Plan measure of progress. One  reason for this is that, according to a Task Force agency, some projects  contribute to the Action Plan measures but are not the type of on-the- ground restoration projects that are addressed by most of the measures  of progress. Officials from the U.S. Geological Survey told us that this is  the case for much of their agency\u2019s GLRI work. For example, the  agency\u2019s work has included efforts to develop new methods of controlling  phragmites, an invasive plant. This work contributes toward the Action  Plan\u2019s objective of developing or refining and pilot testing five  technologies to contain or control invasive species by 2014. However,  there is no linked measure of progress for this objective or assigned to  the project. As a result, EPA\u2019s progress assessments may inaccurately  capture the extent of progress being made toward containing or  controlling invasive species.", "According to EPA officials, projects without assigned measures address  the Action Plan goals, objectives, or principal actions; the reason these  projects do not have measures assigned to them is that they do not  directly provide data for any of the Action Plan\u2019s 28 measures. They told  us that they monitor the results of individual projects through standard  agency practices, but that they are not currently tracking cumulative  results that are not addressed by an Action Plan measure of progress.  According to agency officials, future GLRI progress assessments may  capture more information. Specifically, they said that the cumulative  results of some of the projects without assigned measures of progress  may ultimately be captured by some of the existing measures. We  recognize that this may be the case for some projects. For example,  projects to restore native fish habitat that do not have assigned measures  of progress could help lead to progress over time toward the measure  that addresses the percentage of native aquatic species populations that  are self-sustaining in the wild. However, a cumulative approach may not  allow EPA to capture specific progress information from those projects  without measures, and EPA uses the measures to assess GLRI progress  and has been directed to report on that progress annually. As we reported  in November 2002, one attribute of successful performance assessment  is that there should be enough measures to ensure that an agency has  the information it needs about project performance. Without methods to  include the results of such projects, EPA cannot ensure that the agency is  assessing the full extent of progress being made.", "Data used to evaluate some measures of progress may not be complete  because GLAS users are limited to reporting progress using a single  measure, and GLRI projects may directly address multiple measures  across different focus areas. We found that 7 of the 28 measures of  progress are tracked primarily in GLAS and, as we noted previously, EPA  uses information from GLAS, as well as other sources, to gauge GLRI  progress toward meeting the targets for the measures. Officials from five  Task Force agencies told us that this is a significant limitation that can  result in underreporting of progress. For example, a National Park Service  GLRI project has involved managing acres for invasive species, which is  one measure, as well as outreach to the public on practices that prevent  the introduction and spread of invasive species, which is another  measure. However, GLAS requires the agency to choose only one of  these measures for reporting progress. EPA officials told us that GLAS  users are restricted to reporting on a single measure due primarily to a  decision by EPA to simplify the reporting process during the initial stages  of the GLRI. Agency officials said that this decision was made for several  reasons, including concerns about double-counting and overreporting, a  desire to minimize the reporting burden for GLAS users and EPA, and the  need to ensure appropriate data quality review before making the  progress information public. They said that the current design of GLAS  reflects this decision and that system modifications would be necessary to  allow reporting on multiple measures. However, by limiting users to  reporting information on only a single measure for each project, GLAS  prevents EPA from collecting complete progress information on GLRI  projects\u2014that is, information on each of the measures addressed by  GLRI projects. As we noted previously, there should be enough measures  to ensure that an agency has the information it needs to assess project  performance. Without collecting information about the multiple measures  affected by a project, the data EPA is using for certain measures of  progress cannot be complete, and EPA is likely underreporting progress  for these measures.", "EPA officials told us that they began to address this issue in fiscal year  2012 for two complementary measures in the habitat and wildlife  protection and restoration focus area, the miles of rivers reopened for fish  passage, and the number of fish passage barriers removed or bypassed.  Specifically, EPA has begun asking GLRI funding recipients reporting on  one of these measures to indicate progress, if any, on the complementary  measure. This effort will help EPA obtain more complete information on  these two measures, but it does not address the broader reporting  limitation in GLAS, which EPA officials told us may result in  underreporting of progress for certain measures. EPA officials told us that  they will consider addressing this limitation in GLAS, but they did not  indicate a time frame for doing so.", "In addition, although EPA officials told us that they have concerns about  the quality of GLRI progress information in GLAS, they have not fully  assessed the quality of that information, such as its completeness,  accuracy, and consistency. As a result, the agency has not made this  information available to the public. While practices required under GPRA,  as amended, are required at the federal department or agency level, we  have previously reported that these requirements can serve as leading  practices for planning at lower levels within federal agencies, such as  individual programs or initiatives. Thus, EPA is not required to address  requirements under GPRA, as amended, for GLAS, but by following  them, the agency would be implementing leading practices. The GPRA  Modernization Act of 2010 requires, among other things, that agency  performance plans and reports describe how the agency ensures the  reliability of the data used to measure progress toward its performance  goals, including how it verifies and validates measured values of  performance and compensates for any limitations to the data to reach the   Verification includes the assessment of data  required level of accuracy.completeness, accuracy, and consistency to ensure that the data will be  of sufficient quality to document performance and support decision  making. In light of this and EPA\u2019s concerns about the quality of the GLRI  progress data in GLAS, we also have concerns about the use of these  data for measuring progress toward the Action Plan goals and objectives.", "GLRI funding recipients are responsible for entering information about the  progress of their GLRI projects directly into GLAS, and EPA has methods  in place to review this information on a project-by-project basis. For  example, EPA has developed a plan for managing the grants, interagency  agreements, and contracts the agency awards for GLRI projects.  According to agency officials, this plan synthesizes existing agency  standards and policies and itemizes the activities to be undertaken by  project officers and others to ensure an effective grant oversight process.  Among other things, this plan specifies that, for interagency agreements,  EPA officials who are GLRI project officers will review progress reports  submitted by GLRI funding recipients and that the project officers will  compare the information in those reports to the information entered in  GLAS.  According to EPA officials, project officers for grants are also  expected to compare information in progress reports with information in  GLAS.", "GLRI funding recipients are required to submit semiannual progress reports to EPA.  According to EPA officials, they do not use these project reports to assess GLRI progress.  This is because the progress reports are for administrative management purposes and not  for reporting progress made toward the Action Plan measures. identifying improvements. The officials noted that they are also  considering whether GLAS is the right tool for the GLRI. EPA officials had  not determined a time frame for this work as of June 2013.", "Some Task Force and state agency officials, subject matter experts, and  EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board, raised concerns that certain measures of  progress or their targets may not be useful for indicating GLRI progress  toward the Action Plan\u2019s goals and objectives.", "Climatic factors may affect the usefulness of some measures. Five of the  six measures of progress for the nearshore health and nonpoint source  pollution focus area may not be useful for indicating GLRI progress over  the short term toward the Action Plan\u2019s goals and objectives. Specifically,  EPA officials and others have noted that these measures address  environmental conditions that are influenced by climatic factors, such as  precipitation and wind patterns. These factors make it difficult to identify  whether the restoration efforts are having the desired effects. For  example, one of the measures of progress in the Action Plan for this  focus area tracks the square miles of harmful algal blooms in the Great  Lakes. According to information from EPA officials, such algal blooms are  influenced by climatic factors such as precipitation patterns, water  temperature, and wind speed and direction. Officials from another Task  Force agency also told us that because of factors such as weather that  cannot be controlled, the extent of algal blooms in any given year is not  directly related to the management actions being taken in the GLRI and,  as a result, the measure is not useful for indicating GLRI progress toward  the Action Plan\u2019s goals and objectives. EPA officials told us that, given  the short period of time the GLRI has been under way, factors such as  temperature and the amount and timing of precipitation are currently the  primary factors affecting the extent of algal bloom. Officials also told us  that, over the long term, management actions will lead to lower  phosphorous levels, which will have a minimizing affect on the extent of  such algal blooms. However, over the short term, this measure may not  be useful for indicating GLRI progress toward the focus area\u2019s objective  of significantly reducing the number and severity of incidences of harmful  algal blooms by 2014. In addition, we have previously reported criteria for  determining the extent to which an agency\u2019s performance plan provides a  clear picture of intended performance, including that measures must  clearly represent or be related to the performance they are trying to  assess.related to management actions being taken may not be useful for  indicating GLRI progress toward the Action Plan\u2019s goals and objectives.  While we recognize that the Action Plan is not a performance plan, using  criteria intended for performance plans is appropriate because EPA uses  the Action Plan\u2019s measures of progress to assess GLRI progress as an  agency would use the measures in a performance plan.", "Therefore, measures that track conditions that are not directly  Some measures track actions that may not be sufficient to lead to the  desired GLRI goals. For example, one of the goals for the toxic  substances and areas of concern focus area is that environmental levels  of toxic chemicals are reduced to the point that all restrictions on the  consumption of Great Lakes fish can be lifted. A measure of progress that  links to this goal tracks the long-term reduction in average concentrations  of PCBs in Great Lakes fish. However, officials from two Task Force  agencies and two state agencies, as well as five subject matter experts,  reported that the measure\u2019s focus on PCBs is too narrow and that other  contaminants, particularly mercury, need to be addressed as well. EPA\u2019s  Science Advisory Board also noted this narrow focus in its 2012 review of  the Action Plan. Mercury is important because, according to a 2011  binational study of mercury in the Great Lakes region, it has widely  contaminated the region and has been responsible for fish consumption  advisories in the eight Great Lakes states and the Canadian province of   The study concluded that mercury, largely due to atmospheric  Ontario. emissions from coal-fired power plants, remains a pollutant of major  concern with an impact on fish in the region that is much greater than  previously recognized. Consequently, reducing average concentrations of  PCBs in fish is not likely to lead to lifting all restrictions on the  consumption of Great Lakes fish. Because this measure does not clearly  represent all of the contaminants that need to be addressed, it may not be  useful for indicating GLRI progress toward the Action Plan\u2019s goals and  objectives.", "D.

For  example, one goal of the invasive species focus area is to eliminate the  introduction of new invasive species, with a 2014 objective of reducing  the yearly average rate of invasive species newly detected in the Great  Lakes ecosystem by 40 percent, compared with the period from 2000 to  2009. The linked measure of progress addresses the rate at which  nonnative species are newly detected in the Great Lakes ecosystem. The  source of data used to evaluate this measure is a database maintained by  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. According to  information on this database, the identification of new species depends  on the ability to find, recognize, verify, and document new species, which  is, in turn, dependent on the ability to adequately sample the Great Lakes  ecosystem. Officials from a state agency and four subject matter experts  raised concerns about the usefulness of this measure for assessing  progress toward the Action Plan objectives, noting that the number of new  species detected will increase if surveillance for invasive species  increases or improves. One of these experts noted that meeting the  targets may not represent progress because monitoring efforts are low,  and another of these experts told us that the measure needs to be  combined with a known level of monitoring. Similarly, National Oceanic  and Atmospheric Administration officials agreed that progress toward the  targets for this measure will vary depending on the extent of monitoring  and the ability of surveillance to detect new nonnative species, and they  told us that, without a known level of monitoring, it may not be possible to  reliably identify trends in the introduction or detection of new species  using this measure. As we reported in November 2002, one attribute of  successful performance measures is that they are likely to produce the  same results if applied repeatedly to the same situation. If efforts to  identify new species depend on the ability to adequately sample the Great  Lakes ecosystem and surveillance or levels of monitoring are not  consistent throughout the program, then this measure may not be useful  for indicating GLRI progress toward the Action Plan\u2019s goals and  objectives.", "Targets for some measures may not represent significant ecological  improvement. EPA\u2019s Science Advisory Board reported in its 2012 review  of the GLRI Action Plan that it is not clear whether the targets for the  measures of progress reflect significant or measurable improvement, or  whether achieving the targets will result in real ecological benefit. It also  noted that it is not clear how the targets were developed and, that while  the measures of progress include baselines for the targets, the universe  is not always defined. For example, one measure in the nearshore  health and nonpoint source pollution focus area addresses the amount of  land with certain conservation practices implemented to reduce erosion,  nutrients, and pesticides. The Action Plan reports a baseline of 165,000  acres with such practices already being implemented and identifies a  2014 target of 247,500 acres, a 50 percent increase. However, the Action  Plan does not identify the universe (i.e., the total acreage of land upon  which such practices could be implemented), which the Science Advisory  Board reported is more than 38 million acres of agricultural land in the  United States within the Great Lakes Basin. Consequently, using this  universe, the 50 percent increase in acreage using such conservation  measures represents a change from 0.4 percent to 0.6 percent of the total  U.S. agricultural land in the Great Lakes Basin. According to the Science  Advisory Board, it is not clear if this change is meaningful and how this  percentage of improvement will potentially result in the restoration of the  Great Lakes ecosystem.

EPA and several Task Force agencies in 2000  adopted a unified federal policy on watershed management that defined  adaptive management as a type of natural resource management in  which decisions are made as part of an ongoing science-based process  that involves (1) testing, monitoring, and evaluating applied strategies; (2)  incorporating new knowledge into management approaches that are  based on scientific findings and the needs of society; and (3) using results  to modify management policy, strategies, and practices. This policy  stated that the agencies would incorporate adaptive management  principles into their programs and use adaptive management to improve  watershed conditions. More recently, in the 2012 amendment to the Great  Lakes Water Quality Agreement, the United States and Canada agreed to  be guided by the principles and approaches of adaptive management,  which is described in the agreement as a systematic process to assess  the effectiveness of actions and adjust future actions to achieve the  objectives of the agreement, as outcomes and ecosystem processes  become better understood.", "There is no universal definition for adaptive management or fixed set of  steps that constitutes an adaptive management process, but key  elements of this iterative process based on guidance documents from  several Task Force agencies are summarized in figure 4.

In response to this  recommendation, in May 2013, the Task Force agencies released the  draft GLRI Adaptive Science-Based Framework for Great Lakes  Restoration, or draft framework, for public comment.", "The draft framework recommends use of an \u201cadaptive restoration\u201d  approach for the GLRI that includes most of the key elements of adaptive  management.

According to the respondent,  the plan his organization developed will directly assist the  governments of the United States and Canada in meeting their  obligations under the 2012 amendment to the Great Lakes Water  Quality Agreement, which requires the two governments to develop  and implement an early detection and rapid response initiative for  aquatic invasive species, among other things.", "Officials we interviewed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration told us that the agency\u2019s dissemination of training  materials for educators and climate curricula for elementary through  high school students, which is customized for the Great Lakes region,  is on target to reach more than 3,000 students and 50 teachers by the  end of fiscal year 2013. As a result, officials said, the number of  institutions incorporating this information into existing curricula far  exceeds the GLRI Action Plan targets. Specifically, the Action Plan\u2019s  2013 target for the measure that addresses the number of educational  institutions incorporating Great Lakes protection and stewardship  criteria into their environmental education curricula is 10 institutions.

In  addition, they said that the index is better suited for assessments of long- term, as opposed to annual, changes in the health of the ecosystem. EPA  officials also questioned how meaningful it was to use just one number to  convey information about the state of the multiple ecosystems and  indicators within the Great Lake basin.", "EPA officials also explained that the GLRI is a relatively new undertaking  and that getting visible, lake-wide and basin-wide ecosystem  improvements from Great Lakes restoration efforts is a slow process.

One such factor is atmospheric deposition, which is a process  that transfers pollutants from the air to the earth\u2019s surface and can  significantly impair water quality in the nation\u2019s rivers, lakes, bays, and  estuaries, and harm human health and aquatic ecosystems. Airborne  pollutants transferred by atmospheric deposition can fall to the ground in  precipitation or as a gas or particle and be deposited either directly onto  the surface of a water body or onto land and then transported into a water  body through runoff. Atmospheric deposition contributed to the presence  of toxaphene in the Great Lakes. Toxaphene is an insecticide that was  once primarily used in southern states from 1947 to 1980, and it was  banned in the United States for all uses in 1990. It is toxic for many  aquatic organisms and accumulates in fish and shellfish causing health  problems in humans who consume them.", "We asked survey respondents to rank nine factors that are not addressed  in the Action Plan on the basis of their potential to limit the restoration of  the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem.

Survey respondents also reported that factors  such as the removal of water from the Great Lakes for use outside of the  region and the effects of population growth in the Great Lakes region  have the potential to limit the restoration of the health of the Great Lakes\u2019  ecosystem to a great or very great extent by 57 percent (101 out of 176  respondents) and 49 percent (87 out of 176 respondents) respectively.", "In addition, we asked 21 Great Lakes subject matter experts we  interviewed to rank these factors, and 13 of the 21 experts identified the  same top two factors the survey respondents did, noting that both  inadequate infrastructure for wastewater or stormwater and the effects of  climate change have the potential to limit the restoration of the health of  the Great Lakes ecosystem to a great or very great extent.", "Inadequate infrastructure for wastewater or stormwater refers to the  deteriorating condition of the nation\u2019s wastewater systems. These  systems include sewer pipes that convey wastewater from homes and  businesses to treatment facilities before discharging it into water bodies  or land. In a 2004 report to Congress, EPA estimated that more than 1.2  million miles of pipes delivered wastewater into these systems. EPA has  also reported that the vast majority of the pipes making up the nation\u2019s  wastewater systems were installed more than 50 years ago and are  reaching the end of their useful lives. In addition to the age of these  systems, their conveyance capacity (i.e., the rate at which they can  transport water) is often exceeded during rainfall or snowmelt, which adds  to the discharge of wastewater into U.S. surface waters. According to the  American Society of Civil Engineers, the age and inadequate capacity of  wastewater infrastructure systems lead to the discharge billion of gallons  of untreated wastewater into U.S. surface waters each year.", "Inadequate infrastructure can cause conditions that may slow, if not  negate, restoration efforts, such as to improve water quality or reduce the  number of days a beach is closed. This is because most wastewater  systems are designed to discharge flows that exceed conveyance  capacity directly to rivers, streams, and other surface waters. One Great  Lakes interest group reported that five U.S. cities alone discharged 41  billion gallons of untreated sewage and stormwater into the Great Lakes  from January 2009 to January 2010. needs survey report, EPA stated that $19.7 billion was needed to address  publicly owned wastewater and stormwater infrastructure needs in the  Great Lakes Basin.", "Healing Our Waters \u2013 Great Lakes Coalition, Turning the Tide: Investing in Wastewater  Infrastructure to Create Jobs and Solve the Sewage Crisis in the Great Lakes (Ann Arbor,  MI: August 2010). According to the report, data for this statement was provided by the five  cities and EPA. but a strong scientific consensus has emerged in recent years from the  U.S. Global Change Research Program and the National Research  Council that the future likely entails greater risks of flooding, drought, and  changes in the frequency and severity of storms. In addition, several  organizations have predicted specific effects of climate change in the  Great Lakes, which could negatively affect GLRI restoration efforts, such  as to remove contaminated sediments from areas of concern or reduce  the introduction of invasive species. For example, according to a 2000  report by the U.S. Global Change Research Program, drought could lead  to certain situations in the Great Lakes that may require additional  dredging of sediments at an annual cost of from $75 million to $125  million\u2014about $101.6 million to $129.6 million in 2013 dollars\u2014simply to  maintain shipping lanes. In addition, the U.S. Global Change Research  Program reported in 2009 that warming water temperatures can lead to  increased numbers of aquatic invasive species, which tend to thrive under  a wide range of environmental conditions, and a decline in native species,  which are adapted to a narrower range of conditions. As we noted  previously, invasive species such as the zebra mussel have caused  extensive ecological and economic damage to the Great Lakes.", "One way to reduce the potential effects of climate change is to invest in  enhancing resilience. As defined by the National Academies, resilience is  the ability to prepare and plan for, absorb, recover from, and more  successfully adapt to adverse events.  Enhanced resilience results from better planning to reduce losses, rather than waiting for an event to occur  and paying for recovery afterward. Many jurisdictions in the Great Lakes  region have recognized the threat of climate change and committed  resources to prepare for its effects, according to a 2012 report focused on  the region. Among these efforts, several Great Lakes states and the city  of Chicago have each created climate change action plans that identify  steps being taken to reduce the effects of climate change. For example,  the city of Chicago identified the use of green roofs as one of many  climate change mitigation and adaptation actions in its 2008 Chicago  Climate Action Plan. In its subsequent progress report, Chicago  reported that more than 4 million square feet of green roofs had been   A green roof is a vegetative layer  planned or completed since 2008.grown on a rooftop that provides shade and removes heat from the air,  reducing temperatures of the roof surface and the surrounding air. As a  result, green roofs act as insulators for buildings and reduce the energy  needed to provide cooling and heating, which can decrease the  production of associated air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions that  contribute to climate change.", "In addition, some Great Lakes jurisdictions have recognized that climate  change can exacerbate other factors that may limit Great Lakes  restoration. As we reported in April 2013, the Milwaukee Metropolitan  Sewerage District officials employed what they called \u201cgreen  infrastructure\u201d programs to make the district\u2019s sewer system more  resilient to climate change by capturing and holding or slowing the flow of  stormwater. This was done as part of broader efforts to meet growing  demand for sewer capacity, and officials plan to incorporate climate  change adaptation into infrastructure planning and design where it makes  sense as their facilities age and are replaced over time.", "The Action Plan does not include goals, objectives, or measures of  progress that show how the GLRI should address inadequate  infrastructure, the effects of climate change, or other key factors that may  limit the Action Plan\u2019s success and overall progress concerning the health  of the Great Lakes ecosystem, with two exceptions. In some cases,  such as with inadequate infrastructure for wastewater or stormwater and  atmospheric deposition of pollutants from sources outside the Great  Lakes Basin, the Action Plan notes that some of these issues are  addressed by other federal programs. For example, the Action Plan  states that infrastructure needs will be addressed through increased  funding for EPA\u2019s Clean Water State Revolving Funds, a program that  provides states and local communities with independent and sustainable  sources of financial assistance, such as low- or no-interest loans, to fund  water quality projects identified by the states and localities. EPA reported  in 2010 that the program has provided more than $74 billion for these  projects since 1988. As we testified in March 2013, however,  wastewater infrastructure needs are made more daunting by the limited  resources and budgets facing all levels of government.", "The Action Plan acknowledges that the effects of climate change may  have implications across all five of the Action Plan\u2019s focus areas, and that  the needs of communities to adapt to those effects will be assessed and  addressed by GLRI projects and programs where appropriate. However,  the Action Plan does not state how these effects will be addressed. To  date, EPA has made some modest efforts to acknowledge the issue in  the context of the Great Lakes. In its 2012 request for grant applications,  for example, EPA included $200,000 for two to five grants for projects to  increase climate change resiliency in Great Lakes communities. EPA also  included an incentive in the request for applications for 2012 for the  applicants to consider climate change impacts through vulnerability  assessments or the integration of climate change adaptation measures  into their project. Specifically, applicants could increase their eligibility for  a grant by addressing climate change in their proposal.", "The GLRI was created to accelerate the protection, maintenance, and  restoration of the integrity of the Great Lakes. If the Action Plan does not  state how the GLRI should address key factors\u2014such as inadequate  infrastructure and the effects of climate change\u2014then the ability of  restoration efforts guided by the Action Plan to achieve the GLRI\u2019s goal is  uncertain because these factors may negatively affect restoration efforts.  EPA has acknowledged that the effects of climate change can be  detrimental to the Great Lakes and stated in its fiscal year 2013 budget  justification that it is imperative that consideration of climate change and  climate adaptation be integrated into GLRI grants and projects to ensure  the overall success of the GLRI. Nonetheless, to date, EPA has made  few connections between this key issue and the potential effects of  climate change. At a series of public meetings and webinars beginning in  May 2013, EPA requested input regarding whether the connection  between the Action Plan focus areas and the protection of the Great  Lakes from the effects of climate change should be expressed more  clearly in the next Action Plan. In commenting on a draft of this report,  EPA officials told us that they have heard from many stakeholders about  the need for the fiscal year 2015 to 2019 Action Plan to place additional  emphasis on climate change, and that there is broad agreement on this  point among the task force agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As directed by Congress, EPA and the other Task Force agencies began  implementing the GLRI in fiscal year 2010 to address the stresses that  threaten the health of the Great Lakes ecosystem and help restore the  health of the Great Lakes and issued the GLRI Action Plan to guide  implementation of the approximately $1.3 billion appropriated to the  program. A collaborative and comprehensive approach, it is clear that  both federal and nonfederal GLRI stakeholders believe that the program  is making strides toward its goals. For example, GLRI efforts enabled  EPA to remove the Presque Isle Bay area of concern from the list of  areas of concern identified by the United States and Canada.

EPA and the Task Force agencies recently issued a plan that includes  most but not all of the key elements of adaptive management, and it  does not provide details on how the elements of adaptive  management will be implemented.

We also attended the Eighth  Annual Great Lakes Restoration Conference in Cleveland in September  2012 to learn more about the GLRI and Great Lakes restoration, and  webinars to learn about the GLRI grant application process and how to  use GLAS.", "To examine the methods that EPA has in place to assess GLRI progress,  we analyzed the Action Plan, documentation about GLAS, information  from GLAS about GLRI project measures of progress, information  provided by EPA on the sources of data for each of the plan\u2019s measures  of progress, the draft GLRI Adaptive Science-Based Framework for Great  Lakes Restoration (draft Framework), and EPA\u2019s Science Advisory  Board\u2019s 2012 review of the Action Plan.", "We interviewed EPA officials to  discuss their methods of assessing GLRI progress. We used the  interviews with Task Force agency officials described above, and we  conducted interviews with relevant officials from each of the Great Lakes  states\u2014Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin\u2014to discuss the Action Plan. We also  conducted interviews with subject matter experts, to obtain their views  about the achievability and usefulness of the Action Plan\u2019s measures of  progress and related annual targets.", "As part of our analysis of the Action Plan, we evaluated the extent to  which the long-term goals and objectives in the plan have corresponding  measures of progress. One analyst first compared the objectives for each  focus area with the goals. The analyst considered whether it appeared  that an objective would clearly contribute to attaining a goal. For example,  in the invasive species focus area, the objective of developing and  refining/piloting technologies that contain or control invasive species  appears to clearly contribute to attaining the goal of preventing the spread  of invasive species. The analyst also considered whether there was  consistent or similar language in any of the goals and objectives that  helped identify links between them. For example, the analysts examined if  aspects of a goal in one focus area could be identified in an objective in  the same focus area, such as in the toxic substances and areas of  concern focus area, we identified similar language between the objective  of reducing the concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in fish  through 2014 and the goal of reducing environmental levels of toxic  chemicals to the point that all restrictions on the consumption of Great  Lakes fish can be lifted. Objectives could correspond to multiple goals.  The analyst then compared the measures for each focus area to the  objectives and looked for consistent or similar language in any of them  that helped identify links between the objectives and measures. The  analyst considered whether a measure was closely related to an objective  and whether it appeared that progress toward at least part of the objective  could clearly be assessed by a corresponding measure of progress.  Measures could correspond to multiple objectives. We requested  additional information from EPA officials on goals, objectives, and  measures as needed to improve our understanding of them. A second  analyst examined the conclusions of the first. In cases where there were  initially disagreements between the two analysts regarding the  identification of linkages between goals, objectives, and measures, all  disagreements were resolved through analyst discussions. Ultimately,  there was 100 percent agreement between the analysts. In addition, we  evaluated the extent to which EPA and the Task Force agencies had  established an adaptive management plan for the GLRI by first reviewing  guidance from several Task Force agencies to identify key elements of  adaptive management. We then examined the extent to which the GLRI  Action Plan and draft Framework addressed those elements.", "For our interviews with officials from each of the Great Lakes states, we  developed a set list of open-ended questions for these interviews to  obtain official\u2019s views about the Action Plan, among other things. We  identified the state agencies that we would contact by starting with the list  of state agencies identified at EPA\u2019s Great Lakes website as interested  parties. We then contacted officials from each interested party to  determine if their agency was the lead GLRI agency for the state or to  learn if we should contact a different agency. As a result of this process,  we identified the following as lead GLRI state agencies: the Illinois  Department of Natural Resources; the Indiana Department of  Environmental Management; the Michigan Department of Environmental  Quality; the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency; the New York  Department of Environmental Conservation; the Ohio Lake Erie  Commission; the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection;  and, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.", "For the interviews with subject matter experts, we developed a set list of  questions about the Action Plan\u2019s long-term goals, objectives, and  measures of progress. The experts we interviewed included state agency  officials, members of academia, and representatives of nongovernmental  organizations who had expertise in one or more of the Action Plan\u2019s five  focus areas. We identified these experts by asking for recommendations  of at least three experts in each of the focus areas from 24  representatives of nonfederal Great Lakes stakeholders or Great Lakes  interest groups organizations: 12 were nonfederal attendees of the Eighth  Annual Great Lakes Restoration Conference that we selected randomly to  conduct interviews about the Action Plan and the GLRI, and 12 were  representatives of nonfederal organizations that we contacted as part of  learning more about the GLRI and the Great Lakes. We received  responses from 17 of the 24 individuals who recommended a total of 187  subject matter experts. We then created a list of the 33 experts who had  been recommended two or more times and invited 31 of them to  participate in interviews to obtain their views on the Action Plan goals,  objectives, and measures of progress, among other things. Of those 31  experts, 21 agreed to be interviewed: five experts in focus area one; six  experts in focus area two; three experts in focus area three; four experts  in focus area four; and three experts in focus area five. Because we used  a nonprobability sample, the information obtained from these interviews is  not generalizable to other individuals with expertise in the Action Plan  focus areas but provides illustrative information.", "To examine the progress identified by the Task Force agencies and  nonfederal stakeholders, we took several steps: we reviewed the fiscal  year 2010 and 2011 GLRI progress reports that EPA and the other Task  Force agencies issued to Congress in April and March 2013,  respectively; we administered a web-based survey to each of the 205 nonfederal stakeholders that, as of October 2012, had received GLRI  funds from a Task Force agency and had a project identified in GLAS; we  used the interviews with officials from each Task Force agency identified  above; and, we visited several GLRI projects in Illinois.", "We conducted a web-based survey of all of the nonfederal GLRI  stakeholders that have reported projects in GLAS, as of October 10,  2012, to identify examples of GLRI progress by obtaining their views on  how their GLRI projects have benefited the ecosystem, among other  things. The questionnaire used for this study is in appendix V. EPA  provided us with contact information for each of those stakeholders, and  we sent at least one e-mail to a point of contact from each stakeholder to  identify the best point of contact for our survey. We surveyed the universe  of the 205 nonfederal stakeholders that have projects in GLAS, as of  October 10, 2012, and received responses from 176 nonfederal GLRI  stakeholders for a response rate of 86 percent.", "We designed draft questionnaires in close collaboration with a GAO  social science survey specialist. We conducted pretests with three  nonfederal GLRI stakeholders to help further refine our questions,  develop new questions, and clarify any ambiguous portions of the survey.  We conducted the pretests over the phone, and we selected one GLRI  nonfederal stakeholder that had received GLRI funds for one grant and  two GLRI nonfederal stakeholders that had each received GLRI funds for  multiple grants for the pretest.", "We developed and administered the web-based questionnaire accessible  through a secure server, and we e-mailed unique identification numbers  and passwords to points of contact at the 205 nonfederal GLRI  stakeholders February 4, 2013. We sent follow-up e-mail messages  beginning February 11, 2013. Then we contacted all remaining  nonrespondents by telephone, starting February 26, 2013. The  questionnaire was available online until March 28, 2013. For questions  that should have been skipped but were not, we attempted to contact the  respondents for clarification and edited their responses where warranted.", "Because this was not a sample survey, it has no sampling errors.  However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  errors, known as nonsampling errors. For example, difficulties in  interpreting a particular question, sources of information available to  respondents, or when entering data into a questionnaire or analyzing the  data can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We took  steps in developing our questionnaire, collecting the data, and analyzing it  to minimize these errors. In addition, as indicated above, social science  survey specialists designed the questionnaire in collaboration with GAO  staff that had subject matter expertise. We then conducted three pretests  to check that (1) the questions were clear and unambiguous, (2)  terminology was used correctly, (3) the questionnaire did not place an  undue burden on respondents, (4) the information could feasibly be  obtained, and (5) the survey was comprehensive and unbiased. We made  multiple contact attempts with nonrespondents during the survey by e- mail, and some nonrespondents were also contacted by telephone. When  we analyzed the data, an independent analyst checked all computer  programs. Since this was a web-based survey, respondents entered their  answers directly into the electronic questionnaire, eliminating the need to  key data into a database, minimizing error.", "We conducted a computer-enabled content analysis to analyze  responses to the question \u201cPlease provide examples of how one or more  of your organization\u2019s GLRI projects have benefitted the Great Lakes  ecosystem.\u201d Of the 176 respondents, 163 provided information in  response to this question. We categorized the responses along two  dimensions: direct and indirect benefits, and observed or expected  benefits. We defined these categories based on whether respondents  reported that their organization\u2019s GLRI projects resulted in changes in the  ecosystem, such as reduced beach closure days, or other types of  changes, such as improved understanding of the ecosystem, and if  respondents reported that they had observed the result or expected to  observe them a later time. One reviewer developed content categories  based on survey responses and, after obtaining agreement on the  categories from the second reviewer, assessed and coded each survey  response into those categories. The second reviewer examined the  coding. In cases where disagreements among the two reviewers  regarding the coding of responses into content categories were found, all  disagreements were resolved through reviewer discussion. Ultimately,  there was 100 percent agreement between the reviewers. In addition, we  conducted follow-up interviews by phone and e-mail with those survey  respondents whose examples we wanted to include in the report to collect  clarifying information, if necessary.", "In addition to the survey, we used the interviews with Task Force agency  officials identified above to obtain information about GLRI progress. We  also visited several GLRI projects in Illinois. We traveled to Illinois  because EPA\u2019s Great Lakes National Program Office is located in  Chicago. We met with representatives from two nonfederal GLRI  stakeholders who took us to the sites of their GLRI projects; the two  nonfederal GLRI stakeholders\u2014the Chicago Park District and Waukegan  Harbor Citizens Advisory Group\u2014were recommended to us by an official  from the Illinois Department of Natural Resources.", "To examine the views of nonfederal stakeholders on factors, if any, that  may affect or limit GLRI progress, we used the web-based survey  described above. Specifically, we used the survey to obtain nonfederal  GLRI stakeholder views about factors that may have limited their ability to  carry out GLRI projects and factors that have the potential to affect the  restoration of Great Lakes health. As part of creating the survey, we  developed lists of factors that might limit GLRI project implementation  progress and factors that might limit the restoration of Great Lakes health  in general through interviews we conducted with 19 randomly selected  individuals at the Eight Annual Great Lakes Restoration Conference and  interviews we conducted with representatives from five nonfederal GLRI  stakeholders and one Great Lakes interest group. We narrowed the list of  factors that might limit GLRI project implementation progress to four  factors most often cited by interviewees as hindering their abilities to start  a project or to successfully carry out a project, and asked survey  respondents if they had experienced these factors and about the effects  of each of these factors on their GLRI projects. We narrowed the list of  factors that might limit the restoration of Great Lakes health in general to  the nine factors most often cited by grouping similar factors together and  eliminating those factors that are addressed by the Action Plan either  through Action Plan long-term goals, objectives, or measures of progress.  We eliminated those factors addressed by the Action Plan because this  meant they had already been identified by the GLRI as factors that had  the potential to limit restoration of Great Lakes health. We asked survey  respondents to identify the extent to which each of these factors had the  potential to limit the restoration of the health of the Great Lakes  ecosystem.", "We also used the interviews with subject matter experts mentioned above  to obtain information about the factors that may limit progress by asking  them to identify the extent to which each of the same nine factors we  included in the survey had the potential to limit the restoration of the  health of the Great Lakes ecosystem.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2012 to September 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
