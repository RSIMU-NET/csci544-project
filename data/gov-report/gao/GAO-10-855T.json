Accordingly, GAO was asked to testify on the benefits and risks of moving federal information technology into the cloud. This testimony summarizes the contents of a separate report that is being released today which describes (1) the models of cloud computing, (2) the information security implications of using cloud computing services in the federal government, and (3) federal guidance and efforts to address information security when using cloud computing. In preparing that report, GAO collected and analyzed information from industry groups, private-sector organizations, and 24 major federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Cloud computing has several service and deployment models. The service models include the provision of infrastructure, computing platforms, and software as a service. The deployment models relate to how the cloud service is provided. They include a private cloud, operated solely for an organization; a community cloud, shared by several organizations; a public cloud, available to any paying customer; and a hybrid cloud, a composite of deployment models. Cloud computing can both increase and decrease the security of information systems in federal agencies. Potential information security benefits include those related to the use of virtualization and automation, broad network access, potential economies of scale, and use of self-service technologies. In addition to benefits, the use of cloud computing can create numerous information security risks for federal agencies. Specifically, 22 of 24 major federal agencies reported that they are either concerned or very concerned about the potential information security risks associated with cloud computing. Risks include dependence on the security practices and assurances of a vendor, and the sharing of computing resources. However, these risks may vary based on the cloud deployment model. Private clouds may have a lower threat exposure than public clouds, but evaluating this risk requires an examination of the specific security controls in place for the cloud's implementation. Federal agencies have begun efforts to address information security issues for cloud computing, but key guidance is lacking and efforts remain incomplete. Although individual agencies have identified security measures needed when using cloud computing, they have not always developed corresponding guidance. Agencies have also identified challenges in assessing vendor compliance with government information security requirements and clarifying the division of information security responsibilities between the customer and vendor. Furthermore, while several governmentwide cloud computing security initiatives are under way by organizations such as the Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration, significant work needs to be completed. For example, the Office of Management and Budget has not yet finished a cloud computing strategy, or defined how information security issues will be addressed in this strategy. The General Services Administration has begun a procurement for expanding cloud computing services, but has not yet developed specific plans for establishing a shared information security assessment and authorization process. In addition, while the National Institute of Standards and Technology has begun efforts to address cloud computing information security, it has not yet issued cloud-specific security guidance. Until specific guidance and processes are developed to guide the agencies in planning for and establishing information security for cloud computing, they may not have effective information security controls in place for cloud computing programs. In the report being released today, GAO recommended that the Office of Management and Budget, the General Services Administration, and the Department of Commerce take steps to address cloud computing security, including completion of a strategy, consideration of security in a planned procurement of cloud computing services, and issuance of guidance related to cloud computing security. These agencies generally agreed with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on federal  guidance and efforts to address information security when using cloud  computing.

Examples of cloud computing include Web-based e-mail applications and  common business applications that are accessed online through a  browser, instead of through a local computer. The current administration  has highlighted cloud computing as having the potential to provide  information technology (IT) services more quickly and at a lower cost than  traditional methods.", "We have previously reported that cyber threats to federal information  systems and cyber-based critical infrastructures are evolving and  growing. Without proper safeguards, computer systems are vuln erable to  individuals and groups with malicious intentions who can intrude and use  their access to obtain and manipulate sensitive information, commit fraud,  disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer systems and  networks. Further, the increasing interconnectivity among information  systems, the Internet, and other infrastructure presents increasing  opportunities for attacks. For example, in 2009, several media reports  described incidents that affected cloud service providers such as Amazon  and Google.", "Given the potential risks, you requested that we examine the security  implications of cloud computing. In response to your request, our report  and my statement provide (1) a description of the models of cloud  computing, (2) a description of the information security implications of  using cloud computing services in the federal government, and (3) an  assessment of federal guidance and efforts to address information security  when using cloud computing. In conducting the work for our report, we  collected and analyzed information from industry groups, private-sector  organizations, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),  and 24 major federal agencies. Our work for the report was performed in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cloud Computing Is a Form of Shared Computing with Several Service and Deployment Models", "paragraphs": ["Cloud computing is a new form of delivering IT services that takes  advantage of several broad evolutionary trends in information technology,  including the use of virtualization. According to NIST, cloud computing is  a means \u201cfor enabling convenient, on-demand network access to a shared  pool of configurable computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned  and released with minimal management effort or service provider  interaction.\u201d NIST also states that an application should possess five  essential characteristics to be considered cloud computing; on-demand  self service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and  measured service.", "Cloud computing offers three service models: infrastructure as a service,  where a vendor offers various infrastructure components; platform as a  service, where a vendor offers a ready-to-use platform on which customers  can build applications; and software as a service, which provides a self- contained operating environment used to deliver a complete application  such as Web-based e-mail.", "In addition, four deployment models for providing cloud services have  been developed: private, community, public, and hybrid cloud. In a private  cloud, the service is set up specifically for one organization, although there  may be multiple customers within that organization and the cloud may  exist on or off the premises. In a community cloud, the service is set up for  related organizations that have similar requirements. A public cloud is  available to any paying customer and is owned and operated by the service  provider.

The use of virtualization and automation in  cloud computing can expedite the implementation of secure  configurations for virtual machine images. Other advantages relate to  cloud computing\u2019s broad network access and use of Internet-based  technologies. For example, several agencies stated that cloud computing  provides a reduced need to carry data in removable media because of the  ability to access the data through the Internet, regardless of location.  Additional advantages relate to the potential economies of scale and  distributed nature of cloud computing. In response to our survey, 22 of the  24 major agencies identified low-cost disaster recovery and data storage as  a potential benefit. The self-service aspect of cloud computing may also  provide benefits. For example, 20 of 24 major agencies identified the  ability to apply security controls on demand as a potential benefit.", "In addition to benefits, the use of cloud computing can create numerous  information security risks for federal agencies. In response to our survey,  22 of 24 major agencies reported that they are either concerned or very  concerned about the potential information security risks associated with  cloud computing. Several of these risks relate to being dependent on a  vendor\u2019s security assurances and practices. Specifically, several agencies  stated concerns about:  the possibility that ineffective or non-compliant service provider security  controls could lead to vulnerabilities affecting the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of agency information;  the potential loss of governance and physical control over agency data and  information when an agency cedes control to the provider for the  performance of certain security controls and practices; the insecure or ineffective deletion of agency data by cloud providers once  services have been provided and are complete; and   potentially inadequate background security investigations for service  provider employees that could lead to an increased risk of wrongful  activities by malicious insiders.", "Multitenancy, or the sharing of computing resources by different  organizations, can also increase risk. Twenty-three of 24 major agencies  identified multitenancy as a potential information security risk because  one customer could intentionally or unintentionally gain access to another  customer\u2019s data, causing a release of sensitive information. Another  concern is the increased volume of data transmitted across agency and  public networks. This could lead to an increased risk of the data being  intercepted in transit and then disclosed.", "Although there are numerous potential information security risks related  to cloud computing, these risks may vary based on the particular  deployment model.

These actions, however, have not always been accompanied by  development of related policies or procedures to secure their information  and systems.", "Most agencies have concerns about ensuring vendor compliance and  implementation of government information security requirements. In  addition, agencies expressed concerns about limitations on their ability to  conduct independent audits and assessments of security controls of cloud  computing service providers. Several industry representatives agreed that  compliance and oversight issues are a concern and raised the idea of  having a single government entity or other independent entity conduct  security oversight and audits of cloud computing service providers on  behalf of federal agencies. Agencies also stated that having a cloud service  provider that had been precertified as being in compliance with  government information security requirements through some type of  governmentwide approval process would make it easier for them to  consider adopting cloud computing.

According to OMB  officials, the initiative includes an online cloud computing storefront  managed by GSA and will likely contain several pilot cloud computing  projects, each with a lead agency. However, as of March 2010, a date had  not been set for the release of the strategy or for any of the pilots. In  addition, OMB has not yet defined how information security issues, such  as a shared assessment and authorization process, will be addressed in  this strategy.", "Federal agencies have stated that additional guidance on cloud computing  security would be helpful. Addressing information security issues as part  of this strategy would provide additional direction to agencies looking to  use cloud computing services.
