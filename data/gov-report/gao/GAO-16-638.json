ITS technologies can play an important role in facilitating multimodal choices in a rapidly changing transportation environment. This report describes: (1) the extent to which selected transit providers in large urbanized areas are using ITS, (2) the extent to which transit providers in small urban and rural areas are using ITS, (3) the benefits and challenges these transit providers experience in deploying ITS, and (4) the extent to which transit providers have utilized DOT resources to promote and support ITS.", "GAO reviewed DOT's ITS deployment data and ITS studies; interviewed DOT officials and public transit stakeholders; conducted three site visits, selected based on geographic dispersion and DOT recommendations; interviewed 31 transit providers serving large urbanized areas selected for geographic dispersion and use of multiple transit modes; and conducted a national survey of small urban and rural transit providers to obtain information on ITS technologies used."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Selected large and medium urban transit providers have deployed most Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) technologies, such as automatic vehicle location (AVL) and electronic fare payment. Most of these providers reported sharing data collected from ITS with the public or regional transportation providers to enable technology innovations and improve regional planning. Large and medium urban transit providers have also deployed advanced types of ITS technologies, such as smart phone applications to provide passengers with travel information and mobile ticketing. GAO estimates that small urban and rural transit providers are using security systems, computer-aided dispatch, AVL, and geographic information systems to, among other things, monitor safety and security and improve record-keeping and billing capabilities. However, most small urban and rural transit providers are not using other ITS technologies\u2014such as automatic passenger counters or electronic fare payment\u2014due to the cost of the technologies or because there is no perceived need.", "Transit providers GAO surveyed and interviewed reported various benefits from ITS including improved scheduling and routing, on-time performance and schedule adherence, and customer satisfaction. In addition, many large and medium urban transit providers reported that using combinations of technologies can increase benefits. By using technologies such as AVL and electronic fare payment together, for example, transit providers can obtain more precise ridership information, which can further improve their planning. However, transit providers GAO interviewed and surveyed noted that it can be difficult to quantify the benefits of using ITS technologies because, as reported by large and medium urban providers, it may be difficult to identify a unit of measurement, such as for greater staff efficiency, or attribute benefits to either ITS deployment or a specific technology. Transit providers also face an assortment of deployment challenges, including competing for funding internally with state-of-good-repair needs, reluctance from the transit workforce and leadership to embrace ITS technologies, coordinating deployment across regional agencies, and integrating technologies purchased from different vendors.", "The Department of Transportation (DOT) offers a variety of information resources to support ITS deployment, but few of the transit providers interviewed or surveyed reported using these resources. DOT officials, selected large and medium transit providers, and other public transit stakeholders told GAO that the transit community may not be using these resources because transit providers lack sufficient staff and the information provided may not reflect the transit community's needs. Additionally, DOT does not include small urban and rural transit providers in its ITS deployment survey, a tool officials said is used in designing information resources. DOT could improve the awareness and applicability of ITS resources by developing a strategy to raise awareness of DOT's resources available to the transit community and monitoring the adoption of ITS by transit providers in small urban and rural areas. Without greater efforts from DOT to make the transit community more aware of federal ITS resources and to tailor these resources to the needs of smaller providers, transit providers may be missing information that could help them make the most informed ITS deployment decisions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Transportation develop a strategy to raise awareness of federal resources for ITS deployment in the transit community and include ITS adoption by small urban and rural transit providers in ITS-monitoring efforts.

To help improve the  operations of transit vehicles and services, U.S. transit providers are  adopting a variety of wireless and wire line communications-based  information and electronic technologies\u2014collectively called Intelligent  Transportation Systems (ITS). ITS encompasses a broad range of  technologies, from security cameras to scheduling software, to improve  the operations and efficiency of public transportation. ITS technologies  can play an important role in improving transit operations in urban and  rural areas and facilitating multimodal choices in a rapidly changing  transportation environment. For example, software applications on mobile  devices can help urban transit riders optimize their travel by showing  arrival information for transit vehicles in real time. Transit providers in  major metropolitan areas have used ITS technologies for years, but less  is known about the extent of ITS use among transit providers in smaller  towns and rural areas.", "In this context, you asked us to review the use of ITS by transit providers  in the U.S. We addressed the following questions:  1.  To what extent are selected transit providers in large urban areas  using ITS?  2.  To what extent are transit providers in small urban and rural areas  using ITS?  3.  What benefits and challenges are transit providers in large urban,  small urban, and rural areas experiencing in deploying ITS?  4.  How does DOT promote and support the use of ITS technologies, and  to what extent do transit providers utilize these resources?", "To determine the extent of ITS use among transit providers in large urban  areas, we reviewed 2013 data on national ITS deployment from the  Department of Transportation (DOT). On the basis of interviews with DOT  officials and analysis of the 2013 ITS deployment data, we determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We conducted  site visits to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Portland and Eugene, Oregon; and  Tampa and Orlando, Florida to observe transit ITS deployments. We  selected these site visits based on criteria including geographic  dispersion and recommendations by the ITS Joint Program Office (JPO)  and Federal Transit Administration (FTA) officials and industry  stakeholders. During these site visits, we obtained documentation and  interviewed officials from public transit stakeholders including  municipalities, academic researchers, state departments of  transportation, and metropolitan planning organizations. We also  conducted semi-structured interviews on the use of ITS with a judgmental  sample of 31 transit providers serving large urban areas. We selected  transit providers that were geographically dispersed across the country  and represented the variety of transit modes offered in these areas. We  cannot use the information obtained from these interviews to generalize  to a broader population of transit providers. We separated the transit  providers into two categories: medium urban: 13 providers serving urbanized areas with populations  of 200,000\u20131 million, and  large urban: 18 providers serving urbanized areas with populations of  more than 1 million.", "We also interviewed officials from related industry associations such as  the American Public Transportation Association (APTA), Community  Transportation Association of America (CTAA), and Intelligent  Transportation Society of America (ITS America), and representatives  from two ITS vendors and four independent ITS consultants. We selected  the ITS vendors based on interviews with several transit providers in large  urban areas who utilized their products, and the consultants based on a  review of published transit ITS reports.", "To determine the extent of ITS use among transit providers in small urban  and rural areas, we conducted a generalizable, web-based survey of  transit providers serving small urban and rural areas from November to  December 2015. We define small urban transit providers as organizations  that provide public transit service primarily to urbanized areas of 50,000\u2013 199,999 people, and rural transit providers as organizations that primarily  serve rural areas (i.e., non-urbanized areas with fewer than 50,000  people). Based on discussions with several industry associations and  after conducting initial survey pretests with several transit providers, we  limited our scope to the providers for which the topic of ITS use was likely  most relevant. We therefore excluded rural providers that reported fleets  of 10 or fewer vehicles to the FTA\u2019s National Transit Database (NTD) in  reporting year 2013 from our sample frame. We identified a sample  frame of 896 small urban and rural transit providers using reporting year  2013 data from the NTD, and selected a stratified random sample of 312  of these providers for participation in the survey. The sample is  comprised of 146 recipients of Section 5307 FTA urbanized area formula  grants and 166 sub-recipients of Section 5311 FTA non-urbanized area  formula grants. Approximately 75 percent of our sample\u2014or 233  respondents\u2014 completed the survey. All estimates from the sample in  this report have a margin of error, at the 95 percent confidence level, of  plus or minus 10 percentage points or fewer, unless otherwise noted.

We analyzed the  interviews, survey results, and published research to identify commonly  cited benefits and challenges. To determine how DOT promotes and  supports the use of ITS technologies, we interviewed officials from the  JPO and FTA about the federal resources and assistance available to  support deployment and how transit providers use these resources. We  reviewed the JPO\u2019s program and strategic planning documents, including  documents related to the ITS Professional Capacity Building Program. In  addition, we reviewed the JPO\u2019s efforts to promote and support ITS  technologies, including various studies, guidance, websites, and the  JPO\u2019s ITS databases. We determined the extent to which transit  providers are utilizing DOT\u2019s ITS resources by asking transit provider  officials about their awareness and use of the training, technical  assistance, or knowledge resources programs offered by the JPO,  whether they had used these programs, and how helpful they had found  them to be, in interviews and through the survey. In prior work, we and  the National Academies\u2019 Transportation Research Board identified  leading practices for successfully encouraging the adoption of new  technologies.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2015 to June 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For  example, DOT\u2019s 2013 ITS deployment survey showed that transit  providers rated communication technologies, automatic vehicle location,  and security cameras as having provided them with the highest benefits.  Also, in DOT\u2019s 2014 updated report on information on the benefits, costs,  and lessons learned regarding ITS deployment studies, the agency  reported findings that transit providers experienced improvements in  operations and fleet management, such as achieving improved service  reliability through computer-aided dispatch, decreased transit travel times  through the use of transit signal priority, and increased ridership from  using traveler information systems. We asked the large and medium  urban transit providers in our review to describe the types of benefits their  ITS has collectively generated. Transit providers we interviewed  identified benefits from ITS broadly related to improvements in  administration, operations, and customer satisfaction. Below are  descriptions and examples of the five main types of benefits reported by  the majority of the large and medium urban transit providers we  interviewed.", "Improvements in on-time performance and schedule adherence: Officials  from 25 of the 31 large and medium urban transit providers said that data  from their ITS technologies\u2014such as automatic passenger counters,  automatic vehicle location, and computer-aided dispatch\u2014have improved  or were expected to improve the extent to which service remains on  schedule, which has improved their on-time performance. For example,  officials from 7 of these providers told us computer-aided dispatch and  automatic vehicle location enable them to monitor service in real time and  react to situations that might create service delays\u2014such as traffic,  accidents, or vehicle breakdowns\u2014by holding buses or creating route  detours. Further, officials from 4 of the large and medium urban transit  providers said they have used information from these technologies to  change schedules to better reflect actual arrival and departure times,  which has improved their on-time performance.", "Enhanced safety: Officials from 24 of the 31 large and medium urban  transit providers we interviewed told us that ITS technologies\u2014such as  automatic vehicle location, computer-aided dispatch, and various  elements of their security systems\u2014have improved the safety of their  passengers and operators by helping them prevent, manage, and review  incidents, such as criminal behavior and accidents. For example, officials  from 3 of these transit providers told us that automatic vehicle location  and computer-aided dispatch have reduced the number of accidents by  automating some of the driver\u2019s tasks, including providing drivers with  turn-by-turn directions and automating bus stop announcements, and  eliminating some of their distractions. Also, officials from 7 of the large  and medium urban transit providers told us that audio and video  surveillance technologies have enabled their organizations and  emergency responders to monitor and better respond to incidents.", "More efficient scheduling and routing: Officials from 24 of the 31 large  and medium urban transit providers told us that data from their ITS  technologies\u2014such as automatic passenger counters, automatic vehicle  location, computer-aided dispatch, and electronic fare payment  systems\u2014have enabled them to make improvements to their transit  service. For example, officials from 16 of the transit providers  experiencing this benefit told us these technologies provide them with  more precise information, such as passenger travel behavior and traffic  congestion. This information enables them to make data-driven decisions  about service\u2014such as routes, schedules, and bus stop locations\u2014that  make travel more efficient. Some of these officials told us that prior to  these systems, agencies made service changes based on customer  complaints and on-site observations, which was less efficient, required  more resources, and was less accurate.", "Improvements in reporting and record-keeping: Officials from 21 of the 31  urban transit providers told us that ITS technologies including automatic  passenger counters, automatic vehicle location, computer-aided dispatch,  and maintenance management systems have improved their ability to  document and report new or more accurate data. For example, officials  from 11 of these providers said that they are now able to collect additional  and more accurate statistics, such as on their on-time performance,  number of bus passengers by stop, and vehicle health and parts  inventory. In addition, officials from 7 of the large and medium urban  transit providers we interviewed told us that these technologies have  made it easier to collect and report data on transit service to their  governing boards and to meet federal reporting requirements. For  example, 3 of the large and medium urban transit providers told us that  they are able to use ITS technologies to automatically collect information  such as number of passengers rather than sending staff out to collect this  information.", "Increased customer satisfaction: Officials from 17 of the 31 large and  medium urban transit providers told us that ITS technologies, especially  traveler information systems, have improved customer satisfaction. For  example, officials from 10 of these transit providers attributed this  increase in customer satisfaction to their expanded use of traveler  information systems, which have enabled them to provide their customers  with improved ability to access travel information, through such venues as  websites, mobile phone applications, and electronic signs at transit stops.  Additionally, 3 of the large and medium urban transit providers told us that  customer satisfaction has improved with the deployment of electronic fare  payment options. For example, officials from 1 provider told us that they  believe that some of their customers want to be able to make all of their  transactions using smartphones.", "According to our survey results, small urban and rural transit providers  rated the same top five benefits from using ITS as the 31 large and  medium urban transit providers we interviewed (see table 4). In order to  reduce the respondent burden and due to potential difficulties isolating  the impacts of individual ITS technologies, our survey asked small urban  and rural transit providers to report on the great or slight benefits of their  collective ITS technologies. We are therefore unable to attribute the  benefits they reported to individual technologies.", "We also found from our interviews that the 31 large and medium urban  transit providers achieved other types of benefits to a lesser extent, such  as cost savings, increased operator satisfaction, increased ridership,  greater staffing efficiencies, and reduced travel and wait times. Officials  from the selected large and medium urban transit providers also  described other types of benefits they have experienced from ITS  technologies, such as enhanced communication capabilities between  dispatchers and drivers, improved marketing, and the ability to keep  drivers more accountable. For example, officials from one large urban  transit provider told us they were able to use data from their electronic  fare payment system to measure the impact that a recent marketing  promotion had on ridership, and officials from another large urban transit  provider told us they have used their adoption of some ITS technologies  in their marketing campaigns to improve their image and attract new  customers. In addition, transit providers can use their technologies  together, and officials said this combined use can increase the magnitude  of the benefit they experience. For example, three of the large urban  transit providers told us they use data from automatic passenger  counters, which indicate many passengers get on and off at particular  transit stops, in tandem with electronic fare payment data, which can  provide the exact travel patterns of passengers because it can track the  locations passengers get on and off vehicles and show how riders are  transferring between service modes. Such combinations of technologies  can lead to precise information on ridership behavior that can contribute  to benefits such as more efficient routing and scheduling.

Officials from 11 of the large and medium urban transit providers we  interviewed told us that it can be difficult to quantify the benefits of using  ITS technologies for a number of reasons, such as that it may be difficult  to identify a unit of measurement for enhanced safety or greater staff  efficiency, for example. Several of these officials also told us that it was  difficult for them to attribute benefits exclusively to ITS deployment or  identify the specific ITS technology that created the benefit. For example,  officials from three of the large and medium urban transit providers told us  that ITS technologies are integrated\u2014often installed at the same time\u2014 and may result in similar benefits, making it challenging for them to  specify which ITS technology made the positive impact. In addition,  factors other than ITS deployment may contribute to an observed benefit.  For example, officials from two large urban transit providers told us they  have experienced reduced travel times, but it would be difficult to  determine whether this was caused by using transit signal priority due to  factors such as the ability of passengers to pay for their fares prior to  entering the vehicle, city traffic, and the number of boarding passengers.  Also, officials from four of the large and medium urban transit providers  we interviewed told us that their ridership levels have increased, but this  could be a result of different ITS technologies, such as traveler  information systems or electronic fare payment, or other factors, such as  improved service. Furthermore, we estimate that approximately 71  percent of the small urban and rural transit providers were not able to  quantitatively measure any benefits received from ITS. Officials from five  large and medium urban transit providers told us that they had not  measured benefits from ITS deployment for a variety of reasons, such as  the deployment had occurred too recently to be able to measure any  benefits.", "Despite these challenges, we found several examples in our interviews,  survey, and review of recently published ITS studies where transit  providers and researchers quantified some of the benefits of ITS  deployment. Officials from several of the large and medium urban transit  providers that we interviewed reported that they had quantified several  benefits using a variety of methods, such as:  Increased customer satisfaction, through passenger surveys and  reviews of customer service call rates;  Improvements in on-time performance and schedule adherence,  through reviewing performance data; and", "Cost savings, by estimating the value of conducting preventative  maintenance or reduction of staff that was a result of deployed ITS  technologies.", "Officials from two of the large urban transit providers told us that they  collaborated with university researchers to measure the benefits obtained  from specific ITS deployments and found that traveler information  systems had a positive impact on customer satisfaction and transit signal  priority resulted in reduced travel times. According to officials from these  providers, the university researchers were able to isolate these  technologies from some of the factors mentioned above that may also  influence the experienced benefit. Among the small urban and rural  transit providers that reported taking steps to measure ITS benefits, 15  providers told us they analyzed either ridership or on-time performance  data to document the impact of ITS deployment. We also found recent  ITS studies that measured the benefits experienced by transit providers  that had deployed ITS technologies such as traveler information systems  and transit signal priority. For example, a 2011 study that analyzed the  impact of implementing transit signal priority on 27 intersections along a  corridor in Minneapolis found that transit signal priority reduced bus travel  times by 3 to 6 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Transit Providers Face an Assortment of Challenges in Deploying and Using ITS", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Funding Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Transit providers face a variety of challenges in securing funding for an  ITS deployment. For example, officials from 12 of the 31 large and  medium urban transit providers we interviewed told us that ITS projects  may compete for funding with an agency\u2019s state-of-good-repair needs.  In 2013, FTA estimated that more than 40 percent of buses and 25  percent of rail transit assets were in marginal or poor condition. We have  previously reported that transportation officials must identify priorities and  make tradeoffs between funding projects that preserve or add new  infrastructure and those that improve operations, like ITS. Officials from  one large urban provider told us that technology has historically been a  second-tier funding project next to capital funds for bridges, stations, and  upkeep of infrastructure, and a medium urban provider stated that  because transit providers have so many needs, it can be difficult to say  that acquiring new technology is a bigger need than new buses, for  example. Another large urban provider told us that every project within an  agency has to obtain funds based on its merits, and while providing real- time information at every transit center in a city may be useful, for  example, this project may rank lower among the agency\u2019s priorities. A  2014 JPO report identified securing funding as a challenge when ITS is  competing for attention with \u201cribbon-cutting\u201d projects that have higher  visibility. According to officials from one large urban provider, it can be  difficult for ITS to compete with other projects internally, in part because it  can be hard to measure the return on investment from ITS. Officials from  another large urban provider told us they have seen an increase in  competition for funding between bus and rail needs, due to rail  maintenance and costs associated with positive train control  requirements. Officials from seven large and medium urban transit  providers told us that competition for external funding with other  transportation agencies can also be a challenge. For example, officials  from a large urban provider told us that highway projects tend to receive  more funding than public transit from federal programs such as the  Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program (CMAQ).", "Transit providers may also face obstacles in funding the operations and  maintenance costs associated with ITS systems, as we reported in  2012. Officials from 16 large and medium urban providers we  interviewed indicated that preparing for the future operations and  maintenance costs related to ITS deployment is a key challenge. For  example, officials from one large urban transit provider said that the  maintenance and support contracts for ITS technologies are expensive,  and that those expenses are more difficult to predict than the capital costs  associated with implementing ITS. The officials said they also anticipate  higher operational costs in the future based on the need for unlimited  cellular data plans to collect real-time data from their vehicles.", "Finally, limited opportunities to fund ITS are a challenge, according to  officials from 20 of the 31 medium and large urban transit providers we  interviewed. As we reported in 2012, funding is an ongoing challenge in  the transit community, as transportation agencies face difficult decisions  regarding the allocation of their transportation funding. Many have faced  severe revenue declines in recent years, restricting the availability of  funds for transportation improvements. For example, officials from one  medium urban provider said that the economic recession resulted in  fewer local funds available for transit. Officials from a large urban provider  told us that transit providers must plan and execute new software  deployments effectively because there may not be funding available to  correct a mistake for 5 to 10 years if the agency makes a poor decision in  selecting a vendor or the software selected does not meet a business  need.", "In our survey of small urban and rural transit providers, we asked  respondents to rate their experiences with a number of different  challenges, including several similar funding-related challenges they have  encountered with ITS (see table 5).", "Additionally, we estimate that 22 percent of small urban and rural  providers experienced unexpected costs in deploying, operating, or  maintaining ITS technology. Costs cited include increases in annual  licensing and maintenance fees, the need for additional internet speed  and storage, software upgrades, cellular service, and training costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leadership and Workforce Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The familiarity and comfort of a transit provider\u2019s leadership and  workforce with ITS technologies and their benefits\u2014from a board of  directors to bus operators\u2014may have a significant impact on its ability to  successfully deploy these technologies. According to a 2015 ITS America  report on ITS deployment challenges, a transit provider\u2019s board of  directors may not be familiar with ITS technologies and the potential  benefits they bring to operations and ridership. Similarly, we reported in  2012 that leaders do not always place a priority on ITS, especially in the  context of limited funding, and other infrastructure projects can take  precedence. Officials from nine of the large and medium urban transit  providers we interviewed reported that obtaining support for deploying  technologies from leadership and decision-makers in the organization can  be a challenge. Officials from a large urban provider, for example, told us  that because ITS projects may not be as exciting as projects such as  implementing a new rail line or replacing rail cars, staff may have to  spend time explaining the value of an ITS project to board members.  Officials from another urban provider told us that their general manager  has been able to gain the support of their board members by taking them  to ITS conferences so they can see firsthand what other transit providers  are doing.", "The introduction of transit ITS also has the potential to significantly alter  the work and responsibilities of a transit provider\u2019s workforce, including  dispatchers and operators. Officials from 21 of the 31 large and medium  urban transit providers indicated that the workforce may be reluctant to  embrace new technology that changes their job responsibilities. For  example, officials from a medium urban provider explained that bus  operators were initially resistant to the installation of surveillance systems,  but their apprehension subsided after they learned that the video footage  could prove that they were not at fault for particular incidents that  occurred on the bus. Officials from a large urban provider also told us that  transit staff tends to include \u201clifers\u201d who were hired with one expertise and  it can be difficult to train them to work with new technology, or the funding  for that training may not be available.", "ITS is a rapidly developing field that requires a specialized workforce  familiar with emerging technologies. Officials from 14 of the 31 providers  we interviewed said that a lack of technical expertise in the workforce is a  deployment challenge. For example, officials from one large urban  provider said that it can be difficult to find applicants who have worked  with certain proprietary ITS products, and as a result, they train new staff  in-house with vendor support. The agency risks losing its investment if  staff leave the organization or department. Additionally, officials from one  medium urban provider told us that it can be difficult to attract and  maintain staff with technical expertise because their union rules are more  protective of senior staff, and it is largely younger, more recent hires who  can adapt to new technologies.", "In our survey, we asked small urban and rural transit providers about the  extent to which they encountered similar leadership and workforce  challenges with ITS (see table 6).", "The success of an ITS deployment may depend on effective coordination  between several transportation stakeholders in a region, and we have  previously found that ITS coordination across agencies is a challenge.  Complex systems such as electronic fare payment and transit signal  priority may involve multiple entities, including neighboring transit  providers and cities, among others. Officials from seven large and  medium urban transit providers considered coordinating ITS deployment  across agencies to be a challenge. Officials from two large urban  providers told us that obtaining buy-in from regional partners on their  respective regional fare collection systems was difficult because of  resource limitations and apprehension from smaller regional providers  about a larger agency moving forward with decisions about the system  without their input. Officials from a large and medium provider told us they  have had difficulty implementing transit signal priority in their cities  because state or local transportation authorities have opposed the system  or have not upgraded the fiber optic network so that traffic signals are  connected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Technology Procurement and Vendor Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Transit providers using federal funds typically purchase ITS technologies  from technology vendors through the federal procurement process.

Officials from two large urban  transit providers told us that FTA\u2019s \u201cBuy America\u201d requirements\u2014which  require manufactured products used in a project receiving FTA funds to  be produced in the U.S.\u2014are also a factor in prolonging the procurement  process, as agencies may have difficulty meeting the requirements.", "Officials from 16 of the 31 large and medium urban providers told us they  have experienced challenges in working with ITS vendors. Issues cited by  providers we spoke with include (1) difficulty changing vendors after ITS  has been deployed, (2) turnover among vendor staff during ITS projects,  and (3) difficulty getting vendors to work with one another to integrate ITS  amid concerns about making changes to proprietary systems. Officials  from a large urban provider told us that even though contracts may make  the vendors responsible for integrating ITS technologies, the costs are  passed on to the transit provider. According to DOT, including ITS  standards such as Transit Communications Interface Profiles (TCIP) in  procurements can help to integrate different technologies by establishing  a common framework for the exchange of information between systems,  and allows the transit provider to go beyond a single vendor when  considering an upgrade or adding to an existing system. However, an ITS  consultant we spoke with said that developing standards to enable  different vendors\u2019 products to work together is one of the biggest  challenges in the industry as it requires vendors to share information, and  implementing the interfaces between technologies may add to the cost of  a project.", "Our survey asked small urban and rural transit providers about the  challenges they encountered related to working with ITS vendors.  Although most small urban and rural providers did not rate limited vendor  support as a particular challenge, 33 percent indicated that vendors offer  ITS technology solutions that are not designed for the smaller scale of  small urban and rural transit systems.

We have previously reported  that rural areas can have conditions that increase the cost of deploying  broadband Internet infrastructure and services, such as remote areas with  challenging terrain like mountains, which increase construction costs, or  conditions that make it difficult to recoup deployment costs, such as  relatively low population densities and incomes. Similarly, in their  comments on our survey, three rural transit providers reported that  geographic conditions in rural areas, such as mountains and large service  areas, can limit connectivity. For example, one rural provider reported that  \u201cmapping technology\u201d (e.g., GIS) may not recognize all of the rural roads  in an area, which limits its usefulness for a demand-response service.

Officials from several of these transit providers told us  they are part of peer networking groups where information about ITS is  shared, such as a consortium of transit chief information officers and an  organization of bus transit providers that compare performance and  identify best practices. The large and medium urban transit providers also  reported relying on industry groups and vendors for ITS information. For  example, officials from 18 of the 31 selected large and medium transit  providers said they rely on groups such as APTA, and officials from 7 of  the 31 large and medium urban transit providers said that they rely on  vendors and attending annual vendor user conferences. Based on our  survey results, we estimate that small urban and rural transit providers  receive technical assistance\u2014such as in the planning, deployment,  operation, and maintenance of ITS technologies\u2014from state DOTs (52  percent) and ITS vendors (48 percent) more frequently than from FTA (33  percent).", "JPO and FTA officials told us that transit providers may not be using  federal ITS resources because these providers may not have the ability to  send staff to training opportunities and the topics may not be of interest to  them. For example, FTA officials told us they have not received a lot of  demand for NTI courses to include ITS-focused training because transit  providers have high turnover of staff and staff may not have ITS  expertise. Although JPO officials told us they coordinate with various  stakeholders to ensure their resources are responsive to transit  community needs, officials from JPO, FTA, and RTAP told us that transit  providers may not be using JPO resources because these resources are  more focused on urban areas and highway transportation, including  advanced connected vehicle technologies, which are not of current  interest to the transit community. Officials from five of the large and  medium urban transit providers and four public transit stakeholders we  interviewed, including officials from two industry associations and one ITS  consultant, told us that the information provided was either outdated,  focused on highways rather than public transit, or otherwise did not match  their needs. JPO officials told us that they expect participation rates to  increase among the transportation community with their publication of  new ITS Standards Training Modules in late 2015, which they say are  applicable to transit. JPO officials also told us that they solicit and review  feedback on their PCB Program offerings. For example, officials said they  obtain feedback from users of their Knowledge Resources Databases  through an online feedback link and formally twice a year through a  webinar. They said that the transit providers that have provided feedback  have reported that the information on lessons learned is valuable, but  would like more reports on costs of technologies. These officials said that  overall, given the complexity and number of different types of users of the  databases, it is very difficult to meet everyone\u2019s needs. Officials noted  that they also collect live participation and on-demand use numbers of the  PCB Program, but only began collecting more detailed user data for these  programs in 2014. With more detailed data on each PCB Program  offering, they said they hope to focus more on the types of transportation  stakeholders using their resources in 2016 to help them better understand  the reach and effectiveness to various stakeholders, and incorporate this  information into the PCB Program\u2019s strategic plan and assign PCB  Program resources as needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Better Outreach and Information Collection Could Improve DOT\u2019s Promotion of ITS", "paragraphs": ["Although DOT, through JPO and FTA, offers a variety of different ITS  resources, as discussed above, most of the transit providers in our review  were unaware of the resources offered through the JPO and reported  relying largely on resources other than those offered through DOT. In  addition, officials from DOT and industry groups, as well as an ITS  consultant and several transit agencies, generally said DOT\u2019s ITS support  programs and research may not reflect the needs of the transit  community, particularly in rural areas, because, for example, these  programs focus on urban areas, highway ITS, and connected vehicle  technologies. We and the National Academies\u2019 Transportation Research  Board (TRB) have previously identified a number of leading practices for  successfully encouraging the adoption of new technologies that may  improve the extent to which transit providers use DOT resources. These  leading practices include (1) choosing appropriate methods to promote  the use of technology by the target audience and (2) monitoring  technology adoption. Improving the availability and awareness of DOT  resources is a key component to promoting the use of technology by the  target audience and can enhance efforts to assist others in making  decisions regarding the use of technologies. Also, monitoring  technology adoption can provide lessons about efforts to encourage  technology implementation. For example, according to a TRB report on  promoting technology use, such monitoring of information is needed for  managing technology promotion activities and for successfully assessing  progress toward the goals of those activities.", "Making users aware of ITS resources  JPO officials told us that they advertise PCB Program offerings through e- mail lists that include the major transit industry associations and FTA  staff, who they say consistently share news and information with transit,  state, regional, and local stakeholders, and the private sector. They also  told us that many individual transit providers subscribe to their e-mails.  There are other ways that transit providers hear about their offerings,  according to JPO officials, including advertisements through ITS America- sponsored webinars and newsletters. When there are products for a  specific audience, such as transit-specific offerings, JPO officials said  they will make additional efforts to inform that audience of the products\u2019  availability. DOT officials also told us that FTA publishes information on  PCB Program opportunities and JPO has a dedicated multimodal  knowledge and technology task that includes outreach and marketing.  Despite these efforts, officials from RTAP, two ITS consultants, and  officials from 12 of the 31 large and medium urban transit providers we  interviewed told us they were unaware of the resources offered through  the JPO. We estimate that the majority of small urban and rural transit  providers are also unaware of JPO\u2019s PCB Program offerings. Specifically,  based on our survey, we estimate that about 75 percent of small urban  and rural transit providers are unaware of JPO\u2019s PCB Program training,  85 percent are unaware of PCB Program technical assistance, and 85  percent are unaware of PCB Program knowledge resources information.  The ITS consultants we spoke with told us that outside of federal  resources the level of support transit providers may receive for ITS  deployment varies and transit providers generally rely on vendors for  technical support. Improving the availability and awareness of DOT  resources could help transit providers take advantage of these resources.", "Without greater efforts from DOT to make the transit community more  aware of federal resources, transit providers may be missing information  that could help them make the most informed ITS deployment decisions.", "As described earlier, the JPO monitors the adoption of ITS technologies  through the ITS deployment survey and uses this information, according  to JPO officials, to understand the level of deployment and to help them  make decisions on how to encourage the future deployment of ITS  technologies through its information resources. However, the deployment  survey has focused on technology adoption by transportation providers,  including but not limited to transit, that are located in major metropolitan  areas and does not collect deployment data from transit providers that  primarily serve small urban and rural areas. JPO officials told us they  have no plans to survey rural transit providers because these providers  are generally very small and serve specialized functions often associated  with federal programs, such as the transportation of elderly to medical  appointments, which would have required them to contact each provider  individually to get information and that this was outside of the project\u2019s  scope. Additionally, officials told us the purpose of the survey is to  document trends and to understand how ITS deployment, which generally  occurs in larger cities, has progressed, although some of the information  JPO collects may include deployment in small cities because providers in  larger cities may also provide service in those areas. However, we  estimate from our survey results that a majority of small urban and rural  transit providers are using several ITS technologies\u2014 such as security  systems, computer-aided dispatch, and automatic vehicle location\u2014but  have experienced challenges in using funding opportunities for ITS as  well as the operational costs associated with these technologies.  Additionally, we estimate from our survey that small urban and rural  providers have plans to continue deploying ITS in the next 5 years. While  there may be some difficulties in including small urban and rural transit  providers in DOT\u2019s deployment survey, there may be other ways to  monitor their ITS deployment, including engaging with state DOTs to  collect information on rural transit ITS. FTA considers state DOTs a useful  resource in understanding rural transit issues as they distribute section  5311 rural grant funding to the state\u2019s subrecipient rural transit providers.  Including the deployment of ITS by small urban and rural transit providers  in its ITS monitoring efforts may provide the JPO with information to  customize ITS resources to address the challenges faced by this transit  community. Without greater efforts from DOT to tailor its resources to  include the needs of small urban and rural transit, these transit providers  may be missing information that could inform their ITS deployment  decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As public transit ridership grows, ITS technologies provide opportunities  for transit providers to improve planning, increase the efficiency of their  operations, and make their services more attractive to riders. In the  nation\u2019s major metropolitan areas, transit providers are using ITS in new  and innovative ways to improve fare collection and keep the public  informed about the status of transit services, even in real time through  smartphone applications. Although less prevalent, ITS technologies are  helping transit providers in small communities and rural areas increase  their scheduling capabilities, enhance the safety of their services, and  improve their reporting and billing processes. However, in deploying ITS,  the transit community faces challenges related to identifying ITS funding  opportunities, paying for the operations and maintenance costs of  technology, integrating systems, and managing the disruption that the  introduction of new technologies can bring to the transit workforce.", "Although DOT provides a variety of information resources to promote and  support the use of transit ITS technology including technical assistance  and classroom and online training, few of the transit providers in our  review were aware or making use of these resources, relying instead on  information and support from peer transit providers, industry groups, ITS  vendors, and state DOTs. DOT could improve the awareness and  applicability of these resources through greater use of leading practices  for successfully encouraging the adoption of new technologies.  Specifically, DOT could better ensure that federal ITS resources reach  their intended audience and help make informed ITS deployment  decisions by developing a strategy to increase the transit community\u2019s  awareness of these resources. Additionally, including the deployment of  ITS by small urban and rural transit providers in ITS monitoring efforts  could help DOT customize ITS resources to address the challenges these  providers face.

On  the basis of interviews with DOT officials and analysis of the 2013 ITS  deployment data, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. We conducted site visits to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;  Portland and Eugene, Oregon; and Tampa and Orlando, Florida, to  observe transit ITS deployments. We selected these site visits based on  criteria including geographic dispersion and recommendations by JPO  and FTA officials and industry stakeholders. During these site visits, we  obtained documentation and interviewed officials from stakeholders in  public transit decision-making including municipalities, academic  researchers, state departments of transportation, and metropolitan  planning organizations. We are not able to generalize our findings in  these site visits to the whole country but used the other sources  mentioned above to gain a more general perspective.", "We also conducted semi-structured interviews on the use of ITS with a  judgmental sample of 31 transit providers serving large urban areas.
