However, a few of the leading practices were only partially incorporated or not incorporated at all. For example, the implementation plan did not always fully address the leading practice that planning documents include strategies to achieve goals and plans to assess progress. DOD officials explained that some of the details of their approach to the elements had not been finalized when they were completing the implementation plan. These officials added that their approach to the implementation plan was to create a strategic overview, and that some of the details are contained in contract documents and monitored through their oversight responsibilities.", "Furthermore, GAO's assessment of the plan's elements found that the approach outlined in the implementation plan for ensuring access standards for health care appointments (Element B) is different from the approach DOD intends to use.

However, DOD officials told GAO that the contractors are responsible for developing their own access standards, which DOD must approve. These officials added that DOD did not include information about the contractors proposing their own access standards because DOD was still developing its approach to this element when the plan was submitted.

The National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (NDAA 2017) required DOD to  terminate two of these options, TRICARE Standard and Extra, and  establish a new self-managed preferred provider option called TRICARE  Select no later than January 1, 2018. According to DOD, this change will  modernize the TRICARE benefit\u2014specifically by introducing a  progressive health plan model with enrollment requirements for  beneficiaries.

DOD submitted this plan to Congress on August 7, 2017. The  NDAA 2017 included a provision for us to review the adequacy of the plan  in addressing the mandated elements. In this report, we examine the  extent to which DOD\u2019s implementation plan for TRICARE Select  addressed these elements.", "To conduct this assessment, we reviewed DOD\u2019s implementation plan,  TRICARE program policies and procedures, and contract documents that  require specific access-related plans and data reports from the  contractors. We compared this information with the plan elements  mandated by the NDAA 2017, leading practices for strategic management  planning identified by our prior work, and standards for internal controls in  the federal government. (See app. I.) We also interviewed DOD officials, including officials from the Defense Health Agency (DHA), which  oversees the TRICARE program, and the TRICARE Regional Offices,  which oversee health care delivery in each TRICARE region, to  understand the development and function of the plan, as well as the  planned approach to addressing each element. We also interviewed  representatives of the managed care support contractors, which manage  health care delivery through civilian provider networks in each region,  among other tasks, to understand any challenges related to  implementation of the mandated elements.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2017 to April 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Specifically, the implementation plan described the upcoming changes to  the TRICARE benefit and included individual sections outlining DOD\u2019s  approach for implementing each of the required elements. For example,  for element A\u2014ensure that at least 85 percent of the beneficiary  population under TRICARE Select is covered by the network by January  1, 2018\u2014DOD described, among other things, how the regional  contractors will identify geographic areas with concentrations of TRICARE  Select beneficiaries and how they will establish a sufficient provider  network to serve that population.", "We also found that the implementation plan reflected most of the leading  practices for sound strategic management planning as identified by our  prior work. (See table 2.) These leading practices suggest that strategic  planning documents include the following: (1) a mission statement, (2)  goals, (3) strategies to achieve goals, (4) plans to assess progress, and  (5) identification of challenges and risks. For example, DOD\u2019s  implementation plan clearly articulated a mission statement, which is \u201cto  ensure beneficiaries receive the right level of care, at the right time,  delivered by the right provider.\u201d Additionally, for six of the mandated  elements, DOD\u2019s implementation plan outlined the goal, strategies to  achieve the goal, and how DOD will assess progress. (See elements A,  B, C, D, E, and F in table 2.) This information is supplemented by contract  documents that require specific plans and data reports from the managed  care support contractors. For example, for element A\u2014ensure that at  least 85 percent of the beneficiary population is covered by the network\u2014 each managed care support contractor is required to submit monthly  performance reports that show that a sufficient number of providers in  primary and specialty care are available to meet access requirements.  While DOD\u2019s implementation plan addressed many of our leading  practices, there were instances where some of the leading practices were  only partially addressed or not addressed at all. For example, none of the  mandated elements incorporated the leading practice related to  identifying the challenges and risks that could affect the success of the  element.", "Element G, Evaluation of Quality Metrics, Remains under  Development  We also found that the implementation plan partially addressed or did not  address the leading practices related to strategies or plans to assess  progress for element G\u2014establish mechanisms to evaluate the quality  metrics of the network providers. The plan stated that DOD is reviewing  the required set of core quality performance metrics and will implement a  subset of these performance measures that can be used in future  contracts. However, the plan did not include several strategic details such  as (1) the process that DOD will use to determine the metrics, (2) the  criteria and resources that are needed to select the subset of these  performance measures, and (3) how DOD will assess progress and  evaluate future metrics. DOD officials told us that a workgroup of  departmental officials\u2014including those from DHA and the TRICARE  Regional Offices and representatives of the military service branches\u2014 with expertise in health care quality are evaluating the metrics for inclusion in the subset of measures based  on criteria such as availability of data, the size of the population  affected, and resources needed; developing a work plan and time frames to analyze the metrics that  are (1) already being reported, (2) not being reported but data are  available, and (3) not being reported and require data solutions in  order to track information; and making preliminary recommendations on which measures to adopt  and which to consider for future adoption.", "DOD officials explained that some of the details of their approach to the  mandated elements had not been finalized when they were completing  the implementation plan, including some of the details for element G,  which continues to be a work in progress. They added that they were  under tight time constraints with competing priorities. They explained that  they had to plan for the implementation of TRICARE Select while  concurrently transitioning to new managed care support contracts, which  had to be modified to incorporate this new health plan option. Therefore,  while DOD officials were developing the TRICARE Select implementation  plan, they had to determine the specific program requirements for this  option and modify the contracts to account for these changes.", "Leading Practice on Challenges and Risks May Be Captured through  Contract Oversight Mechanisms  We also found that DOD\u2019s implementation plan did not address the  leading practice related to recognizing the challenges or risks to success  for any of the seven elements. This practice ensures that an organization  considers any external factors that could significantly affect the  achievement of its goal. For example, for element A\u2014ensure that at least  85 percent of the beneficiary population is covered by the network\u2014the  implementation plan did not address what challenges and risks the  contractors might experience in establishing this network. For example,  one of the two managed care support contractors stated that it did not  have data on the beneficiaries who had sought coverage under TRICARE  Standard and Extra as these beneficiaries did not have to enroll in these  health plan options. Thus, the contractor explained that it was difficult to  establish a baseline for calculating the 85 percent network coverage  required for TRICARE Select. The other managed care support contractor  told us that specific challenges included negotiating provider discounts in  certain areas, identifying which providers participated in the past, and  balancing the composition of the network between primary and specialty  care. However, DOD officials told us that they considered and planned for  the challenges and risks associated with certain elements\u2014including  establishing a monitoring and remediation process to help ensure  contractors meet the 85 percent network coverage requirement\u2014even  though this was not described in the plan.", "DOD officials explained that their approach to the implementation plan  was to create a strategic overview rather than a detailed work plan. These  officials also told us that details and time frames related to the mandated  elements are captured in contract documents, such as those that  establish the managed care support contractors\u2019 reporting and planning  requirements. Although these contract documents do not specifically  address challenges and risks for each element, officials stated that they  have oversight mechanisms in place that allow them to address any  challenges faced by these contractors, thereby mitigating any potential  risks. For example, DHA officials told us that the managed care support  contractors provide status updates on their network expansion progress  at weekly transition meetings with DHA and at biweekly meetings with the  TRICARE Regional Offices. DHA officials told us that the TRICARE  contracts have specific expansion goals and deadlines, such as requiring  that 50 percent of network providers are in the system 120 days prior to  the start of health care delivery. Given that both TRICARE Select and the  new TRICARE contracts were implemented on January 1, 2018, it is too  early to determine whether this approach will be sufficient to deal with any  upcoming challenges and risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation Plan Does Not Reflect Current Approach for Establishing Access Standards", "paragraphs": ["Our review of element B\u2014ensure access standards for appointments for  health care that meet or exceed those of high-performing health care  systems in the United States, as determined by the Secretary\u2014noted that  the approach described in the implementation plan differs from the  approach that DOD intends to use. The implementation plan states that  the access standards for TRICARE Select will mirror those of TRICARE  Prime, DOD\u2019s managed care option, and that DOD will continue to  compare these standards with those of high-performing U.S. health care  systems. However, DOD officials told us in interviews that the access  standards for TRICARE Select will be developed by each managed care  support contractor and approved by DOD. This approach is outlined in  contract documents, which state that the contractors are required to  develop access-to-care plans that detail how they will ensure access  standards that meet or exceed those of high-performing health care  systems in the United States.", "DOD officials told us that they did not intend to suggest in the plan that  the TRICARE Prime access standards would be applied to TRICARE  Select. Instead, these officials explained that they meant that the access  standards for TRICARE Select would be evaluated with the same tools as  the access standards for TRICARE Prime. DOD officials further stated  that they did not include information about the managed care support  contractors proposing their own access standards because they were still  developing the approach to this element when the implementation plan  was submitted. DOD officials told us they decided on this approach  because there is no national model for preferred provider organization  access standards, and therefore they did not want to be prescriptive  about the access standards for this option. However, as a result of this  approach, there is the potential that the managed care support  contractors for the East and West regions could be using two different  sets of access standards for TRICARE Select.", "Standards for internal control in the federal government state that  management should externally communicate the necessary information to  achieve the entity\u2019s objectives.
