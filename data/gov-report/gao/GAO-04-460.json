Audits revealed that some data sets could not be traced back to their sources, model development and validation procedures were not followed, and some processes for software development and validation were inadequate or not followed. DOE believes these problems have not affected the technical basis of the project; however, they could adversely affect the licensing process. Recent assessments identified continuing management weaknesses in the areas of roles and responsibilities, quality assurance policies and procedures, and a work environment that did not foster employee confidence in raising concerns without fear of reprisal. NRC has acknowledged DOE's effectiveness in identifying quality problems, but recently concluded that quality problems could delay the licensing process. DOE cannot assess the effectiveness of its 2002 plan because the performance goals to assess management weaknesses lack objective measurements and time frames for determining success. The goals do not specify the amount of improvement expected, how quickly the improvement should be achieved, or how long the improvement should be sustained before the problems can be considered corrected. DOE recently developed a measurement tool that incorporates and revises some of the goals from the action plan, but most of the revised goals continue to lack the necessary time frames needed to determine whether the actions have corrected the recurring problems. A recently completed DOE review of the 2002 plan found that the corrective actions have been fully implemented. However, the review also noted the effectiveness of the actions could not be evaluated because many of the plan's goals lacked the level of objectivity and testing needed to measure effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["High-level nuclear waste, created as a by-product of the nuclear power  process in reactors, can remain highly radioactive for hundreds of  thousands of years, endangering the public if not properly disposed.   Storing this waste safely is therefore of vital interest to the nation.   Currently, more than 50,000 metric tons of this waste is being stored at 72  sites across the country.  In 2002, Congress approved the President\u2019s  recommendation of Yucca Mountain, Nevada, 90 miles from Las Vegas, as a  suitable site for the Department of Energy (DOE) to construct and operate  a geologic repository to safely and permanently dispose of this waste.  To  construct and operate the repository, DOE must obtain a license from the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).  As part of the license application,  DOE must, among other things, demonstrate an effective quality assurance  program that ensures the safe construction and operation of a repository,  protecting public health and safety.  DOE plans to submit a license  application by December 2004 and is following a demanding schedule to  meet this date.  NRC is reviewing an extensive amount of data as part of a  prelicensing agreement with DOE.", "Before granting a license, NRC requires nuclear facilities to develop a  quality assurance program that ensures that the technical information  submitted in support of a license application\u2014such as scientific data,  models, and details on design and construction\u2014is well documented and  defensible.  The quality assurance program involves a two-part process that  (1) requires program staff to follow procedures to help ensure the  reliability of information and (2) uses quality assurance auditors to verify  that the procedures have been followed.  Both program staff and quality  assurance auditors are required to identify when procedures are not being  followed or when they encounter problems with the procedures.  DOE and  contractor quality assurance auditors periodically assess compliance with procedures.  In cases where a significant problem is found (DOE\u2019s criteria  refer to significant problems as significant conditions adverse to quality),  quality assurance personnel and program managers follow specific steps to  analyze and correct the problem: 1. Quality assurance auditors or program personnel complete a corrective  action report that describes the problem and the need for corrective  action. 2. Program managers conduct a root-cause analysis of the problem.   3. Program managers identify corrective actions that address the root  cause(s) to prevent the problem from recurring\u2014these actions are  included in a corrective action plan.   4. Program managers implement these corrective actions and quality  assurance personnel verify that they have been implemented. 5. Quality assurance personnel close the corrective action report, and  program managers later conduct an effectiveness review.   a.", "If actions are determined ineffective, the process begins again with  the issuance of a new corrective action report. b.", "In cases involving more significant problems, an effectiveness  review may be conducted prior to closing the corrective action  report.", "In 1998, DOE\u2019s quality assurance auditors identified significant problems  with data sources, validation of scientific models, and software  development and issued three corrective action reports.  For data sources,  DOE reported that it could not ensure that all data needed to support the  scientific models could be tracked back to original sources or that the data  had been properly collected.  For validation of models, DOE reported that  it had no standardized process to develop the scientific models needed to  simulate geological events.  For software, DOE reported that it had no  process for ensuring that the software being developed to support the  models would work.  As required by DOE\u2019s quality assurance procedures,  the department conducted a root-cause analysis and issued a corrective  action plan in 1999 that identified the needed corrective actions.  Following  implementation of the actions, DOE considered the issues resolved and  closed the corrective action reports.  However, problems with models and  software resurfaced during 2001 quality assurance audits.  As a result, new  corrective action reports were completed in May and June 2001, beginning  another iteration of the corrective action process.", "Recognizing the need to correct these recurring problems, DOE (1)  conducted a comprehensive root-cause analysis that included reviews of  numerous past self-assessments and independent program assessments  and (2) identified weaknesses in management systems, quality processes,  and organizational roles and responsibilities.  As a result, DOE issued a  corrective action plan in July 2002 that addressed both the quality problems  with data and models and the management weaknesses.  In addition to the  37 actions in the 2002 plan that addressed models and software, DOE  added 35 corrective actions to address management weaknesses that it  found in five key areas:   corrective action plans, and  a work environment that allows employees to raise quality concerns  without fear of reprisal.", "To correct these weaknesses, DOE completed a management  reorganization and issued new policy statements to clarify roles and  responsibilities, revised the primary quality assurance implementing  document, reviewed and revised program procedures, revised the system  to correct quality problems, and provided new training for employees to  encourage them to raise concerns about quality.  To assess the  effectiveness of its actions in correcting the management weaknesses,  DOE developed 13 goals to determine whether the corrective actions were  successful, such as achieving decreasing trends in problems attributed to  unclear roles and responsibilities, reducing the time required to revise  procedures and complete corrective actions, and reducing the number of  employee concerns related to the work environment.  Because of the  significance of these problems, DOE stated in the 2002 corrective action  plan that an effectiveness review would be completed prior to closing the  corrective action reports and reporting the results to NRC.", "In May 2003, at a congressional field hearing, we provided preliminary  observations on the Yucca Mountain quality assurance program.   Specifically, we noted DOE\u2019s poor track record in correcting recurring  quality assurance problems and provided preliminary observations on  recent actions taken to correct these problems.  You requested that we  continue our evaluation of the quality assurance program at Yucca  Mountain, focusing on DOE\u2019s actions to correct the recurring quality  problems.  As agreed with your offices, this report (1) assesses the status of  DOE\u2019s corrective actions to resolve recurring problems and (2) determines  the adequacy of DOE\u2019s plan to measure the effectiveness of these actions.", "In conducting our work, we met with DOE and contractor officials,  assessed the status of DOE\u2019s corrective actions, reviewed audits and  deficiency reports, and visited the Yucca Mountain project office.  We met  with NRC officials and reviewed NRC-prepared documents, including  observation audits, on-site representative reports, and correspondence  between DOE and NRC.  We attended several DOE-NRC quarterly quality  assurance meetings and met with representatives of the State of Nevada  Agency for Nuclear Projects and with representatives of the Nuclear Waste  Technical Review Board.

DOE is responsible for developing and operating the repository, and  NRC is responsible for licensing the repository.  DOE is currently preparing  an application to submit to NRC by December 2004 for a license to  construct the repository.  To obtain a license, DOE must, among other  things, demonstrate to NRC that the repository will not exceed  Environmental Protection Agency health and safety standards over a  10,000-year period.  An ineffective quality assurance program runs the risk  of introducing unknown errors into the design and construction of the  repository that could lead to adverse health and safety consequences.", "To demonstrate compliance with the health standards over this 10,000-year  period, DOE must rely primarily on a \u201cperformance assessment\u201d computer  model that incorporates over 1,000 data sources, approximately 60  scientific models, and more than 400 computer software codes to simulate  the performance of the repository.  Given the prominence of computer  modeling in the licensing of the repository, one of DOE\u2019s most important  tasks is to demonstrate the adequacy of the data, models, and software  used to perform the simulation.  In addition, as part of the licensing  process, DOE must demonstrate that its quality assurance program can  effectively identify and correct deficiencies in areas important to the safe  operation and long-term performance of the repository, such as the natural  and engineered barriers of the repository and the program\u2019s data, models,  and software.  See appendix I for more information on the role of quality  assurance in the licensing process.", "DOE has a long-standing history of attempting to correct quality assurance  problems.  In 1988, we identified significant problems with the quality  assurance program, noting that NRC had identified many specific concerns  about the Yucca Mountain program, including    DOE\u2019s heavy reliance on contractors and inadequate oversight would  increase the likelihood that DOE might encounter quality-related  problems;  the possibility that Nevada would contest the licensing proceedings,  thereby increasing the probability that DOE would have to defend its  quality assurance program;  additional expense and time-consuming delays to correct program  weaknesses if DOE could not properly defend the quality of its work;  and  DOE staff\u2019s and contractors\u2019 negative attitude toward quality assurance.", "Since the late 1990s, DOE has attempted to correct continuing quality  assurance problems in three areas critical to the repository\u2019s successful  performance: the adequacy of the data sources, the validity of scientific  models, and the reliability of computer software that have been developed  at the site.  These problems surfaced in 1998 when DOE began to run the  initial versions of its performance assessment model.  Specifically, DOE  was unable to ensure that critical project data had been properly collected  and tracked back to original sources.  In addition, the department lacked a  standardized process for developing scientific models used to simulate a  variety of geologic events and an effective process for ensuring that  computer software used to support the scientific models will work  properly.  DOE implemented actions in 1999 to correct these deficiencies  and prevent their recurrence.", "In 2001, similar deficiencies associated with models and software  resurfaced.  DOE attributed the recurrence to ineffective procedures and  corrective actions, improper implementation of quality procedures by line  managers, and personnel who feared reprisal for expressing quality  concerns.  To ensure that it adequately addressed the problems to prevent  future recurrence, DOE developed a more comprehensive corrective action  plan in July 2002, concentrating on actions needed to address the causes of  the recurring problems while improving the organizational culture and  instilling a strong commitment to quality in all project personnel.  The plan  detailed specific actions for both DOE and its contractor, Bechtel/SAIC  Company, LLC (Bechtel), to strengthen the roles, responsibilities,  accountability, and authority of project personnel; develop clearer quality  assurance requirements and processes; improve program procedures;  create an improved programwide corrective action process; and improve  processes for ensuring that employees can raise project concerns without  fear of reprisals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quality Assurance Problems Persist at the Yucca Mountain Project", "paragraphs": ["DOE reports that it has implemented almost all of the actions identified in  its 2002 corrective action plan; however, recent audits and assessments  indicate that recurring quality assurance problems have not been  corrected.

DOE recently closed the corrective action reports for data and software,  but did so without determining whether corrective actions have been  effective.  To examine actions taken to correct some of the management  weaknesses identified in the 2002 corrective action plan, DOE conducted  four management assessments late in 2003.

To determine if corrective actions had been implemented, DOE  relied on the collective judgment of project managers regarding how  effectively they have incorporated corrective actions into their regular  project activities.  A March 2004 DOE review analyzed the implementation  of corrective actions for each of the management weaknesses but was not  able to evaluate the effectiveness of the corrective actions.", "DOE\u2019s March 2004 review noted strong management commitment to  improvement and described recent actions taken to ensure that work  products meet quality objectives for a successful license application.   However, the review identified continuing weaknesses in DOE\u2019s ability to  determine the effectiveness of the actions it has taken.  The review team  attempted to measure how effectively DOE had met each of the plan\u2019s  original 13 goals.  The team was unable to measure whether 10 of the 13  goals had been met, but concluded that the project had met 2 of the goals  and made progress toward another goal, based on an analysis of trends in  quality problems identified.  However, these conclusions were not based on  an evaluation of quantifiable goals with time frames for meeting and  sustaining the desired performance.  The review also concluded that the  performance indicators developed to evaluate the success of the actions  lacked the level of objectivity and testing needed to measure effectiveness  and that some lacked the data needed to assess effectiveness.  The review  recommended that DOE continue its corrective actions and refine  performance indicators so that the effectiveness of corrective actions in  meeting the plan\u2019s goals can be more readily measured.", "In April 2004, DOE notified NRC that it had completed, validated, and  independently assessed the commitments it made in the 2002 corrective  action plan, institutionalized the corrective actions, and established a  baseline to foster and sustain continuous improvement.  DOE officials  stated they have achieved the initial goals of the 2002 plan through these  actions.  These officials indicated they would continue to refine and  improve project tools used to evaluate the effectiveness of corrective  actions.  However, because of the limitations noted in its March 2004  review, DOE has not yet evaluated the effectiveness of corrective actions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Despite working nearly 3 years to address recurring quality assurance  problems, recent audits and assessments have found that problems  continue with data, models, and software, and that management  weaknesses remain.  As NRC has noted, quality assurance problems could  delay the licensing process.  Despite recurring quality problems, DOE has  recently closed the corrective action reports for data and software and  intends to close the corrective action report for models in August 2004  without first evaluating the effectiveness of the corrective actions taken to  address the problems in these areas.  DOE also does not intend to improve  the goals of the 2002 plan associated with management weaknesses so that  they can be adequately measured.  Instead, DOE continues to plan and  implement further actions to correct its quality problems and management  weaknesses.  This approach provides no indication regarding when DOE  may be in a position to show that corrective actions have been successful.   Entering into the licensing phase of the project without resolving the  recurring problems could impede the application process, which at a  minimum could lead to time-consuming and expensive delays while  weaknesses are corrected and could ultimately prevent DOE from  receiving authorization to construct a repository.  Moreover, recurring  problems could create the risk of introducing unknown errors into the  design and construction of the repository that could lead to adverse health  and safety consequences.

Our draft report  acknowledged that DOE has taken a number of actions to address past  problems in the quality assurance program, but to ensure clarity on this  point, we have incorporated additional language to this effect in the report.   However, our primary focus for this review was to evaluate the  effectiveness of DOE\u2019s corrective actions in addressing the recurring  quality problems.  Despite the many actions taken to improve the quality  assurance program, the management weaknesses and quality problems  with data, models, and software have continued, indicating that the  corrective actions have not been fully effective.  Regarding DOE\u2019s views on  our treatment of the 2002 Management Improvement Initiatives, DOE itself  characterized the initiative as a \u201ccomprehensive corrective action plan.\u201d    DOE stated that the implementation of the plan has been successful based  on the evidence that responsible managers have taken agreed-upon action.   This approach can be misleading, however, because it does not incorporate  a determination of whether these actions have been effective.  In fact, DOE  has not evaluated the effectiveness of these actions in solving recurring  problems.   DOE further stated that we did not consider the full range of  performance indicators related to quality assurance that DOE uses to  manage the project.  We agree.  We asked DOE staff to compare their new  performance indicators to the goals in the 2002 plan, and those are the  goals that we presented for comparison in table 1 of our report.  A  discussion of the remainder of the hundreds of other goals was beyond the  scope of our review and would not have added to an understanding of the  overall problems with DOE\u2019s goals.  Finally, we disagree with DOE\u2019s  comment that we mischaracterized the results of recent independent  reviews.  We noted instances in these reports where improvements were  found.  However, we also devoted appropriate attention to evidence in  these reports that address whether DOE\u2019s corrective actions have been  effective.  As our report states, these reports consistently found that these  actions have not yet had their intended effect.", "In NRC\u2019s written comments, reproduced in appendix V, the agency agreed  with our conclusions but suggested that DOE be given the flexibility to  choose alternative approaches to achieve and measure quality assurance  program performance.

In addition, we reviewed numerous documents  that NRC prepared as part of its prelicensing activities at Yucca Mountain,  including observations of quality assurance audits, NRC on-site  representative reports, and correspondence between NRC and DOE on  quality matters.  We also observed an out-briefing of a quality assurance  audit to obtain additional knowledge of how quality problems are identified  and reported.  To document the status of actions taken, we reviewed  evidence used by DOE\u2019s Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management  to prove corrective actions had been implemented and interviewed officials  with DOE, at the Yucca site and in headquarters, and officials with Bechtel,  the primary contractor.  We also reviewed the results of four DOE  assessments completed in the fall of 2003 that included the quality  assurance program, interviewing the authors of the assessment reports to  obtain a clear understanding of the problems identified.

The review plan is  not a regulation, but does contain the licensing criteria contained in federal  regulations.  DOE\u2019s application is to include general, scientific, and  administrative information contained in two major sections:  (1) a general  information section that provides an overview of the engineering design  concept for the repository and describes aspects of the Yucca Mountain  site and its environs that influence repository design and performance, and  (2) a detailed safety analysis section that provides a review of compliance  with regulatory performance objectives that are based on permissible  levels of radiation doses to workers and the public, established on the basis  of acceptable levels of risk.  The general information section covers such  topics as proposed schedules for construction, receipt, and emplacement  of waste; the physical protection plan; the material control and accounting  program; and a description of site characterization work.

We disagree.  Our report states that the recent independent  assessments have shown improvements in the key management areas  identified in the 2002 corrective action plan.  However, the assessments  also showed that problems remain in these areas and thus the  corrective actions have not yet been successful in correcting these  weaknesses.  DOE\u2019s examples of progress illustrate our point regarding  improperly specified goals.  For example, DOE states in its comments  that line management\u2019s self-identification of conditions adverse to  quality has increased approximately 100 percent in the last 15 months  (as opposed to the identification of such conditions by quality  assurance auditors).  However, despite this seemingly dramatic  increase, DOE has yet to meet its goal of line management\u2019s self- identifying 80 percent of all quality problems.  (DOE\u2019s 100 percent  increase brought them up to about 50 percent of all quality problems  being self-identified by line managers.)  Further, the goal continues to  lack a time frame for when the 80 percent goal should be attained and  for how long it should be sustained before the corrective actions can be  judged successful.  As our report points out, without such specificity,  improvements cannot be evaluated in terms of overall success.   2. We disagree.  The 2002 Management Improvement Initiatives clearly  state that it was a \u201ccomprehensive corrective action plan necessary to  address weaknesses in the implementation of  quality  assurance requirements and attain a level of performance expected of  an NRC license applicant.\u201d Contrary to DOE\u2019s assertion, the initiative  does not indicate it was a \u201cspringboard effort to address management  issues and transition improvements into day-to-day line management  activities.\u201d Although the transitioning of improvements to the line is  laudable, the initiative focused on implementing corrective actions and  evaluating the effectiveness of the actions in correcting problems.  This  approach is consistent with DOE\u2019s criteria for correcting significant  conditions adverse to quality, and it is the criteria we relied on to  determine whether the corrective actions specified in the initiatives  were successful.   3. We agree.  We did not include the full range of performance indicators  (goals) that have recently been developed, and continue to change, to  assess the 2002 plan.  Instead, of the hundreds of indicators that are  being developed to manage the project, we relied on those few that  Bechtel officials told us were connected to the goals of the 2002 plan.   As table 1 shows, some improvements have been made in specifying the  quantitative aspects of the goals, but weaknesses continue to exist in  the new goals.  In fact, table 1 shows that DOE no longer has a goal in  its performance tool that specifically tracks the trend in problems  related to roles and responsibilities.  This omission is particularly  important because the area of roles and responsibilities was noted in  the 2002 plan as one of the biggest sources of problems in the quality  assurance process, and, as the recent assessments have found, this is  an area with continuing problems. 4. We disagree.  We acknowledge that these reviews found positive  improvements in a number of management areas.  However, we also  note that continuing problems were found with management  weaknesses despite all corrective actions having been implemented in  2003.   5. While DOE believes that it has achieved the objectives of the 2002 plan,  it lacks evidence that its actions have been effective in addressing the  management weaknesses and correcting the recurring quality problems  with data, models, and software.  Evaluating performance against  measurable goals with time frames for meeting and sustaining the goals  would provide the needed evidence.   6.
