For example, under MAP-21, New Starts projects had capital costs that were $250 million or greater while Small Starts projects had capital costs that were less than $250 million. As required by MAP-21, FTA has issued guidance outlining the new review and evaluation process for New Starts and Small Starts projects\u2014as well as Core Capacity Improvement projects, which is a new category of eligible projects MAP-21 created and which are designed to increase the capacity of an existing system.

Projects eligible to compete for federal funding  under the Capital Investment Grant program include:", "Commuter rail\u2014systems that operate along electric or diesel- propelled railways and provide train service for local, short distance  trips between a central city and adjacent suburbs.", "Heavy rail\u2014systems that operate on electric railways with high- volume traffic capacity and are characterized by separated right-of- way, sophisticated signaling, high platform loading, and high-speed,  rapid-acceleration rail cars operating singly or in multi-car trains on  fixed rails.", "Light rail\u2014systems that operate on electric railways with light-volume  traffic capacity and are characterized by shared or exclusive rights-of- way, or low or high-platform-loading, single or double-car trains, and  overhead electric lines that power rail vehicles.", "Streetcars\u2014systems that are similar to light rail, but distinguishable  because they are usually smaller and designed for shorter routes,  more frequent stops, and lower travel speeds.", "Bus rapid transit\u2014systems in which the majority operates in a  separated right-of-way during peak periods and includes features that  emulate the services provided by rail transit, such as defined stations,  traffic signal priority, short headway bidirectional services for a  substantial part of weekdays and weekend days, pre-board ticketing,  platform-level boarding, and separate branding. Fixed-guideway bus  rapid transit systems may include portions of service that are non- fixed guideway. In addition, bus rapid transit can also include corridor- based bus rapid transit projects, which have similar characteristics as  fixed-guideway systems, but the majority of the project does not  operate in a separated right-of-way dedicated for public transportation  use during peak periods.", "Ferries\u2014systems comprised of vessels that operate over a body of  water and are generally steam or diesel powered.", "These projects are designed and implemented by project sponsors, which  are usually local transit agencies, often in coordination with local  metropolitan-planning organizations. Within the Capital Investment  Grant program, project sponsors have typically applied for funding as  either a New Starts or a Small Starts project. Under MAP-21, New Starts  projects include new fixed-guideway projects, extensions to fixed- guideway projects, and fixed-guideway bus rapid transit projects that  have a total capital cost of $250 million or greater or a Capital Investment  Grant program contribution of $75 million or greater. Small Starts projects  include new fixed-guideway projects, extensions to fixed-guideway  projects, and both fixed-guideway and corridor-based bus rapid transit  projects that have a total net capital cost less than $250 million and a  Capital Investment Grant program contribution less than $75 million.", "Prior to the enactment of MAP-21, the Capital Investment Grant program  was governed by statutory provisions put in place under SAFETEA-LU.  MAP-21, which was enacted in July 2012, made numerous changes to  the program. For example, MAP-21 reduced the number of phases in the  process that projects must follow to be eligible for and receive federal  funding. Under SAFETEA-LU, project sponsors were required to identify  the transportation needs of a specific corridor and evaluate a range of  alternatives to address locally identified problems in that corridor during  what was called the alternatives analysis phase. To complete this  phase, project sponsors selected a locally preferred alternative to be  advanced for further development after costs, benefits, and impacts of  each alternative were analyzed. However, under MAP-21 the process  relies on the review of alternatives performed during the metropolitan  transportation planning and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969  (NEPA) environmental review processes. In addition, MAP-21 created a  new category of eligible projects called Core Capacity Improvement  projects, which are substantial corridor-based capital investments in  existing fixed-guideway systems that increase the capacity of a corridor  by at least 10 percent in a corridor that is at or above capacity today or is  expected to be within 5 years. Core Capacity Improvement projects can  include expanding system platforms, the acquisition of real property,  rights-of-way, and rolling stock associated with increasing capacity,  among other things, and cannot include elements to improve general  station facilities, parking, or elements designed to maintain a state of  good repair.", "Under MAP-21, any project that fits the definition of a new fixed-guideway  project or an extension to an existing fixed-guideway system is eligible to  compete for federal funding under the Capital Investment Grant program.  Once a project sponsor decides to seek Capital Investment Grant  program funding it submits an application to FTA consisting of information  on the proposed project, such as a description of the transportation  problem the project is seeking to address, among other requirements. If  accepted into the program, the process that project sponsors must follow  varies depending on whether the project is a New Starts, Small Starts, or  Core Capacity Improvement project (see fig. 1).", "New Starts and Core Capacity Improvement projects. New Starts and  Core Capacity Improvement projects must complete two phases in the  development process to be eligible for a Construction grant  agreement\u2014Project Development and Engineering. During the  Project Development phase, among other requirements, the Secretary  must determine that the project has been selected as the locally  preferred alternative at the end of the environmental review process.  Under MAP-21 changes to the Capital Investment Grant program,  New Starts and Core Capacity Improvement projects have 2 years  after the day in which they enter into Project Development to complete  the activities required to obtain a project rating by FTA, a process that  is discussed further below. If approved to advance into the second  phase of the development process\u2014Engineering\u2014project sponsors  must, among other things, develop a firm and reliable cost, scope,  and schedule for the project and obtain all non-Capital Investment  Grant program funding commitments.", "Small Starts projects. Small Starts projects complete a similar but  more streamlined process that requires project sponsors to complete  only one phase\u2014Project Development\u2014to be eligible for a  Construction grant agreement. During this phase, the Secretary must  also determine that the project has been adopted as the locally  preferred alternative and the project sponsor must complete the  environmental review process. To complete Project Development,  project sponsors must develop a firm and reliable cost, scope, and  schedule for the project and obtain all non-Capital Investment Grant  program funding commitments, among other things.", "Before FTA can recommend a project to Congress for funding, it is  required by law to rate the project by using a number of criteria designed  to provide important information about project merit. While New Starts  and Small Starts project justification criteria have changed over time,  there are currently six criteria: mobility improvements, environmental  benefits, cost-effectiveness, economic development, land use, and  congestion relief. In contrast, the project justification criteria for Core  Capacity Improvement projects are: mobility improvements,  environmental benefits, cost-effectiveness, economic development,  congestion relief, and existing capacity needs of a corridor. FTA is also  required to evaluate and rate the local financial commitment to the project  and the project sponsor\u2019s ability to operate the project and continue to  operate the existing transit system.", "FTA is also required to rate each individual criterion on a five point scale,  from low, medium-low, medium, medium-high, and high. As we have  previously reported, FTA prepares and combines a summary project  justification, which is based on the ratings of the six criteria, and a  summary local financial commitment rating to arrive at a project\u2019s overall  rating, as shown in figure 2. To advance through the development  process and be eligible for funding, proposed projects must score at least  a medium overall project rating (which requires at least a medium rating  for both the summary project justification and the summary local financial  commitment). In order to recommend a project for a grant agreement in  the President\u2019s budget, FTA considers the evaluation and rating of the  project under the specified criteria, availability of Capital Investment Grant  program funds, and the readiness of the proposed project.", "Projects that compete for Capital Investment Grant program funding are  formally overseen by FTA with the help of contractors, who provide  assistance to FTA with oversight of planning, construction, and financing  of projects throughout the development process. FTA and its contractors  evaluate each project\u2019s risk, scope, cost, schedule, financial plan, and  project management plan, as well as the project sponsor\u2019s technical  capacity and capability\u2014before recommending a project for funding.  Throughout the development process, project sponsors submit periodic  updates to FTA on different aspects of their projects, such as on project  cost, schedule, projected ridership, and the financing of the projects. FTA  maintains its headquarters in Washington, D.C., with 10 regional offices  throughout the continental United States, to assist with project oversight.", "As mentioned previously, this report focuses on the statutory, regulatory,  and other FTA requirements applicable to the Capital Investment Grant  program under MAP-21. In December 2015, the FAST Act was enacted.  In addition to significantly altering or repealing some of the MAP-21  requirements, the FAST Act also made other changes to the Capital  Investment Grant program\u2019s processes. According to FTA officials, some  of those key changes include: (1) raising the dollar threshold for eligibility  for New Starts and Small Starts projects, (2) increasing the number of  projects eligible for funding by allowing joint public transportation and  intercity passenger rail service and commuter rail projects to be eligible  for funding, and (3) eliminating a requirement that corridor-based bus  rapid transit projects must provide weekend service to be eligible for  funding.

Representatives from 9 of the 13 project  sponsors we interviewed told us that the changes streamlined the project  development process by decreasing the number of time-consuming  reviews FTA undertakes or by eliminating what these representatives  considered to be burdensome requirements, such as the alternatives  analysis requirement under SAFETEA-LU. According to the  representatives we interviewed, streamlining should help expedite  projects through the program because fewer FTA reviews decrease the  amount of work project sponsors need to perform prior to submitting  information to FTA for review. According to APTA representatives, the  elimination of the alternatives analysis requirement was a particularly  positive development for project sponsors because project sponsors  devoted significant resources to analyzing alternatives prior to requesting  entry into the Capital Investment Grant program.", "One of the MAP-21 changes that some project sponsors indicated they  were supportive of is the addition of Core Capacity Improvement projects.  Representatives from one project sponsor said the addition of these  projects is a positive development because these projects give project  sponsors options to increase the capacity of a system as ridership  increases, while two others noted that the addition of Core Capacity  Improvement projects expands project eligibility for projects that would  likely not have rated favorably under New Starts criteria. According to  representatives from one of these project sponsors, these projects  expand eligibility because Core Capacity Improvement projects are  designed to increase the capacity of existing corridors, not add  extensions to an existing system. Figures 4 and 5 provide information on  the two Core Capacity Improvement projects we visited for this review\u2014 Dallas Area Rapid Transit\u2019s (DART) platform extensions project and  Metropolitan Transportation Authority\u2019s (MTA) power improvements  project in New York City.", "Representatives from 6 of 13 project sponsors also indicated that they  were generally supportive of the MAP-21 requirement that New Starts  and Core Capacity Improvement projects complete Project Development  within 2 years. Representatives from two project sponsors told us that  requiring project sponsors to complete more work, such as initiating the  environmental review process, prior to entering Project Development  should help expedite a project\u2019s progress through the program because  completing this work decreases the amount of work project sponsors  need to complete while in Project Development.

Representatives from one project sponsor  noted, for example, that the MAP-21 changes have greatly simplified and  streamlined the review process and made it more transparent.  Representatives from another project sponsor also noted that the  changes required FTA to implement more evaluative measures that take  into account improvements that benefit existing riders, such as measures  designed to reduce travel time, rather than focusing solely on the addition  of new riders.", "However, project sponsors also raised some concerns regarding certain  aspects of the MAP-21 changes.", "Representatives from 11 of the 13 project sponsors told us that  requiring New Starts and Core Capacity Improvement projects to  complete Project Development activities within 2 years could pose a  challenge for projects sponsors\u2014for example, increasing project  sponsors\u2019 costs because project sponsors may have to perform more  work prior to entering Project Development.

According to these  representatives, locking in funding at entry into Engineering increases  the risk of escalating costs to project sponsors\u2014costs which project  sponsors would be responsible for\u2014and is a change compared to  under SAFETEA-LU where funding was locked in prior to a project  being recommended for a grant agreement. APTA representatives  told us that some projects may spend more time in Project  Development as a result of this change, in order to help ensure that  project sponsors develop more mature cost estimates before locking- in funding. According to FTA, project sponsors, not the federal  government, should bear the risk of cost overruns once a project  enters Engineering. FTA officials noted that the project sponsor  determines when to proceed to Engineering and thus is responsible  for ensuring that a project\u2019s cost estimates are supported by sufficient  engineering and design work.", "Representatives from 10 of the 13 project sponsors voiced various  concerns regarding some of the changes MAP-21 made to the  evaluation and rating process. For example, representatives from 4  project sponsors told us that they thought the ridership measure of the  new congestion relief criterion appeared biased toward more mature  regions with legacy transit ridership compared to fast-growing regions  with emerging transit ridership, or, according to representatives from  one of these project sponsors, modes that transport a greater number  of passengers, such as light rail projects. FTA has acknowledged  limitations with the ridership measure and noted it intends to continue  to refine the congestion relief measure over time with input from the  transit industry and experience gained through its implementation of  the MAP-21 changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Project Sponsors Generally Support FTA\u2019s Efforts in Implementing the MAP-21 Changes", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from 11 of 13 project sponsors indicated that they were  generally satisfied with FTA\u2019s implementation of the MAP-21 changes.  For example, representatives from four project sponsors said that FTA  has made a good effort to listen to and incorporate many of the  recommendations offered by project sponsors. APTA representatives  similarly told us that FTA has done an excellent job engaging the transit  industry in trying to streamline the Capital Investment Grant program. In  addition, representatives from 11 of 13 project sponsors said that they  were generally supportive of the policy guidance FTA has issued since  the enactment of MAP-21. For example, representatives from five project  sponsors said FTA\u2019s policy guidance has been comprehensive and useful  in explaining how FTA will implement the MAP-21 changes and  describing what FTA expects of project sponsors. Furthermore,  representatives from all 13 project sponsors said that FTA has continued  to provide support to project sponsors prior to entry into Project  Development, such as during the application process, as well as  throughout the program, as it has worked to implement the MAP-21  changes. For example, project sponsors noted that FTA continues to  provide checklists, roadmaps, and technical assistance, in addition to its  policy guidance updates and reporting instructions. FTA officials noted  that they provide ongoing technical assistance on a routine basis during  each of their conversations with project sponsors.", "Although project sponsors were generally satisfied with FTA\u2019s efforts thus  far, they pointed out that not all MAP-21 changes, such as the programs  of interrelated projects provisions, have been implemented yet. In  addition, representatives from 9 of the 13 project sponsors told us they  thought it took a long time for FTA to issue some of its policy guidance.  FTA officials noted that by law they are required to issue new policy  guidance for the Capital Investment Grant program no less than every 2  years and emphasized that by law they are also required to invite and  respond to public comment on their guidance via the Federal Register\u2014 requirements that are time-consuming to comply with. Representatives  from 11 of the 13 project sponsors also offered various suggestions  regarding how FTA could enhance the support it provides project  sponsors, such as by providing checklists for different types of projects,  such as design-build, operate-maintain, or public-private partnerships or  by increasing the number of training opportunities it provides project  sponsors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Substantially More Projects Have Entered the Program since MAP-21, but Whether They Will Progress More Expeditiously Is Not Yet Known", "paragraphs": ["Since 2012, the total number of projects in the Capital Investment Grant  program has increased by 70 percent, from 37 projects as of February  2012 to 63 projects as of February 2016, as shown in figure 6. FTA  officials, selected project sponsors, and representatives from APTA  largely attributed this growth to the fact that under MAP-21, FTA is no  longer required to rate proposed projects prior to their entry into the  Capital Investment Grant program. While FTA officials told us they view  increased participation in the program as an opportunity to help improve  public transit in communities across the country, they also said such  growth presents challenges, noting that FTA\u2019s resources to review and  evaluate projects have largely remained flat over the last several years.  Further, they noted that participation in the program by Small Starts  projects is increasing\u2014since 2012, Small Starts projects, as a percentage  of the total number of projects, increased from about 24 percent to more  than 50 percent\u2014and that Small Starts project sponsors typically have  little experience constructing major capital projects. Consequently, FTA  often provides those project sponsors with greater levels of technical  assistance and support. FTA officials told us they have requested  additional funding from Congress to address these challenges. They also  noted that absent being given additional resources, they cannot spend as  much time providing technical assistance or evaluating projects.", "While the number of projects in the Capital Investment Grant program has  increased since the enactment of MAP-21, we found that limited data  were available to assess whether projects were progressing through the  program more quickly compared to under SAFETEA-LU. For example, at  the time of our review only 4 projects had approached the 2-year deadline  to complete Project Development. According to FTA officials, 3 of these  projects completed the activities required to obtain a project rating from  FTA before their 2-year deadlines passed while the third requested to  postpone entry into Engineering to complete additional design work and  address local funding issues.", "Representatives from 8 of the 13 project sponsors we spoke with and  representatives from APTA also felt that it was is too early to tell the  extent to which the MAP-21 changes will help expedite projects through  the program. For example, among other things, representatives from  these project sponsors told us that while MAP-21 consolidated the  number of phases in the development process it was not yet apparent to  them how this might affect their projects since they perceived they would  still have to complete the same amount of work. In discussing this issue  with FTA, officials emphasized that projects were not far enough along for  FTA to determine whether the MAP-21 changes are expediting projects  through the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOT for review and comment.

We also reviewed  FTA\u2019s policy guidance; other pertinent FTA documents related to the  program, such as FTA\u2019s annual reports to Congress; and our body of  work on FTA\u2019s Capital Investment Grant program. In addition, we  interviewed FTA officials, representatives of the American Public  Transportation Association, and selected project sponsors. Specifically,  we interviewed representatives from 13 project sponsors representing 17  of 52 projects participating in the program as of February 2015 and  conducted a content analysis of the interviews with project sponsors to  identify and summarize themes that emerged during our discussions. The  information obtained from our interviews with project sponsors is not  generalizable to all project sponsors but provides insight into project  sponsors\u2019 views of the MAP-21 changes thus far. We also visited New  York City and Dallas, Texas, to tour the sites of two proposed Core  Capacity Improvement projects. The project sponsors we contacted and  the locations we visited were selected based on a number of factors, the  primary being previous project experience in FTA\u2019s Capital Investment  Grant program under SAFETEA-LU, which provided a basis to compare  changes made by MAP-21. These project sponsors represent 7 New  Starts projects, 8 Small Starts projects, and 2 Core Capacity  Improvement projects, as well as different rail modes (heavy rail, light rail,   commuter rail) and both bus rapid transit and streetcar projects, as shown  in table 2.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 through April 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
