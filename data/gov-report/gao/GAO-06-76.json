To evaluate the status of TSA's efforts to secure domestic air cargo, GAO examined (1) the extent to which TSA used a risk management approach to guide decisions on securing air cargo, (2) the actions TSA has taken to ensure the security of air cargo and the factors that may limit their effectiveness, and (3) TSA's plans for enhancing air cargo security and the challenges TSA and industry stakeholders face in implementing these plans."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TSA has taken initial steps toward applying a risk-based management approach to address air cargo security. A risk-based management approach entails a continuous process of managing risk through a series of actions, including setting strategic goals and objectives and assessing risk through the identification and evaluation of threats, vulnerabilities, and critical assets. In November 2003, TSA completed an air cargo strategic plan that outlined a threat-based, risk management approach to secure the air cargo system by, among other things, targeting elevated risk cargo for inspection. TSA also completed an updated threat assessment in April 2005. However, TSA has not yet established a methodology and schedule for completing assessments of air cargo vulnerabilities and critical assets--two crucial elements of a risk-based management approach without which TSA may not be able to appropriately focus its resources on the most critical security needs. TSA has taken a number of actions intended to strengthen air cargo security, but factors exist that may limit their effectiveness. For example, TSA established a centralized database on people and businesses that routinely ship air cargo to improve information on known shippers. However, we identified problems with the reliability of the information in the database, and how TSA is using the information to identify shippers who may pose a risk. TSA has also established requirements for air carriers to randomly inspect air cargo, but has exempted some cargo from inspection, potentially creating security weaknesses. Further, TSA conducts audits of air carriers and indirect air carriers to ensure that they are complying with existing air cargo security requirements. However, TSA has not developed measures to assess the adequacy of air carrier and indirect air carrier compliance, systematically analyzed these audit results to target future inspections, or assessed the effectiveness of its enforcement actions to ensure compliance with air cargo security requirements. TSA's plans for enhancing air cargo security focus on implementing a system for targeting and inspecting elevated risk cargo, and requiring air carriers to conduct security threat assessments on thousands of cargo workers, among other efforts. However, these plans may pose financial, operational, and technological challenges to the agency and air cargo industry stakeholders. For example, stakeholders are concerned, and our analysis identified, that TSA may have underestimated the cost of its proposed measures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, aviation  security, including the security of cargo carried on passenger and all-cargo  aircraft, became a growing concern both to the public and to members of  Congress. Since the attacks, several instances of human stowaways in the  cargo holds of all-cargo aircraft have further heightened the concern over  air cargo security by revealing vulnerabilities that could potentially  threaten the entire air transportation system. The Aviation and  Transportation Security Act (ATSA), enacted in November 2001, required  the screening of all passengers and property, including cargo, United  States mail, and carry-on and checked baggage that is carried onboard  commercial passenger aircraft. It also required that a system be put in  place as soon as practicable to screen, inspect, or otherwise ensure the  security of cargo on all-cargo aircraft. Within the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), the Transportation Security Administration  (TSA) is responsible for overseeing aviation security to ensure the security  of the air traveling public. While TSA has focused much of its attention on  meeting requirements to screen 100 percent of passengers and baggage,  less attention has been paid to securing air cargo transported on passenger  and all-cargo aircraft.", "In 2004, an estimated 23 billion pounds of air cargo were transported  within the United States, with about a quarter of this amount transported  on passenger aircraft. Recently, DHS reported that most cargo on  passenger aircraft is not physically inspected. Specifically, according to  industry estimates, only a very small percentage of the total cargo placed  on passenger aircraft is physically screened or inspected. To enhance air  cargo security, Congress recently enacted legislation authorizing $902  million for air cargo security and required that TSA take additional steps  to secure air cargo, including increasing the percentage of cargo being  inspected on passenger aircraft. We have previously reported on the need  for TSA to strengthen air cargo security, and the challenges TSA faces in  determining how to allocate its resources to manage risks while  addressing threats and enhancing security both within aviation and across  all modes of transportation. This evolving approach, referred to as risk  management, entails a continuous process of managing risk through a  series of actions, including setting strategic goals and objectives and  assessing risk through the identification and evaluation of threats,  vulnerabilities, and critical assets, among other efforts.", "To help Congress evaluate the status of TSA's efforts to secure domestic  air cargo, we answered the following questions: (1) To what extent has  TSA used a risk management approach to guide decisions on securing air  cargo? (2) What actions has TSA taken to ensure the security of air cargo,  and what factors may limit their effectiveness? (3) What are TSA's plans  for enhancing air cargo security, and what financial, operational, and other  challenges do TSA and industry stakeholders face in implementing these  plans?", "To answer these questions, we interviewed TSA headquarters officials  responsible for managing the agency\u2019s air cargo security program.  We  reviewed laws and regulations related to air cargo security and TSA air  cargo security directives and guidance to determine the requirements  placed on air carriers and indirect air carriers for ensuring air cargo  security. To determine the extent to which TSA has used a risk  management approach to guide decisions on securing air cargo, we  compared the elements of our risk management approach with TSA's  efforts to implement such an approach.  A complete risk-based  management approach includes setting strategic goals and objectives;  assessing risk (threat, vulnerabilities, and criticality); evaluating  alternatives; selecting initiatives to undertake; and implementing and  monitoring those initiatives. This report examines the two risk  management efforts TSA has focused on thus far related to air cargo  security\u2014setting strategic goals and objectives and assessing risk.   Regarding risk assessment, we interviewed air cargo industry stakeholders  to obtain their views on the timeliness, specificity, and clarity of threat  information provided by TSA. We also analyzed data on TSA's compliance  inspections to determine the agency's progress in evaluating industry  compliance with existing air cargo security requirements. We discussed  the reliability of TSA's compliance inspection data for fiscal years 2002,  2003, and 2004 with TSA officials in charge of this effort, and concluded  that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this review. To  obtain information on government and industry actions and plans to  secure air cargo, we interviewed TSA officials and air cargo industry  stakeholders. We also reviewed TSA's Air Cargo Strategic Plan and  proposed air cargo security rule, including comments on the regulation  and costs associated with implementing the proposal. In addition, we  conducted site visits to 12 United States commercial airports to observe  air cargo security operations and pilot testing of cargo inspection  technology, including explosive detection systems (EDS). We selected  these airports based on several factors, including airport size, geographical  dispersion, and the volume of air cargo transported to and from these  airports. Because we selected a nonprobability sample of airports, the  results from these visits cannot be generalized to other United States  commercial airports. More detailed information on our scope and  methodology is contained in appendix I. We conducted our work between  June 2004 and September 2005 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.  We issued a restricted version of this  report on July 29, 2005.  This report contains information presented in  that report with all sensitive security information removed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Safeguarding the nation's air cargo transportation system is a shared  public and private sector responsibility. While TSA enforces statutory and  regulatory requirements, provides guidance on securing air cargo, and  provides some funding, air carriers and indirect air carriers have  operational responsibility for implementing security requirements issued  by TSA. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA) charged  TSA with the responsibility for ensuring the security of the nation's  transportation systems, including the transportation of cargo by air.  Specifically, TSA's responsibilities include (1) establishing security rules  and regulations covering domestic and foreign passenger carriers that  transport cargo, domestic and foreign all-cargo air carriers, and domestic  indirect air carriers; (2) overseeing implementation of air cargo security  requirements by air carriers and indirect air carriers through compliance  inspections; and (3) conducting research and development of air cargo  security technologies. Section 130 of ATSA also requires TSA to take  actions consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993, which states that agencies must use outcome-oriented goals and  measures that assess results, effects, or impacts of a program or activity  compared with its intended purpose. TSA officials stated that the agency  has developed performance goals for the overall air cargo security  program consistent with the Government Performance and Results Act.  These goals include the percentage of known shipper cargo inspected on  passenger aircraft, the percentage of regulatory compliance inspections  completed, and the percentage of assets that remain below acceptable  levels of risk for all threat scenarios for air cargo.", "Air carriers (passenger and all-cargo) and indirect air carriers are  responsible for implementing TSA security requirements, including  maintaining a TSA-approved security program that describes the security  policies, procedures, and systems the air carrier and indirect air carrier  must implement in order to comply with TSA security requirements.  These requirements include measures related to the acceptance, handling,  and inspection of cargo; training of employees in security and cargo  inspection procedures; testing employee proficiency in cargo inspection;  and access to cargo areas and aircraft. Although TSA screens or inspects  passengers and their baggage, it does not do so for air cargo. Instead, TSA  regulations assign this responsibility to air carriers. TSA also does not  directly regulate individuals or businesses that have their cargo shipped by  air.", "Air cargo includes freight and express packages that range in size from  small to very large, and in type from car engines, electronic equipment,  machine parts, apparel, medical supplies, human remains, to fresh-cut  flowers, fresh seafood, fresh produce, tropical fish, and other perishable  goods. Cargo can be shipped in various forms, including in unit-loading  devices, wooden crates, assembled pallets, or individually wrapped/boxed  pieces, known as break bulk cargo.", "Participants in the air cargo shipping process include potentially millions  of individuals and businesses that ship their cargo on all-cargo aircraft;  about 1.5 million known entities, such as manufacturers, that ship their  products on passenger aircraft; about 3,800 indirect air carriers, also  known as freight forwarders, who operate about 10,000 facilities  nationwide where they consolidate shipments and deliver them to air  carriers; and 285 passenger and all-cargo air carriers that use their cargo  facilities to store cargo until it is placed onboard an aircraft for transport.  There are about 2,800 such facilities or stations at commercial United  States airports. Figure 1 depicts these participants and the two primary  ways in which a shipper can send cargo by air.", "As illustrated in figure 1, shippers typically send cargo by air in one of two  ways. A shipper may take its packages to indirect air carriers, which  consolidate air cargo from many shippers and deliver it to air carriers. The  indirect air carrier usually has cargo facilities located in or near airports  and uses trucks to deliver bulk freight to commercial air carriers\u2014either  to a cargo facility or to a small-package receiving area at the ticket  counter. According to TSA, about 80 percent of shippers use indirect air  carriers. A shipper may also send cargo by directly packaging and  delivering it to an air carrier's airport sorting center. Under both scenarios,  the shipper may employ a representative or agent to act on its behalf. The  shipper may also have cargo picked up and delivered by an all-cargo  carrier.", "In 2004, an estimated 23 billion pounds of cargo was shipped within the  United States by air. About three-quarters of this amount, or 17 billion  pounds, traveled aboard all-cargo aircraft, while the remaining 6 billion  pounds traveled aboard passenger aircraft. Typically, about one-half of  the hulls of each passenger aircraft transporting cargo are filled with  cargo. Air cargo is a significant source of revenue to air carriers, bringing  in about $17 billion for passenger airlines in 2004.", "To support TSA's efforts to address air cargo security, Congress provided  the agency with varying levels of funding over the last 2 fiscal years. For  example, in fiscal year 2004, Congress, through the DHS 2004  Appropriations Act conference report, directed TSA to spend $85 million  for air cargo security, including $55 million for conducting research and  development of air cargo inspection technologies. In fiscal year 2005,  Congress, through the DHS 2005 Appropriations Act conference report,  directed TSA to spend $118 million for air cargo security activities,  including the hiring of additional air cargo inspectors, continued research  and development of technologies to provide more effective and efficient  methods of detecting air cargo threats, and expanding the number of TSA- certified explosive detection canine teams deployed to inspect air cargo.  The conference report further requires that DHS act expeditiously to fully  obligate and expend the funding provided for air cargo security, and  directs TSA to provide quarterly reports to the House and Senate  Appropriations Committees beginning in December 2004 on the use of all  funds obligated and plans for the use of unobligated balances related to air  cargo security. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of  2004, (Intelligence Reform Act) also authorized $902 million for air cargo  security activities for fiscal years 2005 through 2007, including $200 million  each year to improve aviation security related to the transportation of  cargo on both passenger and all-cargo aircraft, $100 million each year for  research and development related to enhanced air cargo security  technology and the deployment and installation of such enhanced  technology, and $2 million to support efforts to explore alternative  technologies for minimizing the potential effects of detonating an  explosive device on cargo and passenger aircraft. The President's fiscal  year 2006 budget requested $40 million for TSA to ensure the security of  air cargo. According to the request, this amount includes funds for  supporting the 200 air cargo inspectors, continuing the development and  improvement of the Known Shipper and indirect air carrier databases,  supporting the canine explosive detection program, and field-testing the  agency's air cargo targeting program, among other things. See appendix III  for a timeline of significant events in air cargo security following the  terrorist attacks of September 11, including additional TSA requirements  and enacted legislation.", "As we have previously reported, given the vast transportation network and  its importance to commerce, quick and easy access for passengers and  cargo must be maintained while identifying the best possible strategies for  security. Consistent with this goal, we have advocated the need to  implement\u2014at TSA and throughout the federal government\u2014a risk  management approach for prioritizing efforts and focusing resources. A  risk management approach entails a continuous process of managing risk  through a series of actions, including setting strategic goals and objectives,  assessing risk, evaluating alternatives, selecting initiatives to undertake,  and implementing and monitoring those initiatives. The President's fiscal  year 2006 budget request recognizes the need for TSA to identify,  prioritize, and manage risks, and mitigate the impact of potential incidents,  to help ensure that the best security strategies are pursued. Figure 2  depicts a risk management cycle that is a synthesis of government  requirements and best practices, as previously reported. Elements of  strategic planning and risk assessments implemented for air cargo security  are separately identified.", "TSA has committed to implementing a risk management approach for  securing air cargo and has to date focused its efforts on the first two  elements of this approach, setting strategic goals, objectives, and  constraints, and developing a risk assessment.", "Setting strategic goals, objectives, and constraints is a key first step in  implementing a risk management approach and helps to ensure that  management decisions are focused on achieving a purpose. These  decisions should take place in the context of an agency's strategic plan  that includes goals and objectives that are clear and concise. These goals  and objectives should identify resource issues and external factors to  achieving the goals. Further, the goals and objectives of an agency should  link to a department's overall strategic plan. The ability to achieve  strategic goals depends, in part, on how well an agency manages risk. The  agency's strategic plan should address risk-related issues that are central  to the agency's overall mission.", "Assessing risk, a critical component of a risk management approach in a  homeland security setting, typically involves three key elements\u2014threats,  vulnerabilities, and criticality\u2014that provide input into the decision-making  process for homeland security. A threat assessment identifies and  evaluates potential threats on the basis of factors such as capabilities,  intentions, and past activities. A vulnerability assessment identifies  weaknesses that may be exploited by identified threats and suggests  options to address those weaknesses. A criticality assessment evaluates  and prioritizes assets and functions in terms of specific criteria, such as  their importance to public safety and the economy, as a basis for  identifying which structures or processes are relatively more important to  protect from attack. Information from these three assessments can lead to  a risk characterization, such as high, medium, or low, and provides input  for prioritizing security initiatives.

This plan  incorporates recommendations provided by industry stakeholders and  outlines a threat-based risk management approach for securing the air  cargo transportation system. Specifically, this plan is based on two  primary threats\u2014preventing the introduction of an explosive device on a  passenger aircraft and the hijacking of an all-cargo aircraft resulting in its  use as a weapon to inflict mass destruction. In November 2004, TSA issued  a proposed rule to implement many of the actions identified in the  strategic plan. TSA is also in various stages of assessing the risk posed by  terrorists to the air cargo transportation system\u2014a key aspect of risk  management. However, while TSA has conducted a threat assessment to  identify terrorist threats to the air cargo transportation system, TSA has  not yet conducted assessments to identify air cargo security vulnerabilities  and critical air cargo assets. TSA has acknowledged the need to conduct  these assessments but has not yet completed a methodology or schedule  for completing them. As a result, TSA is limited in its ability to fully  address the risks posed by terrorists because some potential air cargo  security vulnerabilities may have gone undetected.

More specifically, agencies are  required to develop a strategic plan that contains a comprehensive mission  statement covering the major functions and operations of the agency and  outlines how an agency will achieve its goals and objectives. In December  2002, we reported that TSA lacked a comprehensive plan with long-term  goals and performance targets for air cargo security, time frames for  completing security improvements, and risk-based criteria for prioritizing  actions to achieve those goals. We recommended that TSA develop a  comprehensive plan for air cargo security that incorporated a risk  management approach. Specifically, we stated that this plan should  provide a framework for systematically evaluating and prioritizing  technological and operational improvements, and for identifying and  implementing additional improvements. We also stated that such a plan  should provide a framework for developing a system to ensure air cargo  security.", "In January 2003, TSA partnered with the Aviation Security Advisory  Committee (ASAC) to establish a working group to address air cargo  security issues. TSA officials stated that the establishment of the working  group was a first step in addressing our recommendation calling for a risk- based approach to enhancing air cargo security. The ASAC working group  consisted of three subgroups that focused on shipper acceptance  procedures, indirect air carriers, and securing all-cargo aircraft. These  groups collectively developed over 40 recommendations for enhancing air  cargo security that were issued to TSA in October 2003. Representatives  from various sectors of the air cargo industry participated in these  working groups, including those from passenger and all-cargo carriers,  indirect air carriers, government agencies, unions representing pilots and  flight attendants, and the victims from Pan Am flight 103.", "In November 2003, TSA issued its Air Cargo Strategic Plan, which  incorporated many of the ASAC working groups' recommendations to  enhance air cargo security. The plan focuses on securing the air cargo  supply and transportation system through the implementation of a layered  security approach. This includes screening, or reviewing specific  information on all cargo shipments, in order to determine their level of  relative risk; ensuring that 100 percent of cargo identified as posing an  elevated risk is physically inspected; pursuing technological solutions to  physically inspect air cargo; and implementing regulations and programs  that support enhanced security measures. To achieve these goals, TSA's  plan identifies strategic objectives and priority actions for enhancing air  cargo security based on risk, cost, and deadlines.", "TSA's air cargo security objectives tie into broader aviation and homeland  security goals and objectives contained in TSA's agencywide strategic plan  and the Department of Homeland Security's strategic plan. For example,  TSA's air cargo plan addresses broader agency and departmental goals by  proposing the establishment of a system to identify elevated risk cargo  through prescreening. This goal of the air cargo plan supports one of TSA's  agencywide goals of identifying technology for performing inspections of  elevated risk cargo. In turn, this agencywide goal of TSA supports DHS's  broad goal of safeguarding critical infrastructure, property, and the  nation's economy from terrorism acts or other emergencies. The air cargo  plan also calls for a coordinated effort in three other strategic areas\u2014 enhancing shipper and supply chain security, identifying technology for  performing inspection of elevated risk air cargo, and securing all-cargo  aircraft and operation areas through appropriate physical security  measures. These efforts support TSA's strategic goal to deter foreign and  domestic terrorists and others from causing harm or disrupting the  transportation system by implementing preventive and protective  measures to mitigate risk to this system.

The  importance of a risk management approach was also highlighted by the  National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States (also  known as the 9/11 Commission). The commission noted that the United  States government should identify and evaluate the transportation assets  that need to be protected, set risk-based priorities for defending them,  select the most practical and cost-effective ways of doing so, and develop  a plan, budget, and funding to implement the effort. The commission  further reported that the plan should assign related roles and missions to  the relevant federal, state, and local authorities and to private  stakeholders.

In October 2004, TSA conducted additional threat  assessments, focusing on United States mail and threats to the United  States commercial aviation system. These assessments identified the same  threats to the air cargo transportation system documented in TSA's June  2004 assessment. More recently, in April 2005, TSA briefed a congressional  committee on threats to the nation's entire transportation sector, including  aviation. The briefing included a threat matrix that ranked the risk  associated with the different transportation modes and showed threats to  the air cargo system that were consistent with previous threat  assessments. (The details of TSA threat assessments and the briefing are  classified.) TSA officials acknowledged the need to periodically reassess  the terrorist threats to air cargo and stated that the agency's air cargo  threat assessment would be updated as new or additional information on  air cargo security threats is identified. In June 2005, TSA officials  requested that the agency's Transportation Security Intelligence Service  (TSIS) update the air cargo threat assessment. According to TSA officials,  they have not been provided a date for when this assessment will be  completed.", "TSA officials stated that because the agency does not independently gather  intelligence information, the agency is dependent upon sources, such as  DHS's Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection,  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Central Intelligence  Agency, for information on air cargo security-related threats. According to  agency officials, TSA's TSIS reviews intelligence information upon receipt  and analyzes such information to determine whether policy decisions are  needed to address the identified threats. Such policy decisions could  include immediate actions to safeguard air cargo through the issuance of  security directives or long-term strategic planning efforts to enhance the  overall security of the nation's air cargo transportation system.", "Some air cargo industry stakeholders agreed with TSA's decision to focus  efforts on strengthening air cargo security based on the two threats  described in the agency's strategic plan and proposed air cargo security  rule. For example, one passenger air carrier representative said that his  company supported TSA's decision to increase supply chain security in a  post-September 11 environment. However, other air cargo stakeholders  noted that TSA plans to enhance air cargo security do not sufficiently  address another potential threat to the air cargo transportation system.  Specifically, in comments to TSA's proposed air cargo security rule,  associations representing airline pilots, some security technology experts,  airline passenger groups, and airport operators stated that the third  threat\u2014the introduction of an explosive device containing a weapon of  mass destruction on an all-cargo aircraft\u2014warrants greater emphasis in  the agency's near- and long-term air cargo security plans.  In discussing  this issue, TSA officials stated that the agency decided to focus on the two  threats cited above because they are the most likely scenarios to occur.   TSA officials also stated that they address potential threats as needed.  In  June 2005, TSA officials stated that DHS is concerned about a new and  emerging threat to air cargo on a passenger aircraft.

TSA officials stated that  they typically notify the Federal Security Directors (FSDs), who are  responsible for overseeing the implementation of air cargo security  requirements at airports nationwide, of the most updated threat  information related to aviation security, to include the security of air  cargo. In turn, the FSDs and responsible field office staff notify  stakeholders, including passenger and all-cargo carriers, of threat-related  information in person or via electronic mail or telephone. For example, at  one airport we visited, TSA and the law enforcement community hold a  monthly meeting in which both classified and nonclassified information on  threat-related information is exchanged among the participants. In  addition, updated threat information can also be relayed to industry  stakeholders, such as air carrier security managers, via information  circulars, emergency amendments, and security directives issued by TSA,  which typically contain new security requirements or other prescribed  actions to take to mitigate the identified threats. In recognition that some  industry stakeholders with a need to know, such as indirect air carriers,  may not be receiving air cargo security threat information, TSA is  proposing through its air cargo security rule to implement measures  allowing for indirect air carrier personnel to receive such information.  Specifically, this proposal would require indirect air carriers to designate a  security coordinator at the corporate level who would be responsible for  implementing security programs and serve as the point of contact for  communications with TSA.", "Air cargo stakeholders we spoke with, including air carrier officials,  expressed various views on the quality of the air cargo threat information  they received from TSA. An official from one of the seven air carriers we  interviewed stated that the threat information provided by TSA was  adequate, while officials from two other carriers stated that the  information lacked specificity about the locations, targets, and assets  being threatened, and was not communicated directly to all cargo industry  stakeholders who may have a need to know such information, such as  indirect air carrier personnel and airline pilots. Officials from these two  carriers stated that in the absence of quality TSA threat information, they  have taken independent steps to compile and analyze potential air cargo  threat information and use this information as a basis to make informed  decisions on whether additional air cargo security measures are  warranted. For example, officials from one of the two carriers stated that  the all-cargo carrier had assigned a full-time staff person to perform daily  reviews and analyses of government and publicly available information to  identify potential threats to its air cargo personnel, aircraft, and operations  resulting from reports of civil unrest, political instability, the high  presence of extremists and terrorist groups, and anti-United States  sentiment in foreign countries. These officials stated that this information  is communicated to corporate managers to facilitate operational decisions,  which could include increased security measures.  Officials from the  remaining four air carriers did not comment on the quality of threat  information provided by TSA.", "As we have previously reported, dissemination of timely, specific, and  actionable threat information is a key element of effective risk  communication. Our prior work on aviation security has also shown that  TSA faces challenges in ensuring that threat information is effectively  communicated to relevant stakeholders because intelligence information  can be general. In November 2004, we reported that applying risk  communication principles that focus on relaying to the extent possible,  only timely, specific, and actionable information could provide  organizations like TSA with the best opportunity to achieve the desired  result of effectively communicating with stakeholders.", "We discussed the issues raised by industry stakeholders with TSA officials,  who stated that that the agency is a consumer of intelligence and a  disseminator of related-threat information to stakeholders and thus can  only provide stakeholders with information it receives. In addition,  intelligence information may be classified or sensitive, thus limiting with  whom it can be shared. Specifically, TSA's TSIS receives information  from the United States intelligence and federal law enforcement  communities. For example, the FBI shares intelligence information and  maintains daily contact with TSA through its liaison responsible for civil  aviation. TSA also participates in the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces in  some FBI field office locations. Upon receipt of threat information, TSIS  reviews the information for its applicability to the transportation sector.

TSA is in the early stages of developing a methodology for conducting a  post-September 11 assessment of air cargo security vulnerabilities.  However, according to officials, limited resources and competing  priorities have delayed agency efforts to conduct such an assessment.  TSA officials stated that after completing its vulnerability assessments and  analyzing the results, the agency may propose measures to address  identified vulnerabilities. TSA also has not yet developed a methodology  for conducting criticality assessments of air cargo assets. TSA officials  stated that they anticipate conducting three air cargo vulnerability  assessments beginning in June 2005 at locations yet to be determined and  will decide whether additional assessments are needed based on the  results of these initial assessments. However, TSA has not established a  schedule for when it would complete these vulnerability assessments, nor  has it established a schedule for completing criticality assessments. TSA  officials stated that the agency will use vulnerability assessment tools such  as the agency's Transportation Risk Assessment and Vulnerability  Evaluation tool and Web-based Vulnerability Identification Self- Assessment Tool for conducting its vulnerability assessments of the air  cargo system. However, as of September 2005, these tools have not been  modified for use in conducting such assessments. Further, TSA officials  did not establish a schedule for when these tools would be ready for use,  thus raising concerns whether TSA will have the necessary tools available  to begin conducting its vulnerability assessments.", "According to TSA's Air Cargo Strategic Plan, the agency's plans for  enhancing air cargo security considered air cargo system vulnerabilities  identified by GAO, the Department of Transportation's Inspector General,  and the Federal Aviation Administration. For example, in October 2001,  the Federal Aviation Administration conducted an assessment of air cargo  security that focused on the pathways by which a terrorist may introduce  an improvised explosive device into the cargo hold of a passenger aircraft.  Some air cargo vulnerability scenarios, however, were not addressed.   Other air cargo vulnerabilities identified relate to the adequacy of  background investigations for all persons handling cargo, possible  tampering with cargo during transport, and the illegal shipment of  hazardous materials. We and others have also reported that the amount of  cargo theft that occurs in these locations, which is estimated to range into  the billions of dollars annually, indicates potential weakness in security,  including air cargo security. Recent news reports of air cargo workers  stealing goods from all-cargo aircraft intended for United States military  personnel further illustrates this concern.", "Various sources have highlighted the importance of TSA's efforts to assess  air cargo vulnerabilities. Specifically, TSA officials have acknowledged the  need to conduct a post-September 11 vulnerability assessment to both  validate existing vulnerabilities in the air cargo security system and  identify new ones. In addition, air carrier representatives we spoke with  said that a TSA-led vulnerability assessment would facilitate their efforts  to comprehensively document air cargo security weaknesses and develop  measures that would effectively mitigate the identified weaknesses. These  air carrier representatives added that TSA's assessment process should  also be ongoing and repeated as needed to reflect major changes in the air  cargo threat environment. In addition, in December 2003, the President  issued a directive calling for assessments of the vulnerability of critical  infrastructure to assist in developing the nation's homeland security  strategy. TSA has also taken the departmental lead in developing a  National Strategy for Transportation Security, for which air cargo  vulnerability assessments may provide critical information.", "Data on air cargo security breaches could also provide useful information  to identify the full range of potential air cargo security vulnerabilities by  exposing weaknesses in air cargo security procedures that would  otherwise not be detected. However, TSA has not defined what constitutes  a breach of air cargo security, even though it has defined breaches of  security in other areas of aviation security, such as passenger and airport  access controls. Specifically, TSA officials stated that the agency has not  yet determined the difference between a security breach and a violation of  air cargo security requirements identified through its regulatory oversight  of air carriers and indirect air carriers. In our discussions with TSA  officials, TSA agreed that an air cargo security breach could consist of an  event that exposes vulnerabilities in air cargo security procedures that  would not necessarily be detected during a TSA compliance inspection.  TSA officials acknowledged that such events could include instances of  human stowaways in aircraft cargo holds, an event for which TSA issued  security directives calling for random inspection of cargo on all-cargo  aircraft to deter and detect future occurrences. Although TSA officials  agreed that data on air cargo security breaches could provide useful  information to identify potential security weaknesses, the agency does not  have plans to define what constitutes a breach of air cargo security or  compile information on these breaches.", "In addition to lacking some data on air cargo vulnerabilities, TSA has not  developed a methodology or schedule for completing assessments to  identify those air cargo assets deemed most critical to protect. Air cargo  assets could include workers, facilities, aircraft, and airports in heavily  populated areas, among other things. According to TSA officials, the  agency is still in the process of determining the methodology it will use to  conduct criticality assessments of air cargo assets, as well as the criteria  for identifying such assets. The criteria could include factors such as the  number of fatalities that could occur during an attack on an airport cargo  facility or the economic and political importance of the cargo facility. TSA  officials stated that the agency's efforts to identify critical air cargo assets  have been delayed because of limited resources and competing aviation  security priorities. To facilitate the development of a methodology for  identifying critical air cargo assets, such as indirect air carriers and their  facilities, TSA officials stated that the agency planned to contract with the  National Safe Skies Alliance to compile business and location information  on the nation's entire population of indirect air carriers, and to map out in  detail the various ways cargo can flow through the supply chain.  However, TSA officials stated that they decided not to fund this effort  because of its cost. According to TSA officials, the agency plans to capture  information on the entire population of indirect air carriers and the  location of their facilities through its centralized indirect air carrier  database, which was deployed in May 2005. TSA officials stated that this  database will provide the agency with more detailed information on these  critical assets.", "The need for an assessment of critical transportation infrastructure, which  could include the nation's air cargo transportation system, has been  identified by various sources. For example, the 9/11 Commission reported  that the United States government should identify and evaluate the  transportation assets that need to be protected, set risk-based priorities  for defending them, select the most practical and cost-effective ways of  doing so, and develop a plan, budget, and funding to implement the effort.  Moreover, DHS's 2005 Interim National Infrastructure Protection Plan  highlights the need for criticality assessments of transportation  infrastructure, beginning with the identification of critical or key assets.  TSA officials acknowledged that completed criticality assessments could  better enable the agency to prioritize its efforts by focusing on high- priority or high-value air cargo assets, and by targeting resources to cost- effectively address the most critical air cargo security risks. Moreover,  criticality assessments could provide the basis for taking immediate  protective actions depending on the threat environment and the need, as  well as future agency decisions related to securing the air cargo supply  chain.", "In the absence of completed vulnerability and criticality assessments, TSA  officials stated they are using available threat intelligence, expert  judgment, and information about past terrorist incidents to select and  prioritize their efforts to address air cargo security needs, including  determining where to place TSA's cadre of 200 dedicated air cargo  inspectors. For example, TSA officials said that in 2004, the agency  allocated the first 100 of its 200 dedicated air cargo inspectors to airports  with the highest volume of air cargo. Officials also stated that other factors  considered in determining the allocation of inspectors included whether  the airport was considered high-risk because of its geographic location,  and the number of air carriers and indirect air carriers operating at that  airport, as well as other airport-specific issues. TSA officials stated that  the agency will continue to use such rationales in determining where to  allocate its remaining dedicated air cargo inspectors until criticality  assessments are completed."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Implemented Actions Intended to Strengthen Air Cargo Security, but Factors Exist That May Limit Their Effectiveness", "paragraphs": ["TSA has implemented a variety of actions intended to strengthen the  security of air cargo as it works to fully implement a risk management  approach for securing air cargo.

However,  factors exist that may limit the effectiveness of these measures. For  example, the information in TSA's database on known shippers is  incomplete because participation is voluntary, and the information in the  database may not be reliable.  In addition, exemptions in TSA's random  cargo inspection requirements may leave the air cargo system vulnerable  to terrorist attack.  Further, TSA has not developed performance measures  to determine to what extent air carriers and indirect air carriers are  complying with air cargo security requirements, analyzed the results of  inspections to systematically target future inspections on those entities  that pose a higher security risk to the domestic air cargo system, or  assessed the effectiveness of its enforcement actions in ensuring air  carrier and indirect air carrier compliance with air cargo security  requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Has Implemented Various Actions Aimed at Strengthening Air Cargo Security", "paragraphs": ["Prior to the events of September 11, the Federal Aviation Administration  was responsible for overseeing the security of domestic air cargo.

Since its establishment in November  2001, TSA has implemented additional actions intended to strengthen  domestic air cargo security, several of which built upon preexisting  requirements. According to TSA, the new actions were implemented in the  aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11, to address general  threats to the nation's aviation transportation system, specific threats to  air cargo, and incidences of exploited vulnerabilities in existing air cargo  security programs and requirements. Specifically, these actions focus on  four areas: (1) improving the screening of air cargo, including prohibiting  shipments from unknown shippers on passenger aircraft, and requiring air  carriers to perform random cargo inspections for weapons, explosives,  and stowaways; (2) strengthening the physical security of aircraft and  cargo operation areas, including controlling access around aircraft; (3)  conducting security checks on cockpit crew members, among others,  consisting of checks against TSA no-fly and selectee lists, and other  terrorist-related law enforcement or intelligence databases; and (4)  verifying the identity of indirect air carriers to identify entities potentially  posing a security risk. According to TSA officials, while some of these  actions, such as random cargo inspections, are designed to serve as  interim measures until a more comprehensive risk management approach  to air cargo security can be implemented, others, such as the centralized  Known Shipper database and system to verify indirect air carriers, will be  used to support their planned risk management approach.", "TSA has implemented requirements for conducting security checks on  cockpit crew members for both passenger and all-cargo aircraft. This  requirement was implemented to ensure that individuals who pose a  potential terrorist threat are not permitted to board or access an aircraft.  In addition, TSA implemented an automated system to recertify indirect  air carriers, and took steps to verify the accuracy of information for each  indirect air carrier to identify entities posing a security risk.  TSA took  these steps in recognition that indirect air carriers could pose a potentially  serious vulnerability in the air cargo transportation system and because  the historic paper-based process for certifying indirect air carriers was  time-consuming and cumbersome.  Specifically, in May 2004, TSA began  operating a Web-based system that allowed indirect air carriers the option  of electronically submitting information to revalidate their status in lieu of  submitting paper renewal forms. The system also informs indirect air  carriers via e-mail when their certification is due to expire. According to  TSA officials, in May 2005, the agency allowed indirect air carriers to  submit initial certification applications on-line.  TSA\u2019s proposed air cargo  security rule would require indirect air carriers to use the agency\u2019s  automated system to obtain initial indirect air carrier certification and to  apply for recertification.", "Air cargo industry stakeholders have also independently taken measures  to enhance air cargo security. However, several officials representing air  carriers and indirect air carriers we spoke to stated that they were  generally reluctant to invest resources on implementing security measures  beyond those required by TSA. Specifically, these representatives stated  that they were waiting for TSA to finalize its proposed air cargo security  rule, due in mid-August 2005, before spending funds on security measures  that may differ from those that would be required by TSA. As of September  2005, this rule has not been issued.  We did, however, identify some  examples of air carriers and indirect air carriers that have taken actions to  address air cargo security that went beyond implementing measures  currently required by TSA. Specifically, officials representing 8 of the 11  air carriers and indirect air carriers we spoke with stated that they had  implemented security measures beyond those required by TSA. According  to some of the 8 air carrier and indirect air carrier officials, while some of  these actions focus on safeguarding cargo from theft, they also have  applicability to cargo security and mitigating terrorist threats.

TSA has primarily relied  on its Known Shipper program to ensure that cargo transported on  passenger air carriers is screened in accordance with this requirement.    The Known Shipper program allows individuals or businesses with  established histories to ship cargo on passenger carriers.  However, the  Known Shipper program has weaknesses and may not provide adequate  assurance that shippers are trustworthy and that air cargo transported on  passenger air carriers is secure.", "As part of the Known Shipper program, in February 2004, TSA deployed a  voluntary centralized Known Shipper database designed to streamline the  process by which shippers are made known to carriers with whom they  conduct business. As of May 2005, TSA reported that the database is  being used by 89 air carriers and over 500 indirect air carriers and contains  information on approximately 400,000 known shippers. Prior to the  database being implemented, each air carrier and indirect air carrier was  responsible for maintaining its own information on its known shippers. As  a result, each carrier had to repeat the process of making new shipping  customers known when that shipper was already known to another  carrier. The centralized database allows carriers and indirect air carriers  to electronically ascertain the status of shippers unknown to carriers and  indirect air carriers. Specifically, an electronic message is provided to the  air carrier or indirect air carrier indicating whether or not the shipper is a  known shipper. If the shipper is known, a unique shipper identification  number is electronically provided to the carrier, and the cargo can be  accepted from that shipper as known shipper cargo and shipped on a  passenger aircraft. TSA officials stated that these known shipper data are  automatically compared with the names of restricted entities.   If the  shipper is a restricted entity, the carrier would receive a warning against  receiving shipments from that entity.  Local TSA officials at airports we  visited and associations representing air carriers, law enforcement, and  pilots we spoke with stated that while the Known Shipper program may  provide some security benefit, it is by itself an insufficient security  safeguard and must be supplemented by other security measures.", "Following the terrorist acts of September 11, TSA issued security  directives which require that passenger air carriers only transport cargo  from shippers who meet certain eligibility criteria. However, these  requirements may not by themselves deter or prevent terrorists from  meeting the Known Shipper program\u2019s basic eligibility criteria and thus  becoming known shippers.  According to TSA officials, the new Known  Shipper program requirements are one of several layers of air cargo  security\u2014including random cargo inspections conducted by air carriers,  comparing information on cargo cockpit members against terrorist watch  lists, and securing access to aircraft and cargo operation areas\u2014aimed at  deterring and preventing terrorists from doing harm.", "TSA currently estimates that the agency's centralized database contains  information on about 400,000 known shippers, or less than one-third of the  total population of known shippers, which TSA estimates at about 1.5  million known shippers.  Moreover, we determined that the information  contained in the agency\u2019s database may not be reliable.  TSA is planning  to address the problems associated with the Known Shipper database by,  among other things, proposing that air carriers and indirect air carriers be  required to submit information on their known shippers into the database.   According to TSA officials, information in the Known Shipper database  could be used in a variety of ways to identify shippers who pose a risk to  the air cargo transportation system.

As previously noted, inspection  refers to some level of examination of cargo, which can include manual  physical searches and the use of nonintrusive technology to ensure that  cargo does not contain an improvised explosive device or stowaway. TSA  established the requirements for random inspection to address threats to  the nation's aviation transportation system and to reflect the agency's  position that inspecting 100 percent of air cargo was not technologically  feasible and was potentially disruptive to the flow of air commerce. TSA  officials stated that through these random inspection requirements, the  agency attempted to balance the need for increased security with the need  to allow for the flow of air commerce. TSA officials added that the random  nature of the inspections adds an additional layer of security to the air  cargo transportation system by inserting a level of uncertainty into the  inspection process, thus creating a deterrent effect to terrorists.", "As of May 2005, TSA required that passenger carriers randomly inspect a  specific percentage of nonexempt items, and that all-cargo carriers  randomly inspect a different percentage of nonexempt items.  According  to TSA officials, the agency issued an amendment to air carriers' security  programs on April 25, 2005, to triple the percentage of cargo inspected on  passenger aircraft to address a provision in the fiscal year 2005  Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act. According to TSA  officials, the increase in the percentage of nonexempt cargo items  inspected was to be phased in by the end of July 2005. TSA officials stated  that they chose to exempt certain cargo from the requirement for random  inspection because it did not view the exempted cargo as posing a  significant security risk.", "In an effort to address the threats identified for all-cargo aircraft, TSA  focused its inspection requirements for all-cargo air carriers on specific  areas that address known threats.

Beginning in fiscal year 2004, TSA's new approach involved  visiting air carriers and indirect air carriers but inspecting only some of  the air cargo specific inspection areas (known as supplementary  inspections). According to TSA officials, the new inspection process uses  risk management principles that consider threat factors, local security  issues, and input from law enforcement to target key vulnerabilities and  critical assets.

TSA is authorized  to issue civil monetary penalties when air carriers and indirect air carriers  fail to correct serious violations of air cargo security requirements.", "TSA officials stated that the majority of air cargo security violations  identified from January 1, 2003, to January 31, 2005, were addressed  through on-site counseling and training. Specifically, of the 4,343 air cargo  security violations identified during this period, TSA resolved almost 60  percent (2,590) through on-site counseling and training. TSA enforcement  action data covering this period, however, did not specify the actions the  agency took in resolving approximately 1,600 (about 35 percent) of the  4,343 air cargo security violations. TSA also recommended civil penalties  for 185 violations, of which 11 were issued and 15 were resolved through  administrative actions or no action. Enforcement actions on the remaining  159 violations are still pending.", "According to TSA officials, the agency has not assessed the effectiveness  of its enforcement actions, including on-site counseling and civil penalties,  in ensuring air carrier and indirect air carrier compliance with air cargo  security requirements. Our reviews of agency compliance inspection  programs have cited the need for evaluations of enforcement activities and  have noted the effectiveness of using sanctions such as civil penalties to  increase compliance. Moreover, ATSA requires TSA to conduct ongoing  assessments of the effectiveness of penalties in ensuring airport  compliance with security procedures. Without assessing the effectiveness  of its enforcement actions, TSA cannot be assured that its current  cooperative approach to addressing issues of noncompliance is resulting  in increasing carrier compliance with air cargo security requirements."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Plans to Enhance Air Cargo Security, but Implementing These Plans Poses Challenges to the Agency and Air Cargo Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["TSA has developed plans aimed at enhancing air cargo security, but the  agency and industry face challenges in effectively implementing these  plans. Specifically, TSA is developing a system to target elevated risk air  cargo for inspection that would minimize the agency's reliance on random  inspections. This system would compare information on individual air  cargo shipments as well as information from the Known Shipper, indirect  air carrier, and PARIS databases against targeting criteria to assign a risk  level to cargo. Cargo identified as posing an elevated risk would then be  subject to additional inspection by air carrier personnel through physical  searches or other nonintrusive means. Elevated risk cargo could include  cargo that has been determined to pose a risk to the safety and security of  passengers and air cargo operations. Although the agency acknowledges  that the successful development of the targeting system is contingent upon  having complete and accurate targeting information in a timely manner,  the agency has not yet completed efforts to ensure that these data are  complete, accurate, and current. Moreover, the agency has not yet  determined the criteria that will be used to identify elevated risk cargo.  TSA plans to pilot-test this targeting system beginning in early 2006 and  phase in deployment of the system during calendar years 2006 and 2007.  TSA is also testing and developing technologies to assess their  applicability to air cargo\u2014a key component of the agency's Air Cargo  Strategic Plan. According to TSA officials, the results of its technology  tests will need to be analyzed before the agency determines which  technologies will be certified for inspecting cargo, and whether it will  require air carriers to use such technology. Further, TSA's proposed air  cargo security rule would require air carriers and indirect air carriers to  (1) include all known shippers in a centralized database, (2) secure air  cargo facilities, and (3) conduct security checks on air cargo workers. A  number of industry stakeholders, including passenger and all-cargo  carriers that commented on the proposed rule, stated that TSA  underestimated the costs associated with implementing the proposed  measures and that some of these proposals may be difficult to implement.  Our analysis of TSA's proposed air cargo security rule cost estimate, $637  million (in discounted 2003 dollars) over a 10-year period, identified  concerns with the agency's methodology for calculating the cost estimate  and suggests that TSA's cost figure may have been underestimated.  According to TSA officials, the agency plans to reassess its cost estimates  before issuing its final air cargo security rule."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Is Working to Develop a System to Target Elevated Risk Cargo, but Has Not Yet Ensured That Data to Be Used to Target Cargo Are Complete, Accurate, and Current", "paragraphs": ["According to TSA officials, the agency decided to develop a system to  target elevated risk cargo after concluding that physically inspecting 100  percent of the cargo boarded onto passenger aircraft was not feasible  using currently available technology without significantly impeding the  flow of commerce. Specifically, TSA officials stated that currently  available technology does not have the capability to inspect various types  and sizes of cargo in a timely manner and that the cost associated with  inspecting 100 percent of air cargo could be significant. A Federal Aviation  Administration analysis conducted in 2001 determined that only a small  portion of the nation's air cargo could be inspected effectively or  efficiently with available technology, for similar reasons. In its analysis,  the Federal Aviation Administration estimated that 8,000 federal screeners  and $500 million (in the first year) would be required to implement a  federally managed cargo inspection program for passenger aircraft.  Further, in June 2002, TSA estimated that it would cost air carriers and the  federal government up to $3.61 billion (in discounted 2001 dollars) over 10  years to physically inspect all cargo placed in the cargo hold of  commercial passenger aircraft, primarily because of the expense  associated with inspection equipment and personnel costs. Moreover,  according to TSA, delays associated with inspecting 100 percent of cargo  would significantly affect the air cargo operations on passenger carriers by  potentially delaying cargo delivery schedules. Delays associated with  cargo inspection could also affect cargo shippers who may be required by  air carriers to deliver cargo sooner so it can be properly inspected before  being loaded onto aircraft. In addition, air cargo stakeholders contend that  additional security costs related to 100 percent cargo inspection could  adversely affect the financial status of air carriers.", "TSA is in the early stages of developing a system to target elevated risk  cargo for additional scrutiny, including physical inspection through  manual searches and the use of nonintrusive inspection technologies. TSA  officials anticipate that the agency's targeting system, referred to as  Freight Assessment, will minimize the reliance on the random physical  inspections currently conducted by air carriers. TSA officials stated that  the development of the Freight Assessment System will also help the  agency to address one of its key objectives in the agency's Air Cargo  Strategic Plan\u2014identifying elevated risk cargo.  TSA\u2019s planned Freight  Assessment System would use information maintained in the agency's  Known Shipper, indirect air carrier, and PARIS databases to target  elevated risk cargo for inspection.  Cargo that is identified by the Freight  Assessment System as posing an elevated risk will then be physically  inspected either through the use of inspection technology or other  methods.", "According to agency plans, air carriers would receive targeting  information from TSA on specific cargo items identified as posing an  elevated risk. Upon notification by TSA's Freight Assessment System,  carrier personnel would be responsible for conducting the inspection of  cargo identified as elevated risk. Thus, cargo inspection would continue to  differ from current passenger and baggage inspection in that cargo  inspection would be performed by the employees of air carriers, rather  than by a federal workforce.  Air carrier and indirect air carrier officials  we spoke with have raised concerns about their role in cargo inspection  and have questioned the skill level and adequacy of inspection training  provided to air carrier employees.", "TSA and CBP officials stated that they had agreed to jointly develop and  deploy the Freight Assessment System and the rules that would be used to  identify elevated risk cargo for inspection. TSA officials stated that the  goal of this interagency coordination is to minimize the cost of the Freight  Assessment System's development by leveraging existing DHS capabilities,  and reduce the administrative burden on the air cargo industry by not  requiring stakeholders to submit the same data to multiple government  agencies. CBP is responsible for preventing terrorists and terrorist  weapons from entering the United States. To target elevated risk  international cargo, CBP systems store data on international cargo  shipments, assign a risk score to a specific cargo shipment, and update  stored information with the latest risk scoring for specific shipments. In  addition, all commercial air carriers transporting international cargo must  now transmit specific cargo information to CBP through an automated  system. This cargo information is screened to identify elevated risk cargo  based on certain criteria. Upon arrival in the United States, cargo that is  deemed as posing an elevated risk is to be inspected either physically or  with nonintrusive inspection technology by CBP inspectors.", "According to TSA and CBP officials, most of the components needed for  TSA's Freight Assessment System already exist within CBP. To use these  components, however, TSA will need to further develop its air cargo  databases to identify and target elevated risk air cargo and develop the  criteria and rules necessary to assign a risk score to domestic air cargo  shipment. TSA's databases will also need to be linked to the systems  housed within CBP. According to TSA officials, the preliminary design  phase of the Freight Assessment System, incorporating components  already existing within CBP, was completed on April 12, 2005.", "In addition to collaborating with CBP, TSA has worked with the air cargo  industry to develop the overall design of the Freight Assessment System.  For example, in September 2004, the Aviation Security Advisory  Committee created an industry working group to advise TSA on the  development of a Freight Assessment System. On April 28, 2005, the  working group presented the Aviation Security Advisory Committee with  four recommendations to be formally provided to TSA. The working group  recommended (1) extending the life of the working group to enable the  industry to have adequate input into the Freight Assessment System  process as it evolves over time; (2) designing the Freight Assessment  System to include processes for sharing threat information; (3)  establishing a pilot program to determine whether the proper system  elements are in place, and whether the communication between  government and industry allows for the inspection of elevated risk cargo  without disrupting the air cargo supply chain; and (4) obtaining public  comment on the proposed Freight Assessment System through a notice of  public rule making, and implementing the system through amendments to  each regulated party's security program. During the April 28, 2005,  meeting, the Freight Assessment System working group members noted  that in addition to the targeting and physical inspection of elevated risk air  cargo, random physical inspection should continue as an additional layer  of security and stressed that once elevated risk air cargo is identified,  inspection of such cargo should be performed by TSA employees. TSA  officials stated that they would consider the working group's  recommendations and that most of the group's recommendations have  been accepted and incorporated into the Freight Assessment System  design. In addition, TSA officials agreed to continue the life of the Freight  Assessment System working group to extend through the implementation  of the pilot. TSA further requested that once the pilot program was  complete, the working group draft additional recommendations on the  implementation of the system. According to TSA officials, however, the  agency does not plan to use TSA employees to inspect air cargo because of  the cost associated with using federal screeners and because the number  of full-time equivalent screeners is capped at 45,000.", "TSA officials anticipate pilot-testing the Freight Assessment System in  early 2006. According to TSA officials, two airlines and five indirect air  carriers have agreed to participate in the pilot test. TSA officials expect to  expand the pilot test to include cargo transported on all-cargo carriers but  have yet to make a final determination on when the agency will expand the  pilot. TSA officials also plan to phase in implementation and deployment  of the targeting system for cargo transported on passenger carriers during  calendar years 2006 and 2007. Until such time, TSA officials stated that the  agency will rely on the Known Shipper program and random inspection  requirements as the primary means for screening and inspecting air cargo.", "Although TSA has identified data elements that could be used in its Freight  Assessment System, the agency has not yet ensured that these data are  complete, accurate, and current. TSA acknowledges that the successful  development of the targeting system is contingent upon having complete  and accurate information on shippers and cargo shipments, among other  things.  However, as we have previously noted, there are problems with  the information contained in the TSA Known Shipper database and how  TSA uses this information to identify shippers who may pose a risk.  TSA  plans to make the Known Shipper database mandatory, allowing the  agency to compile and verify information on the entire population of  known shippers and take other actions to identify high-risk shippers.  In  December 2004, TSA contracted for a study to review the information  contained in the Known Shipper database. However, as of June 2005, the  study has not yet been completed. TSA officials stated that they intend to  conduct a follow-on study to examine how to use known shipper data as  part of the Freight Assessment System once privacy issues are addressed.  Further, while TSA plans to use the results of its compliance inspection  program to help target elevated risk cargo, the agency has not yet fully  analyzed its compliance inspection results data or required air carriers to  provide data of their inspection activities.  In addition, TSA does not  currently require carriers to submit information on individual domestic  cargo shipments, as is done by CBP for international shipments in transit  to the United States. TSA anticipates requiring domestic air carriers to  submit such information under the proposed Freight Assessment System.", "Complete and accurate shipment and compliance inspection information  is essential for the development of an effective system to target elevated  risk cargo. Further, as we have recently reported, efforts to target elevated  cargo will only be as good as the data used to conduct such targeting.  Specifically, we reported on limitations associated with the information  used by CBP in targeting oceangoing cargo. CBP uses manifest  information as one of several data sources to assess the risk level of  United States-bound shipments, but our review identified problems with  this information. We found that without complete and accurate  information on shipments, it is difficult for CBP's Automated Targeting  System to accurately assess the risk of shipments and to conduct thorough  targeting. Similarly, TSA plans to develop a system to target elevated risk  domestic air cargo based on the use of information from existing agency  databases, as well as information contained in air carrier's cargo airway  bills. The limitations we identified with CBP's efforts highlight the need for  TSA to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of information it plans on  using to target elevated risk domestic air cargo. Without quality  information, TSA's ability to effectively target cargo for inspection will be  limited, regardless of the system being used. According to TSA officials,  the agency is working to address issues of quality and availability for both  industry-provided data and data from government sources. TSA  anticipates using the results of this analysis as well as the results of its  Freight Assessment pilot, which is currently scheduled for early 2006, to  adjust the information that will be used to identify elevated risk cargo.", "Finally, TSA is still deliberating on the criteria it will use to define elevated  risk cargo during the pilot test of its Freight Assessment System. While  TSA is considering various factors for determining an air cargo shipment\u2019s  risk, the agency has not yet determined whether these or other criteria will  be used to define elevated risk cargo. According to TSA officials, the  Freight Assessment System has been designed to accommodate changes in  targeting criteria to identify elevated risk cargo. Establishing clear criteria  for identifying elevated risk cargo will be essential for the development,  testing, and implementation of an effective system to target such cargo for  further inspection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Is Testing Inspection Technologies to Determine Their Applicability to Air Cargo", "paragraphs": ["TSA is currently developing and testing technologies to assess their  applicability to the inspection of air cargo.

Testing and  developing technology is also one of TSA's key objectives in the agency's  strategic plan for enhancing air cargo security and is also a key component  of TSA's plans to inspect elevated risk cargo. Recognizing the importance  of researching and developing inspection technology, TSA obligated about  $700,000 in fiscal year 2003 and was directed by the conference report for  the DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2004 appropriations act to spend $55 million for air  cargo security research and development activities. The fiscal year 2005  Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act also directed the  Secretary of Homeland Security to research, develop, and procure  certified systems to inspect and screen air cargo on passenger aircraft at  the earliest date possible. To accomplish this, the accompanying  conference report directed TSA to spend an additional $75 million to  research and develop air cargo security technologies.", "TSA is currently developing performance criteria for technology to inspect  air cargo and considering whether to establish a certification standard for  such technology. At present, TSA is not required to certify technology for  air cargo inspection. Until such technology is certified, TSA officials stated  that the agency will continue to allow air carriers to use the technologies  and methods described in the air carrier standard security program and  TSA security directives. These technologies and methods include manual  physical searches, X-ray systems, explosive trace detection (ETD)  equipment, explosive detection systems, TSA-certified explosives  detection canine teams, and decompression chambers, among other  methods. TSA security programs contain procedures and training  requirements for air carrier personnel when using X-ray systems or  performing manual searches of air cargo. TSA also established protocols  for air carriers to follow when using ETD equipment to inspect air cargo.  These protocols include testing procedures, operating instructions, alarm  resolution guidance, and training requirements.", "TSA has recently completed a pilot program focused on testing the  applicability of EDS technology to inspect individual pieces of air cargo,  referred to as break bulk cargo. According to TSA officials, the agency  decided to test EDS's applicability for inspecting air cargo, in part because  this technology is already used to inspect checked baggage. EDS pilot-  testing criteria included detection rates, false alarm rates, and throughput  rates. Although EDS is currently an approved method for inspecting air  cargo, it had not been tested by TSA to determine its effectiveness in  inspecting air cargo. According to TSA officials, EDS was approved by the  Federal Aviation Administration for inspecting air cargo, but TSA still  needs to review the results of its EDS pilot test before the agency will  determine whether to certify EDS for inspecting air cargo.  Although TSA  has not yet finalized its evaluation of the results of the EDS pilot, agency  officials stated that preliminary data suggest that EDS technology is well  suited to inspect break bulk cargo under a range of environmental and  climactic conditions, but limitations exist with using such technology. TSA  has not yet established time frames, however, for when the agency will  decide whether or not to certify EDS technology for air cargo or require  air carriers to use this technology to inspect air cargo. For a description of  TSA's evaluation of EDS technology, see appendix V.", "TSA also recently completed an operational test and evaluation to  determine the applicability of explosives detection canine teams to inspect  air cargo. There are currently 370 TSA-certified explosives detection  canine teams authorized and 333 assigned for use in inspecting passengers'  checked baggage. According to TSA, the agency chose to test the  effectiveness of TSA-certified explosives detection canine teams in  inspecting air cargo in part because these teams are already used as part  of the agency's multifaceted approach to airport security. As with EDS  technology, existing TSA security programs allow air carriers to use  canines for inspecting air cargo. According to TSA officials, the agency,  however, has not yet certified the use of canines for inspecting air cargo.  TSA officials stated that the canine operational test and evaluation was  designed to determine the effectiveness of canine detection teams in the  air cargo environment. Although TSA has not fully evaluated the results of  the pilot tests, according to TSA, the data suggest that even without prior  training, the canine teams performed effectively in inspecting various  types of cargo. They added that the results of these tests will be used to  determine whether canines will be certified for inspecting air cargo. TSA  has not yet established time frames, however, for when such decisions will  be made. For a description of the recently completed TSA canine pilot  program, see appendix VI.", "TSA is also testing other forms of currently available cargo inspection  technologies, as well as identifying and developing new and emerging  technologies. In February 2004, for example, TSA solicited information  from vendors on new and emerging technology concepts for inspecting  cargo containers and United States mail. According to TSA officials, the  agency is pursuing multiple technologies that will automate the detection  of explosives in the types and quantities that will cause catastrophic  damage to an aircraft in flight. On the basis of responses to its solicitation,  TSA identified nine technologies to finance for further development and  testing. According to TSA, the technologies selected will go through four  phases of development: (1) a preliminary design phase, consisting of  activities in which the concept of operations will be clearly defined and  the system components will be clearly identified; (2) a critical design  phase, consisting of further definition of system design features and  analysis of overall detection and false alarm performance; (3) a system  development phase, consisting of the final design and fabrication of the  system, including developmental tests and evaluations; and (4) a prototype  evaluation phase, consisting of a series of laboratory tests using threats  and cargo to evaluate the detection and false alarm performance for a  variety of threat scenarios. TSA plans to develop working prototypes of  these technologies by September 2006 and complete operational testing by  2008. TSA acknowledges that full development of these technologies may  take 5 to 7 years. For a description of the new and emerging technologies  selected by TSA for further development and testing, see appendix VII.", "TSA also has other efforts under way to develop and deploy technology in  the air cargo environment. For example, in January 2005, TSA solicited  information on technology systems that could be used to inspect break  bulk air cargo. According to TSA officials, the agency will identify and  evaluate commercial off-the-shelf systems that could be used to inspect  break bulk cargo. TSA plans to begin laboratory and field tests of these  technologies in the summer of 2005. In April 2005, TSA issued another  solicitation for information on air cargo inspection technology. This  solicitation specifically requested information on explosives detection  systems for inspection of cargo containers or palletized air cargo and will  cover the use of unit load devices placed on passenger aircraft. According  to TSA, the agency is currently reviewing the responses to this solicitation.", "In addition to cargo inspection technology, hardened cargo containers are  being considered as a means to mitigate the threat of an improvised  explosive device. The Federal Aviation Administration previously had a  research program on blast-resistant containers to examine their  effectiveness in containing the effects of an improvised explosive device.  Air carriers have raised concerns regarding the weight of these containers  and the potentially significant affect their use would have on airlines by  increasing fuel costs, reducing flight range, and decreasing payload  capacity for revenue-generating passengers and cargo. Other challenges  associated with deploying hardened cargo containers include purchasing  costs (which, according to TSA can range from $20,000 to $40,000 per  container), durability, and potentially higher maintenance costs for  hardened container materials. Although the purchase, deployment, and  use of such containers may prove to be challenging, the Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required that TSA begin to  carry out a pilot program to evaluate the use of blast-resistant containers  for cargo and baggage on passenger aircraft to minimize the potential  effects of an explosive device's detonation. The act authorized $2 million  to conduct such a pilot program. According to TSA officials, the agency is  currently conducting a pilot program with two airlines on the use of  hardened containers.", "Finally, according to its Air Cargo Strategic Plan, TSA is also considering  whether the agency's Transportation Worker Identification Credential  (TWIC) Program would be beneficial to incorporate into the air cargo  environment. The TWIC Program is intended to establish a uniform  identification credential for 6 million workers who require unescorted  physical or cyber access to secured areas of transportation facilities. The  program is intended to combine standard background checks and new and  emerging biometric technology so that a worker can be positively matched  to his or her credential. As of June 2005, TSA had not yet determined  whether the TWIC Program would be incorporated as part of the agency's  overall effort to enhance air cargo security. We currently have an on-going  review of the TWIC Program.", "According to TSA officials and air carrier and airport representatives, the  federal government and the air cargo industry face several challenges that  must be overcome to effectively implement technology to inspect air cargo  for explosives. These challenges include factors such as the nature, type,  and size of the cargo; environmental and climatic conditions; inspection  throughput rates; screener staffing and training issues; the location of air  cargo facilities (centralized versus decentralized); cost and availability;  and employee health and safety concerns. For example, cargo weighing  several tons may be too large to be inspected by currently available  technology. The heat and humidity at certain airport locations may affect  the functioning of inspection technology. Furthermore, trained staff must  be available to operate the technology, and health and safety concerns  such as worker exposure to radiation must be addressed. We have also  previously reported on the need for TSA and DHS to better manage their  research and development programs to ensure effective use of technology  research funds. Specifically, we recommended that DHS and TSA  implement a risk management approach for their research and  development programs. Table 2 describes the potential challenges with  using current and new and emerging technology to inspect air cargo that  were identified by TSA officials and officials representing airports and air  carriers.", "TSA noted that given the challenges of inspecting air cargo using currently  available technologies, the agency's goal is to develop an approach to  inspect air cargo using a combination of technologies. TSA's strategic plan  states that the agency envisions developing a \"tool box\" of technologies  that can be used by air carriers to inspect cargo of various types of sizes  under different operating environments. Although the agency recognizes  the challenges associated with inspecting air cargo, has completed some  technology evaluations, and plans to conduct further technology testing,  TSA has not decided whether it will certify or require air carriers to use  specific technologies. TSA officials stated that they will make these  decisions after evaluating the results of the cargo inspection technology  assessments, but the agency has not established time frames for making  such decisions. To effectively inspect cargo that TSA deems to be an  elevated risk, the agency will need to make decisions regarding the use of  air cargo inspection technologies prior to full implementation of its  Freight Assessment System, which is currently scheduled for the end of  calendar year 2007."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Plans to Issue New Air Cargo Security Requirements, but Some Industry Stakeholders Have Expressed Concern Over Their Cost and Feasibility", "paragraphs": ["In addition to developing a system to target and inspect elevated risk  cargo, TSA has proposed additional requirements to enhance air cargo  security in its proposed rule, issued on November 10, 2004. Many of the  measures outlined in the proposed rule are initiatives that are outlined in  TSA's Air Cargo Strategic Plan, as discussed earlier in this report.  Specifically, the proposed rule making would require the adoption of  security measures that focus on inspecting cargo, securing air cargo  facilities, and conducting security checks on air cargo workers. TSA  received 676 comments to its proposed rule from 134 commentators  representing air carriers, indirect air carriers, and airports, among others.  The agency has reviewed these comments as it determines how to finalize  its proposals aimed at enhancing air cargo security. TSA estimated in its  proposed rule that implementing these proposals, including random  inspection of air cargo, will cost $637 million (in discounted 2003 dollars)  over a 10-year period from 2004 to 2013. Table 3 describes TSA's proposed  measures.", "Although most industry members who commented on the proposed air  cargo rule were pleased that TSA is taking steps to enhance air cargo  security, many pointed out various issues related to implementing these  measures, particularly cost. Specifically, officials representing air  carriers, indirect air carriers, and airports have expressed concern that  they would incur approximately 97 percent of the projected cost of the air  cargo security procedures described in TSA's proposed air cargo security  rule. Air carriers also contend that the additional air cargo security costs  will ultimately be borne by shippers and passed on to their customers.  Officials representing passenger and all-cargo carriers also commented  that the overall estimate to implement these proposed procedures was  low. For example, cost projections developed by one stakeholder suggest  that implementing TSA's proposals could cost more than double what TSA  estimated. A major reason for this higher cost estimate was that the  stakeholder assumed a tripling in the estimated percentage of air cargo  required to be inspected on passenger aircraft, as mandated in the fiscal  year 2005 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act.  According to TSA officials, the agency's cost estimate for implementing its  proposed security measures did not assume the tripling of the inspection  percentage, as required by the Act, because the fiscal year 2005  Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act was signed shortly  before the proposed rule was issued. Therefore, TSA based its proposed  rule's cost estimates for cargo inspection on existing requirements at the  time.", "Our analysis of TSA's costs estimates identified four ways in which the  agency had likely underestimated the costs of air cargo inspections. First,  TSA's estimate did not take into consideration the tripling in the  percentage of inspections for cargo transported on passenger aircraft.  Second, TSA is proposing to expand the definition of indirect air carriers  to include those transporting goods on all-cargo aircraft in addition to  those transporting goods on passenger aircraft, a change that would  increase the cost of implementing the proposed rule. Third, earlier TSA  analyses assumed a range of costs for inspection technology, yet in TSA's  cost analysis for its proposed rule, the agency chose to use a cost estimate  for this technology at the lower end of this range. Incorporating the full  range of possible inspection technology costs raises the expected cost of  the proposed regulation. Fourth, our analysis of the proposed regulation  also indicated that there is no allowance for the cost of any delay. For  instance, added time spent inspecting cargo could mean missing delivery  deadlines for shippers or flight delays. This could affect industries, whose  costs of production are tied to inventories being delivered on time. We  discussed these issues with TSA officials, who stated that the agency will  consider revising its costs estimates as it reviews industry comments to  these security proposals.", "In addition to concerns about the overall cost of TSA's proposed rule, air  cargo industry stakeholders expressed concern about the cost and  feasibility of implementing specific proposals described in TSA's proposed  rule. For example, in commenting on the proposed rule, some air carriers  and indirect air carriers acknowledged the need for TSA's proposal for  conducting security threat assessments on air cargo workers but  expressed concern that TSA may have underestimated the total number of  workers affected, as well as the total costs to perform these checks.  Specifically, one air cargo stakeholder estimated that the population  affected by TSA's proposal is more than twice as large as the agency  estimated, thus potentially more than doubling the estimated cost of $3.2  million (in discounted 2003 dollars) over 10 years. Air carrier  representatives also questioned why TSA would propose a different type  of check than is already required for workers with unescorted access to an  airport's SIDA. These air carrier representatives stated that requiring a  single type of check for workers with access to either an airport SIDA or  air cargo would provide for a more uniform level of worker security.  According to TSA officials, the agency's preliminary review of the  comments on its proposed rule indicates that industry stakeholders may  have misunderstood the scope of this proposal, particularly as it relates to  the number and type of workers affected. According to TSA officials, the  agency will clarify these requirements in the agency's final air cargo  security rule.", "Several stakeholders also commented on TSA's proposal to apply or  extend airport SIDA requirements to air cargo operations areas. While  three air carrier and indirect air carrier representatives we spoke with  were supportive of this proposal and stated that extending the airport  SIDA should enhance the physical security of cargo shipments and  aircraft, other air carriers and indirect air carriers expressed concern over  the implementation of this proposal. For example, officials from two air  carrier associations we spoke with stated that this proposal would transfer  responsibility for cargo operations areas from the air carrier to the airport  authority. One airport official we spoke with stated that he did not want  the additional responsibility associated with implementing this proposal,  and that air carriers should be responsible for overseeing the  implementation of this requirement. According to TSA officials, the  agency's preliminary review of comments to its proposed rule indicates  that industry stakeholders may have misunderstood the air carriers\u2019 and  airport operators' role in implementing this proposed requirement,  particularly as it relates to their role in overseeing all-cargo operations  within the SIDA. According to TSA officials, the agency will clarify these  requirements in the agency's final air cargo security rule.", "Air cargo industry stakeholders, also expressed concern about the cost  and feasibility of implementing TSA's proposal to put into regulation  existing requirements for air carriers to inspect a portion of air cargo. For  example, a representative from one industry association we spoke with  stated that TSA's proposal to screen a percentage of air cargo does not  ensure that air cargo is secure and suggested that most, if not all, cargo  should be screened. Air carrier representatives noted that the inspection  of air cargo should be considered a national security issue and therefore  funded and conducted by the federal government. In addition, several  stakeholders who represent air carriers and indirect air carriers we spoke  with stated that TSA has not adequately defined what an inspection will  entail and who will be responsible for such an inspection. Further, three of  the air cargo stakeholders we spoke with stated that TSA's  interchangeable use of the terms \u201cscreening\u201d and \u201cinspection\u201d created  confusion about the actions they were required to take regarding the  examination of air cargo. Specifically, they noted that they were unsure  whether inspection meant conducting a physical search, while screening  meant using nonintrusive methods such as X-ray machines.

Some indirect air carriers noted that more information is needed  on who will now be defined as an indirect air carrier, who will receive  security training, and what the training will entail. Similarly, air carrier  representatives agreed with TSA's proposals regarding security measures  for individuals boarding an all-cargo aircraft and establishing a required  standardized security program for all-cargo carriers, but they said that  they would like clarification on what these measures would entail.", "TSA officials told us that the agency is evaluating industry stakeholders'  comments to its proposed security measures and may revise these  proposals prior to issuing its final air cargo security rule. The Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 provides that TSA must  issue a final air cargo rule no later than 240 days from its date of  enactment (August 14, 2005).

The nature,  size, and complexity of the nation's air cargo transportation system  highlights the need for the federal government and the private sector to  work together to secure this system and enhance security. While the cost  of enhancing air cargo security can be significant, the potential costs of a  terrorist attack, in terms of both the loss of life and property and long-term  economic impacts, would also be significant although difficult to predict  and quantify. The importance of the nation's air cargo security system and  the limited resources available to protect it underscore the need for a risk  management approach to prioritize security efforts so that a proper  balance between costs and security can be achieved. In December 2002,  we recommended, and TSA committed to, implementing a risk  management approach for securing air cargo. By developing a strategic  plan, TSA established strategic goals and objectives, a key first step in  implementing a risk management approach. TSA also took another key  step in implementing a risk management approach by assessing threats to  air cargo security.", "While these efforts represent achievements, more work remains to be  done to fully address the risks posed to air cargo security. By not yet fully  evaluating the risks posed by terrorists to the air cargo transportation  system through assessments of systemwide vulnerabilities and critical  assets, including analyzing information on air cargo security breaches,  TSA is limited in its ability to focus its resources on those air cargo  vulnerabilities that represent the most critical security needs and assure  Congress that existing funds are being spent in the most efficient and  effective manner. Further, without examining the rationale of current air  cargo inspection exemptions in light of potential vulnerabilities associated  with these exemptions, TSA cannot be assured that tripling the amount of  cargo on passenger aircraft that is inspected, as required by recent  legislation, will enhance air cargo security.", "Without performance measures to gauge air carrier and indirect air carrier  compliance with air cargo security requirements, TSA cannot effectively  focus its inspection resources on those entities posing the great risk. In  addition, without systematically analyzing the results of its air cargo  compliance inspections, TSA will be limited in its ability to effectively  target future inspections and fulfill its oversight responsibilities for this  essential area of aviation security. TSA also cannot be assured that its  current cooperative approach to addressing issues of noncompliance is  resulting in increased air carrier and indirect air carrier compliance with  air cargo security requirements without assessing the effectiveness of its  enforcement actions. Finally, TSA's goal of developing a system to target  elevated risk cargo for inspection without impeding the flow of air  commerce will be difficult to achieve without ensuring that the  information used to target such cargo is complete, accurate, and current.  By addressing these areas, TSA would build a better basis for  strengthening air cargo security in the future as it moves forward in  implementing risk-based security initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help ensure that the Transportation Security Administration has a  comprehensive risk-based approach for securing the domestic air cargo  transportation system, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland  Security direct the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security for the  Transportation Security Administration to take the following six actions:  (1) develop a methodology and schedule for completing assessments of air  cargo vulnerabilities and critical assets, as well as defining, gathering, and  analyzing information on air cargo security breaches, and use the  information resulting from these assessments as a basis for prioritizing the  steps necessary to enhance the security of the nation's air cargo  transportation system;  (2) reexamine the rationale for existing air cargo inspection exemptions,  determine whether such exemptions leave the air cargo system  unacceptably vulnerable to terrorist attack, and make any needed  adjustments to the exemptions;  (3) develop measures to gauge air carrier and indirect air carrier  compliance with air cargo security requirements to assess and address  potential security weaknesses and vulnerabilities;  (4) develop a plan for systematically analyzing the results of air cargo  compliance inspections and use the results to target future inspections and  identify systemwide corrective actions;  (5) assess the effectiveness of enforcement actions, including the use of  civil penalties, in ensuring air carrier and indirect air carrier compliance  with air cargo security requirements; and  (6) ensure that the data to be used in the Freight Assessment System to  identify elevated risk cargo are complete, accurate, and current."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS for review and comment.

Specifically, DHS stated that this assessment will identify weaknesses with  the nation\u2019s air cargo operations that may be exploited by terrorists and  that this assessment will be tied into the department\u2019s work to identify  critical assets.  Completing a vulnerability assessment is an important step  in applying a risk management approach to securing air cargo.  While DHS  identified that the vulnerability assessment will tie into the department\u2019s  criticality work, it has not indicated when a vulnerability or criticality  assessment of air cargo assets will be conducted or whether it intends to  define, gather, and analyze information on air cargo security breaches as  part of this assessment.  Taking these steps would more fully address our  recommendation.", "Concerning our recommendation to reexamine the rationale for existing  air cargo inspection exemptions, DHS stated that it is already in  consultation with industry stakeholders regarding reevaluating current  cargo inspection exemptions as it designs and develops the Freight  Assessment System, and will soon launch a broad-based review of current  air cargo policies and processes.  While conducting such a review may  provide useful information on security processes and policies that need to  be improved, it is important that the exemptions specifically be reviewed  to determine whether they leave the air cargo system unacceptably  vulnerable to terrorist attack.  This assessment, as well as any resulting  adjustments to the exemptions, should be completed as soon as practical  and should not be exclusively tied to the design and development of the  Freight Assessment System. Taking this step would more fully address our  recommendation.", "In addressing our recommendation to develop measures to gauge air  carrier and indirect air carrier compliance with air cargo security  requirements, DHS stated that TSA is committed to focusing compliance  inspection resources on regulated parties that have greater security  weaknesses and vulnerabilities and will enhance current efforts to gauge  air carrier and indirect air carrier compliance with air cargo security  requirements.  Although these efforts should help TSA in performing its  oversight responsibilities, developing specific performance measures to  gauge air carrier and indirect air carrier compliance with air cargo security  requirements will be important to fulfilling the agency\u2019s oversight  commitment.  Taking such action would more fully address the intent of  this recommendation.", "Regarding our recommendation to develop a plan for systemically  analyzing the results of air cargo compliance inspections, DHS stated that  TSA has taken steps to compile information results from past compliance  inspections and will analyze the results of its inspection activities to target  future inspections and develop systematic and localized corrective action  as appropriate.  In addition, DHS stated that TSA recently formed an  advisory group to assist in developing the agency\u2019s annual compliance  work plan which will identify and direct further inspection efforts. If  properly implemented, these actions should address the intent of this  recommendation.", "Concerning our recommendation to assess the effectiveness of  enforcement actions to ensure air carrier and indirect air carrier  compliance with air cargo security requirements, DHS stated that TSA will  use compliance inspection results generated by the PARIS database, in  addition to reviewing formal enforcement actions and adjudications  rendered through the legal process, to assess enforcement action  effectiveness.  Developing specific details on how compliance inspection  results will be evaluated to determine the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s  enforcement actions will be necessary for the agency to ensure that these  actions result in increased air carrier and indirect air carrier compliance  with air cargo security requirements.", "With regard to our recommendation to ensure that the data to be used in  the Freight Assessment System to identify elevated risk cargo are  complete, accurate, and current, DHS stated that TSA is developing a plan  to ensure the integrity of all data that will be used in the Freight  Assessment System.

(3) What are TSA's plans for enhancing air  cargo security, and what financial, operational, and other challenges do  TSA and industry stakeholders face in implementing these plans?", "To answer these questions, we interviewed TSA headquarters officials  responsible for managing the agency\u2019s air cargo security program. We also  interviewed headquarters\u2019 officials at the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s (DHS) U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Federal  Bureau of Investigation, and the United States Postal Service to obtain  information about their role in air cargo security.  In addition, we  interviewed 48 air cargo industry stakeholders, including officials  representing 7 air carriers, 4 indirect air carriers, 12 airport authorities, 16  associations representing airport operators, air carrier pilots, indirect air  carriers, passenger air carriers, all-cargo air carriers, law enforcement  agencies, and 9 air cargo security consultants and experts. The majority of  these industry stakeholders participated in the Aviation Security Advisory  Committee working groups that developed recommendations for  enhancing air cargo security. We also conducted site visits at 12 United  States commercial airports. Because we selected a nonprobability sample  of airports, the results from these visits cannot be generalized to other U.S.  commercial airports. During our site visits, we met with Federal Security  Directors and inspections staff at each airport and observed pilot testing  of air cargo inspection technology, including explosive detection systems  at select airports. We also met with CBP officials at 4 of the airports we  visited. In addition, we met with airport authorities at each airport we  visited and interviewed air carrier and indirect air carrier officials at  several airports we visited. Specifically, we interviewed officials from four  passenger and three all-cargo air carriers. To gain an understanding of  current and planned air cargo security requirements, we reviewed air  cargo security-related laws and regulations as well as TSA's air cargo  security strategic plan and proposed air cargo security rule. Moreover, we  reviewed and analyzed stakeholders' comments to TSA's proposed rule.  We also reviewed reports on air cargo security previously issued by GAO,  the Congressional Research Service, the Federal Aviation Administration,  and the Department of Transportation Inspector General. To determine  the amount of air cargo transported and the revenue that major, national,  and large regional air carriers received from transporting air cargo for the  year 2004, we obtained and reviewed information from TSA and the  Department of Transportation's Bureau of Transportation Statistics.", "To determine the extent to which TSA has used a risk management  approach to guide decisions on securing air cargo, we compared a  synthesis of government requirements and best practices that represents  GAO's risk management approach with TSA's efforts to implement such an  approach. Specifically, we focused on the strategic planning and  objectives and risk assessment elements of the risk management  framework. To identify the extent to which TSA's air cargo strategic goals  and objectives support broader departmental and agency strategic goals  and objectives, we reviewed and analyzed Department of Homeland  Security and TSA strategic planning documents, including TSA's Air Cargo  Strategic Plan. Regarding TSA's efforts to assess risk, we reviewed threat  assessments prepared by TSA in 2004 and 2005. We did not assess the  quality of the threat assessments completed. To obtain information on  how threat information is shared and TSA's efforts to address threats, we  met with officials from TSA's Transportation Security and Intelligence  Service, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and air cargo industry  stakeholders. We also obtained these stakeholders' views on the  timeliness, specificity, and clarity of threat information TSA disseminates.", "To determine the actions TSA has taken to ensure the security of domestic  air cargo and the factors that may limit their effectiveness, we reviewed  and analyzed TSA security requirements including current air cargo-  related regulations, security directives, and program policies. In addition,  we reviewed the Aviation Security Advisory Working Group's committee's  recommendations to TSA, TSA's air cargo security strategic plan, and  TSA's proposed air cargo security rule to gain an understanding of the  similarities, differences, and weaknesses among these plans. We also  analyzed information on TSA's compliance testing program to determine  the agency's progress in evaluating existing air cargo security  requirements. Further, we reviewed TSA's compliance inspection process  and results to determine air carriers' and indirect air carriers' compliance  with existing air cargo security measures. Specifically, we reviewed TSA's  annual inspection plans for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 and available data  on the results of inspections, including civil penalties, conducted from  November 1, 2001, through January 31, 2005. To determine the percentage  of air cargo transported on passenger and all-cargo air carriers that is  exempt from TSA random inspection requirements, we used industry  estimates that a very small percentage of all cargo carried on passenger  and all-cargo air carriers is inspected. We assumed that passenger and all- cargo air carriers were fully compliant with TSA random inspection  requirements in place as of May 2005.", "To identify TSA's plans for enhancing air cargo security and the financial,  operational, and other challenges TSA and industry stakeholders face in  implementing air cargo security plans, we interviewed TSA and air cargo  industry stakeholders. In our discussions, we obtained their views on the  challenges related to developing and implementing air cargo security  enhancements, including air cargo inspection technologies. We also  reviewed TSA's proposed air cargo security rule and analyzed  stakeholders' comments to the rule to identify stakeholder concerns with  TSA's proposal. To identify the costs of implementing TSA's existing and  additional measures proposed to enhance air cargo, we analyzed TSA and  industry studies, models, and documents outlining the economic cost and  other challenges associated with implementing the proposed security  measures as well as other possible measures. Specifically, we reviewed  TSA's methodology, assumptions, and findings related to cost projections  and economic impacts associated with its proposed enhancements. To  determine how sensitive TSA cost estimates were to various cost  assumptions, we conducted Monte Carlo simulations. We also interviewed  TSA's Director of Regulatory and Economic Analysis, who was  responsible for preparing the economic analysis of the proposed air cargo  security rule.", "To obtain an understanding of TSA's efforts to develop a system to target  and inspect elevated risk cargo, we met with TSA and CBP officials who  are responsible for developing TSA's planned air cargo targeting and  inspection systems.

In addition we reviewed documentation  on CBP's policies and procedures for targeting elevated risk cargo as well  as its automated targeting system. In addition we observed CBP's targeting  efforts at its National Targeting Center. We did not assess the effectiveness  of CBP's targeting efforts. Regarding TSA's research and development to  identify inspection technology, we spoke with officials in TSA's Chief  Technology Office and reviewed TSA's research and development plans,  including the scope, methodology, and implementation time frames and  results of their pilot programs.

Although our initial  reliability testing indicated that there were some inconsistencies in the  data provided by TSA, we were able to resolve most of the discrepancies.  For example, TSA inspection data did not include unique identification  numbers for each inspection. As a result, TSA data could have counted  duplicate inspections. We developed a methodology to count individual  inspections based on entity name, location of the facility, type of  inspection being conducted, inspector conducting the inspection, and the  date of the inspection. Further, we were unable to replicate the  methodology TSA used to group violation topics and to count the number  of violations for each topic in its reporting of high-risk violations from  January 1, 2003, to January 31, 2005, including violations identified as  \"other\" or violations for which no specific topic area was provided.
