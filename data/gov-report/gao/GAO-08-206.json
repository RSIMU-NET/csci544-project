These countries had adopted accrual budgeting more to increase transparency and improve government performance than to increase awareness of long-term fiscal challenges. Accrual budgeting continues to be used in all six countries; Canada and the Netherlands, which use accrual information selectively, considered expanding the use of accruals but thus far have made only limited changes. Since 2000, other countries have considered using accrual budgeting. For example, Denmark and Switzerland began using accrual budgeting on a selective basis. Norway and Sweden, however, rejected accrual budgeting primarily because they believed cash budgeting enables better control over resources. Countries have taken different approaches in the design of their accrual budgets. Regardless of the approach taken, cash information remains important in all the countries for evaluating the government's finances. Other countries' experiences show that accrual budgeting can be useful for recognizing the full costs of certain programs, such as public employee pensions and retiree health, insurance, veterans benefits, and environmental liabilities, that will require future cash resources. However, these other countries do not use accrual budgeting to recognize their long-term fiscal challenges that are primarily driven by public health care and pension programs. Instead, many countries in GAO's study have begun preparing fiscal sustainability reports to help assess these programs in the context of overall sustainability of government finances. European Union members also annually report on longer-term fiscal sustainability. Although no change in measurement or reporting can replace substantive action to meet our longer-term fiscal challenge, GAO believes that better and more complete information on both the full-cost implications of individual decisions and on fiscal sustainability of the government's finances can help."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government\u2019s current financial condition and long-term fiscal  outlook present enormous challenges to the nation\u2019s ability to respond to  emerging forces reshaping American society, the United States\u2019 place in  the world, and the future role of the federal government. Unfortunately,  the federal government\u2019s financial condition and fiscal outlook are worse  than many may understand. In fact, the nation\u2019s fiscal condition has  deteriorated dramatically since 2000. The federal budget has gone from  surplus to deficit and the nation\u2019s major reported long-term fiscal  exposures\u2014a wide range of programs, responsibilities, and activities that  either explicitly or implicitly commit the government to future spending\u2014 have more than doubled.

We also looked at two other countries\u2014Canada and the Netherlands\u2014that  used accrual budgeting more selectively at that time and were considering  expanding the use of accrual budgeting. We reported that these countries  had adopted accrual budgeting more as part of broader public  management reforms to increase transparency and improve government  performance rather than as a way of increasing awareness of their longer- term fiscal challenges. None used accrual budgeting for social insurance  programs.", "We concluded that the current cash- and obligation-based budget in the  United States provides equal or better control than full accrual budgeting,  but that the United States should consider expanding the use of accrual  measurement in the budget to certain areas where it would enhance up- front control, namely federal employee pensions and retiree health,  insurance, and environmental liabilities. For these programs, accrual  measurement would move budgetary recognition earlier to when benefits  are earned or the insured event occurs. However, for most other activities  there is not a significant difference between cash and accrual measures.  Furthermore, the up-front funding requirement under an obligation-based  budget provides policymakers greater control over capital investment.", "Since our 2000 report, these nations have not only gained additional  experience with accrual budgeting but also have begun using other  measures, analyses, and reporting to improve the understanding of  broader long-term fiscal sustainability issues.

All countries in our study that have adopted accruals have  parliamentary systems in which the government is formed by the political  party, or coalition of parties, that have the support of a majority of  Parliament. Many important decisions that are debated during the annual  budget and appropriations process in the Congress of the United States  occur in case study countries before the budget is presented to Parliament  for approval. The Parliaments in the countries we studied regularly enact  the government\u2019s budget without amendment; failure to do so may be  viewed as a lack of confidence in the government.

Policymakers, managers, and the American people rely on it to frame their  understanding of significant choices about the role of the government and  to provide them with information to make decisions about individual  programs and overall fiscal policy. The budget process helps highlight for  policymakers and the public the overall \u201ccost\u201d of government. Since the  budget process also serves as a key point of accountability between  policymakers and managers, the way \u201ccosts\u201d are measured and reported in  the budget can have significant consequences for managerial incentives.  The term \u201ccost\u201d has different meanings in the budget and financial  statements. In the budget, the term \u201ccost\u201d generally refers to the amount of  cash needed during the period. In the financial statements, the term \u201ccost\u201d  means the amount of resources used to produce goods or deliver services  during the period regardless of when cash is used. Therefore, one goal of  accrual budgeting is to report the \u201cfull cost\u201d of government services  provided during the year. The different methods of reporting (e.g., cash,  obligations, or accrual) represent much more than technical means of cost  measurement. They reflect fundamental choices about the information and  incentives provided by the budget.", "Cash-based measurement records receipts and outlays when cash is  received or paid, without regard to when the activity occurs that results in  revenue being earned, resources being consumed, or liabilities being  increased. In comparison, obligation-based budgeting\u2014which is used in  the U.S. federal government\u2014focuses on the legal obligations entered into  during a period regardless of when cash is paid or received and regardless  of when resources acquired are to be received or consumed. Obligation- based budgeting provides an additional level of control over pure cash  budgeting by requiring that federal agencies have statutory authority to  enter into obligations to make outlays of government funds. With limited  exceptions, the amounts to be obligated are measured on a cash or cash- equivalent basis. Therefore, we generally refer to the U.S. federal budget  as \u201ccash based.\u201d", "In contrast to cash- and obligation-based budgeting, accrual budgeting  generally involves aligning budget recognition with the period in which  resources are consumed or liabilities increased, rather than when  obligations are made or cash flows occur. Although accruals can be  measured in a variety of ways, the term accrual budgeting typically has  been used in case study countries to refer to the recording of budgetary  costs based on concepts in financial accounting standards. Thus, accrual- based budgeting generally provides information similar to that found in a  private sector operating statement.", "Choices about the appropriate method of budget reporting are  complicated by the multiplicity of the budget\u2019s uses and users, including  policymakers and managers. The federal budget is simultaneously asked to  provide full information and appropriate incentives for resource  allocation, control over cash, recognition of future commitments, and the  monitoring of performance. Given these multiple and potentially  competing objectives, choices about the method of budget reporting  involve trade-offs. For example, control over spending is greatest if the  budget recognizes the full cash cost at the time the decision is made but  assessing performance and its cost is generally best supported by accrual- based cost information, which recognizes resources as they are used to  produce goods and services. The up-front funding requirement under an  obligation-based budget helps ensure policymakers\u2019 control over the  acquisition of a new building but does not align its cost with its use.  Conversely, accrual budgeting better aligns the cost of the building with  the periods that benefit from its use, but in its simplest form it does not  provide for up-front control over entering a legally binding commitment to  purchase the building. Given the necessary trade-offs, the method of  budget reporting should be selected to meet the primary decision-making  and accountability needs of a governmental system while balancing the  needs of multiple users."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cash and Accrual Measures of the Government\u2019s Annual Fiscal Condition", "paragraphs": ["The federal government reports both cash and accrual measures of its  current finances.

Accordingly, amounts taken from the Financial Report may not be reliable. when cash payments are made. For many program areas, the timing  difference is small but for others the timing differences can amount to  billions of dollars each year. Differences arise when a cost is accrued (and  affects the accrual deficit) in one fiscal year but paid (and affects the cash  deficit) in another fiscal year. The following six areas account for the  largest differences between cash and accrual deficits:    civilian employee benefits,    military employee benefits,    veterans compensation,    environmental liabilities (e.g., cleanup and disposal),   insurance programs, and    capital assets.", "For example, the accrual deficit includes an expense for current  employees\u2019 pension and other retirement benefits, which are earned  during the employee\u2019s working years and are part of the annual cost of  providing government services but not paid until sometime in the future  when the employee retires. The cash budget deficit does not include  retirement benefits earned today, but it does reflect payments made to  current retirees. (These cash payments reflect past accrued expenses.)  The difference between the accrued retirement benefits recognized and  cash payments made during the year is the difference between the accrual  and cash measures due to employee benefits.", "In the year that capital assets such as structures and equipment are  purchased, the budget recognizes the full cash cost to provide decision  makers with the information and incentives to make efficient decisions at  the only time that they can control the cost. Specifically, budget authority  for the asset\u2019s full cash cost must generally be provided up front before the  asset can be purchased. The full cash cost of a capital asset is recorded as  an outlay and included in the cash budget deficit when the asset is paid  for. However, under the accrual basis of accounting used in the financial  statements, the cash cost of the asset is initially recorded on the balance  sheet. The cash cost of the asset is then spread over its expected useful  life to match the asset\u2019s cost with its use. Therefore, each year the accrual  deficit only reflects one year\u2019s worth of the cash cost, called depreciation  expense.", "We have previously noted that while both cash and accrual measures of  the government\u2019s overall finances are informative, neither measure alone  provides a full picture. For example, the unified budget deficit provides  information on borrowing needs and current cash flow, but does not  measure the amount of resources used to provide goods or services in the  current year. While the accrual deficit provides information on resources  used in the current year, it does not provide information on how much the  government has to borrow in the current year to finance government  activities. Nor does it provide information about the timing of payments  and receipts, which can be very important. Therefore, just as investors  need income statements, statements of cash flow, and balance sheets to  understand a business\u2019s financial condition, both cash and accrual  measures are important for understanding the government\u2019s financial  condition.", "Although a more complete picture of the government\u2019s fiscal stance today  and over time comes from looking at both the cash and accrual measures  than from looking at either alone, even the two together do not provide  sufficient information on our future fiscal challenges. In addition to  considering the federal government\u2019s current financial condition, it is  critical to look at other measures of the long-term fiscal outlook of the  federal government. While there are various ways to consider and assess  the long-term fiscal outlook, any analysis should include more than just  the obligations and costs recognized in the budget and financial  statements. It should take account of the implicit promises embedded in  current policy and the timing of these longer-term obligations and  commitments in relation to the resources available under various  assumptions. For example, while the cash and accrual measures showed  improvement between fiscal year 2005 and fiscal year 2007, our long-term  fiscal outlook did not change. In fact, the U.S. government\u2019s total reported  liabilities, net social insurance commitments, and other fiscal exposures  continue to grow and total more than $52 trillion, representing  approximately four times the nation\u2019s total output, or gross domestic  product (GDP), in fiscal year 2007, up from about $20 trillion, or two times  GDP in fiscal year 2000 (see table 1).", "Another way to assess the U.S. government\u2019s long-term fiscal outlook and  the sustainability of federal programs is to run simulations of future  revenues and spending for all federal programs, based on a continuation of  current or proposed policy. Long-term simulations by GAO, the  Congressional Budget Office, and others show that we face large and  growing structural deficits driven primarily by rising health care costs and  known demographic trends. As shown in figure 2, GAO\u2019s long-term  simulations\u2014which are neither forecasts nor predictions\u2014continue to  show ever-increasing long-term deficits resulting in a federal debt level  that ultimately spirals out of control. The timing of deficits and the  resulting debt buildup varies depending on the assumptions used, but  under either optimistic (\u201cBaseline Extended\u201d) or more realistic  assumptions (\u201cAlternative simulation\u201d), the federal government\u2019s current  fiscal policy is unsustainable.", "One summary measure of the long-term fiscal challenge is called \u201cthe  fiscal gap.\u201d The fiscal gap is the amount of spending reduction or tax  increases that would be needed today to meet some future debt target. To  keep debt as a share of GDP at or below today\u2019s ratio under our  Alternative simulation would require spending cuts or tax increases equal  to 7.5 percent of the entire economy each year over the next 75 years, or a  total of about $54 trillion in present value terms. To put this in perspective,  closing the gap would require an immediate and permanent increase in  federal tax revenues of more than 40 percent or an equivalent reduction in  federal program spending (i.e., in all spending except for interest on the  debt held by the public, which cannot be directly controlled).", "As demonstrated by these various measures, our nation is on an  unsustainable fiscal path. This path increasingly will constrain our ability  to address emerging and unexpected budgetary needs and will increase  the burdens that will be faced by future generations.

The Dutch government decided  against moving the governmentwide budget to an accrual basis in 2001.

These took time to work out and  refinements continue. Some countries in our study sought to put the  government\u2019s financial reporting and budgeting on the same basis and to  make them comparable to the private sector. In all, three of the six  countries in our 2000 report and Denmark said that the technical  standards used in the budget were substantially based on private-sector  accounting standards. Only Canada and Switzerland said the technical  standards were based on public sector accounting standards. Three  countries\u2014Australia, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom\u2014reported  that the standards used for aggregate measures were based on national  accounting standards (similar to the national income and product  accounts in the United States) set by an international organization (e.g.,  the International Monetary Fund\u2019s Government Finance Statistics or the  European System of Accounts).", "Some countries in our study thought that adopting standards and concepts  developed by independent bodies was important. While both cash and  accrual accounting can be subject to gaming, some believe that accrual  accounting in particular opens up the opportunity for manipulation. Three  countries responded that a commission of experts outside of government  developed the standards. Other countries, however, said that although  their standards were based on independent standards, the finance ministry  or bureau of statistics has the ultimate responsibility for developing  standards. In these countries, accounting standards were generally not  adopted intact from an independent entity. For example, Switzerland\u2019s  accrual budgeting system is designed to be closely aligned with the  international public sector accounting standards (IPSAS), but there were  some deviations from IPSAS for constitutional reasons such as compliance  with the cash-based balanced budget requirement. Also, for practical  reasons, Switzerland does not capitalize defense investments, which is  required under IPSAS.", "Besides developing the accounting standards to be used in the budget, a  key challenge when switching to accrual budgeting, particularly for  countries that choose to treat capital on an accrual basis (i.e., to capitalize  assets and record them on the balance sheet) and provide funding for  noncash depreciation costs, is to ensure that the recorded value of the  capital asset is as accurate as possible. The value of the capital asset is  used to calculate annual depreciation costs and in turn fund future capital  acquisitions (replacements). If an agency overvalued its assets, it could be  difficult to reduce the level of assets once accrual budgeting is  implemented because the excess value represents a source of funding for  the agency in the form of depreciation. On the flipside, if assets were  undervalued, they may not provide good information on the cost of  maintaining or replacing the asset. In 2004, for example, the New Zealand  government purchased the nation\u2019s rail network for only NZ$1. Officials  with whom we spoke said the NZ$1 value did not yield good information  about annual depreciation (maintenance) costs. Therefore the New  Zealand government revalued the network at NZ$10.3 billion in 2006; this  revaluation led to an increase in the New Zealand government\u2019s net worth.  More importantly, the annual operating balance used in the budget now  reflects the associated depreciation costs.", "In Australia, the government thought that capitalizing assets would lead to  a better understanding of what is owned and what would be needed in the  future. However, an Australian official said departments still request  supplementary funding to replace old assets. An Australian official said  that this may be because some departments were not fully funded for all  capitalized assets in their opening balance sheets during the move to  accrual budgets. It could also be because new asset purchases are not  identical to the assets they replace or because agencies did not have  sufficient assets to carry out their goals in the first place.", "Asset identification and valuation were cumbersome and time-consuming  efforts for the countries that chose to capitalize assets. Indeed, one of the  reasons that Iceland decided against capitalizing assets was the difficulty it  would have faced identifying and agreeing on the asset values. Valuing  assets poses special problems in the public sector since it owns unique  assets such as heritage assets (e.g., museums and national parks) and  defense assets (e.g., weapons and tanks). By nature, heritage assets are  generally not marketable. Their cost is often not determinable or relevant  to their significance and they may have very long life cycles (e.g., hundreds  of years). Although the recognition issues associated with heritage assets  are challenging, these assets are generally not very significant in terms of  the overall effect on fiscal finances. As a result, valuing heritage assets  may be seen as not worth the effort. Indeed, of all the countries we  reviewed, only Australia and New Zealand capitalize all assets. The other  countries exclude unique government assets such as highways, bridges,  national parks, historical buildings, and military assets.", "The most common approaches for valuing assets are historical cost and  fair value. (Fair value is usually the same as market value; in the absence  of reliable market values, replacement cost is often used.) Five of seven  countries in our study that measure capital assets on an accrual basis use  fair or market value. Only two\u2014Canada and Denmark\u2014use historical  cost. Use of market value relies on professional judgments to assess values  and the values can fluctuate sharply between reporting periods. Although  historical cost is based on a verifiable acquisition price and does not  fluctuate, the reported amounts may not reflect the current value of the  asset. Furthermore, it is often very difficult to estimate the original costs  of government assets that are hundreds of years old or for which cost  records have not been maintained."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing Reliable Financial Data Is Seen as a Prerequisite to Accrual Budgeting in Some Countries", "paragraphs": ["We have reported that enhancing the use of performance and \u201cfull-cost\u201d  information in budgeting is a multifaceted challenge that must build on  reliable cost and performance data, among other things. Reliable  financial information was also viewed as important to have before moving  to accrual budgeting in some countries we reviewed. For example, in the  Netherlands, an agency must receive a \u201cclean audit\u201d or an unqualified  audit opinion for the year prior to moving to accrual budgeting and at least  6 months must have been spent in a trial run of the accrual accounting  system. Other criteria must also be met before moving to accrual-based  budgeting and receiving the associated flexibilities including being able to  describe and measure the agency\u2019s products and services. Before moving  to accrual budgeting in New Zealand, a department had to define its broad  classes of outputs, develop an accrual-based system capable of monthly  and annual reporting, and develop a cost-allocation system to allocate all  input costs including depreciation and overhead to outputs and provide  assurance it had an adequate level of internal controls. There was not,  however, a requirement for an unqualified opinion for the agency.", "Accrual budgeting can also lead to improvements in financial information.

For example, if a program purchases a large amount of equipment in one  year, it will appear costly under cash accounting, but under accrual  accounting, only a proportion of the equipment\u2019s cost in the form of  depreciation would be shown in that year. Accrual measures experience  volatility for other reasons such as changes in the value of assets and  liabilities or changes in assumptions (e.g., interest rates, inflation, and  productivity) used to estimate future payments.", "Because the accrual-based operating results can be volatile due to events  outside the government\u2019s control, New Zealand generally does not use it as  a measure of the government\u2019s short-term fiscal stewardship. For example,  under New Zealand\u2019s accrual-based accounting standards, most assets are  revalued at least every 3 years. New Zealand uses fair value, which is  usually the same as market value when there is an active market. As noted  above, market values tend to fluctuate between reporting periods. The  changing market values can cause swings in the reported accrual-based  operating results because such changes are reflected as revenue or cost in  the year revalued. Therefore, changes in operating results may reflect not  a fundamental change to the government\u2019s finances but rather changes in  the value of assets or liabilities that do not affect the government\u2019s  financing in the current period. Fluctuations can also result from annual  changes in the value of liabilities when there are deviations between actual  experience and the actuarial assumptions used or changes in actuarial  assumptions. The liabilities for New Zealand\u2019s government pension and  insurance programs, for example, fluctuate from year to year partly due to  changes in the underlying assumptions such as interest rates and  inflation. To deal with this, the New Zealand Treasury removes  revaluations and other movements that do not reflect the underlying  financing of government from its operating balance. It is this measure\u2014 the Operating Balance Excluding Revaluations and Accounting Changes  (OBERAC)\u2014that has been the focus of policy debates in New Zealand  since about 2001.", "More recently the New Zealand Treasury shifted its focus to a new  measure\u2014Operating Balance Excluding Gains and Losses (OBEGAL).  Gains and losses can result when the value of an asset or liability differs  from the value booked on the balance sheet. If the government sells an  asset and the sales price equals book value, there is no gain or loss,  because a cash inflow equal to book value is the exchange of one asset for  another of equal recorded value. However, if the sales price is more or less  than the book value of the property, the difference is reflected as a gain or  loss. New Zealand set up a fund to partially prefund future superannuation  expenses. This fund reports gains and losses on its investments. Because  the current government wishes to retain the investment returns in the  fund, beginning with the 2007 budget the government has shifted its focus  to the OBEGAL to ensure the government is meeting its fiscal objectives.

The full cost of government is the focus of the operating  budget rather than the immediate cash requirement. The downside of this  approach is that control of cash and capital acquisitions to replace assets  can become challenging. If an agency is given cash to fund depreciation  expense, there is a risk that agencies may use the funds to cover other  expenses. Similarly, Parliament may lose control over the acquisition of  capital assets since it will have funded them through depreciation  provided in previous years.", "To address these concerns, countries have implemented cash management  policies and specific controls over capital acquisitions. For example, like  Australia and New Zealand, the United Kingdom initially provided funding  for the full cost of programs, outputs, or outcomes with the thought that it  would generate efficiencies. Over time, however, United Kingdom  Treasury officials said they became concerned that some departments  were shifting noncash expenses to cash expenses, which adversely  affected the government\u2019s borrowing requirement. As a result, the United  Kingdom has imposed controls on cash. Departments\u2019 budgets now  include both the amount of the full accrual costs and the cash required.

An unsustainable condition exists when  demographic and other factors are projected to place significant pressures  on future generations and government finances over the long term and  result in a growing imbalance between revenues and expenditures.", "Four of six case study countries produce reports on long-term (i.e., more  than 10 years) fiscal sustainability. The Netherlands first issued a report on  the long term in 2000. Both the United Kingdom and Australia followed,  issuing their first reports in 2002. New Zealand issued its first report in  2006. Of our case study countries, only Canada and Iceland currently do  not issue long-term fiscal sustainability reports. However, Canada is  planning to issue a comprehensive fiscal sustainability and  intergenerational report in the near future. Of our limited review  countries, Norway reported that it has traditionally provided Parliament  reports on long-term budget projections as well as fiscal sustainability  analyses. Further, Switzerland is planning to issue a long-term fiscal  sustainability report in early 2008.", "The European Commission is also increasing its focus on the fiscal  sustainability of the EU member states, including the Netherlands, United  Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden, as part of the Stability and Growth Pact  (SGP). The SGP, an agreement by EU member states on how to conduct,  facilitate, and maintain their Economic and Monetary Union requirements,  requires member states to submit Stability or Convergence Reports, which  are used by the European Council to survey and assess the member\u2019s  public finances. The guidelines for the content of these reports were  changed in 2005 to include a chapter with long-term projections of public  finances and information on the country\u2019s strategies to ensure the  sustainability of public finances. The European Commission uses this  information to annually assess and report on the long-term sustainability  of all EU members, including consideration of quantitative measures (e.g.,  primary balance, debt-to-GDP) and qualitative considerations of other  factors, such as structural reforms undertaken and reliability of the  projections. Such reporting includes an assessment of the sustainability of  member countries\u2019 finances, policy guidance to EU members to improve  sustainability, and discussion of the effect of significant policy changes on  the sustainability of member countries\u2019 finances. The Commission  released its first comprehensive assessment on the long-term sustainability  of public finances in October 2006.", "Whether a government will be able to meet its commitments when they  arise in the future may depend on how well it reduces its debt today so the  burden does not fall entirely to future generations. Countries may have  different assumptions about what is sustainable but one aim is to keep  debt at \u201cprudent levels.\u201d Several of our case study countries have set debt- to-GDP targets in their efforts to address fiscal sustainability issues. For  example, Canada wants to reduce its net debt (i.e., financial liabilities less  financial assets) for all levels of government to zero by 2021. Similarly,  New Zealand\u2019s current objective is to reduce debt to around 20 percent of  GDP over the next decade. The United Kingdom, under its sustainable  investment rule, requires that public sector net debt is to be maintained  below 40 percent of GDP over the economic cycle.

Common approaches to assessing fiscal  sustainability include cash-flow measures of revenue and spending and  public debt as a percent of GDP as well as summary measures of fiscal  imbalance and fiscal gap (see table 2). Each measure provides a different  perspective on the nation\u2019s long-term financing. Cash-flow measures are  useful for showing the timing of the problem and the key drivers, while  measures such as the fiscal imbalance or fiscal gap are useful for showing  the size of action needed to achieve fiscal sustainability. Each measure has  limitations by itself and presents an incomplete picture. Therefore, most  countries use more than one measure to assess fiscal sustainability.", "Two measures\u2014the fiscal gap and fiscal imbalance\u2014show the size of the  problem in terms of action needed to meet a particular budget constraint.  Changes in these measures over time are useful for showing improvement  or deterioration in the overall fiscal condition. The fiscal gap shows the  change in revenue or noninterest spending needed immediately and  maintained every year to achieve a particular debt target at some point in  the future. The fiscal imbalance (or intertemporal budget constraint) is  similar to the fiscal gap but the calculation assumes all current debt is paid  off by the end of the period. These summary measures can also be  calculated in terms of the adjustment needed in the future if adjustment is  delayed (which would increase its size). The change in policy can be in the  form of adjustments to taxes, spending, or both. A positive fiscal gap or  imbalance implies that fiscal policy should be tightened (i.e., spending cut  or taxes raised) while a negative fiscal gap or imbalance implies that fiscal  policy could be loosened (i.e., spending increased or taxes reduced). A  fiscal gap or imbalance implies potential harm to future generations if  action to make public finances sustainable is deferred thus requiring more  budgetary actions (or higher interest costs) in the future than today. It  should be noted that a fiscal gap or imbalance of zero over a finite period  does not mean that current fiscal policy is sustainable forever. For  example, debt could still be rising faster than GDP at the end of the period.  Another limitation to these summary measures is that by definition they do  not provide information on timing of receipts and outlays, which is  important.", "Most of the countries we studied used share of GDP measures rather than  present value dollar measures. In part this is to avoid the situation in  which a small change in the discount rate assumption leads to large swings  in the dollar-based sustainability measures. Present value dollar measures  are highly sensitive to assumptions about the discount rate. An increase of  0.5 percentage points in the discount rate used to calculate the U.S. fiscal  gap reduces the present value of the fiscal gap from $54.3 trillion to $47.7  trillion; in contrast such a change results in a smaller proportional change  to the gap as a share of GDP from 7.5 to 7.3 percent. Also, since the  numbers can be so large, it may be difficult for policymakers and the  general public to understand without placing the numbers in context of  the resources available in the economy to finance the fiscal gap."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reports Stem from Law and Political Commitments", "paragraphs": ["Fiscal sustainability reports are required by law in two countries\u2014 Australia and New Zealand.

The United Kingdom calculates  the intertemporal budget constraint over an infinite time horizon, which  poses a high degree of uncertainty.

However, the fiscal gap was more sensitive to changes in the interest  rate assumption.

Trends  in health care costs and utilization underlying estimates of federal  employee postretirement health benefits have also been volatile.

Not all environmental liabilities have been identified and cleanup and  disposal technologies are not currently available for all sites.
