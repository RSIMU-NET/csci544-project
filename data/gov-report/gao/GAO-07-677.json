From fiscal years 2003 through 2006, the United States spent about $5.1 billion to rebuild the oil and electricity sectors. The United States also spent an additional $3.8 billion in Iraqi funds on these sectors. However, Iraq will need billions of additional dollars to rebuild these sectors. The Iraqi government and donors represent important sources of potential funding. However, the oil and electricity ministries have encountered difficulties spending capital improvement budgets because of weaknesses in budgeting and procurement practices and major security challenges. Moreover, Iraq has not made full use of potential international contributions. It is also unclear what additional financial commitments, if any, will be provided to Iraq's oil and electricity sectors as part of a new international compact. Despite 4 years of effort and the substantial resources expended, production in both sectors has consistently fallen below U.S. program goals. In addition, State's estimate of Iraq's oil production levels may be overstated due to inadequate metering that does not allow precise measurement of crude oil production. The Iraqi government projects that it will be able to meet the demand for electricity in 2009. However, these projections assume that the Ministry of Electricity will be assured of the stable supply of the fuel needed for electricity generation, which has been lacking due to poor coordination between the oil and electricity ministries. A variety of security, corruption, legal, and planning challenges have impeded U.S. and Iraqi efforts to restore Iraq's oil and electricity sectors. The challenging security environment and insufficient protection efforts have continued to place workers and infrastructure at risk. Corruption, smuggling, and other illicit activities result in revenue losses and low cost recovery. Furthermore, the Iraqi government has difficulty attracting foreign investment because, according to the World Bank, it lacks an adequate legal framework, including comprehensive hydrocarbon legislation that would govern distribution of future oil revenues and granting of exploration rights. Finally, although the oil and electricity sectors are mutually dependent, the Iraqi government lacks integrated planning for these sectors, which has led to inefficient management of the country's resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Iraqi government inherited an oil and electricity infrastructure that  was greatly deteriorated due to the previous regime\u2019s neglect, international  sanctions, and years of conflict, looting, and vandalism.

In September 1980, Iraq invaded Iran and production levels  plummeted. Although the Iran-Iraq War continued until 1988, production  levels grew steadily after 1983, peaking at 2.9 million barrels per day in  1989. The following year, Iraq invaded Kuwait, which began the Gulf War.  In January 1991, the United States and coalition partners began a counter- offensive (Operation Desert Storm). Crude oil production once again  dropped precipitously and remained relatively low from 1990 to 1996,  while Iraq was under UN sanctions. Under the UN Oil for Food program,  Iraqi crude oil production began to rebound, peaking at an annual average  of 2.6 mbpd in 2000.

The CPA also committed to improving  the electricity sector in Iraq and stated that CPA partners would provide  reliable, stable, and predictable power to the people and enterprises of  Iraq by rebuilding generation, transmission, and distribution networks, as  well as system control and communications; by establishing a sound  regulatory framework for the electricity sector; and by ensuring improved  security for infrastructure.", "In developing its reconstruction plan, the CPA made several assumptions  that never materialized. The first and most critical assumption was that  there would be a permissive security environment to conduct  reconstruction activities. Second, the CPA assumed that U.S.-funded  reconstruction activities would help restore Iraq\u2019s essential services\u2014 including oil production and electricity generation\u2014to prewar levels. The  CPA assumed that the Iraqi government and the international community  would help finance Iraq\u2019s developmental needs and that Iraqi oil revenues  could help pay for reconstruction costs. The CPA estimated that Iraq\u2019s oil  production would increase to about 2.8 to 3 mbpd by the end of 2004.

DOD has identified areas in which the government of Iraq may seek  its help, including the procurement of fuel, electrical power generation,  water projects, and security upgrades.

State also set an  eventual crude oil production goal of 2.8 mbpd in March 2006. Production  capacity differs from actual production. Production capacity is the  maximum amount of production a country can maintain over a period of  time. For example, EIA has defined production capacity as the maximum  amount of production that (1) could be brought online within 30 days and  (2) sustained for at least 90 days. Since Iraq has been trying to increase its  production of crude oil, we use actual production as an indicator of Iraq\u2019s  production capacity in this report.", "Besides production and export of crude oil, the CPA also established goals  for the production of natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), as  well as the national stocks of refined petroleum products (such as  gasoline) that are used to generate energy by consumers and businesses.  These CPA goals were to increase production capacity of natural gas to  800 million standard cubic feet per day (mscfd); increase production  capacity of LPG to 3,000 tons per day (tpd); and meet demand for benzene  (gasoline), diesel, kerosene, and LPG by building and maintaining their  stock levels at a 15-day supply. However, the 2006 averages did not meet  these goals, as shown in table 3. To increase the stocks of petroleum  products and the availability of these products to consumers, Iraq  legalized the importation of petroleum products by private companies to  supplement its own production and state-owned company imports. For  2006, the IMF estimated that Iraq\u2019s state-owned companies imported about  $2.6 billion of petroleum products. At the recommendation of the IMF, the  Iraqi government has also been reducing subsidies for refined oil products,  which raises the prices consumers pay. In the past, refined oil products in  Iraq have been highly subsidized, which leads to increased demand.  Reduction in domestic demand for refined oil products would allow  additional crude oil to be exported for revenue rather than refined in Iraq.", "Iraq\u2019s crude oil production statistics may overstate Iraq\u2019s oil production.

While  these two data sets follow similar trend lines, EIA\u2019s series is generally  100,000 to 300,000 barrels per day lower than IRMO\u2019s statistics. At an  average price of $50 per barrel, this is a discrepancy of $5 to $15 million  per day. Figure 6 shows these two data sets over the time period (June  2003 to December 2006) for which data were available for both. According  to EIA, several factors may account for the discrepancy. One known factor  is the lack of storage facilities for crude oil in Iraq. With limited storage,  the crude oil in Kirkuk that cannot be either processed by refineries or  exported (both of which have been hampered by limited refinery capacity  and sabotage to oil pipelines) is re-injected into the ground after the  natural gas liquids are removed. Another factor affecting the discrepancy  may be differences in the frequency and timing of the data. IRMO\u2019s data is  reported daily in real time, while EIA produces monthly data that has been  reviewed and corroborated from several sources. This lag in reporting and  longer time period may allow analysts to address inconsistencies such a  double-counting and reinjection. In addition, IRMO regularly reports on  sabotage and interdictions to crude oil pipelines and other disruptions in  the crude oil production process. Also, under Saddam Hussein, Iraq had a  history of diverting crude oil production to circumvent UN sanctions.   Therefore, it is possible that corruption, theft, and sabotage may also be  factors in the discrepancy.", "However, identifying, measuring, and resolving these factors without  precise metering is more difficult. Without knowing precisely how much  crude oil is being produced and transported along the extensive network  of pipelines, refineries, and export facilities, the government is limited in  its ability to identify potential weaknesses in the system. According to an  IRMO oil advisor, meters are in place at many locations but are not usable  in many instances due to the difficulties in obtaining needed replacements  and spare parts. Without comprehensive metering, crude oil production  must be estimated using less precise means, such as estimating flow  through pipelines, and relying on reports from on-site personnel rather  than an automated system that could be verified.", "An improved metering system has been a U.S. and international donor  priority since early 2004 but has faced delays in its implementation. In  1996, the UN first cited the lack of oil metering when Iraq was under UN  sanctions. In 2004, the International Advisory and Monitoring Board  (IAMB) for the Development Fund for Iraq recommended the expeditious  installation of metering equipment, in accordance with standard oil  industry practices. According to the IAMB, in June 2004, the CPA had  approved a budget to replace, repair, and calibrate the metering system on  Iraq\u2019s oil pipeline network and to contract the metering of Iraq\u2019s oil  resources. However, the oil metering contract was not completed due to  security and technical issues. In June 2006, the IAMB reported that the  Iraqi government had entered into an agreement with Shell Oil Company  to serve as a consultant for the Ministry of Oil on metering and calibrating  that would include the establishment, within the next 2 years, of a  measuring system for the flow of oil, gas, and related products within Iraq  and export and import operations. The U.S. government is assisting in this  effort by rebuilding one component of the metering system in the Al- Basrah oil port\u2014Iraq\u2019s major export terminal\u2014and expects the project to  be complete by June 2007.", "The collection of reliable statistics is also complicated by the challenging  security environment and the numerous entities involved in compiling  countrywide production data (from wellheads, through pipelines, to final  uses in refineries or exports). Iraq\u2019s current oil operations are divided  among several state-owned oil companies that have responsibility for  operations. Therefore, IRMO, which is responsible for producing aggregate  data on Iraq\u2019s production levels, must collect daily reports from the  Ministry of Oil and each of the state-owned enterprises and combine them  into a countrywide total.

For 2006, demand averaged 8,180 mw exceeding the  average peak electricity supply of 4,280 mw by about 3,950 mw. According  to U.S. agency officials, demand for electricity has been stimulated by a  growing economy and a surge in consumer purchases of appliances and  electronics. In addition, electricity is subsidized in Iraq, which leads to  increased demand. If the Ministry of Electricity\u2019s master plan for 2006 to  2015 to rehabilitate and expand the national grid is implemented, the  ministry estimates that Iraq will be able to meet its projected demand for  electricity in 2009. However, these projections assume a stable supply of  fuel for electricity generation, which has been lacking in the past due to  poor coordination between the ministries. The projections are also based  on the assumption that the Ministry of Electricity will be able to mobilize  funding for projects listed in the Master Plan and properly manage,  maintain, and operate its electricity infrastructure.", "Moreover, the widespread use of off-grid electrical generators to meet  unmet demand from the national grid makes it difficult to measure total  demand and the progress made toward meeting that demand. According to  USAID, it is estimated that neighborhood generators provide an additional  2,000 mw per day. However, electricity usage from neighborhood  generators cannot be accurately measured, according to IRMO officials.  Likewise, when measuring production, it is important to note that the U.S.  and Iraqi goal is to supply homes from the national grid rather than from  the inefficient use of small household and neighborhood generators.

U.S. officials also report that rebuilding of the  electricity sector has been slowed by the lack of training for plant  workers, inadequate spare parts, and an ineffective asset management and  parts inventory system. Electricity plants are sometimes operated beyond  their recommended limits and use poor-quality fuels that rapidly  deteriorate parts, involve longer maintenance downtimes, and increase  pollution. According to U.S. government officials, Iraq needs to develop  cleaner and more reliable sources of natural gas for its generators  supporting the national grid. Currently, Iraq\u2019s fuel supply does not meet  demand and its quality is inconsistent. For example, of the 35 natural gas  turbines the U.S. government installed in power generation plants, 16 are  using diesel, crude, or heavy fuel oil due to the lack of natural gas and  lighter fuels. As a result, maintenance cycles are reportedly three times as  frequent and three times as costly. Poor-quality fuels also decrease the  power output of the turbines by up to 50 percent and can result in  equipment failure and damage, according to U.S. and Iraqi power plant  officials. The U.S. government also estimates that Iraq is flaring enough  natural gas to generate at least 4,000 mw of electrical power. Because of  natural gas shortages, diesel has to be imported at a cost of about $1.2  billion a year, thus straining economic resources.", "The U.S. government is providing some assistance to address these  shortfalls.

GRD noted that if the lines and plant were in operation  today, an additional 500,000 barrels per day would be produced in  northern Iraq. Major electrical transmission and fuel lines also have been  repeatedly sabotaged, cutting power to other parts of the country.

DOD provided technical comments, which we incorporated where  appropriate.", "The Department of State provided written comments, which are reprinted  in appendix II. State also provided us with technical comments and  suggested wording changes that we incorporated as appropriate. In  commenting on a draft of this report, State agreed that all the steps we  included in our recommendations are necessary to improve Iraq\u2019s energy  sector but stated that these actions are the direct responsibility of the  government of Iraq, not the Department of State, any U.S. agency, or the  international donor community. We recognize that these actions are  ultimately the responsibility of the Iraqi government and thus recommend  that the Department of State work with the Iraqi government to  accomplish these actions. Further, we believe that our recommendations  to the State Department are valid given the billions of dollars that the  United States has invested in Iraq\u2019s energy sector to date, the U.S.  government\u2019s responsibility to ensure that funds are well spent, and the  influence the United States holds in overseeing Iraq stabilization and  rebuilding efforts. The U.S. government is uniquely positioned to provide  encouragement and assistance in implementing these recommendations  given the resident expertise of the senior IRMO advisors staffed to Iraq\u2019s  oil and electricity ministries. The ministries of oil and electricity have 10  and 18 IRMO advisors, respectively.", "In their written comments, State noted that U.S. agencies are already  undertaking work that complements several of our recommendations. We  acknowledge that State has taken some actions to address these steps, and  we have refined our report language accordingly. However, our  recommendations are still warranted given the lack of progress that has  been made over the last 4 years in achieving U.S. program goals and the  considerable influence that the United States wields in overseeing Iraq  stabilization and rebuilding efforts. Also, some of the State Department  initiatives are relatively new. For example, State commented that an  Energy Fusion Cell composed of the Embassy, Multinational Force-Iraq,  and the Ministries of Oil and Electricity has been formed to craft an  integrated energy strategy but that the practical effectiveness of this effort  will depend on whether it is able to obtain buy-in from the two Iraqi  ministries. However, it is unclear whether this new effort addresses the  key elements of an effective strategy identified in our report, such as  identifying rebuilding priorities, resource needs, stakeholder roles and  responsibilities, and performance measures and milestones. Therefore, our  recommendation for an integrated energy strategy for the oil and  electricity sector is still valid.", "With respect to our recommendation to establish an effective metering  system, State commented that the installation and reading of retail  electricity meters would be difficult in the present security environment  and that the United States is paying for the installation of meters on Iraq\u2019s  oil export terminal. We agree with State\u2019s comment and refined our  recommendation to focus on the need to improve Iraq\u2019s oil metering  system. However, the oil metering project for Iraq\u2019s oil export terminal  that State highlighted in its comments is only one of the elements of an  effective metering system. Iraq still lacks a comprehensive oil metering  system to reliably measure the outputs of its crude oil production and  refinery operations. This vulnerability has existed for several years; in  2004, a UN body recommended that such a metering system be  expeditiously installed. Thus, we retained our recommendation for  installing an effective oil metering system.", "Regarding our recommendation to improve the existing legal and  regulatory framework, State commented that U.S. agencies are already  working to improve Iraq\u2019s legal and regulatory frameworks. However,  Iraq\u2019s framework for managing its oil industry and the use of its energy  resources remains undefined after months of contentious Iraqi  government debate. This framework is crucial to Iraq\u2019s efforts to rebuild  its oil-dependent economy. Setting specific benchmarks and assigning  resources to expedite the development of this legislative framework as we  recommended is necessary to encourage progress and focus continued  leadership attention on this issue.", "With respect to our recommendation to develop adequate ministry  budgeting, procurement, and financial management systems, State  commented that teams are working with the Ministries of Oil and  Electricity to address budgeting, procurement, and financial management  issues but acknowledged that the bureaucracy of the Iraqi government is a  hindrance to these efforts. The large unexpended 2006 capital budgets in  Iraq\u2019s oil and electricity ministries that we highlighted in our report also  underscore the need for additional assistance and benchmarks for  developing effective budgeting, procurement, and financial management  systems in Iraq\u2019s oil and electricity ministries.", "Finally, regarding our recommendation to secure funding for Iraq\u2019s future  oil and electricity rebuilding needs, State noted that the International  Compact with Iraq, formally launched in Sharm El-Sheikh on May 3, 2007,  aims to build upon existing mechanisms to provide bilateral donors with  better ways to coordinate their contributions of financial and technical  assistance. However, no supporting details were released on what  additional financial commitments, if any, are being provided to Iraq\u2019s  energy sector as part of this compact. Thus, it is too early to judge the  potential implications of this new coordination arrangement.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees.

As part of this work, we made multiple visits to Iraq and Jordan  during 2006. We conducted our review from January 2006 through March  2007 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. The information on foreign law in this report does not reflect  our independent legal analysis but is based on interviews and secondary  sources.", "To address the amount of U.S. funds that were appropriated, obligated,  and disbursed for the reconstruction of Iraq\u2019s oil and electricity sectors,  we collected funding information from the Department of Defense (DOD),  U.S. Army, Department of State, U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID), and the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA).  Data for U.S.-appropriated funds are as of September 30, 2006. We also  reviewed U.S. agency inspector generals\u2019 reports, Special Inspector  General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR) reports, and other audit agency  reports. Although we have not audited the funding data and are not  expressing our opinion on them, we discussed the sources and limitations  of the data with the appropriate officials and checked them, when  possible, with other information sources. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for broad comparisons in the aggregate, and we  noted limitations at the sector level.", "To address the amount of Iraqi funds used by U.S. agencies to support the  rebuilding of Iraq\u2019s oil and electricity sectors, we relied on CPA  documents, past GAO interviews with the CPA, and reviews of  independent auditor\u2019s reports. To identify sources and uses of  Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) funds for the oil and electricity sectors,  as agreed with U.S. officials, we relied on funding data obtained from  Development Fund for Iraq Statement of Cash and Receipts and  Payments (with Independent Auditor\u2019s Report) reports for January 1,  2004, through December 31, 2005, from the International Monitoring  Advisory Board. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable to  describe the major disbursements from the DFI to the oil and electricity  sectors and noted limitations in reporting as identified in the independent  auditor\u2019s report. For the sources and uses of vested and seized assets, we  relied on CPA and DOD funding data. To determine the reliability of these  data, we examined CPA schedules and relied on past GAO interviews with  CPA officials responsible for the data. We verified results with DOD  officials. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for broad  comparisons in the aggregate, and we noted limitations at the sector level.", "To assess Iraqi budget allotments and expenditures for the oil and  electricity sectors, as well as potential future budget support, we obtained  and assessed Iraqi budget data from the U.S. Department of the Treasury.  We corroborated our analysis and findings with information from other  U.S. agencies, the Iraqi government, and the International Monetary Fund.  While we did not independently verify the precision of the data on Iraq\u2019s  budget execution, we found that they were sufficiently reliable to show  the relative differences in budget execution across Iraq\u2019s ministries and  budget categories (e.g., capital projects versus salaries). Finally, we  obtained oil revenue and pricing data from the Department of State, Iraq  Reconstruction Management Office (IRMO) officials and discussed with  them the collection and preparation of these statistics. We also  corroborated the data with external sources. Data on revenue are based  on U.S. agency estimates that use internationally recognized financial  sources for pricing calculations, such as Bloomberg and Platts. We found  that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of showing trends  in Iraq\u2019s crude oil export revenue and prices.", "To address international assistance for the rebuilding of Iraq\u2019s oil and  electricity sectors, we reviewed documents and met with U.S., Iraqi, and  international donor officials. As agreed with the Department of State,  United Nations (UN), and World Bank officials, we obtained data and  information on multilateral contributions from the UN Development  Programme Iraq Trust Fund and the World Bank Iraq Trust Fund through  the Iraq Reconstruction Fund for Iraq Web site.  As agreed with  Department of State officials, we obtained data and information on  bilateral contributions from their quarterly report to Congress and the  Iraqi Ministry of Planning\u2019s Development Assistance Database (DAD). We  also obtained data and information on bilateral contributions from  international donors, including Japan and the European Union. To assess  the reliability of the data on pledges, commitments, and deposits made by  international donors, we interviewed officials at the Department of State  who are responsible for monitoring the data provided by the IRFFI and  donor nations. We determined that the data on donor commitments and  deposits made to the IRFFI were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  reporting at the sector level. Based on discussions with the Ministry of  Planning, UN, World Bank, and Department of State officials, we  determined that the DAD was incomplete and would not provide accurate  data for reporting purposes. However, according to Department of State  officials, this is the best available source of data and the department uses  this data in their reports to Congress.", "To assess U.S. goals for the electricity and oil sectors, U.S. measures of  progress in achieving these goals, and the planning and status of  reconstruction projects, we reviewed reports and planning documents  obtained from the Department of State\u2019s IRMO and Near East Asia bureau;  DOD\u2019s U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Gulf Region Division (GRD) and  Project Contracting Office, including contractors; USAID; CPA; U.S.  embassy officials in Iraq; International Monetary Fund; the World Bank;  and the UN. We also obtained views from international donors such as  Japan and the European Community. To assess U.S. goals, we reviewed  planning and strategy documents from the CPA and U.S. government,  including the National Strategy for Victory in Iraq; Iraq\u2019s National Strategy  for Development; the MNF-I/U.S. Embassy Baghdad Joint Action  Campaign Plan; and the Department of State\u2019s Quarterly Update to  Congress, 2207 Report, among others. To monitor the status of efforts and  reconstruction projects, we reviewed daily, weekly, and biweekly  reporting from the Department of State, DOD, GRD, and USAID. We  compiled daily data from IRMO to provide summary data on crude oil and  electricity production averages. We discussed and reviewed documents on  goal, metric, data limitations, and project status with GRD, USAID, IRMO,  and international donor officials. IRMO collects its crude oil production  and export data from estimates provided by Iraq\u2019s Ministry of Oil and  state-owned companies that have responsibility for various regions and  parts of the production process. We identified the challenges IRMO faces  in collecting these data, which we discuss in the report, including limited  metering at oil facilities. We also compared crude oil production data from  IRMO to data reported by the Department of Energy, Energy Information  Administration (EIA). We noted a discrepancy between these two data  sets and discussed with EIA officials the reasons for this discrepancy,  which we note in the report. We also examined IRMO data on Iraq\u2019s  national stocks of refined petroleum products, such as gasoline. For  electricity production, IRMO receives data from Iraq\u2019s Ministry of  Electricity based on electricity output from Iraq\u2019s electricity national grid.  It does not include electricity production from local generators. We also  reviewed prior GAO, U.S. agency inspector general, SIGIR, and other audit  agency reports. Based on this analysis, we found the data sufficiently  reliable for identifying production goals in both sectors and whether  actual production is meeting these goals. We report oil and electricity  production data as of December 31, 2006, and reconstruction project  progress data as of March 3, 2007.", "To determine the challenges affecting sector progress, we reviewed and  analyzed U.S., Iraqi, donor government, UN, International Monetary Fund  (IMF), and World Bank reports and data. Over the course of our field work  in Washington, D.C.; Baghdad, Iraq; and Amman, Jordan, we met with  officials from the Department of State, USAID, DOD, the Department of  the Treasury, and the Department of Energy. Over the course of our two  trips to Iraq and Jordan, we met with Iraqi, UN, International Monetary  Fund, World Bank, donor country (Japan and European Union), and  private-sector officials. We observed several embassy meetings and a  donor meeting led by the Iraqi Ministry of Planning and Development. We  also interviewed U.S., Iraqi, and UN officials at a November 2006  electricity conference sponsored by the UN Development Program at the  Dead Sea, Jordan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition, Stephen Lord, Assistant Director; Lynn Cothern; Howard Cott;  Martin De Alteriis; Etana Finkler; Bruce Kutnick; Kathleen Monahan; Mary  Moutsos; Amy Sheller; Jena Sinkfield; and Timothy Wedding made key  contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
