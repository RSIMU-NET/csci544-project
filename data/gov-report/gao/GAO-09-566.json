In addition, the Clinger-Cohen  Act places responsibility for managing IT investments with the heads of  agencies and establishes chief information officers to advise and assist  agency heads in carrying out this responsibility.", "To help carry out its oversight role and assist the agencies in carrying out  their responsibilities, OMB developed its Management Watch List in 2003  and its High-Risk List in 2005 to focus executive attention and to ensure  better planning and tracking of the major IT investments. The Management  Watch List identifies projects at federal agencies that are poorly planned,  i.e., projects with weaknesses in their funding justifications, which are  known as exhibit 300s. Because of the focus on the funding justifications,  projects on the Management Watch List specifically concern the process  by which agencies select projects to invest in. OMB places projects on the  High-Risk List when they require special attention from oversight  authorities and the highest level of agency management. These projects  are not necessarily \u201cat risk\u201d of failure, but may be on the list because of  one or more of the following four reasons:    The agency has not consistently demonstrated the ability to manage  complex projects.", "The project has exceptionally high development, operating, or  maintenance costs, either in absolute terms or as a percentage of the  agency\u2019s total IT portfolio.", "The project is being undertaken to correct recognized deficiencies in the  adequate performance of an essential mission program or function of the  agency, a component of the agency, or another organization.", "Delay or failure of the project would introduce for the first time  unacceptable or inadequate performance or failure of an essential mission  function of the agency, a component of the agency, or another  organization.", "The High-Risk List also includes projects that are performing poorly (i.e.,  high-risk projects with reported performance shortfalls). High-risk  projects are identified as having performance shortfalls if one or more of  the following performance evaluation criteria are not met: (1) establishing  baselines with clear cost, schedule, and performance goals; (2)  maintaining the project\u2019s cost and schedule variances within 10 percent;  (3) assigning a qualified project manager; and (4) avoiding duplication by  leveraging inter-agency and governmentwide investments. Projects on the  High-Risk List, therefore, require disciplined and effective oversight to  ensure that performance shortfalls, if any, are addressed.", "GAO, Information Technology: OMB and Agencies Need to Improve Planning,  Management, and Oversight of Projects Totaling Billions of Dollars, GAO-08-1051T  (Washington, D.C.: July 31, 2008). projects (totaling about $3 billion) were considered both poorly planned  and poorly performing.", "OMB took several steps to address our recommendations to improve the  identification and oversight of Management Watch List and High-Risk List  projects; however, further action is needed, including, for example,  identifying the deficiencies (i.e., performance shortfalls) associated with  the high-risk projects. On April 28, 2009, we testified that the future of the  Management Watch List and High-Risk List was uncertain because OMB  officials stated that they had not decided if the agency plans to continue to  use these lists. We noted that OMB needs to decide if it is going to  continue to use the Management Watch List and High-Risk List and, if not,  that OMB should promptly implement other appropriate mechanisms to  help direct and oversee IT investments in the future.

These challenges can be addressed, in part,  by the use of systematic management processes to select, control, and  evaluate the investments. To further support the implementation of such  processes, we developed an IT investment management (ITIM)  framework for agencies to use. It is based on our research of IT  investment management practices of leading private and public sector  organizations and can be used to determine both the status of an agency\u2019s  current IT investment management capabilities and the additional steps  that are needed to establish more effective processes. The framework  consists of progressive stages of maturity for any given organization  relative to its selection and oversight responsibilities. We have used the  framework in many of our reports, and a number of agencies have  adopted it.", "The ITIM maturity framework cites the establishment of \u201cone or more IT  investment management boards\u201d as a fundamental step in establishing a  mature capital planning process. The framework states that a  departmentwide IT investment review board (IRB) composed of senior  executives from both IT and business units should be responsible for  defining and implementing the department\u2019s IT investment governance  process. This department-level IRB is to provide selection and oversight of  department IT projects to ensure that the department\u2019s portfolio of  projects meets mission needs at expected levels of cost and risk. Selecting  projects involves identifying and analyzing projects\u2019 risks and returns  before committing any significant funds to them and selecting those that  will best support the agency\u2019s mission needs; overseeing projects involves  reviewing the progress of projects against expectations and taking  corrective action when these expectations are not being met.", "To ensure that agencies\u2019 department-level boards are using a disciplined  selection and oversight process, the ITIM framework also states that,  among other things, the department-level board should: select new  investments and reselect ongoing investments; perform regular reviews of  each project\u2019s performance against stated expectations; and receive data  associated with a project\u2019s actual performance (including cost, schedule,  benefit, and risk performance).

The department  disagreed with the statement that the projects reviewed did not receive a  selection or oversight review, stating that they had been selected and  reviewed by the Federal Student Aid\u2019s Executive Leadership Team. In our  report, we have clarified the discussion of these reviews by the Executive  Leadership Team where appropriate. The Department of Education\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix IV.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s Director for Departmental GAO/OIG Liaison Office  agreed with the recommendation to conduct department-level reviews of  the three programs we reviewed and provided evidence of department  Acquisition Review Board reviews for these programs during fiscal year  2008. The department disagreed with the assertion that the department- level review boards were not active in overseeing the three projects we  examined during our review and provided decision memoranda\u2014three of  which we had not been provided before\u2014as evidence of reviews by the  boards in place for 2007, the time period we considered. However, in our  report, we do not state that the department-level boards were not active.  Rather, we note that the department did not provide sufficient evidence of  department-level IRB reviews. We did not change our assessments for the  three projects because the additional documentation received still did not  provide sufficient evidence documenting the 2007 reviews.", "The documentation we have seen from more recent reviews more  completely documents departmental-level IRB reviews and we have noted  this in our report. The department also provided technical comments.

The department also asked that the definition of  high-risk projects reflect the fact that some investments designated as  such are performing within acceptable thresholds but require heightened  awareness and oversight by investment review boards because of their  importance. To address this comment, we have added OMB\u2019s criteria for  designating projects as high-risk to our report background. We did not  make any recommendations to the Department of the Interior. The  Department of the Interior\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix VII.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, the Department of Justice\u2019s  Assistant Attorney General for Administration disagreed with our  recommendation that it ensure its department-level review board include  business unit representation and provided clarification on the role and  responsibilities of the Deputy Attorney General who chairs the board and  on the participation of component executives in the board\u2019s  decisionmaking process. Based on this clarification, we agree that the  board provides adequate business unit representation. We have noted this  change in our report and removed the related recommendation. In its  comments, the department also took issue with our use of the term  \u201cpoorly performing\u201d to characterize the projects we reviewed. We are not  implying as the department states that these projects are \u201cnear failing.\u201d We  have clarified our use of the term in the report and, in the case of the  Sentinel project\u2014which we have reviewed\u2014 acknowledged progress  made in managing the project. The Department of Justice\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix VIII.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, the Department of Labor\u2019s  Assistant Secretary for Administration and Management addressed our  recommendation to ensure that its department-level review board include  business unit representation by acknowledging that the board does not  include senior executives from business units and stating that, while it  believes the executives on the board effectively represented the business  interests of their respective organizations, it will consider appropriate and  efficient steps for including senior executives from business units as part  of the board\u2019s process. The Department of Labor\u2019s comments are reprinted  in appendix IX.", "In e-mail comments on a draft of this report, the Department of  Transportation\u2019s Director of Audit Relations addressed our  recommendation to ensure that the projects we identified as not having  received department-level IRB selection or oversight reviews receive these  reviews by stating that actions are underway to schedule a summer IRB  meeting to review the entire budget year 2011 portfolio of IT investments,  and that the Combined IT Infrastructure investment which we reviewed is  expected to be reviewed in detail.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary for Information Systems and Chief  Information Officer addressed our recommendation to ensure that the  projects we identified as not having received department-level IRB  selection or oversight reviews receive these reviews by noting recent  efforts to reconstitute a department-level Executive Investment Review  Board, increase the oversight role of its Chief Information Officer Council,  and remediate weaknesses associated with the three projects we  reviewed. The Department of the Treasury\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix X.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, the Secretary of the  Department of Veterans Affairs concurred with our recommendations to  define and implement responsibilities for the department-level IRB to  oversee projects in operations and maintenance by noting that the  Programming and Long Term Issues Board will include operational  programs/projects in its program reviews for fiscal year 2010. The  department also concurred with our recommendation to ensure that the  project which we identified as not having received department-level IRB  oversight reviews receive these reviews and stated that it will address  actions to ensure this in its plan to address our recommendations. The  Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 comments are reprinted in appendix XI.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, the National Aeronautics  and Space Administration\u2019s Associate Deputy Administrator partially  concurred with our recommendation that projects which are identified in  this report as not having received department-level IRB selection or  oversight reviews receive these reviews stating that the departmental  board will continue to review major IT investments that are not highly  specialized in nature (this includes two of the four projects we reviewed),  while another governing body will maintain responsibility for ensuring the  overall successful performance of NASA\u2019s program portfolio, including the  highly specialized IT investments. We received information about the  second governing body after we sent our report to NASA for comment.  During the comment period, the agency also provided us additional  documentation on the projects we reviewed. After reviewing this  documentation, we have changed the reported reason column in table 1  from \u201cdepartment-level board was not active (i.e., it had not yet been  established)\u201d to \u201cNASA did not provide evidence that a selection review  had been performed by the appropriate department-level IRB\u201d for the  three projects we reviewed for selection. In addition, we changed the  department-level IRB review column in table 2 for the Integrated Financial  Management Improvement program from a \u201cno\u201d to a \u201cyes.\u201d NASA\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix XII.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission\u2019s Deputy Executive Director for Corporate Management, Office  of the Executive Director for Operations, agreed with our recommendation  to define conditions for elevating issues related to project selection and  oversight to its department-level IRB stating that the commission will  review and enhance the existing guidance for project selection and  oversight to ensure that its process is compliant with the intent of the  Clinger-Cohen Act. This will include updating the Information Technology  Business Council charter for project oversight reviews to include any  necessary changes to the process or criteria for review by the Information  Technology Senior Advisory Council. The commission also agreed with our  recommendation to ensure that the National Source Tracking System which  we identified as not having received a selection or oversight review by the  department-level IRB receive such review. The Nuclear Regulatory  Commission\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XIII.", "In written comments on a draft of this report, the Commissioner of the  Social Security Administration asked that we remove the Information  Technology Operations Assurance project we reviewed from our report  because it is not a poorly planned or poorly performing project. During the  agency comment period, we informed the agency that we would be  removing the project from our sample, and, based on clarification provided  by the Associate Chief Information Officer that the project reported a  positive cost variance, agreed that it should not be considered poorly  performing. We did not make any recommendations to the agency. The  Social Security Administration\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix XIV.", "In e-mail comments on a draft of this report, the U.S. Agency for  International Development concurred with our recommendation to ensure  that the project which we identified as not having received a department- level IRB oversight review receive this review.

In reviewing the guidance, we  determined the role department-level IRBs are expected to play in  selecting and overseeing IT projects, updating the findings from our 2004  governmentwide review of agencies\u2019 use of key investment management  practices. We also reviewed the composition of the boards to determine  whether they included senior executives from both IT and business (i.e.,  mission) units, in accordance with the GAO IT Investment Management  framework which identifies the key practices for creating and maintaining  successful investment management processes.", "For the second objective, we selected a sample of 48 IT projects that were  identified as being poorly planned according to the Office of Management  and Budget\u2019s Management Watch List  or reported as poorly performing  on the High-Risk Lists or both. To provide a governmentwide perspective,  we attempted to select one project from the 2007 Management Watch List  and one project from the High-Risk List with performance shortfalls  during 2007 for each of the 24 major agencies. We focused on the high-risk  projects with performance shortfalls in the areas of cost and schedule  since we had reported in September 2007 that these were the most  frequently reported shortfalls. To obtain broader representation of  agencies with high-risk projects, we also selected three High-Risk projects  that had performance shortfalls in 2006. From these lists, we selected  those projects with the highest funding levels according to the fiscal year  2008 President\u2019s budget request. When an agency had a project on only  one of the lists (i.e., only the Management Watch List or High-Risk List),  we selected at least 2 projects from that list. For example, we selected 2  high-risk projects with shortfalls for the Environmental Protection Agency  because the agency did not have any projects on the Management Watch  List for the time frame we considered.", "Our selection process resulted in 26 projects from the Management Watch  List, totaling about $7.4 billion in the fiscal year 2008 budget request, and  33 projects from the High-Risk List, totaling about $5.2 billion in the fiscal  year 2008 budget request. Eleven of these projects, totaling about $4  billion, were on both lists. The Department of Energy and the National  Science Foundation did not have any projects on the Management Watch  List or on the High-Risk List with shortfalls and, therefore, we did not  select any projects from these agencies. We removed two Management  Watch List projects and five high-risk projects from our initial sample after  sending the draft report to agency comment because we determined after  further review and discussion with agencies that these projects had not  been on the Management Watch List during 2007 or reported negative cost  or schedule variances exceeding 10 percent between December 2006 and  December 2007. This brought our sample of Management Watch List  projects to 24 projects, totaling about $7.3 billion in the fiscal year 2008  budget request and 28 high-risk projects totaling about $4.7 billion in the  fiscal year 2008 budget request and the number of projects on both lists to  11 projects totaling $4 billion in the fiscal year 2008 budget request.", "To determine whether department-level IRBs were performing selection  and oversight reviews of poorly planned and performing projects, we  requested evidence of board reviews for the 48 projects in our sample  during the time they were either on the Management Watch List or High- Risk List. We analyzed the documentation obtained, and, when reviews  had not been performed, we followed up with agencies to determine why  the required reviews were not performed. For the oversight reviews, we  determined whether project cost, benefit, schedule and risk data had been  provided to the board, but we did not assess the reliability of this  information.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2008 to June 2009 in  Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
