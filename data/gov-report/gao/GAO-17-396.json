To assess the reliability of the  data provided by components, we reviewed the data to identify outliers,  missing data and other potential errors, requested clarification from  component officials, and compared the data to source documents when  available. Based on this assessment, we determined that the population  of current non-major acquisitions and their associated acquisition costs  could not be reliably determined. However, we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable to identify the minimum number of these  acquisitions, and the general magnitude of the minimum acquisition costs  associated with active non-major acquisitions.

For each acquisition type, acquisitions are further  categorized as major or non-major based on expected cost. An  acquisition\u2019s major or non-major status determines who acts as the  Acquisition Decision Authority (ADA), the individual responsible for  management and oversight of the acquisition. DHS policy established the  DHS Chief Acquisition Officer as the ADA for major acquisitions and the  Component Acquisition Executive (CAE)\u2014the senior acquisition official  within the component\u2014as the ADA for all non-major acquisitions. CAEs  have overarching responsibility for the acquisition cost, schedule, risk,  and system performance of the component\u2019s acquisition portfolio and are  responsible for ensuring that appropriate acquisition planning takes place.  According to the DHS Instruction Manual, the CAEs are required to  establish component-specific non-major acquisition policies and guidance  that support the \u201cspirit and intent\u201d of department acquisition policies.  CAEs establish unique processes for managing their components\u2019 non- major acquisitions. Components that do not have CAE-approved policies  for non-major acquisition management are required to follow MD-102 and  the Instruction until those policies are developed. Figure 1 illustrates the  decision authority and thresholds for major and non-major acquisitions.", "DHS acquisition policy establishes an acquisition lifecycle framework that  includes a series of five acquisition decision events.

Figure 2 depicts the five acquisition decision events  and the four phases of the acquisition lifecycle.", "As part of an acquisition decision event for a major acquisition, the ADA  reviews and approves key acquisition documents, such as an acquisition  program baseline. An acquisition program baseline establishes an  acquisition\u2019s critical cost, schedule, and performance parameters.  Baselines are useful management tools that can help leadership (1)  understand of the scope of an acquisition, (2) assess how well the  acquisition is being executed, and (3) secure adequate funding. For non- major acquisitions, each CAE has flexibility in deciding how his or her  component will apply the acquisition lifecycle framework and the types of  documentation that will be required at each acquisition decision event.  The Instruction grants the components flexibility when managing non- major acquisitions.", "Within DHS headquarters, PARM is the lead office responsible for  overseeing the department\u2019s acquisition processes. PARM has a direct  management role with major acquisitions and less oversight of non-major  acquisitions. For non-major acquisitions, PARM\u2019s role is to ensure CAEs  are overseeing their components\u2019 acquisitions appropriately, and facilitate  component efforts to report acquisition information using DHS\u2019s INVEST  system, among other things.

When an acquisition is considered active, managers  develop, test, and evaluate the extent to which the acquired capability can  meet DHS mission needs, and adhere to critical cost, schedule, and  performance parameters.

They said that the first step toward  increasing the management rigor for these acquisitions is to  accurately identify them.", "Ineffective procedures: Officials from 2 components stated that they  lack effective procedures for identifying non-major acquisitions. USCG  and USCIS officials acknowledged that their procedures for identifying  these acquisitions need improvement. Specifically, a USCG official  told us that USCG procedures do not always successfully distinguish  IT acquisitions from non-acquisition activities. According to the official,  many non-major IT acquisition activities may be occurring, but the  USCG acquisition support staff may not be aware of them. USCG  officials said that the component has approximately 400-500 IT  investments to assess to determine whether they should be identified  as acquisitions.

According to USCG officials, the  process of identifying all such acquisitions is underway.", "Additionally, a senior USCIS official stated that his component\u2019s  method for identifying its smaller non-major acquisitions needs  improvement. USCIS combines its smallest acquisitions\u2014those  valued at less than $50 million\u2014into a single acquisition, aligns each  combined acquisition to specific offices within USCIS, such as the  Office of Information Technology, and tracks each combined  acquisition as a single acquisition. Using this approach, USCIS may  be underreporting the number of non-major acquisitions, as multiple  acquisitions may be counted as one, and the CAE may be missing  opportunities to influence the acquisitions at key decision events. To  improve tracking of these acquisitions, the official told us that USCIS  is evaluating each individual acquisition to determine if it is active, and  if it should be managed as a stand-alone acquisition. In addition,  according to USCIS officials, USCIS has recently revised its non- major acquisition policy, which will change the acquisition tracking  requirement. This revision is expected to be finalized in 2017.", "DHS component officials told us that they were working to improve their  ability to identify non-major acquisitions. For example, officials from 4  components stated that they were using new guidance provided in a 2016  update to the DHS Instruction Manual to more consistently categorize all  acquisitions as (1) capital acquisitions, (2) service acquisitions, or (3)  simple procurements. The guidance includes a series of yes-or-no  questions that acquisition officials answer to categorize a particular  acquisition. Component officials said these categorizations are helping  them identify all of the non-major acquisitions in their respective  portfolios. For example, FEMA officials said they have used the new  guidance to determine whether acquisitions considered procurements  should actually be managed as non-major acquisitions. Officials from the  other components reported efforts such as updating component policies  and performing ongoing reviews to identify which activities are  acquisitions. However, it was unclear when these various efforts to  identify the full scope of all non-major acquisitions would be complete  because no timelines had been established by DHS headquarters, which  may have resulted in components losing traction in their efforts. Federal  internal controls standards establish that management should obtain  relevant data from reliable sources in a timely manner. Until components  have identified all of their non-major acquisitions, they cannot effectively  manage their acquisition portfolios or apply the level and type of oversight  that complies with department policy.

They told us  their non-major acquisition data and corresponding documentation is  regularly compiled and CAE staff review it every month. Meanwhile, CBP  officials reported using a less centralized approach. CBP officials track  non-major acquisition data in two department-level systems and multiple  component-level systems, including several Microsoft Excel spreadsheets  and Microsoft Access databases. CBP officials reported that their  component lacks a systematic data review process, and that they had to  manually aggregate their data to respond to our queries.", "Additionally, components\u2019 policies for managing non-major acquisitions  vary. For example, at the start of fiscal year 2017, 7 components had  policies in place requiring component leadership to approve program  baselines for active non-major acquisitions. However, the 4 other  components did not. Our prior work and DHS acquisition policy  emphasize the importance of the critical cost, schedule, and performance  parameters that a baseline provides. As our work showed in 2012, the  baseline is a critical tool for managing an acquisition. First, it is an  agreement between program-, component-, and department-level officials  establishing what the capabilities being acquired should cost, when they  should be delivered, and how they should perform. DHS acquisition policy  for major acquisitions requires that the ADA approve a program\u2019s  baseline before it initiates design and development activities, and this  baseline then serves as a performance management tool to monitor and  measure an acquisition\u2019s execution. Second, baselines can help  acquisition leaders secure funding needed for programs to meet critical  cost, schedule, and performance parameters. If a program is not fully  funded, a baseline can help leaders identify the trade-offs needed to fund  the program with existing resources. Our prior work has demonstrated  that resources, including time and funding, should be consistent with  performance requirements. For major programs, the ADA confirms the  program is fully resourced through the next 5 years when the ADA  approves the program\u2019s baseline.", "At the start of fiscal year 2017, the majority of DHS\u2019s active non-major  acquisitions did not have component-approved baselines, though 3  components\u2014NPPD, USCG, and USSS\u2014did have baselines for all of the  active non-major acquisitions they identified.

The baselines provided by the components for the remaining  15 acquisitions varied in length and detail, but each included the cost,  schedule, and performance parameters needed to monitor a program  over time. Some components provided other types of acquisition  documentation, such as an Operational Requirements Document or Test  and Evaluation Master Plan. However, in each case, we determined that  the documents submitted did not effectively define the acquisitions by  linking their cost, schedule, and performance parameters.

For example, they said  that (1) the baselines for these acquisitions have been a relatively low  priority and were therefore still pending development or approval; (2) their  components chose not to require program baselines for non-major  acquisitions; or (3) while the component requires baselines for future non- major acquisitions, the acquisitions were initiated prior to the  establishment of that requirement.", "However, this situation is likely to change, given that, in February 2017,  DHS issued a new policy specifically focused on managing non-major  acquisitions. In response to our preliminary findings, during the course of  our audit, the Under Secretary for Management included in this policy a  requirement that component leadership approve baselines for these  acquisitions. This new requirement should help components execute  their acquisitions more effectively. Specifically, as identified above, CAEs  are likely to: (1) accurately understand the size of their portfolio; (2) have  adequate knowledge about execution against cost, schedule and  performance parameters when making acquisition decisions; and (3)  secure the funding the acquisition needs to meet those parameters.

Components valued 21 of their 38 reported active non-major acquisitions  at more than $50 million, and these acquisitions account for  approximately 95 percent\u2014$6.1 billion\u2014of the roughly $6.4 billion  components reported as the total value of their active non-major  acquisitions.", "PARM initiated these reviews in 2015, and, during the first round, officials  said they reviewed the components\u2019 non-major acquisition policies in an  effort to determine whether these policies aligned with departmental  guidance. PARM officials also said the components provided updates on  the acquisitions\u2019 costs, key milestones, and capabilities.", "For the second series of annual reviews in 2016, the DHS Under  Secretary for Management issued a memorandum intended to increase  the rigor of PARM\u2019s non-major acquisition reviews. The memorandum  stated that the components must provide PARM \u201cevidence of sufficient  acquisition documentation as tailored by the CAE\u201d and report cost,  schedule, and performance metrics with associated milestones. However,  the memorandum did not identify (1) any minimum requirements for  sufficient acquisition documentation; or (2) the specific cost, schedule,  and performance metrics the components should report to PARM. To  clarify the requirements, later in 2016, PARM developed more detailed  instructions for the 2016 annual review. PARM instructed the components  to identify whether they had an overarching policy or set of policies that  were specific to non-major acquisitions, and whether these policies  aligned with departmental guidance. PARM instructed the components to  report the annual costs associated with each acquisition, provide a high- level schedule, include a description of the capability or service being  acquired, and discuss issues such as the CAE\u2019s confidence in the  program\u2019s meeting the metrics in the program baseline, if a baseline was  indeed in place.", "Additionally, in response to our preliminary findings, a new policy that  DHS finalized in February 2017 includes a requirement that component  leadership approve baselines for non-major acquisitions that have not yet  achieved FOC, and states that PARM\u2019s Executive Director will leverage  its reviews to assess whether CAEs are (a) baselining these acquisitions  in accordance with the requirement; and (b) tracking the acquisitions\u2019  progress against cost, schedule, and performance parameters from  approved baselines. These reviews would help PARM\u2019s Executive  Director determine whether CAEs are overseeing their non-major  acquisitions in accordance with MD-102. Federal internal control  standards state that management should monitor program results and  evaluate these results against a previously established baseline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Components Have Started Entering Non-Major Acquisition Data into INVEST and Headquarters Is Taking Steps to Improve Data Reliability", "paragraphs": ["As part of its efforts to increase oversight of non-major acquisitions, DHS  leadership now requires components to enter data into the INVEST  system for all non-major acquisitions valued at greater than $50 million  that have not yet reached FOC. INVEST, DHS\u2019s central system for  acquisition information, is used by program-, component-, and  department-level officials to enter and obtain information for monthly  reporting and monitoring. In the past, components were required to enter  non-major acquisition data into INVEST only for IT acquisitions valued at  greater than $50 million as part of the DHS IT Capital Planning and  Investment Control process. In March 2016, DHS\u2019s Under Secretary for  Management issued a memo requiring components to enter data into  INVEST for both IT and non-IT non-major acquisitions valued at greater  than $50 million.", "However, we found that the data component officials had entered into  INVEST for non-major acquisitions through 2016 were unreliable. Only  about half of the acquisitions eligible for entry into INVEST had been  entered into the system. As of January 2017, component officials had  entered data into INVEST for 10 of the 21 programs that were eligible for  entry into the system\u2014i.e., active non-major acquisitions valued at  greater than $50 million. For the majority of the non-major acquisitions in  INVEST, we found few source documents\u2014particularly baselines\u2014that  CAEs could use to validate the data. A December 2016 requirement  states that CAEs must validate the accuracy of these data in INVEST  twice a year, mirroring the current certification requirement for major  acquisitions. This recent requirement, combined with the February 2017  baselining requirement, will likely improve the reliability of the data.", "Additionally, component officials have reported challenges when trying to  enter non-major acquisition data into INVEST. PARM did not initially  provide specific guidance on entering the data, and officials from some  components said they were confused about the amount and type of  information that should be entered into INVEST. In response to this  confusion, PARM officials created a new guidebook in October 2016 and  issued additional instructions in a December 2016 memo intended to  clarify the INVEST data-entry process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Headquarters Has Taken Additional Actions to Help Improve Components\u2019 Management of Non-Major Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["In addition to PARM\u2019s implementation of annual non-major acquisition  reviews and the requirement to enter non-major acquisition data into  INVEST, DHS headquarters has taken several additional actions to help  improve the components\u2019 management of these acquisitions.

In February 2017, the DHS Under Secretary for  Management more clearly defined CAEs\u2019 roles and responsibilities for  managing non-major acquisitions. PARM also issued new non-major  acquisition management guidance specific to the DHS Management  Directorate in February 2017. The new policy consolidates the  Management Directorate\u2019s CAE authority by designating the Deputy  Director of PARM the CAE for all of the Management Directorate\u2019s  non-major acquisitions. Previously, offices within the Management  Directorate, such as the OCIO and the Office of the Chief Readiness  Support Officer, had their own CAEs. One such office in the scope of  our review\u2014OCIO\u2014did not use the acquisition lifecycle process for its  acquisition management.

In 2015,  PARM established a DHS Master Acquisition Oversight List  Governance Board. This body reviews and approves major and non- major acquisition additions, removals, and other updates to the  department\u2019s Master Acquisition Oversight List.

Similarly, at FEMA\u2019s  request, the Under Secretary for Management elevated FEMA\u2019s  Integrated Public Alert and Warning System acquisition to major  status because of its complexity, cross-component impact, and high  visibility outside of the department. DHS officials stated that the Under  Secretary for Management may elevate non-major acquisitions for  other reasons, including external events such as congressional and  media interest, if a program\u2019s importance to DHS\u2019s strategic and  performance plans is disproportionate to its size, and if an acquisition  has significant program or policy implications.", "These actions reflect DHS leadership\u2019s increased focus on non-major  acquisitions as the department continues to work to mature its acquisition  management processes across all of its component agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 8 years, DHS leadership has taken several steps to mature  its acquisition management processes.

However, the fact that officials from few components  could confidently identify the full scope of their non-major acquisitions is  problematic.

This  review addresses both the components\u2019 management of non-major  acquisitions as well as the department\u2019s oversight role. Specifically, this  report assesses (1) the extent to which component leadership is  effectively overseeing non-major acquisitions and (2) the extent to which  DHS headquarters has helped components establish effective  management controls for non-major acquisitions.", "To identify the extent to which component leadership is effectively  overseeing non-major acquisitions, we attempted to identify all non-major  acquisitions within DHS. We asked officials from DHS\u2019s Office of Program  Accountability and Risk Management (PARM), which are responsible for  overseeing the department\u2019s acquisitions, to identify the components that  manage non-major acquisitions. PARM identified 14 DHS components in  response. We requested data from the 14 DHS components and obtained  non-major acquisition data from 11 components. Officials from the 3  remaining components stated that they did not manage non-major  acquisitions. For example, officials from the DHS Science and  Technology Directorate stated that their component does not identify any  acquisition valued at less than $50 million as a non-major acquisition and,  based on that definition, the component does not have any non-major  acquisitions to report. For this reason, we removed the Science and  Technology Directorate from our scope.

We used a data collection  instrument to obtain non-major acquisitions data based on preliminary  discussions with DHS and component officials that indicated we should  work directly with the components to collect this information.", "To assess the reliability of the data provided by components, we reviewed  the data to identify outliers, missing data and other potential errors, and  compared the data to source documents when available. In interviews  and via e-mail correspondence; we provided component officials an  opportunity to review, discuss, and, where applicable, correct any  completeness and accuracy issues. In addition, we requested that each  component update its non-major acquisition data to be accurate as of  October 1, 2016. We also requested and reviewed information on how the  components enter, store, access, update, and review non-major  acquisition data, as well as component officials\u2019 comments on the  reliability of the data they provided. Based on this assessment, we  determined that the population of current non-major acquisitions and their  associated acquisition costs could not be reliably determined. However,  we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to identify the  minimum number of non-major acquisitions, and the general magnitude of  the minimum acquisition costs associated with active non-major  acquisitions. For those acquisitions that components could identify, we  found that the data components provided for these non-major acquisitions  were generally unreliable as further discussed in the report.", "In addition to the non-major acquisitions at the components that PARM  identified, with the assistance of component officials we also identified  one non-major acquisition at the DHS Office of the Chief Readiness  Support Officer and one non-major acquisition at the DHS Office of the  Chief Security Officer.

As a  final quality assurance step, we returned the collected and updated data  collection instruments to the respective components, and requested  officials verify and, when applicable, correct the data.", "To designate each acquisition active, pre-active, or post-FOC, we  reviewed the FOC and acquisition phase data that the component officials  provided. We designated an acquisition active if it had reached  Acquisition Decision Event 2A but had not reached FOC by October 1,  2016. If any increment, project, or segment of an acquisition was active,  we designated the entire acquisition active. We designated acquisitions  with an FOC date on or before October 1, 2016 post-FOC, and those that  had not yet reached Acquisition Decision Event 2A by October 1, 2016  pre-active. For acquisitions with conflicting data, we confirmed our  designation with component officials. In addition, we collected acquisition  cost information for each acquisition, specifically, life cycle cost estimates  for capital asset acquisitions and annual expenditure data for services  acquisitions. For active acquisitions that did not have final cost estimates  in place, we accepted and reported the preliminary information that was  available, such as rough order of magnitude estimates or life cycle cost  estimates with lower confidence levels.", "To understand the processes components use to manage non-major  acquisitions and assess the extent to which components were  consistently baselining these acquisitions, we reviewed draft and final  DHS acquisition policy, and component-level non-major acquisition  policies and guidance. We also requested and reviewed acquisition  decision memos and component-approved acquisition program  baselines\u2014or any equivalent documents containing cost, schedule, and  performance parameters\u2014for all acquisitions that were active as of  October 1, 2016. We then reviewed each baseline document to determine  whether it actually contained cost, schedule, and performance  parameters in accordance with key acquisition management practices we  established in previous reports. We also interviewed department and  component officials to expand our understanding of component  management processes, and determine why the components were or  were not approving baselines for non-major acquisitions.", "To identify the extent to which DHS headquarters has helped components  establish effective management controls for non-major acquisitions, we  reviewed draft and final department acquisition policy, guidance, and  memos to identify how PARM and other headquarters entities contribute  to non-major acquisition management.

We  collected INVEST reports for active non-major acquisitions and compared  cost information in those reports to available source documents, such as  acquisition program baselines and life cycle cost estimates. To assess  relevant internal controls, we reviewed the DHS INVEST User Guide and  Training Manual and identified the purpose and structure of the INVEST  system. We subsequently evaluated INVEST reports and identified the  forms each component used to enter data into INVEST, as well as the  level of completeness of the forms and any system-generated errors.
