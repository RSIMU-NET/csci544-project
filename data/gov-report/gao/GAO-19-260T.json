According to DOT officials, DOT has been working on a single draft maritime strategy to meet both mandates. This strategy is intended to address how to make vessels registered to the United States (U.S.-flag vessels) more competitive in the international cargo market. It is also intended to address how to ensure the long-term viability of U.S.-flag vessels and U.S.-citizen mariners. The Department of Defense (DOD) counts on U.S.-citizen mariners that work on U.S.-flag vessels to crew the government-owned reserve fleet during a crisis. In an August 2018 report, GAO concluded that by not completing the strategy or establishing a timeline for completing it, DOT had delayed providing decision-makers the information they needed to address challenges facing the U.S. flag fleet. Subsequently, with the passage of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, Congress extended the deadline for the strategy to February 2020. According to DOT officials, DOT will issue the strategy by the new deadline.", "Stakeholders GAO spoke with for its August 2018 report identified two primary challenges to ensuring that the U.S.-flag fleet would continue to meet DOD's national defense needs: (1) maintaining the financial viability of the U.S.-flag fleet, which is threatened by the increasingly higher costs of operating U.S. vessels compared to foreign flag vessels and a decrease in government cargo being shipped internationally; and (2) a potential shortage of U.S. citizen mariners available to support defense needs, in part due to the declining numbers of U.S.-flag vessels that employ these mariners. For example, the number of U.S. flag vessels involved in international trade declined from 199 vessels at the end of 1990 to just 82 vessels by the end of 2017. DOT officials have identified some options to make U.S.-flag vessels more competitive, increase the amount of commercial cargo on U.S. flag vessels, and address a potential shortage of U.S.-citizen mariners, although they are not ready to assess their feasibility or formally propose these options.", "To address the challenge of maintaining the financial viability of U.S.-flag vessels, DOT has identified options such as changing regulations to decrease the costs of bringing a ship under the U.S. flag and requiring that certain energy export commodities, such as oil or liquefied natural gas, be carried on U.S.-flag vessels.", "To address the potential shortage of U.S.-citizen mariners, DOT convened a working group to determine how many mariners would be needed to meet defense needs. The working group estimated a shortage of over 1,800 U.S.-citizen mariners in the event of a sustained military activation, although it also recommended data improvements to increase the accuracy of the count of available mariners. In addition, the working group identified two actions that could help increase the number of U.S.-citizen mariners: (1) developing a reserve program to identify and support qualified mariners willing to sail to support defense needs during an emergency and (2) expanding programs and requirements that support U.S.-citizen mariners, such as requirements that government agencies must ship certain cargo on U.S. flag vessels."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the August 2018 report, GAO recommended that DOT complete the national maritime strategy and establish time frames for its issuance.

DOD largely relies on  internationally-trading U.S.-flag vessels (vessels registered in the United  States that must be mainly crewed by U.S. citizens) for sealift\u2014the  process of transporting government equipment and supplies by sea for  military purposes. However, it has long been recognized that the  operating costs of U.S.-flag vessels are higher than the operating costs of  foreign-flag vessels, and that government support is therefore necessary  to maintain a fleet of internationally trading U.S.-flag vessels. To help  ensure an adequately-sized U.S.-flag fleet for defense needs, the  government supports internationally-trading U.S.-flag vessels in the  following ways: (1) through the Maritime Security Program (MSP), which  provides the operators of selected U.S.-flag vessels a stipend in  exchange for their agreeing to provide sealift support in times of war or  crisis, and (2) through \u201ccargo preference\u201d requirements that specify that  federal agencies must transport certain percentages of international  government cargo on U.S.-flag vessels.", "Despite the MSP and cargo preference requirements that have helped  support the U.S.-flag fleet, concerns have been raised about the fleet\u2019s  future sustainability The U.S.-flag fleet has been in decline for many years  and increasingly faces difficulties in competing for international cargo due  to the higher costs of operating under the U.S. flag. Notably, the number  of U.S.-flagged vessels has continued to decline\u2014from 199 vessels at the  end of 1990 to just 82 vessels by the end of 2017, creating a potential  shortage of U.S. citizen mariners to crew government-owned reserve  vessels in times of need. Recognizing these and other challenges,  Congress statutorily mandated in 2014 that DOT develop national  strategies related to the sustainability of the U.S.-flag fleet, including  recommendations for the future. In the John S. McCain National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019, the statutory deadline for the  national maritime strategy was extended from February 2015 to February  2020.", "My statement today provides information on (1) the status of the  mandated national strategies and (2) challenges that stakeholders  identified related to sustaining the U.S.-flag fleet for defense needs and  options DOT has considered for addressing them.

However, DOT and MARAD officials had  stated that they were not yet ready to address the feasibility of these  options, or formally propose them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Maintaining Financial Viability of the U.S.-Flag Fleet", "paragraphs": ["According to MARAD officials, the relative cost of operating a U.S.-flag  vessel compared to a foreign-flag vessel has increased in recent years,  making it more challenging for vessel operators to remain economically  viable under the U.S. flag. In our August report we found that financial  support to U.S.-flag vessels through both the MSP stipend and the  government cargo preference requirements has helped ensure a  sufficient number of internationally trading U.S.-flag vessels are available  to meet DOD\u2019s most recently stated cargo capacity needs from such  vessels. On the other hand, according to MARAD officials, the additional  cost of operating a U.S. flag vessel compared to a foreign-flag vessel has  increased\u2014from about $4.9 million annually in 2009 and 2010 to about  $6.2 to $6.5 million currently\u2014making it harder for such vessels to remain  financially viable. This cost differential results primarily from the rising  relative costs of employing U.S. versus foreign mariners as crew.  Compounding the increasing costs of operating U.S. flag vessels, the  volume of government cargo\u2014a key source of revenue for many U.S.- flagged vessels\u2014has fallen in recent years as the international military  presence of the United States and funding for food aid overseas have  both declined. In response to these challenges, Congress increased the  MSP stipend from $3.5 million to $4.99 million per vessel from fiscal year  2016 to 2017. MARAD officials said this increase has temporarily  stabilized the financial situation of MSP vessel operators. However, they  added that trends in operating costs and government cargo suggest that  the ability to retain an adequate number of financially-viable U.S.-flagged  vessels will remain an ongoing challenge.", "MARAD officials identified the following options as having potential to  reduce the costs of operating a U.S.-flag vessel\u2014which would in turn  make U.S.-flag vessels more competitive in the international cargo  market:", "MARAD is part of a U.S. Registry Working Group looking at a range  of actions to decrease the time and cost of bringing vessels under the  U.S. flag, including the cost of meeting Coast Guard requirements.  For example, the group is looking at a recommendation for the  broader application of internationally recognized vessel standards to  U.S.-flag vessels to meet Coast Guard requirements.", "In the current strategic plan for 2017 through 2021, MARAD identified  two areas of reform\u2014mariner income-tax relief and liability insurance  reform\u2014that could reduce the crew costs of operating under a U.S.  flag.", "According to MARAD officials, some stakeholders have  recommended that MARAD consider requesting the elimination of a  tax on U.S.-flag vessels receiving maintenance overseas to reduce  maintenance costs for U.S.-flag vessels. In general, maintenance and  repairs on U.S.-flag vessels not conducted at U.S. shipyards are  subject to a statutory 50 percent ad valorem tax on the cost of  maintenance performed in a foreign country. According to 12 of the 14  MSP vessel operators we spoke with for our August report, U.S.  shipyards are typically more expensive than foreign shipyards or may  not be close to the vessel\u2019s location or route, so they typically choose  to pay the tax and have the maintenance performed overseas. Four  MSP vessel operators we spoke to stated that they send U.S.-flag  vessels to U.S. shipyards for maintenance when it makes sense from  a logistical and financial perspective. MARAD officials we spoke to  said they are considering the effect of eliminating the tax, a step that  would reduce costs for vessel operators but would potentially  negatively affect the financial viability of U.S. shipyards, which the law  was designed to assist. However, MARAD officials stated that they  have not yet evaluated these trade-offs.", "MARAD and DOD\u2019s Transportation Command (Transportation Command)  officials have also identified\u2014but not officially proposed\u2014several options  to address the decline in government cargo carried on U.S.-flag vessels,  which would also make U.S.-flag vessels more competitive by providing  more revenues. In our August 2018 report, Transportation Command  officials and ship operators to whom we spoke told us that they consider  access to U.S. government cargo to be a critical means of sustaining  U.S.-flag vessels.", "Transportation Command and MARAD officials stated that one way to  increase the amount of commercial cargo on U.S.-flag vessels would  be to require that certain energy export commodities, such as oil or  liquefied natural gas, be carried on U.S.-flag vessels. While this option  has been considered in the past, it would require new legislation and  would potentially have a negative impact on the export market for  liquefied natural gas. In 2015, we analyzed the potential effects of a  requirement that U.S. liquefied natural gas exports be carried on U.S.- built and -flagged vessels. We found that such a requirement could  potentially increase the number of U.S.-flag vessels by 100 over the  course of many years; however, due to their higher operating costs,  this would increase the cost of transporting liquefied natural gas from  the United States, decrease the competitiveness of U.S. liquefied  natural gas in the world market, and in turn, reduce demand for U.S.  liquefied natural gas. MARAD officials stated that another option  would be increasing the percentage of other cargo, such as food aid,  that civilian agencies are required to transport on U.S.-flag vessels.  This would also require an amendment to existing legislation and  would also have trade-offs, since cargo requirements such as these  can result in higher shipping costs that can negatively affect the  missions of civilian agencies, in particular food aid agencies.", "Another option identified by MARAD officials to address declining  government cargo volumes would be to increase the MSP stipend to  replace some of the government support previously provided through  cargo preference requirements, as was done for fiscal year 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Potential Shortage of U.S.- Citizen Mariners", "paragraphs": ["The second challenge identified by stakeholders related to maintaining  adequate sealift for defense needs is the potential shortage of U.S.- citizen mariners available to crew the government-owned reserve fleet  during a crisis. The government\u2019s reserve fleet vessels are held in  reduced operating status with minimal crew in peacetime. When put into  full operating status\u2014such as for a surge related to a wartime effort\u2014 these vessels need additional crew, and DOD counts on mariners  working on oceangoing U.S.-flag vessels to meet this need. MARAD and  DOD have raised concerns about the sufficiency of U.S.-citizen mariners  to meet this need. For example, in January 2018, in a statutorily  mandated report, MARAD\u2019s Maritime Workforce Working Group  estimated a shortage of over 1,800 mariners in the case of a drawn-out  military effort, although it also recommended data improvements to  increase the accuracy of the count of available mariners.", "Specifically, in this report, the working group estimated approximately  11,768 qualified and available U.S.-citizen mariners as of June 2017\u2014 1,839 less than the 13,607 mariners the working group estimates would  be needed for sustained operation of the reserve and commercial fleet.  The working group based its identification of 11,768 existing qualified  U.S.-citizen mariners on the number of U.S.-citizen mariners actively  sailing on U.S.-flag commercial and government-owned oceangoing  vessels. For the vessels in full operating status, the working group  accounted for 2 mariners employed for each crew position. The double  crew, which according to MARAD officials is typical for a commercial  U.S.-flag vessel operating in international trade, allows each mariner,  over the course of a year, to work for 6 months on the vessel and take 6  months of earned leave. The working group assumed that during a  military activation, commercial operations would continue at the same  level as during peacetime\u2014but that some U.S-citizen mariners currently  working on commercial vessels would be willing to reduce the amount of  earned leave they took in order to work on government-owned reserve  vessels. The working group analyzed this scenario by changing the ratio  of crew positions to crew from 2 to 1.75. As illustrated in figure 1, under  this scenario, with an average of 26 crew positions per vessel, between 6  and 7 mariners per existing commercial oceangoing U.S.-flag vessel are  made available to crew the reserve fleet.", "According to the working group\u2019s methodology, given the size of the  current U.S.-flag oceangoing fleet and the number of currently employed  mariners on this fleet, there are enough U.S.-citizen mariners to crew the  reserve fleet during an initial surge, but not for a sustained activation,  during which the working group estimated that the reserve vessels  themselves would need a double crew to allow for crew rotations. This  need for crew rotations on the reserve vessels led the working group to  estimate a shortage of 1,839 U.S.-citizen mariners. Moreover, the working  group\u2019s report found that the shortage of mariners may be understated if  some of the estimated available mariners are unable or unwilling to  continue sailing during times of national emergency, as available  mariners are not required to crew the reserve fleet.", "Although the working group concluded that there is a shortage of  mariners for sustained operations, its report also details data limitations  that cause some uncertainty regarding the actual number of existing  qualified mariners and, thus, the extent of this shortage. The working  group\u2019s approach\u2014driven, in part, by limitations of the U.S. Coast  Guard\u2019s database that tracks mariner credentials\u2014did not count any  qualified mariners who are no longer employed on U.S.-flag oceangoing  vessels or who are employed on other types of vessels but may have the  required credentials. In fact, according to the working group\u2019s analysis,  over 15,000 mariners listed in the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s database have  unlimited credentials but are unaccounted for, as they are neither  currently employed on large, oceangoing vessels nor serving as civil- service mariners committed to government-owned vessels. The working  group stated that the availability and continuing proficiency of these  mariners remains unknown. MARAD officials emphasized to us, however,  that mariners who have not worked on the right types of vessels for more  than 18 months are likely to need additional training before they would be  qualified to crew the reserve fleet during a military activation.", "The working group\u2019s report contains several recommendations related to  improving information on the number of available and willing mariners.  These recommendations include replacing the Coast Guard database  with one that would enable a more accurate account of available  mariners, and establishing a periodic survey of the U.S.-citizen mariner  pool to allow MARAD to determine, with reasonable certainty, how many  qualified mariners would be available and willing to sail on U.S.- government reserve vessels if called upon to do so. The report concluded  that until these agencies improve the tracking of licensed mariners who  may be available to crew the government-owned reserve vessels when  activated into full operating status, the extent to which there is a shortage  of mariners for defense needs will remain unclear. The lack of  information on the extent to which there is a shortage of mariners limits  the U.S. government\u2019s ability to effectively plan for such needs. In  January 2018, MARAD\u2019s administrator testified that MARAD is working  with the Coast Guard and the maritime industry to better track licensed  mariners who may no longer be sailing but could serve in a time of crisis,  and in March 2018, MARAD officials told us they are taking steps to  initiate a new survey of mariners, as recommended in the working group\u2019s  report.", "In its report, the working group also identified options to address the  challenge of ensuring a sufficient number of U.S.-citizen mariners for  defense needs. It identified two actions that could help increase the  number of U.S.-citizen mariners\u2014one focused specifically on mariners  and the other focused more broadly on the merchant marine, which  encompasses U.S.-flag vessels and U.S.-citizen mariners. However, the  working group\u2019s report did not discuss specific costs or trade-offs related  to either action or elaborate any further on them. The report identified the  following actions:", "MARAD should develop a broad-based reserve program that would  identify and support qualified mariners willing to sail in commercial  and government-owned vessels during an emergency. MARAD would  provide limited financial assistance in training mariners and  maintaining credentials, in turn for which mariners who participate  would be obligated to sail in the event of a defense need.", "MARAD and other U.S. government agencies should support a  healthy merchant marine (which encompasses U.S.-flag vessels and  U.S.-citizen mariners). The government should fully support programs  including MSP, requiring the government to ship certain cargo on U.S  flag vessels, the Jones Act, and government chartering of privately  owned vessels. If DOD determines that national needs require more  mariners and vessels than can be provided through current programs,  those programs should be expanded to meet such needs.", "In conclusion, the U.S.-flag fleet is increasingly facing challenges that  threaten its ability to meet future defense needs. In response to  congressional mandates, MARAD has been working on a national  maritime strategy and plans to issue one by February 2020. However,  until such a strategy is in place, decision-makers will have limited  information to make important policy choices that consider all the relevant  tradeoffs associated with this complex issue.", "Chairman Mast, Ranking Member Garamendi, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
