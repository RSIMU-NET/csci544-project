In April 1990, some PCIE members had expressed concern over the legal standing of the Integrity Committee and noted that the committee had been handling allegations against IGs without a formal charter, policy, and procedures. The 1992 testimony also cited a PCIE internal review that had found that (1) the Allegation Review Subcommittee (the Integrity Committee\u2019s predecessor) lacked authority to participate in any investigative process; (2) the subcommittee system of sporadic meetings for decision-making, under which the Integrity Committee\u2019s predecessor had operated, was cumbersome and impeded the effective and timely resolution of allegations; and (3) the subcommittee system had led to a situation in which no one party was responsible for the effective investigation and resolution of allegations against IGs.", "Further, the PCIE had no clear authority to review allegations\u2014criminal and noncriminal\u2014against IGs and make appropriate investigative referrals. In addition, no investigative agency had the authority to investigate administrative allegations against IGs who were outside the purview of specific executive branch agencies (e.g., Office of Special Counsel for alleged prohibited personnel practices). In some cases, this lack of clear authority caused the Integrity Committee difficulty in deciding how to handle noncriminal matters involving alleged mismanagement. They dismissed some allegations as being frivolous, as noted by a PCIE official; referred some to the head of the affected agency; and referred others to the affected IG.", "In addition, according to the 1992 hearing, the FBI had no statutory authority to conduct noncriminal investigations for the PCIE. Current and former members of the Integrity Committee told us that the PCIE\u2019s lack of authority to deal with noncriminal issues had continued to be a problem. However, the March 1996 Executive Order clearly vests the authority to conduct all investigations requested by PCIE with the FBI.", "In addition, in 1982 a Department of Justice counsel questioned whether one IG office had the authority to investigate another. Further, at the 1992 hearing, a PCIE official opined that the Inspector General Act authorized IGs to investigate allegations of misconduct only when the allegations involved fraud, waste, or abuse in their particular department or agency. However, according to a former Chairman of the Integrity Committee, nothing precludes OIG personnel from being detailed from one agency to another to investigate an IG on a reimbursable basis for noncriminal matters. An alternative consideration was to use investigative staff from an agency with government-wide authority, such as the Office of Personnel Management.

The record showed that the Integrity Committee referred 43 of the 72 allegations we reviewed to various agencies and received agency responses regarding 8 of the allegations.

In addition, we noted that the 1996 Executive Order requires that \u201cll records created and received pursuant to this order are records of the Integrity Committee and shall be maintained by the FBI.\u201d In contrast to this requirement, the PCIE Chairman, in commenting on a draft of our report, stated that PCIE\u2019s draft procedures will require agencies that receive referred allegations to maintain the investigative files after providing the resulting investigative report to the Integrity Committee. However, with such a procedural requirement, the PCIE would still not have a central, complete file on actions taken to resolve allegations.", "During our review of the records, we noted another possible problem related to the investigations of individuals who had left office and the lack of record-keeping regarding the allegations against them. In four cases, the Integrity Committee and/or the affected OIG declined to follow up allegations, according to OIG officials, because the subject of an allegation had left office and was not subject to any administrative or adverse personnel action. One IG stated the belief that such allegations should be investigated. Further, we determined that with no centralized record-keeping system to track the subjects of allegations, the PCIE had no effective way to determine who the subjects were, what the allegations were, or how long the allegations had been awaiting PCIE action. Further, the allegations could not be chronicled for trend analysis or a reference check if an individual were to be considered for future federal positions.

The IGs were concerned that even though the allegations were unfounded, the agency head could use the information at a later date to seek the IG\u2019s removal. In addition, the IGs favored a procedure whereby (1) the IG being investigated is made aware of the investigation and (2) the IG and the complainant are made aware of the investigation\u2019s outcome.
