North Korea\u2019s refusal to resolve the discrepancies, its termination of IAEA\u2019s inspections, and its subsequent announcement that it intended to withdraw from the treaty raised widespread concern that North Korea may have diverted some of its nuclear material to produce nuclear weapons.", "On October 21, 1994, the United States and North Korea concluded a separate, bilateral arrangement known as the Agreed Framework to address the North Korean nuclear issue. Under the Agreed Framework, the United States is helping North Korea to acquire two light-water nuclear power reactors to produce electricity in exchange for, among other things, a \u201cfreeze\u201d (stoppage) of operations and construction at North Korea\u2019s existing graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities and North Korea\u2019s commitment to eventually dismantle the facilities. While North Korea\u2019s safeguards agreement with IAEA remains in effect, the Agreed Framework defers certain IAEA safeguards activities, including the resolution of IAEA\u2019s questions about North Korea\u2019s past production of nuclear material.

Most of the facilities are located in Yongbyon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang.", "The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons prohibits nonnuclear weapons states from acquiring nuclear weapons. North Korea became a party to the treaty in 1985 and, in 1992, concluded an agreement with IAEA for safeguarding its nuclear material. The agreement with IAEA\u2014the United Nations-affiliated organization responsible for implementing safeguards requirements under the treaty\u2014requires North Korea to declare all of its nuclear material and to allow IAEA to perform inspections and other safeguards measures at North Korea\u2019s nuclear facilities. The purpose of these measures is to ensure that nuclear material is not diverted to nuclear weapons.", "IAEA uses several measures to ensure compliance with its safeguards agreements. Material-accounting measures verify the quantity of nuclear material declared to IAEA and any changes in the quantity over time. Containment measures utilize physical barriers, such as walls and seals, to control the access to and movement of nuclear material, while surveillance and other monitoring devices detect the movements of nuclear materials and any tampering with IAEA\u2019s containment measures. Finally, IAEA uses on-site inspections, among other things, to help ensure that all of the material has been declared and placed under IAEA\u2019s control.", "According to unverified public accounts, North Korea reported to IAEA in May 1992 that it had about 90 grams of plutonium subject to IAEA\u2019s safeguards from a one-time reprocessing of defective fuel rods. Shortly thereafter, IAEA began implementing safeguards, including inspections, to verify the accuracy and completeness of North Korea\u2019s declaration of the amount of nuclear material in its possession. The inspections identified discrepancies suggesting that North Korea had not declared all of its nuclear material. For example, contrary to North Korea\u2019s claim that it conducted a one-time reprocessing of damaged fuel rods, IAEA concluded that North Korea had reprocessed fuel on several occasions since 1989. North Korea refused to allow IAEA to resolve the discrepancies, limited IAEA\u2019s inspections, refused the implementation of IAEA\u2019s \u201cspecial inspections\u201d at two sites, and announced its intention to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. These and other perceived provocations led to concerns about the possibility of war if North Korea continued to pursue its existing graphite-moderated nuclear program.", "The Agreed Framework defused tensions on the Korean Peninsula and resulted in various trade-offs between North Korea and the United States. For its part, North Korea committed, among other things, to (1) remain a party to the treaty; (2) freeze the operation and construction of its graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities and, later, to dismantle them; (3) safely store and, at a later time, transfer its spent fuel from North Korea for ultimate disposal; and (4) resolve IAEA\u2019s questions about the accuracy and completeness of North Korea\u2019s 1992 nuclear declaration. In return, the United States agreed, among other things, to create an international consortium of member countries to replace North Korea\u2019s graphite-moderated reactors with two light-water reactors by a target date of 2003. The resulting consortium\u2014established in March 1995\u2014is called the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO). In August 1997, groundbreaking for the reactors occurred in the Kumho district of Sinpo\u2014a port city on North Korea\u2019s east coast. (See fig. 1 for a map identifying Sinpo and other relevant North Korean sites.)", "While groundbreaking has occurred, no formal delivery schedule has been established for the reactor project. In the meantime, the Agreed Framework envisions specific functions for IAEA, notably that IAEA (1) monitor the freeze at five North Korean nuclear facilities and (2) resume inspections at other nuclear facilities not subject to the freeze. The Agreed Framework also calls upon North Korea to take \u201call steps that may be deemed necessary\u201d for IAEA to verify the accuracy and completeness of North Korea\u2019s 1992 report on nuclear facilities and the amount of nuclear material in its possession."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Problems, Freeze Is in Place", "paragraphs": ["IAEA began monitoring the five North Korean nuclear facilities subject to the freeze in late November 1994\u2014about 1 month after the Agreed Framework was concluded.

For example, although activities affecting North Korea\u2019s reprocessing facility are prohibited, North Korea has not allowed IAEA to implement required safeguards measures on the liquid nuclear waste tanks at the facility. According to IAEA, the measures are needed to ensure that the nuclear waste is not being removed or altered.

However, in November 1994, the United Nations Security Council requested that IAEA take all steps deemed necessary to monitor the freeze. IAEA\u2019s Board of Governors approved the request. Shortly thereafter, IAEA and North Korea began negotiating arrangements for IAEA\u2019s monitoring of the freeze, which among other things, resulted in the identification of critical buildings at each facility site that would be subject to IAEA\u2019s monitoring measures. According to officials from the State Department and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), IAEA and North Korea also reached an understanding on the definition of the freeze that, according to IAEA\u2019s documentation, provides that any movements of nuclear material or equipment within the facilities under the freeze, any maintenance work by the operator, and any transfers of nuclear materials out of the facilities must be carried out under IAEA\u2019s observation or under other IAEA arrangements. Finally, any nuclear equipment and components related to the freeze, including items manufactured for the two reactors under construction, must be monitored by IAEA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IAEA Inspectors Perform Various Monitoring Activities", "paragraphs": ["IAEA inspectors visited the North Korean facilities subject to the freeze from November 23 to November 28, 1994, and confirmed that the three operating facilities had been shut down and that construction on the two incomplete reactors had stopped. IAEA maintains a continuous presence in North Korea to monitor the facilities and to ensure that they remain under the freeze. According to IAEA, its monitoring activities provide assurance that operations and construction at the five facilities are frozen.", "IAEA inspectors regularly monitor the 5-MW(e) reactor, the fuel fabrication plant, and the reprocessing plant. IAEA uses all technical means available to monitor the freeze at these facilities, such as using seals that can indicate instances of tampering, using video cameras, and making short-notice inspections. The particular method(s) used depends on the circumstances at each of the three facilities. The primary monitoring method is the use and frequent verification of tamper-indicating seals on equipment and installations throughout the \u201cfrozen\u201d nuclear facilities. Video cameras are also used for surveillance. Finally, short-notice inspections are used to monitor certain equipment and areas in the frozen facilities that have not been allowed to be sealed. IAEA inspectors also monitor activities related to the canning and storage of spent fuel from the 5-MW(e) reactor and have, through qualitative measurements of the fuel rods (spent fuel), verified whether the rods are, in fact, irradiated (spent) fuel rods.", "IAEA also monitors activities at the two unfinished reactors. As with the three other nuclear facilities under the freeze, IAEA established an initial photographic baseline to document the status of each facility\u2019s construction. Since then, IAEA inspectors have visited the 50-MW(e) graphite-moderated nuclear reactor in Yongbyon and the 200-MW(e) graphite-moderated nuclear reactor in Taechon a few times a year. During their visits, the inspectors observe the facilities, take updated pictures, and compare the photos to ensure that construction has not resumed at the facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IAEA Identified Monitoring Problems", "paragraphs": ["While IAEA is confident that operations and construction at the five nuclear facilities have ceased, IAEA identified several problems affecting its ability to determine if North Korea is complying fully with certain aspects of the nuclear freeze. First, despite repeated requests, North Korea has not provided IAEA with adequate information about the amount and location of nuclear equipment and components that it may have produced for its two unfinished reactors. As previously discussed, the nuclear equipment and components for the facilities under the freeze, such as the graphite blocks manufactured for the 50-MW(e) and the 200-MW(e) reactors under construction, are subject to monitoring by IAEA. According to congressional testimony by the former Secretary of Defense in January 1995, North Korea\u2019s 50-MW(e) reactor was expected to be completed in 1995. Because of this schedule, all of the reactor\u2019s equipment and components, including the reactor\u2019s graphite blocks and fuel-handling machines, should have been available for inclusion in the reactor\u2019s building. Instead, North Korea informed IAEA that it had manufactured only about 50 percent of the graphite blocks needed for the 50-MW(e) reactor and none of the graphite blocks needed for the 200-MW(e) reactor, which, according to the former Secretary of Defense, was expected to be completed in 1996. According to IAEA, North Korea explained that there was no reason for it to continue manufacturing equipment and components for the two reactors after July 1993, since it had begun discussions with the United States about replacing the graphite-moderated reactors with light-water reactors. However, North Korea\u2019s explanation is insufficient for IAEA to rule out whether any additional nuclear equipment and components exist.", "The second problem involves the \u201cmixer settlers,\u201d which are part of a system that separates plutonium from uranium and fission products in the reprocessing facility. According to IAEA, North Korea informed IAEA that the mixers need to be maintained frequently to ensure that they operate in case the Agreed Framework collapses and North Korea chooses to resume its nuclear program. As a result, IAEA has not precluded access to the area or equipment and has allowed North Korea to operate the mixers for a brief time each month for maintenance purposes under inspectors\u2019 observation. While IAEA periodically performs short-notice inspections of the mixer area, IAEA cannot be sure that North Korea is operating the mixers within the permissible limit. IAEA wants to monitor the mixers on a continuous basis and, in January 1996, secured North Korea\u2019s agreement to demonstrate relevant equipment containing sensors that would detect instances when the mixers are operating. The sensors would permit IAEA to determine whether North Korea\u2019s use of the mixers is compatible with both (1) the equipment\u2019s maintenance needs and (2) North Korea\u2019s commitment to operate the mixers for only a brief interval each month. IAEA expects to install the equipment in North Korea in mid-1998.", "Third, IAEA has not been allowed to implement safeguards measures on the liquid nuclear waste tanks with instruments that would ensure that North Korea is not removing or altering the composition of the waste at the reprocessing facility. This issue is particularly important because, in addition to the monitoring issue, the tanks hold critical evidence about the history of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. IAEA has asked North Korea for permission to install instruments for monitoring the volume and composition (level and density) of the liquid in the nuclear waste tanks.According to an IAEA official, these safeguards measures are needed because seals and surveillance do not provide the required assurance\u2014the tanks are connected to a complex and inaccessible piping system that, if operating, would permit the waste to be removed and/or altered. While North Korea maintains that the system\u2019s valves are closed, IAEA is concerned that the valves\u2019 status is not verifiable and that North Korea could be using these or other valves and pumps to tamper with the tanks\u2019 contents. Such an activity would change the composition of the waste (i.e., alter its nuclear \u201cfingerprint\u201d and affect its subsequent analysis), thus violating the terms of the Agreed Framework. However, according to IAEA, whether this is occurring will not be known until North Korea agrees to allow the monitoring instruments to be installed. Thus far, North Korea has denied IAEA\u2019s repeated requests to install the instruments. North Korea has also denied IAEA\u2019s request to take environmental \u201cswipe\u201d samples at the facility and other types of analytical samples.", "Last, although IAEA has access to all critical nuclear facilities under the freeze, it has experienced difficulties in gaining regular access to some technical buildings at the frozen facilities. IAEA\u2014as a matter of normal practice in carrying out its safeguards inspections\u2014wants to obtain periodic access to all the technical buildings to ensure that they are not being used for unauthorized purposes. According to State Department and ACDA officials, negotiations between IAEA and North Korea in late 1994 and early 1995 resulted in, among other things, the identification of technical buildings at a facility site that would be subject to IAEA\u2019s monitoring measures under the freeze. According to IAEA, the procedures agreed to with North Korea envision IAEA\u2019s periodic visits to technical support buildings for which North Korea has stated that the buildings\u2019 scope of operations has changed. IAEA stated that, without such visits, the monitoring of the freeze would be limited to only certain buildings where IAEA\u2019s safeguards measures, including inspections, are already applied. However, according to IAEA, North Korea now says that while it agreed to freeze technical buildings that are directly related to its nuclear program, it did not agree to freeze those that are indirectly related to the program. Therefore, North Korea will consider IAEA\u2019s access for visits by inspectors only on a case-by-case basis. According to IAEA, the issue remains unresolved.", "According to information supplied by the State Department, the United States is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the \u201ccontinued lack\u201d of North Korean cooperation with IAEA\u2019s freeze-monitoring activities, including IAEA\u2019s efforts to monitor the liquid nuclear waste tanks and to help ensure that other information about North Korea\u2019s nuclear program is preserved. State Department guidance in 1996, for example, instructed U.S. delegates to IAEA to remind North Korea that the Agreed Framework requires North Korea to cooperate fully with IAEA in monitoring the freeze and that, \u201cby definition,\u201d full cooperation includes the preservation of information and data that might speak to the history of North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.", "While the Agreed Framework requires North Korea to cooperate fully with IAEA\u2019s freeze-monitoring activities, neither the Agreed Framework nor its subsequent implementing agreements, including the agreement for supplying the reactors, \u201cdefine\u201d or otherwise discuss North Korea\u2019s cooperation with IAEA on activities related to the preservation of information during the monitoring phase. Officials from the State Department and ACDA concurred with our understanding of the agreement. They explained that the guidance reflected an understanding of what is \u201cimplicit\u201d in the Agreed Framework\u2014namely, that the preservation of information will be essential in demonstrating North Korea\u2019s compliance with its safeguards agreement with IAEA.", "According to IAEA, the freeze-monitoring issues are unresolved, in part, because of a fundamental difference in view between IAEA and North Korea. Specifically, IAEA contends that its safeguards agreement with North Korea is valid and in effect and, as a result, that IAEA\u2019s activities in North Korea\u2014including its monitoring activities\u2014arise from its safeguards agreement with North Korea. According to IAEA, North Korea disagrees and says that its safeguards agreement with IAEA is currently invalid for the facilities subject to the freeze and, consequently, that its acceptance of IAEA\u2019s freeze-monitoring measures derives solely from the Agreed Framework. Furthermore, according to IAEA, North Korea asserts that it is cooperating fully with IAEA\u2019s freeze-monitoring measures because such outstanding issues as IAEA\u2019s monitoring of the liquid nuclear waste tanks relate to the verification of North Korea\u2019s 1992 nuclear declaration and, as a result, need not be resolved until much later in the Agreed Framework\u2019s implementation. (Activities related to IAEA\u2019s verification of North Korea\u2019s nuclear declaration and the timing of these activities are discussed in more detail later in this report.)"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "North Korea Is Generally Cooperating With IAEA\u2019s Inspections of Facilities Not Subject to the Freeze", "paragraphs": ["As part of the Agreed Framework, North Korea agreed to allow IAEA to resume certain types of facility inspections upon the conclusion of the agreement for supplying the two light-water reactors. IAEA had been inspecting North Korea\u2019s declared nuclear facilities in the years preceding the Agreed Framework. However, North Korea terminated the inspections after IAEA uncovered evidence suggesting that North Korea had not declared all of its nuclear material. Under the terms of the Agreed Framework, IAEA\u2019s inspections (as opposed to monitoring activities) need resume only at the facilities not subject to the freeze. The applicable facilities are (1) an experimental 8-megawatt thermal reactor (MW(t))\u2014a research reactor for isotope production and research in Yongbyon, (2) a nuclear fuel rod storage facility in Yongbyon, (3) about 30 locations scattered throughout North Korea that have small quantities of nuclear material, and (4) two other facilities that were identified as a \u201ccritical assembly\u201d for isotope production in Yongbyon and a \u201csubcritical assembly\u201d in Pyongyang. These facilities are smaller and generally less significant to North Korea\u2019s nuclear program than the facilities under the freeze.", "Following the conclusion of the light-water reactor supply agreement in December 1995, IAEA continued inspections at facilities not subject to the freeze in March 1996 and resumed inspections at the locations with small quantities of nuclear material scattered throughout North Korea. IAEA inspects most of the facilities a few times a year. The fuel rod storage facility is inspected more frequently because the facility is of greater importance to North Korea\u2019s nuclear program. Finally, through the end of February 1998, IAEA had also inspected a number of the approximately 30 locations scattered throughout North Korea. State Department and ACDA officials described North Korea\u2019s agreement to resume IAEA\u2019s inspections at these facilities as a \u201csignificant symbolic move\u201d because it represents the beginning of North Korea\u2019s gradual return to the international safeguards system.", "According to IAEA, North Korea is cooperating with IAEA\u2019s inspection activities at facilities not subject to the freeze with some limitations. Specifically, North Korea has permitted IAEA to take measurements of nuclear material at these facilities and has provided reports on the amount of nuclear material at them for IAEA\u2019s examination.

Consequently, the time when IAEA\u2019s verification activities may actually begin is uncertain.", "The delay in IAEA\u2019s verification of North Korea\u2019s nuclear declaration has been the subject of considerable disagreement. At the time when the Agreed Framework was signed, for example, opponents of the Agreed Framework argued that delaying IAEA\u2019s verification activities created a disturbing precedent that not only undermined IAEA\u2019s credibility and authority but also rewarded North Korea for its treaty transgressions. Critics also expressed concern that the Agreed Framework essentially allowed North Korea to renegotiate its treaty obligations so that\u2014unlike other treaty members\u2014North Korea need not provide information about its past activities for many years. In addition, critics expressed concern that North Korea may exploit the ambiguities in the Agreed Framework, including the absence of specific time frames for IAEA\u2019s determination of the accuracy and completeness of North Korea\u2019s nuclear declaration.", "However, according to official U.S. policy, as articulated by State Department and other U.S. government officials, the Agreed Framework did not undermine IAEA\u2019s credibility or authority. Instead, they said that the Agreed Framework demonstrates the United States\u2019 commitment to ensure that the issues identified by IAEA will be resolved. Furthermore, while U.S. government officials acknowledged that delaying IAEA\u2019s verification of North Korea\u2019s nuclear declaration was not preferable, they said that the trade-off was necessary because North Korea was intractable on this point during the negotiations on the Agreed Framework.According to them, the United States negotiated the best deal possible, given the circumstances at that time. They explained that North Korea\u2019s commitments under the Agreed Framework go far beyond North Korea\u2019s obligations under the treaty. Furthermore, they said that delaying IAEA\u2019s verification of North Korea\u2019s nuclear declaration did not compromise U.S. security interests because, according to them, the Agreed Framework ensures that the United States is not disadvantaged in any significant way if North Korea reneges on its commitments. For example, if North Korea backed out of the Agreed Framework in the early years, U.S. officials said that North Korea would have gained very little except modest amounts of heavy fuel oil and some technical assistance related to the safe storage of its spent fuel. Furthermore, if it reneges on its commitment to provide IAEA with information, North Korea will be left with only the \u201cempty shells\u201d of two light-water reactors.

Unfortunately, North Korea has neither provided the information nor agreed to any of IAEA\u2019s proposed interim measures for preserving it, and as a result, IAEA has reported that it has no assurance that the necessary information will be available later. According to IAEA officials, North Korea views IAEA\u2019s preservation requirements as excessive and premature in relation to the time frames established in the Agreed Framework. Furthermore, according to the officials, North Korea says that since it intends to make the information available to IAEA when the time comes, it is cooperating with both IAEA and the terms of the Agreed Framework."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Delay in Determining the Reactor\u2019s Operating History Is a Major Preservation-Related Problem", "paragraphs": ["A delay in determining the operating history of the 5-MW(e) reactor may be the most troublesome, complex, and costly preservation-related problem that IAEA faces under the Agreed Framework. As discussed, in the early 1990s, IAEA\u2019s inspections identified discrepancies suggesting, in IAEA\u2019s view, that North Korea had not declared all of its nuclear material. Specifically, contrary to North Korea\u2019s claim that it conducted a one-time reprocessing of damaged fuel rods, IAEA concluded that North Korea had reprocessed fuel on several occasions since 1989. Determining whether or not North Korea has diverted fuel from the reactor\u2019s core requires, among other things, measurements of (1) the total amount of plutonium in North Korea\u2019s spent fuel and (2) certain fission products in the discharged fuel. According to Department of Energy (DOE) officials, the amount of plutonium can be determined whenever North Korea permits IAEA to measure the fuel. However, measurements of the fission products become increasingly difficult over time because of their short-lived nature. IAEA had envisioned taking these measurements when the spent fuel was transferred into canisters for storage. However, according to IAEA, North Korea refused because, in its view, it was premature to perform the measurements.", "According to IAEA, it lost valuable information about the reactor\u2019s core in May 1994. This occurred because, while discharging the reactor, North Korea failed to accept IAEA\u2019s proposals to select, segregate, and secure fuel rods for IAEA\u2019s later measurement. Shortly thereafter, IAEA reported that the \u201csituation resulting from the core discharge was irreversible and had seriously eroded\u201d IAEA\u2019s ability to ascertain whether North Korea had declared all of its plutonium.", "As early as September 1995, IAEA reported that delaying the measurements over the next several years would result in some (unspecified) \u201climitations in accuracy\u201d and \u201csignificant additional cost\u201d if the containers need to be opened. Furthermore, over time it will no longer be possible to determine the rods\u2019 operating (irradiation) history using nondestructive methods. This is because the radioactive isotopes needed for the analysis are \u201cdying out.\u201d In addition, analyzing the aged and corroding fuel rods by \u201cdestructive\u201d methods is far more complex and expensive than using nondestructive methods.", "IAEA is investigating a variety of methods that might be used to verify the accuracy and completeness of North Korea\u2019s nuclear declaration. State Department and ACDA officials stressed, however, that the accuracy and timeliness of any of these methods will depend critically on (1) North Korea\u2019s willingness to permit measurements and samples to be taken at relevant sites and (2) the amount of money that the United States and other interested parties are willing to spend to perform the work."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The United States Is Concerned About the Preservation Issue", "paragraphs": ["According to information supplied by the State Department, the United States is \u201cdeeply concerned\u201d about the absence of tangible North Korean steps to preserve information about the country\u2019s past nuclear activities. A December 1996 State Department cable, for example, expressed deep concern about whether North Korea will fulfill this critical component of the Agreed Framework. The cable instructs U.S. delegates to IAEA to remind North Korea that if the Agreed Framework is to be fully realized, North Korea must take appropriate steps to resolve IAEA\u2019s concerns in this area. Similarly, a March 1997 cable instructs U.S. delegates to remind North Korea that, although it will be several years before the key reactor components are expected to be delivered, North Korea must prepare now so that IAEA\u2019s verification work can proceed smoothly and expeditiously.While the United States is concerned about the extent of North Korea\u2019s cooperation thus far, State Department officials stressed that North Korea will not receive the key nuclear components until it has complied fully with its safeguards agreement.", "In November 1997, a senior State Department official told us that the United States and IAEA continually stress to North Korea the importance of the preservation issue. The official distinguished between the preservation issue and IAEA\u2019s work in monitoring the freeze. Specifically, according to the official, while North Korea\u2019s reluctance to cooperate on the preservation of historically relevant information poses a long-term problem for the project, in the short term, there is \u201cno real problem\u201d and \u201cno alarming consequences\u201d in monitoring the freeze.

The specific timing of interim milestones\u2014such as the completion of a significant portion of the first reactor\u2019s construction\u2014is, by design, ambiguous and highly dependent on the actions of parties involved in implementing the Agreed Framework. The Agreed Framework\u2019s ambiguity about the timing of the project\u2019s interim milestones and its linkages to reciprocal actions by North Korea, creates the basis for North Korea\u2019s position that it is premature to resolve matters related to the preservation of vital information needed for IAEA\u2019s verification work.", "When the Agreed Framework was signed, the United States estimated that IAEA\u2019s verification work would begin in about 1999. Although site preparation work has begun for the reactor project, the reactor\u2019s construction schedule awaits the negotiation of two important instruments\u2014a contract between KEDO and its prime contractor and a \u201cdelivery schedule protocol\u201d with North Korea. If the conclusion of these activities were delayed, then IAEA\u2019s verification activities could be correspondingly delayed. Schedule delays increase the cost and difficulty of verifying North Korea\u2019s nuclear declaration and lessen the likelihood that IAEA will be able to make a definitive assessment about the accuracy and completeness of North Korea\u2019s nuclear declaration. Any protracted delays are likely to exacerbate these problems and could eventually result in the collapse of the Agreed Framework if IAEA cannot verify, with sufficient assurance, North Korea\u2019s nuclear declaration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the State Department, ACDA, DOE, and IAEA with a draft of this report for their review and comment.

For example, the officials acknowledged that IAEA has experienced problems associated with its monitoring of North Korea\u2019s nuclear freeze. However, they stressed that since North Korea\u2019s nuclear program remains frozen, the monitoring problems are not central to the implementation of the Agreed Framework and therefore have not jeopardized the agreement. Instead, the primary problem has been securing North Korea\u2019s cooperation in preserving information about its past nuclear activities.
