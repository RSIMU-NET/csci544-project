Based on information provided by the Department of Transportation, as of July 2006, the National Capital Region had 120,000 participants claiming roughly $140 million in benefits. Recently, inspectors general (IG) of various agencies have found numerous prior instances of fraud, waste, and abuse in this federal program. Based on both the significance of these IG findings and the amount of federal money spent on transit benefits, GAO was asked to (1) investigate allegations that federal employees in the National Capital Region are involved in fraud and abuse related to the transit benefits program, (2) identify the potential causes of any fraud or abuse that is detected, and (3) estimate the magnitude of fraud and abuse in the National Capital Region in 2006. To address these objectives, GAO identified federal employees selling their transit benefits on the Internet and obtained additional data from these sellers' employing agencies to determine whether more widespread problems existed. GAO also obtained the policies and procedures governing the transit benefits program at each of the employing agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["After investigating just 3 days of sales, GAO confirmed that at least 20 federal employees were fraudulently selling their Metrocheks on eBay. Most of the employees GAO interviewed admitted to falsifying their transit benefit applications and fraudulently selling their benefits. One GS-14 Department of the Treasury employee drove to work, parked for free in agency-provided parking, and was still able to collect $105 per month in Metrocheks--most of which he sold on eBay. Posing as buyers, GAO investigators also purchased Metrocheks from 3 federal employees fraudulently selling their benefits on Craigslist, a popular community Web site. GAO investigations revealed additional examples of federal employees inflating their transportation expenses on their transit benefit applications. Many of them admitted to intentionally falsifying their benefit applications to receive excess benefits. For example, a GS-11 Department of Transportation employee admitted to claiming the maximum allowable benefit of $105 per month when his actual commuting cost was only $54. Weaknesses in the design of program controls at the Departments of Commerce, Transportation, State, Homeland Security, Defense, and Treasury, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Patent and Trademark Office, and the U.S. Coast Guard can be associated with the fraudulent and abusive activity we identified. Although GAO did not conduct a comprehensive review of each agency's controls, the results from investigations illustrate flaws in the design of the controls. For example, GAO identified four employees who continued to receive transit benefits even though they were on extended absences from work, but none of the agencies had written policies requiring adjustment of benefits because of leave or travel. Using limited transit benefit records, we found that the possible magnitude of potentially fraudulent transit benefit payments during 2006 in the National Capital Region was more than $17 million. This order of magnitude is based on employees at Commerce, Transportation, Homeland Security, Defense, Treasury, IRS, and the Coast Guard who made false statements by requesting benefits they were not entitled to. Given the number of agencies not covered by our analysis, it is likely that this amount is significantly understated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss allegations of fraud and abuse  related to the federal government\u2019s transit benefits program. This program  was established by executive order in April 2000, and is intended to reduce  federal employees\u2019 contribution to traffic congestion and air pollution and  to expand their use of public transportation. In the Washington, D.C.,  National Capital Region, federal agencies are required to offer employees  tax-free transit passes for public transportation, to be used exclusively to  cover their actual out-of-pocket commuting expenses. In 2006, employees  could not receive more than $105 per month in transit passes.", "Agencies in the National Capital Region can either distribute these transit  passes directly to employees or contract with the Department of  Transportation for distribution. Based on information provided by  Transportation, as of July 2006, the portion of the program they administer  had approximately 250,000 participants who claimed about $250 million  worth of benefits. The National Capital Region constituted the largest part  of this program, with 120,000 participants claiming roughly $140 million  worth of benefits. These numbers do not include agencies that do not  contract with Transportation and administer their own programs. As  shown in figure 1, the transit passes themselves are issued by the  Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) in the form of  either Metrocheks, which are paper fare cards, or SmartBenefits, which  are electronic deposits to a transit debit card (called a SmarTrip card).", "As shown in the figure, WMATA labels paper Metrocheks with a warning  indicating that they may only be issued to qualified employees by  approved employers and that resale is illegal; SmarTrip cards are printed  with a similar warning. The inspectors general (IG) of various agencies  have identified numerous problems related to the transit benefits program,  including ineligible employees receiving benefits and a lack of policies and  procedures essential to preventing fraud, waste, and abuse.", "Based on both the significance of these IG findings and the amount of  federal funds spent on transit benefits, you asked us to (1) investigate  allegations that federal employees in the National Capital Region are  involved in fraud and abuse related to the transit benefit program,   (2) identify the potential causes of any fraud or abuse we detected, and   (3) estimate the magnitude of fraud and abuse in the National Capital  Region during 2006.", "To conduct our work, we investigated allegations of Internet sales of  transit benefits by federal employees in the National Capital Region. We  confirmed selected sellers\u2019 federal employment status in consultation with  federal IGs or offices of investigation and through Internet payment  records.

To determine whether other individuals at the  sellers\u2019 employing agencies were fraudulently using their benefits, we data  mined a nonrepresentative selection of transit benefit records, compared  employee home and work addresses, conducted further interviews, and  prepared additional case studies. To identify the potential causes of the  fraud and abuse we detected, we reviewed the written transit policies and  procedures at all the case study individuals\u2019 employing agencies. While we  were unable to develop a precise estimate of the magnitude of the  potentially fraudulent transit benefit payments that occurred in the  National Capital Region, we used available data to develop an order of  magnitude estimate. Specifically, we analyzed limited data from the case  study individuals\u2019 employing agencies and records from the National  Finance Center. For more information on the data used to develop our  calculations, see appendix I. It is important to note that we did not  conduct a comprehensive audit of the federal transit benefits program.  Rather, our investigation of allegations concerning individuals selling their  benefits over the Internet led us to conduct limited investigations at  specific agencies. Although we conducted corrective actions concerning  our investigative findings with these agencies, as discussed later in this  testimony, we are not issuing recommendations.

However, we found  that hundreds of these individuals did in fact request this maximum  amount, claiming more benefits than they needed to commute to work.  Although these individuals may have been eligible for a portion of the  transit benefits they requested, their applications should not have been  approved because they signed certifications stating that they would not  request benefits in excess of their monthly commuting costs (see figure 2).  As provided on the applications submitted by these employees, such  overstated requests constitute a potential violation of the False Statements  Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a71001.

First, we  narrowed our scope to seven agencies\u2014Commerce, Treasury, IRS,  Defense, Homeland Security, Coast Guard, and Transportation\u2014where we  identified employees selling their transit benefits on the Internet and for  whom we had sufficient data. We further narrowed our scope by limiting  our analysis to federal employees working at the headquarters buildings of  these seven agencies. We then identified a set of zip codes for each of the  seven agency headquarters buildings. Employees living within these zip  codes could not legitimately claim the maximum allowable benefit of $105  per month, no matter what combination of Metrobus and Metrorail they  used to commute to their places of employment. We identified  approximately 4,000 federal employees at the seven agencies that lived  within these zip codes, and determined that approximately 19 percent of  them may have fraudulently claimed the maximum benefit by providing  false statements on their applications in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  These potentially fraudulent claims represent about 25 percent of the $4  million claimed by the total selection of 4,000 employees. We then applied  this fraudulent payment rate to the roughly $70 million spent by the seven  agencies on the transit benefit program in the National Capital Region  during 2006 and determined that the possible magnitude of potentially  fraudulent transit benefit payments was more than $17 million.", "In this analysis, public transportation costs were calculated as the actual  costs incurred as a result of utilizing a combination of Metrobus and/or  Metrorail to commute to and from a place of employment. We used peak  fares (as opposed to nonpeak fares) for our calculations, because we  assumed that transit benefit participants were working during normal  business hours. We also assumed that the employees did not take any sick  or annual leave and worked at their headquarters offices five days per  week. In other words, we assumed that the employees did not have  alternative work schedules (i.e., they did not work four 10 hour days) and  they did not telecommute.", "We used information from the Department of Transportation (which is  responsible for administering the program for the selected agencies) and  the National Finance Center to identify employees from the seven selected  agencies whose homes of record are located within our defined area and  who were also claiming the maximum benefit. To confirm our conclusions  concerning these individuals, we tested a nonrepresentative selection of  our potentially fraudulent cases, identified their home address, and used  the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority\u2019s online Trip Planner  to determine the participant\u2019s actual daily, and then monthly, public  transportation costs. We interviewed these participants and confirmed  that the individuals we selected were not entitled to the maximum benefit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Federal Employees Fraudulently Selling Metrocheks on eBay", "paragraphs": ["The table below provides a complete listing of information on all the 20  eBay sellers we identified as federal employees.
