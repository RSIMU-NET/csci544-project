When GAO identified problems with the information EPA provided, the agency manually reconstructed data for fiscal years 1995 through 2002. The reconstructed data indicate that during this period 548 EPA employees filed 679 discrimination complaints, and the agency closed 588 complaints. Complaints were closed with 125 dismissals, 48 withdrawals, 178 settlements, 5 remands, and 222 agency decisions not supporting the claimant. GAO cannot attest to the accuracy of these numbers but believes they are indicative of the situation at EPA. EPA recently procured new software to facilitate accurate tracking and reporting of EEO information and believes the software will rectify data problems. EPA has never had official standard operating procedures for complaint processing, which are required by regulation. Rather, EPA said that complaints were processed under general guidance provided by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) until draft procedures, prepared in July 2001, were put into use. EPA has taken a long time to process discrimination complaints with cases averaging 650 days from filing to closing over fiscal years 1995-2002. A major contributing factor was that investigations, which are supposed to be done in 180 days, averaged a total of 465 days. The firms used by EPA failed to conduct thorough investigations and their reports did not provide complete or factual accounts of the incidents leading to the complaints. As a result, investigations often had to be redone, adding to the amount of time needed to complete them. Over the last year, EPA has discontinued the use of these firms and contracted with new ones that it believes are doing a much better job. EPA has also increased its own staffing for EEO matters to try to reduce processing times. EPA does not have a specific process for determining whether managers involved in discrimination complaints did in fact discriminate and if so whether managers should be disciplined. EPA officials told us that they have relied on training to rectify and prevent discriminatory conduct. Other agencies have formal processes to evaluate each case in which discrimination is found or a complaint is settled to determine whether discipline is warranted. EPA will be required to collect and report the number of agency employees disciplined for discrimination or harassment under the provisions of the Notification and Federal Employee Anti- Discrimination and Retaliation Act, effective in October 2003. A process like those in place at other agencies should also help EPA meet this requirement."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Four federal statutes-Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended;  the Equal Pay Act of 1963; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967-make it unlawful for a federal  employer to discriminate against an employee on the basis of race, color,  religion, sex, national origin, disability, or age.  For a number of years, some  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees reported that, based  on race, EPA officials treated them differently from other employees in  terms of promotion, retention, and other employment-related decisions and  retaliated against employees for filing complaints.  In addition, EPA has  faced charges that its Office of Civil Rights (OCR) has not conducted  proper and timely investigations of discrimination complaints, specifically  not meeting the 180-day time frame for completing complaint  investigations as required by regulation.  Moreover, the agency allegedly  did not take disciplinary action against managers found to have  participated in discriminatory conduct.", "These issues were the subject of hearings by the House Committee on  Science in the fall of 2000.

The Equal Pay Act of 1963 protects men and  women who perform substantially equal work in the same establishment  from sex-based wage discrimination (29 U.S.C.  206(b)).  The Age  Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as amended, prohibits  employment discrimination against individuals who are 40 years of age and  older (29 U.S.C. 621 et seq.).

Federal agencies are required to make reasonable  accommodations to qualified employees or applicants with disabilities  except when such accommodation would cause an undue hardship.   EEOC  is responsible for enforcing all of these laws.  In addition, a person who  files a complaint or participates in an investigation of an EEO complaint or  who opposes an employment practice made illegal under any of the  statutes enforced by EEOC is protected from retaliation or reprisal.", "EPA\u2019s EEO program, like those in other agencies, is subject to several  regulations.

Data fosters  transparency, which provides an incentive to improve performance and  enhance the image of the agency in the eyes of both its employees and the  public.  We initially requested discrimination complaint data for a 10-year  period (1991-2000).  However, OCR officials said they had no confidence in  discrimination complaint data prior to fiscal year 1995 because the data are  unreliable and source documents were not available to permit its  reconstruction.", "OCR provided discrimination complaint data for fiscal years 1995 through  2002; however, in reviewing these data, we found that the information was  incorrect.  These data understated the actual number of discrimination  complaints on hand, the number of new discrimination complaints filed,  the number of complaints closed, and the year ending numbers.   Also the  data provided to us differed from the discrimination complaint data  reported to EEOC.   For example, the number of discrimination complaints  on hand at the end of fiscal year 2000 was reported to us as 176, but EPA  reported to EEOC that the number was 264.  The number of new  discrimination complaints filed in 2000 was reported to us as 79, but the  number reported to EEOC was 75.", "After we pointed out some problems with the data, OCR manually reviewed  source documents and revised these numbers.

To determine if the numbers  provided for complaints on hand, new, closed, and ending were  supportable, we reviewed the information EPA reconstructed, including  handwritten notes.  We also selected a number of supporting documents  for review and found that the data reported agreed with the supporting  documentation.  These documents were also reviewed to determine if the  numbers of complaints reported to us matched those reported to EEOC.

The number of discrimination complainants is usually less  than the number of complaints filed because more than one complaint can  be made by a complainant.

In each year from  fiscal year 1996 to 2000, the number of cases settled at the agency  numbered less than 20, while 54 cases were settled in 2001.  These  settlements represented 44 percent of all discrimination complaint cases  closed in 2001.  According to agency officials, a number of settlements  were reached during 2001 as part of an effort to eliminate the large number  of backlogged complaints.", "Settlements can be achieved by different methods.  For example, for the  years 1996 through 2001, a total of 29 discrimination complaint cases were  settled at the EEOC hearing stage while another 7 cases were settled while  pending before federal district courts.  Beginning in 2000, as required by  EEOC, EPA began a program to make Alternative Dispute Resolution  (ADR) available in precomplaint and formal complaint processes.  The  agency uses mediation as its alternative method to resolve EEO complaints  and administrative grievances.   During the first 6 months of fiscal year  2003, there were 18 requests for mediation, of which 14 EEO cases were  accepted for mediation, 1 case is under review, and 3 cases are pending  further action.", "The data showed that headquarters discrimination complaints focused  mainly on race, reprisal, gender, and age.  The specific issues addressed in  these complaints were non-selection for promotion, appraisal, and  harassment.  Similarly, in regional offices the most often cited bases for  discrimination complaints were race, reprisal, and gender.

Leading organizations understand that  they must support their employees in learning how to effectively interact  with and manage people in a diverse work place.

Data of this nature are  important because they can be a starting point for agency decision makers  to understand the nature and scope of issues in the workplace involving  discrimination, reprisal, and other conflicts and problems, and can help in  developing strategies for dealing with those issues.", "Under the No FEAR Act signed into law in May 2002, agencies are required  to accumulate additional information about discrimination cases.  The  provisions of this act are to take effect October 1, 2003, and will require  EPA to begin tracking and accumulating data on disciplinary actions  resulting from discrimination.  Specifically, the act requires that federal  agencies file annual reports with Congress detailing, among other things,  the number of discrimination or whistleblower cases filed with them, how  the cases are resolved, and the number of agency employees disciplined for  discrimination, retaliation, or harassment.  These data requirements should  alert agencies and employees that they are accountable for their actions in  cases involving discrimination, retaliation, or harassment.  This legislation  demonstrates Congress\u2019s high level of interest in discouraging  discriminatory conduct and reprisal at federal agencies and the need for  managers to be held accountable for such conduct."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["EPA did not have accurate data on the numbers and types of discrimination  complaints made by its employees, and this in turn made discerning trends  in workplace conflicts, understanding the sources of conflict, and planning  corrective actions difficult.  These types of data are useful in helping to  measure an agency\u2019s success in adhering to merit system principles,  treating its people fairly and equitably, and achieving a diverse and  inclusive workforce.  Having a data software system that can track cases  and provide EEO managers with the information needed to discern trends  to enable the development of policies is critical.   EPA is relying on its  newly procured EEO data system to overcome its data accumulation and  reporting problems.   Moreover, the agency is relying on that system to  provide it the capability to track cases and identify trends that may indicate  problems areas.   This, in turn, illustrates the importance of the new  system\u2019s effective operation.", "EPA has never had standard operating procedures for EEO complaint  processing and has been using draft procedures prepared in July 2001.

If agency  employees have the impression that EPA\u2019s discrimination complaint  process does not discipline managers who participate in discriminatory  conduct, employees may be less willing to participate in the process.   Employees are less likely to file discrimination complaints if they perceive  that there is no benefit from doing so or if they fear reprisal.

The comments also did not  address our second recommendation about finalizing standard operating  procedures for handling EEO complaints that have been in draft for 2 years  and would be EPA\u2019s first set of official procedures.

This action should, when completed, address the part of the  recommendation related to disciplinary action when discrimination has  been found.  However, it does not address the part of the recommendation  dealing with the need to assess whether disciplinary action should be taken  in cases where allegations of discrimination are settled.
