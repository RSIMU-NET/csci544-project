Although part of an aviation system with an extraordinary safety record, there have been over 400 air cargo accidents and over 900 incidents since 1997, raising concerns about cargo safety. GAO's congressionally requested study addresses (1) recent trends in air cargo safety, (2) factors that have contributed to air cargo accidents, (3) federal government and industry efforts to improve air cargo safety and experts' views on the effectiveness of these efforts, and (4) experts' views on further improving air cargo safety. To perform the study, GAO analyzed agency data, surveyed a panel of experts, reviewed industry and government documents, and interviewed industry and government officials. GAO also conducted site visits to Alaska, Ohio, and Texas."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From 1997 through 2008, 443 accidents involving cargo-only carriers occurred, including 93 fatal accidents. Total accidents declined 63 percent from a high of 62 in 1997 to 23 in 2008. Small cargo carriers were involved in the vast majority of the accidents--79 percent of all accidents and 96 percent of fatal accidents. Although accident rates for large cargo carriers fluctuated during this period, they were comparable to accident rates for large passenger carriers in 2007. GAO could not calculate accident rates based on operations or miles traveled for small carriers because the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not collect the necessary data. Although several factors contributed to these air cargo accidents, our review of National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) data found that pilot performance was identified as a probable cause for about 80 percent of fatal and about 53 percent of non-fatal cargo accidents. Furthermore, GAO's analysis of NTSB reports for the 93 fatal accidents, using an FAA flight-risk checklist, identified three or more risk factors in 63 of the accidents. Risk factors included low pilot experience, winter weather, and nighttime operations. Alaska's challenging operating conditions and remotely located populations who rely on air cargo are also a contributing factor. Many federal efforts to improve air cargo safety focus on large carriers. Air cargo experts that GAO surveyed ranked FAA's voluntary disclosure programs--in which participating carriers voluntarily disclose safety events to FAA--as the most effective effort to improve air cargo, but two of the three main voluntary disclosure programs are used typically by large carriers. Several industry initiatives, however, focus on carriers with smaller aircraft, such as the Medallion Foundation, which has improved small aircraft safety in Alaska through training and safety audits. The two actions experts cited most often to further improve air cargo safety were installing better technology on cargo aircraft to provide additional tools to pilots and collecting data to track small cargo carrier operations. Using flight risk checklists can also help pilots assess the accumulated risk factors associated with some cargo flights."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The air cargo industry, which contributed over $37 billion to the U.S.  economy in 2008, provides businesses and individuals with quick delivery of  everything from small packages to heavy equipment. As part of the U.S.  commercial aviation industry, air cargo\u2014along with air passenger service\u2014 enjoys an extraordinary safety record. This record reflects the efforts of the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), airlines, manufacturers, the National  Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and others to maintain one of the safest  aviation systems in the world. Nevertheless, over 900 air cargo incidents and  over 400 accidents occurred from 1997 to 2008, including 93 fatal accidents  with 128 fatalities, raising concerns about air cargo safety. Given the  economic importance of the cargo aviation sector and concerns about its  safety, you asked that we examine the nature and extent of safety issues in  the air cargo industry and determine what is being done to address these  issues. While cargo is also carried by passenger air carriers, we focused on all- cargo (cargo-only) air carriers operating fixed-wing aircraft and addressed  the following questions:  1.  What have been recent trends in air cargo safety?  2.  What factors have contributed to air cargo accidents in recent years?  3.  What have FAA and the industry done to improve air cargo safety, and  how do experts view the effectiveness of these efforts?  4.  What do experts say FAA and industry could do to further improve air  cargo safety?", "To answer these questions, we obtained and analyzed accident data from  NTSB and incident, oversight, and enforcement data from FAA for all- cargo carriers operating fixed-wing aircraft. We assessed the reliability of  these data and determined that they were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes. We also surveyed a panel of 27 air cargo safety experts and  asked them to rate and provide relative rankings on the effectiveness of  current efforts to improve air cargo safety, the severity of challenges to air  cargo safety, and the potential improvements that additional efforts could  have on air cargo safety. With the assistance of the National Academy of  Sciences, we selected the panel of experts to represent the perspectives of  a cross-section of stakeholders, including pilots, carriers, manufacturers,  airports, federal government, and human factors and safety performance.  We also conducted site visits in Alaska, Ohio, and Texas because they  were geographically diverse and as the states with the largest number of  air cargo accidents or because of the relatively large number of air cargo  carriers of various sizes located there. Finally, we analyzed documents and  interviewed officials from FAA, NTSB, and air cargo industry  organizations and an employee group. We conducted our review from  December 2007 through June 2009 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Air cargo carriers fall into two distinct categories: (1) all- cargo carriers that transport only cargo and (2) passenger carriers that  transport cargo as belly freight in passenger aircraft. For the most part, all- cargo carriers can be categorized according to three business models: (1)  large carriers, such as United Parcel Service (UPS) and FedEx, which  operate large narrow-body and wide-body aircraft under part 121 of  federal aviation regulations; (2) feeder carriers, which operate midsize  and small aircraft (e.g., Cessna Caravans, Mitsubishi MU-2B-60s) under  part 135 or part 121 on regularly scheduled flights in support of large cargo  carriers; and (3) ad hoc carriers, which operate small aircraft (e.g., Cessna  401s, Beech Bonanzas) under part 135 and are individually contracted to  haul cargo out of smaller airports while not necessarily operating on a  regular schedule. Throughout this report, we use the term \u201csmall carriers\u201d  when referring to both feeder carriers and ad hoc carriers. Some carriers  operate under both part 121 and part 135, and one large carrier leases  aircraft to small carriers to provide feeder operations. (See fig. 1 for an  illustration of a large carrier feeder-ad hoc relationship.) FAA estimated  that as of May 6, 2009, the large all-cargo fleet contained 471 narrow-body  and 593 wide-body aircraft and the small carrier all-cargo fleet contained  1,515 aircraft.", "Several federal transportation agencies play significant roles in air cargo  safety. These agencies are FAA, the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT)  Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), and  NTSB.", "Two FAA offices in particular have important responsibility for the  oversight of air cargo carriers. First, FAA\u2019s Flight Standards Service  oversees cargo carrier operations conducted under parts 121 and 135. For  each carrier, Flight Standards assembles a team of inspectors (known as a  \u201ccertificate management team\u201d) led by principal inspectors who focus on  avionics, maintenance, or operations. For large carriers, dedicated teams  of inspectors use the risk-based Air Transport Oversight System (ATOS) to  carry out their duties. Under ATOS, inspectors develop surveillance plans  for each carrier based on data analysis and risk assessment, and adjust the  plans periodically in accordance with inspection results. For feeder and ad  hoc carriers operating under part 135, inspectors\u2014who unlike ATOS\u2019s  dedicated inspection teams may be assigned to multiple air carrier and  other certificates\u2014use the National Flight Standards Work Program  Guidelines (NPG) to ensure that carriers comply with safety regulations.  For NPG, Flight Standards annually identifies a minimum set of required  inspections to be undertaken. In addition, individual inspectors determine  annual sets of planned inspections based on their knowledge of and  experience with the carriers they oversee. Second, FAA\u2019s Office of  Security and Hazardous Materials enforces hazardous materials (hazmat)  safety policies and conducts annual inspections of cargo and passenger  carriers. Inspectors in this office work exclusively on issues related to  compliance with hazmat requirements. When violations of statutory and  regulatory requirements are identified, FAA has a variety of enforcement  tools at its disposal with which to respond, including administrative and  legal sanctions.", "In addition, PHMSA ensures the safe transport of hazmat by air and other  modes. PHMSA promulgates regulations concerning the types and  amounts of hazmat that can or cannot be transported by air\u2014often  differentiating between what hazmat can be carried on all-cargo versus  passenger aircraft\u2014and maintains its own database of hazmat incidents as  well as a portal that pulls together hazmat data from other databases.", "NTSB investigates and determines a probable cause for each U.S. aviation  accident, which is defined as \u201can occurrence associated with the operation  of an aircraft which takes place between the time any person boards the  aircraft with the intention of flight and all such persons have disembarked,  and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, or in which the  aircraft receives substantial damage.\u201d NTSB makes transportation safety  recommendations to federal, state, and local agencies and private  organizations to reduce the likelihood of recurrences of transportation  accidents but has no authority to enforce its recommendations. NTSB also  conducts annual reviews of aircraft accident data and determines U.S.  aviation accident and fatal accident rates. NTSB also periodically holds  public hearings and forums, and issues special studies on various  transportation safety topics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Cargo Accidents and Fatal Accidents Have Decreased, but Small Carriers Have Accounted for Higher Proportions of Both", "paragraphs": ["From 1997 through 2008, air cargo accidents and fatal accidents each  declined by about two-thirds.

Fatal air cargo accidents also decreased over our 12-year review period, falling  from 12 in 1997 to 4 in 2008. In addition, from the first to the second half of our  review period, fatal cargo accidents dropped from an average of 10 per year to  an average of 6 per year. The fluctuation in annual air cargo accidents could be  the result of a number of factors, including the general decline in aviation  activity after September 11, 2001; a fluctuation in overall U.S. aviation  accidents; and other factors.

It is possible to  calculate these rates because FAA requires those carriers to report  operational data (e.g., flight hours or departures).", "However, FAA does not require small on-demand carriers operating under  part 135 to report operational information, and the majority of feeder and ad  hoc cargo carriers fall into this group. In 2003, NTSB recommended that  FAA collect this type of data and, according to NTSB, FAA is still reviewing  the costs and benefits as well as options for collecting and processing the  data. However, the lack of data about the flight hours for small on-demand  carriers precludes calculation of the industry\u2019s current accident or fatality  rates or changes in the rates over time, making it difficult to determine  whether the industry is becoming more or less prone to accidents. Instead,  FAA relies on an annual survey of aircraft owners to form the basis for  estimates of small carrier operations, but this survey does not distinguish  between passenger and cargo operations, making it impossible to use the  survey estimates to calculate cargo or passenger accident rates for on- demand operations or for the cargo industry as a whole.", "Even though operational data are not available for small air cargo carriers,  their fatal accident rates would exceed those of large carriers for the latter  part of our review period. From 2005 through 2008, there were no fatal  accidents among large cargo carriers, so their fatal accident rate for those  years was zero. However, there were 17 fatal feeder and ad hoc accidents  over the same period, meaning that their fatal accident rate, if it could be  determined, would be higher than zero\u2014though it is unclear how much  higher. This logic would not hold for air cargo accidents in general  because large carriers had accidents in each year from 1997 through 2008,  though they had fewer accidents than the feeder and ad hoc carriers.

Our review determined that the second most  prominent cause of air cargo accidents was some type of equipment   equipment  failure or malfunction.  failure or malfunction.", "Pilots of small cargo aircraft have fewer human and other resources  available to them to help avoid mistakes or recover from unexpected  circumstances. Typically, there is no second pilot to share in the pilot\u2019s  many duties and help respond to emergencies. Eighty-one percent of the  fatal air cargo accidents from 1997 through 2008 were single-pilot flights.  The lack of a second pilot coupled with the many duties of a single pilot  merits a mention of the issue of pilot fatigue. Although NTSB indicated  fatigue as a contributing factor\u2014not a probable cause\u2014in just 4 of the 443  accidents in our data, 12 of 27 experts we surveyed ranked pilot fatigue as  one of the three most serious challenges to safe air cargo operations. The  view of the experts is not out of line with the accident record to the extent  that the concern about pilot fatigue has led to vigilance in identifying and  addressing fatigue issues.", "Further compounding the lack of pilot resources, cargo aircraft operated  under part 135 are not required to have on-board safety technology such as  a traffic collision and avoidance system, a terrain awareness and warning  system, or an autopilot, which could aid a single pilot in monitoring the  environment or responding to changing weather conditions. Most of these  systems are required for small passenger aircraft that also operate under  part 135.", "Additionally, small cargo aircraft may fly into airports where FAA does not  provide air traffic control services at all hours and the airports offer fewer  services than might be required for passenger operations. For example, at  the Bethel, Alaska, airport\u2014the transportation hub for the remote villages  in the area and the third-busiest airport in Alaska\u2014FAA provides air traffic  control services from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. from November to March and 2  hours later in other months, and the airport clears its runway of snow and  staffs its aircraft rescue and fire-fighting equipment only during operations  of passenger aircraft with more than 30 passenger seats."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Analysis Indicates That Most Fatal Accidents Involved Multiple Risk Factors", "paragraphs": ["We analyzed NTSB reports of the 93 fatal air cargo accidents that occurred  from 1997 through 2008 using FAA\u2019s Flight Risk Assessment Tool and identified  three or more risk factors in 63 of the accidents and four or more risk factors in  41 accidents.

While we do not know how the presence of these risk factors  differs from their occurrence during normal operations, the experts told us that  the unrecognized accumulation of multiple risk factors can create a potentially  dangerous situation. One 1997 fatal accident, which NTSB attributed to the  pilot\u2019s disregard of the preflight weather briefing for severe weather, involved  six risk factors. The pilot had not flown a minimum number of hours during the  previous 90 days, had not accumulated a minimum amount of experience flying  the aircraft type involved in the accident, and was flying solo.

Alaska is more dependent on aviation for the transport  of goods and people than other states because it lacks a comprehensive  road system. Less than 10 percent of the state is accessible by road.  Therefore, goods must be transported to remote villages via air or barge,  and barge transport is not an option during the winter months. These  factors make Alaska highly dependent on cargo aircraft, which often fly  into poorly maintained airports that often do not meet FAA standards.  Consequently, most of the accidents in Alaska involved small aircraft.  Alaska is also subject to unusual weather conditions. Taken together, we  believe these challenges render Alaska more susceptible to aviation  accidents and fatal accidents than other states.", "Of the 27 experts we surveyed, 5 ranked operating conditions in Alaska as  one of the top three challenges to the safe operation of cargo flights; in  addition, 12 experts in our panel indicated that Alaskan operating  conditions do pose at least moderate challenges to safety, whereas 2  experts (a pilot of large aircraft and a government official) said these  conditions were not a challenge.

According to our review of the NTSB accident data, only three cargo  accidents involved hazmat. They occurred in 1997, 1998, and 2006 to large  carriers, and none resulted in fatalities. The 2006 accident resulted in an  NTSB hearing and recommendations that we discuss later in this report.", "The problem of undeclared hazmat was cited primarily by government and  large carrier experts in our survey. Specifically, three of the four  government experts and two of the three large carrier experts cited it as  the most serious challenge to air cargo safety. These opinions may stem  from the previously cited fires and the relative rarity of a destroyed  aircraft among large carriers, as well as government concerns about the  transport of lithium batteries on aircraft.", "FAA hazmat officials told us that undeclared shipments of hazardous  materials represent the biggest challenge they face and that lithium batteries  are the most challenging type of hazmat in air transportation. We reported in  January 2003 that FAA, in the early 1990s, identified a number of incidents  associated with batteries, particularly lithium batteries, aboard aircraft in  which the batteries caused fires, smoke, or extreme heat. In response to  these and other concerns, DOT took a number of actions designed to  strengthen the regulations for the transportation of lithium batteries. In  January 2008, NTSB noted that lithium batteries had been involved in at least  9 aviation incidents, and both primary and secondary lithium batteries are  regulated as hazardous materials for the purposes of transportation. In  December 2007, NTSB made six recommendations to PHMSA following a  UPS aircraft fire at Philadelphia International Airport in February 2006, in  which a number of secondary lithium batteries were found in the accident  debris. The recommendations included requirements for transporting  primary lithium batteries in fire-resistant containers and stowing cargo  containing secondary lithium batteries in crew-accessible locations so that  any fire hazards can be quickly addressed. These recommendations remain  open with acceptable responses from PHMSA because they have not yet been  implemented, but according to NTSB, actions are planned that, if  satisfactorily completed, may comply with the safety recommendations. FAA  and PHMSA have embarked on a lithium battery action plan, which aims to  reduce the risk associated with the transport of batteries on aircraft by  passengers and as cargo. The primary focus of this plan is all types of lithium  batteries. According to DOT, PHMSA and FAA have also initiated a rule- making project to consider additional measures to enhance the safety of  lithium battery shipments such as packaging, hazard communication, and  stowage requirements.  PHMSA plans to publish a notice of proposed  rulemaking by December 2009. FAA, the Air Line Pilots Association, and  PHMSA also issued safety alerts or advisories in 2007 that addressed smoke  and fire hazards, recommended crew actions in the event of a battery fire,  noted the availability of guidance for the safe transport of batteries and  battery-powered devices on board aircraft, and provided information on  proper packing and handling procedures for these batteries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Large Numbers of Air Cargo Incidents May Be Precursors to Accidents", "paragraphs": ["Although our analysis for this study included 443 air cargo accidents,  cargo carriers were involved in more than twice as many incidents during  the first 11 years of our review period, and FAA and others recognize that  incidents are potential precursors to more serious accidents. In an analysis  of air cargo data for 1997 through 2007 from FAA\u2019s Accident/Incident Data  System, we identified over 900 air cargo incidents. These incidents  covered a broad set of events, such as an engine losing power at 7,000 feet;  a cargo door opening in flight; and an aircraft engine coming into contact  with a fuel truck. FAA does not use incident data to identify precursors to  aviation accidents, because the data were not developed for this purpose.  However, the agency is moving toward using data to better identify  precursors to accidents, but until it does so, it may be missing  opportunities to make air cargo operations and aviation, in general, safer.  For example, from 2000 to 2007, one ad hoc cargo carrier was listed in  FAA\u2019s database 10 times with incidents that resulted in varying degrees of  damage to its aircraft, from none to substantial, and in NTSB\u2019s database  with one non-fatal accident. This carrier subsequently experienced a fatal  accident in 2008. Had this carrier\u2019s incident data been used to identify  accident precursors, inspectors might have been alerted to underlying  problems that might have been addressed, potentially preventing the  subsequent fatal accident. In addition, NTSB\u2019s accident database also does  not track incidents in a way that would allow empirical analysis.", "The notion that incidents can be precursors to more serious accidents is  accepted both inside and outside aviation. NASA\u2019s Aviation Safety  Reporting System collects, analyzes, and responds to aviation safety  incident reports voluntarily submitted by pilots and others to lessen the  likelihood of aviation accidents. In its 2005 Safety Management Manual,  the International Civil Aviation Organization noted that for accidents,  there are precursors evident before the accident, and focusing solely on  instances of serious injury or significant damage is a wasted opportunity,  since the factors contributing to such accidents may be present in  hundreds of incidents. The International Civil Aviation Organization  further noted that \u201ceffective safety management requires that staff and  management identify and analyze hazards before they result in accidents,\u201d  particularly since there is the opportunity \u201cto identify why the incidents  occurred and, equally, how the defenses in place prevented them from  becoming accidents.\u201d The National Academy of Engineering undertook an  accident precursor project in February 2003, which culminated in a report  that included aviation accident precursor analysis and management.

The three major ones are Flight Operations Quality  Assurance (FOQA), the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP), and the  Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program (VDRP). At the current time,  FOQA is used only by large carriers because of the level of technology  required and ASAP is not typically used by small carriers.", "FOQA collects and makes available for analysis digital flight data  generated during the normal operations of the 23 participating carriers. As  of January 2008, the only cargo carriers participating in FOQA were large  carriers. Participating carriers pay for the special flight data recorders that  can record FOQA data; these recorders cost approximately $20,000 each.  Although such an investment can be expensive for some air carriers, some  aircraft models come with the data recorder already built in. However,  smaller carriers tend to operate older aircraft, which lack the data  recorder equipment.", "ASAP encourages industry employees to report safety information that  may be critical in identifying potential precursors to accidents. Under this  program, employees of air cargo carriers and other participating entities  report safety events, which a committee that includes the carrier, the  employee labor group, and FAA then reviews and determines appropriate  corrective actions, such as remedial training. FAA agrees not to pursue  enforcement actions for safety violations reported exclusively under this  program. As of December 2008, 73 carriers participated in ASAP,  including 8 cargo carriers. Seven of these 8 cargo carriers were large  carriers, possibly because large carriers are more likely than small carriers  to have the time and resources required for participation. Officials from an  ad hoc carrier we interviewed said it was not practical for their carrier to  enter into an agreement with FAA and then organize meetings to discuss  disclosures when the carrier could operate an informal safety issue  disclosure program internally.", "VDRP encourages regulated entities, such as air carriers or repair stations,  to voluntarily report instances of regulatory noncompliance. FAA does not  take legal action on VDRP disclosures, but a violation with the same root  cause can be reported only once by a carrier.

Under ATOS, principal inspectors  are assigned to just one part 121 carrier. Our interviews with part 121  carriers and FAA inspectors revealed mixed opinions about ATOS. Some  of the carriers, particularly the smaller part 121 carriers, indicated that  transitioning to ATOS was too complicated and costly and that its focus on  administrative reviews has reduced the number of on-site FAA inspections  they receive. In addition, some FAA inspectors said that the ATOS  paperwork is time consuming and can have the effect of tethering them to  their computers. For example, officials from a small part 121 air carrier  said that they had to hire a full-time person to work on implementing  ATOS as well as spend over $500,000 to hire a company to help revise the  carrier\u2019s manuals to satisfy FAA requirements under ATOS. However,  officials from a large carrier indicated that ATOS is a more effective  oversight system than NPG once it is fully implemented. In addition, some  officials from large carriers said that the bureaucratic nature of ATOS  limited the amount of direct oversight they receive. FAA officials said that  ATOS does not impose new requirements on carriers, and FAA does not  require carriers to set up an ATOS program. FAA officials also said that  because ATOS is more robust than the oversight system it replaced\u2014 NPG\u2014inspectors may find omissions in manuals that were overlooked  before. Carriers may then be required to correct these deficiencies to meet  regulatory requirements. In addition, FAA officials said they are exploring  options for reducing the time inspectors spend at their computers and  increasing the time they spend doing hands-on inspections. For example,  FAA officials said that FAA is reducing the number of ATOS program  elements in order to make inspection planning and management easier.", "The 303 part 135 carriers remain under the NPG system, which requires  all active carriers to be inspected at least once a year and sets the numbers  of required inspections nationally and planned inspections at the local  level.

There is nothing  intrinsic to small carriers that precludes risk-based oversight, voluntary  disclosure programs, or the use of SMSs, but these efforts are usually  targeted toward, or at least primarily used by, the large cargo carriers.

From these data we identified 443 fixed-wing aircraft accidents, including  93 fatal accidents. Six of the accidents involved 2 aircraft, so our data  included a total of 449 accident aircraft.", "From FAA, we obtained data on part 121 and part 135 fixed-wing all-cargo  accidents and incidents that occurred from January 1, 1997, through  December 31, 2007. From these data, we eliminated accidents that were  also included in the NTSB data, for a total of 937 accidents and incidents.  To avoid confusion when discussing the two data sets, we refer to the FAA  data as \u201cincidents\u201d and the NTSB data as \u201caccidents.\u201d", "Because we are familiar with and have previously determined that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the nationwide descriptive and  comparative analyses used in this report, we interviewed agency officials  knowledgeable about the databases from which the data were derived to  determine that the accident and incident data used in this report continue  to be sufficiently reliable for the types of analyses we performed. We also  obtained information on industry trends by conducting a literature search  and reviewing the resulting documents, conducting a survey of air cargo  experts, and interviewing officials and reviewing relevant documents from  FAA, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration  (PHMSA), air cargo industry associations, air cargo carriers, airports, an  employee group, and others.", "We also conducted site visits to Alaska, Ohio, and Texas. Those locations  were selected to be geographically diverse and as the states with the  largest number of air cargo accidents or because of the relatively large  number of air cargo carriers of various sizes located there.", "To assess what factors have contributed to air cargo accidents in recent  years, we conducted several analyses. First, to determine prominent  accident causes, we analyzed data on probable causes and contributing  factors from completed NTSB investigations of 417 air cargo accidents.  Second, to assess accumulated risk, we applied FAA\u2019s proposed flight risk  assessment tool to NTSB\u2019s reports on the 93 fatal cargo accidents that  occurred during our review period. To do this, we searched each accident  report for the 38 risk factors in the tool, such as \u201cpilot flight time less than  100 hours in the last 90 days.\u201d For each factor found, we noted its  corresponding risk value on an Excel spreadsheet and tabulated the total  score as well as the total number of risk factors for each fatal accident.  Third, for indications of other factors contributing to air cargo accidents,  we surveyed a panel of air cargo experts, which is discussed in more detail  later below; analyzed documents and interviewed officials from FAA,  PHMSA, NTSB, air cargo industry associations, air cargo carriers, airports,  an employee group, and others; and conducted site visits to Alaska, Ohio,  and Texas (see the previous paragraph).", "To determine what FAA and the air cargo industry have done to improve  safety, we interviewed FAA and industry officials, reviewed key  documents, and analyzed FAA\u2019s oversight and enforcement data for all- cargo carriers. We interviewed officials and tested the data and found it  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To obtain experts\u2019 opinions about  how FAA and the air cargo industry could further air cargo safety, we  surveyed a panel of 27 air cargo safety experts. The experts rated and  provided relative rankings on the effectiveness of current efforts to  improve air cargo safety, the severity of safety challenges faced by the air  cargo sector of aviation, and the potential improvements that additional  efforts could have on air cargo safety. We selected the panel of experts  with the assistance of the National Academy of Sciences to represent the  perspectives of a cross-section of air cargo stakeholders. The specific  experts, their affiliation, and their expert perspectives are listed below.", "To develop our survey of air cargo experts, we reviewed existing studies  about air cargo safety, including previous and ongoing GAO work, and  interviewed air cargo safety stakeholders. GAO subject matter experts  designed draft questionnaires in close collaboration with a social science  survey specialist. We conducted pretests with four people knowledgeable  in the field of air cargo (representatives from air carriers, airports, and air  transportation associations) to help further refine our questions, develop  new questions, clarify any ambiguous portions of the survey, and identify  any potentially biased questions. These pretests were conducted in-person  and by telephone. We worked with the National Academy of Sciences and  internally to develop the panel of experts and obtain contact information.", "We launched our Web-based survey on August 18, 2008, and received all  responses by November 5, 2008. Log-in information to the Web-based  survey was e-mailed to participants. We sent one follow-up e-mail message  to all nonrespondents a week later, and contacted by telephone all those  who had not completed the questionnaire within 3 weeks. We received  responses from all 27 of our selected experts.", "Because our survey was not a sample survey, there are no sampling errors;  however, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce  nonsampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question  is interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents, or the  types of people who do not respond can introduce unwanted variability  into the survey results. We included steps in both the data collection and  data analysis stages for the purpose of minimizing such nonsampling  errors. As indicated above, GAO subject matter experts collaborated with  a social science survey specialist to design draft questionnaires, and  versions of the questionnaire were pretested with four knowledgeable  people in the air cargo field. From these pretests, we made revisions as  necessary. We examined the survey results and performed computer  analyses to identify inconsistencies and other indications of error. A  second, independent analyst checked the accuracy of all computer  analyses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Expert Responses to GAO Survey", "paragraphs": ["We worked with the National Academy of Sciences to identify air cargo  experts that included carrier, pilot, airport, aircraft manufacturer,  government, and human factors and safety performance perspectives.
