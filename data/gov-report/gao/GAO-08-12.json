U.S Coast Guard (USCG) guidance calls for an annual inspection to ensure that plans are being followed. Federal law enacted in October 2006 required such facilities to be inspected two times a year--one of which is to be conducted unannounced. The USCG plans to conduct one announced inspection and the other as a less comprehensive unannounced \"spot check.\" GAO examined the extent to which the USCG (1) has met inspection requirements and found facilities to be complying with their plans, (2) has determined the availability of trained personnel to meet current and future facility inspection requirements, and (3) has assessed the effectiveness of its facility inspection program and ensured that program compliance data collected and reported are reliable. GAO analyzed USCG compliance data, interviewed inspectors and other stakeholders in 7 of 35 USCG sectors of varying size, geographic location, and type of waterway."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["We could not determine the extent to which the USCG has met inspection requirements because its compliance database does not identify all regulated facilities to establish how many should have been inspected. While the USCG estimates there are about 3,200 facilities requiring inspection, their records indicate 2,126 annual inspections were conducted in 2006. Headquarters officials said field units reported that all required facility inspections were conducted. However, officials also said some inspections may not have been recorded, or were delayed by staff being diverted for natural disasters. The USCG identified deficiencies in about one-third of inspections, mainly for problems with access controls or missing documentation. Over 80 percent of deficiencies identified by the USCG were resolved by facility operators without the USCG applying formal enforcement actions. Although USCG officials believe they have enough trained inspectors to conduct current and future inspections, two additional factors could affect the USCG's estimates of the number of inspectors needed. First, facility inspectors balance security inspections with other competing duties, such as safety or pollution checks, and giving priority to security inspections could affect these other duties, inspectors said. Second, new guidance for spot checks calls for these checks to be more detailed--and perhaps more time-consuming--than some USCG units conducted in the past. For example, the guidance now requires an on-site visit, whereas some units had allowed the check to be a drive-by observation. The effect of the new guidance on resource requirements in these units is unknown. The USCG has not assessed the effectiveness of its facility inspection program. Headquarters guidance gives considerable discretion to local USCG units in deciding how to conduct facility inspections--for example, deciding whether a fine is warranted. The USCG has little or no information, however, on which approaches work better than others and is therefore limited in being able to make informed decisions in guiding the program. Flaws in USCG's database, including missing, duplicate, and inconsistent information, complicate the USCG's ability to conduct such analyses or provide other information for making management decisions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The security of more than 3,200 terminals, chemical plants, factories, and  power plants plays an important role in the protection of our nation\u2019s  ports. Ports and waterways represent attractive targets for terrorist attack,  given their importance to the economy, abundance of specific targets,  proximity to large populations, and accessibility by water and land. To  reduce the opportunity for terrorists to exploit security vulnerabilities, as  well as to help minimize the effects of accidents or natural disasters,  facilities are required to implement security plans to maintain physical,  passenger, cargo, and personnel security and may utilize measures such as  fences, security guards, and monitoring activities using cameras.  Efficiently implementing such plans can reduce the potential for  unauthorized entry and help prevent vulnerabilities from being exploited  to kill people, cause environmental damage, or disrupt transportation  systems and the economy.", "Much of the federal framework for port security is contained in the  Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA). MTSA establishes  requirements for various layers of maritime security, including requiring a  national security plan, area security plans, and facility and vessel security  plans.  The act calls for various types of facilities to develop and  implement a security plan, and it places federal responsibility for  approving and overseeing these plans with the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS). DHS has placed lead responsibility for this and other  MTSA requirements with the U.S. Coast Guard. Subsequent Coast Guard  guidance in 2003-2004 called for conducting annual on-site inspections to  verify a facility\u2019s compliance with its security plan. The guidance also calls  for the Coast Guard to provide additional oversight at any time based on  perceived risk.", "In 2004 we reviewed the implementation of these and other MTSA  provisions. We reported that facility owners and operators had made  progress in developing their security plans but expressed concerns about  challenges the Coast Guard faced in ensuring enough well-trained  inspectors and equipping them with adequate guidance to conduct  thorough, consistent reviews. We reported that the Coast Guard was in an  initial \u201csurge\u201d period during which it had to cope with reviewing security  plans submitted at the time for more than 3,000 facilities and over 9,000  vessels. We recommended that after this initial 6-month period, the Coast  Guard use the experience to evaluate its initial compliance strategy and  take steps to strength the compliance process for the long term.", "Since 2004, requirements for inspecting maritime facilities have increased.  The Security and Accountability For Every Port Act (SAFE Port Act),  enacted in October 2006, among other things, amended MTSA to direct the  Coast Guard to inspect facility compliance with its approved facility  security plan periodically, but not less than two times per year, at least one  of which shall be an inspection of the facility that is conducted without  notice to the facility. Thus, in effect, under the SAFE Port Act maritime  facility inspection requirements, in addition to an annual inspection, the  Coast Guard is also required to make a second unannounced inspection of  each MTSA facility.", "You asked us to review the Coast Guard\u2019s progress in dealing with these  expanded inspection requirements and developing a sound oversight  strategy. This report addresses the extent to which the Coast Guard    has met its maritime facility inspection requirements and has found  facilities to be in compliance with their security plans,    has determined the availability of trained personnel to meet current  and future facility inspection requirements, and    has assessed the effectiveness of its MTSA facility oversight program  and ensured that program compliance data collected and reported are  reliable.", "To address these questions, we conducted work at Coast Guard  headquarters and at various ports in seven of the Coast Guard\u2019s 35  sectors. Within each sector, we interviewed Coast Guard officials and  inspectors, facility security officials at 29 selected MTSA facilities, and  other port stakeholders. We obtained and analyzed data from 2004-2006 on  Coast Guard\u2019s facility compliance activities from the Marine Information  for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) database, which is the agency\u2019s  primary data system for documenting facility oversight and other  activities. As discussed later in this report, we identified some problems  with the data, and worked with agency officials to address these problems  to the extent possible. To assess the reliability of the data, we (1)  performed electronic testing for obvious errors in accuracy and  completeness;(2) reviewed related documentation, such as guidance for  entering data in MISLE; and (3) held meetings and exchanged  correspondence with Coast Guard information systems officials to discuss  data entry and analysis and ensure correct identification of specific data  fields. We removed 77 records that Coast Guard indicated to be duplicate  records, created a dataset linking deficiencies and enforcement actions  and worked with Coast Guard to reduce data inconsistencies, and created  a new \u201cSector\u201d field based on Coast Guard identification of the  appropriate sector. Based on the steps we took to assess data reliability  and our work with Coast Guard officials to resolve problems with the data,  we found the data to be sufficiently reliable to provide a general indication  of Coast Guard compliance activities. We also reviewed a variety of  documents, such as pertinent MTSA provisions, as amended, and their  implementing regulations, Coast Guard circulars, and reports related to  port security. A more detailed description of our scope and methodology  is contained in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2006 through February  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

MTSA and  Coast Guard implementing regulations establish requirements for owners  and operators currently at about 3,200 select port facilities. In general,  facilities that receive vessels that carry large or hazardous cargo, vessels  subject to international maritime security standards, selected barges, and  passenger vessels certified to carry more than 150 passengers are subject  to MTSA regulations.", "Owners or operators of facilities subject to MTSA regulations (MTSA  facilities) were required, among other things, to designate a Facility  Security Officer (FSO), ensure that a facility security risk assessment was  conducted, and ensure that a facility security plan was approved and  implemented. The basic aim of such plans is to develop measures to  mitigate potential vulnerabilities that could otherwise be exploited to kill  people, cause environmental damage, or disrupt transportation systems  and the economy. Facility Security Plans (FSP) encompass a range of  security activities, such as access controls and security training to prevent  a security incident. MTSA and its regulations set out requirements that are  performance-based rather than requiring specific procedures or  equipment, thus allowing flexibility for meeting the law\u2019s requirements.  For example, a facility\u2019s plan must include measures to control access to  the facility, but how access should be specifically controlled is not  mandated by MTSA or its implementing regulations.", "The Coast Guard is largely responsible for administering MTSA  requirements. For facilities, in addition to issuing regulations, the Coast  Guard is responsible for review and approval of facility security plans,  ensuring that facilities implement the plans, verifying that facilities  continue to adhere to their plans, and for re-approving facility security  plans periodically, which were established by Coast Guard regulations as  valid for 5 years. The Coast Guard reported that security plans required for  over 3,000 MTSA facilities as of July 1, 2004 were approved, and that it had  verified that these plans were in place by December 31, 2004.

Key concerns  were how the Coast Guard planned to ensure that enough inspectors were  available, that they would have a training program sufficient to overcome  major differences in inspector experience levels, and that inspectors  would be equipped with adequate guidance to help conduct thorough,  consistent reviews. Further, we reported that the Coast Guard faced the  challenge of ensuring that owners and operators continue implementing  their plans and do not mask security problems in ways that do not  represent the normal course of business. In this regard, our work has  shown that there are options the Coast Guard could consider beyond  regularly scheduled visits, such as unscheduled, unannounced visits, and  covert testing.

Reasons this official and others cited for some facilities  possibly not receiving an exam during 2006 included the following:   Inspectors were diverted to a higher-priority mission. Officials said that  activities conducted after Hurricanes Rita and Katrina disrupted  inspection activities in the areas affected by the hurricanes and  diverted Coast Guard resources from other regions.

The database  can identify which facilities received annual exams in a particular year,  but it cannot identify those facilities that did not receive exams but should  have. Our analysis of MISLE data on the number of exams reported,  however, indicates the total is less than the number of facilities the Coast  Guard believes it is regulating. The Coast Guard estimates the number of  MTSA facilities at about 3,200 nationwide, based on the number of facility  security plans currently approved. Our analysis of MISLE data indicated  2,126 facilities received exams during 2006.", "Coast Guard data show that prior to the SAFE Port Act\u2019s requirement that  each facility receive an unannounced inspection, Coast Guard units were  conducting unannounced spot checks, but not at every facility.

The SAFE Port Act\u2019s requirement  for each facility to receive two inspections was not effective until October  2006.", "Coast Guard officials said that, prior to the SAFE Port Act\u2019s new  unannounced inspection requirement, units used a combination of risk  and convenience to decide which facilities should receive spot checks. As  a result, some facilities received a number of checks in a year\u2019s time, while  others received none. For example, Coast Guard officials at two sectors  said if inspectors are frequently at a facility to examine arriving vessels,  they also have an opportunity to conduct a spot check of the facility\u2019s  security measures. Several sectors we visited mentioned that they had a  goal, even before the new requirement took effect, of spot checking every  facility, but officials at these sectors said the risk-based approach took  precedence, leading to numerous checks at facilities with higher risk.", "Given the resources provided in DHS fiscal year 2007 appropriations,  related Coast Guard allocations, and the number of spot checks conducted  in prior years, Coast Guard officials said they expect sectors to meet\u2014and  likely exceed\u2014the spot-check requirements. At sectors we visited where  additional staffing resources (temporary reservists and permanent staff)  were in place, local officials generally agreed with this assessment.

Headquarters and sector officials told us that, in  keeping with Coast Guard policy allowing the practice, inspectors may  choose not to record such deficiencies. For example, a facility security  officer at one oil facility said the Coast Guard gave him a verbal warning  about the failure to display credentials at entrance gates and maintaining  better documentation of security drills conducted at the facility. Similarly,  the security officer at a gypsum facility said inspectors had suggested  more creativity in crafting facility exercise scenarios (which the facility  official said he would try to do) but inspectors had not recorded a  deficiency.", "About 70 percent of the 2,500 reported deficiencies identified in 2006  occurred in five categories: access control (such as fences or gates  needing repair), recordkeeping requirements, security for restricted areas  (such as not posting required signs), drill and exercise requirements, and  facility security plan amendment (for example failing to get approval for  changing a security measure) and deficiencies related to the facility  security plan or conducting a facility security audit.

We observed four instances in which a neighboring  facility\u2019s building or stacked-up materials would facilitate entry over a  regulated facility\u2019s perimeter fencing. Figure 4 shows one of those  instances. After we pointed out these weaknesses to Coast Guard  officials, they assured us that the weaknesses would be corrected. Coast  Guard officials told us that any vulnerabilities introduced by neighboring  facilities (whether the neighboring facility is a MTSA facility or not) should  be identified in a facility\u2019s vulnerability assessment, then addressed in a  facility\u2019s security plan.", "While about one-third of all facilities had at least one deficiency identified  and recorded during an annual inspection or spot check, deficiencies in  the seven sectors we visited tended to be concentrated in relatively few  facilities. According to MISLE data, five or fewer facilities accounted for  an average of 61 percent of deficiencies in six of the seven sectors we  visited, and 10 or fewer facilities accounted for an average of 80 percent.  One facility that receives passenger vessels in one sector we visited was  cited for 12 deficiencies during its annual compliance exam. This facility\u2019s  deficiencies related primarily to (1) lack of knowledge about security  procedures or equipment on the part of the security officer or other  personnel and (2) failure to conduct or document security drills and  exercises.", "Coast Guard officials at the sectors we visited said they thought security  awareness and procedures had improved in the years since MTSA\u2019s  inception. Atlantic Area Coast Guard officials cited MTSA as making a  difference in reducing cargo loss as increased security procedures lower  theft rates. Officials cited qualitative changes such as the following:  facilities taking more ownership of their own security and being more  aware of security concerns,  fewer trespassers on waterfront property and increasing security  awareness among maritime workers,    decrease in vandalism as a result of additional cameras in port areas   more informed security personnel, and  improved communication with facilities regarding break-ins.", "Our analysis of the top deficiencies included in the Coast Guard\u2019s database  showed that Coast Guard inspectors identified deficiencies both in spot  checks and in annual exams, but spot checks tended to identify  deficiencies related to access control and control over restricted areas.

Other tasks included  responding to pollution incidents, supervising the handling of explosive  cargo, monitoring the transfer of oil, conducting harbor patrols, boarding  vessels, and conducting inspections of vessels or other matters, such as  safety or environmental concerns (see fig. 5).", "At four of the seven sectors we visited, officials said meeting all mission  requirements for which inspectors were responsible was or could be a  challenge, especially after reservists made available for SAFE Port Act  inspections were no longer available.", "Officials in one sector said they were meeting inspection requirements  at the expense of other missions, such as inspecting containers or  monitoring the transfer of oil. They said they make a risk-based  judgment call on which activities to undertake.", "In another sector, officials said meeting inspection requirements in the  long term would be difficult. The new inspection requirements  effectively doubled the required number of facility inspections, and the  sector has received only short-term assistance.", "Officials in another sector said available staffing could adequately  cover only part of the sector\u2019s area of responsibility.", "In another sector, officials said depending on the long-term workload,  they may be seeking additional inspectors later this year, after  temporary duty staff has left."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Spot Check Guidance May Affect the Sufficiency of Inspectors to Conduct All Inspections", "paragraphs": ["A second factor that may affect the reliability of the estimates is that the  Coast Guard based its estimate for the number of inspectors needed in  part on the number of spot checks conducted in the past, but subsequent  spot check guidance may require inspectors to spend more time on these  spot checks than they had previously. After the SAFE Port Act\u2019s passage,  Coast Guard officials initially said they did not plan to issue specific  guidance for spot checks, because developing a single inspection form that  encompassed all situations was difficult and because they had not heard  from Captains of the Port that such guidance was needed. In July 2007,  however, the Coast Guard Commandant issued a message to Coast Guard  Area officials that provided some spot check guidance. Among other  things, this guidance:    Defines minimum requirements for security spot checks\u2014for example,  specifying that the inspector must confirm that the facility is compliant  with unique requirements for specific types of facilities (such as cruise  ships) and must provide the facility with documentation of the  inspection.", "Identifies activities that do not meet the requirements for a security  spot check, such as inspections from a vehicle or checks conducted  while performing certain shoreside patrols or facility visits related to  vessel boardings (unless the minimum security spot check  requirements are met during the patrols or boardings).", "Specified codes for documenting facility inspections in the MISLE  database.", "Our discussions with sector officials indicated that prior to this guidance,  sectors varied considerably in their interpretation of what constituted a  security check. For example, one sector considered asking facility  officials 15 to 30 minutes of knowledge-based questions as a spot check,  while another considered a drive-by with a stop at the gate a type of spot  check. Officials in several sectors mentioned that spot checks were  conducted during other types of facility visits or missions, such as while  escorting a boat, conducting a waterside patrol, or performing a vessel  inspection. For documentation, one sector reported entering a record of  all spot checks conducted, while several others qualified that \u201cofficial\u201d  spot checks were logged\u2014a drive by or dropping in to check on a few  items might not be recorded. One sector said recording the check or not  depended partly on whether a deficiency was identified during the spot  check.", "The activities called for in this guidance have potential staffing  implications. Based on our discussion with headquarters officials and  inspectors in all sectors we visited, some of the activities that have been  considered spot checks will no longer be considered adequate, such as  observing facility security procedures from a vehicle while driving by.  Meeting the spot check requirements under the new guidance may thus  require more time from inspectors. This in turn may affect sector  estimates of the level of resources needed to meet inspection requirements  and Coast Guard goals for the number of inspections to be conducted.", "In Coast Guard comments on this draft, officials reported a total of 9,403  inspections (spot checks and annual exams) were conducted in 2007,  exceeding their internal target of 8,800 inspections.  This is an increase in  inspections from prior years. Their comment however, did not indicate  that each facility received a spot check and an annual exam.  Further,  since the spot check guidance was not issued until July of 2007, it is not  clear how many of the spot checks were conducted following the new  guidance.

The Coast Guard\u2019s ability to assess its compliance program is complicated  by omissions, duplications, and other flaws in the data it would most likely  use in measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of different monitoring  and oversight approaches."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Coast Guard Has Not Evaluated the Effectiveness of Oversight Efforts", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, when we first examined the Coast Guard\u2019s efforts to deal with  MTSA requirements, we reported that development of a sound long-term  strategy was a critical step in bringing about effective monitoring and  oversight. Our work assessing such other areas as airport security and  regulatory compliance had identified approaches for ensuring compliance  and strengthening security. These approaches included such steps as  unscheduled and unannounced inspections, and inspections on weekends  or after normal working hours. At the time, local Coast Guard officials said  that unscheduled inspections would be a positive component of a longer- term strategy because informing owners or operators of annual  inspections can allow them to mask security problems by preparing for  inspections in ways that do not represent the normal course of business.  We recommended that, after the initial \u201csurge\u201d involved in reviewing  security plans and conducting the first round of inspections, the Coast  Guard should conduct a formal evaluation of its efforts and use the  evaluation as a means to strengthen the compliance process for the longer  term.", "In the 1990s, a statutory management framework for strengthening  government performance and accountability was enacted into law. In  particular, the Government Performance and Results Act (Results Act)  calls for an increased reliance upon program performance information in  assessing program efficiency and effectiveness. The Results Act notes  that federal managers are seriously disadvantaged in their efforts to  improve program efficiency and effectiveness because of insufficient  articulation of program goals and inadequate information on program  performance, and that spending decisions and program oversight are  seriously handicapped by insufficient attention to program performance  and results. Although the Results Act\u2019s provisions apply primarily to  tracking and reporting performance at the overall agency level, the same  sound management principles apply to management of individual  programs such as the facility compliance program. In other work, we have  identified instances in which agencies can use performance information to  improve programs and results.", "In many of its areas of activity, the Coast Guard has devoted extensive  attention to providing sound data on its activities and analyzing what these  data say about what the agency is accomplishing with the resources it  expends. In 2006, for example, we reported that for many of its non- homeland security programs, the Coast Guard had developed performance  measures that were generally sound and based on reliable data. Further,  the Coast Guard was actively engaged in initiatives to help interpret these  performance measures and use them to link resources to program results.", "The Coast Guard has not, however, applied this same approach to the  facility compliance program. Although the Coast Guard agreed with our  recommendation in 2004 that the agency formally evaluate its MTSA  compliance inspection efforts and use the results as a means to strengthen  its long-term strategy for ensuring facility compliance, it has not  conducted such an evaluation, and has no current plans to do so. In  comments submitted after reviewing a draft of this report, the Coast Guard  indicated that facility security program metrics were discussed during a  November 2007 workshop with field personnel.  The comments also  indicated that the Coast Guard is developing performance goals for  monthly review by program management.", "We asked the Coast Guard to provide documentation of any systematic  effort to assess implementation of its facility compliance program since  July 2004, when the agency initiated the compliance phase of MTSA  facility oversight. Headquarters officials told us that program managers  use MISLE to see the results of inspectors\u2019 data entries and to produce  reports, but the Coast Guard\u2019s only formal analysis of the overall success  of MTSA implementation was contained in its Annual Report to Congress.  The information the 2005 and 2006 reports provide, which includes figures  on the number of enforcement actions and the approximate number of  facility security inspections the Coast Guard conducted (included in the  2005 report only), does not include an analysis of the program\u2019s operations  or provide a basis to determine what, if anything, might be done to  improve its operations. The program metrics and performance goals the  Coast Guard indicated it is  developing may provide data useful for future  assessments.", "A more thorough evaluation of the facility compliance program could  provide information on, for example, the variations we identified between  Coast Guard units in oversight approaches, the advantages and  disadvantages of each approach, and whether some approaches work  better than the others. The Coast Guard has allowed Captains of the Port  considerable discretion in implementing facility oversight program at the  local level, in order to meet differences in local conditions. An evaluation  could also explore the benefits of the variations that have resulted. For  example, an evaluation could shed light on such issues as the following:    Conducting annual compliance exams unannounced vs.  scheduling them beforehand. Views we heard from different Coast  Guard units varied on this issue. Coast Guard policy has encouraged  the pre-scheduling of these exams, but some units have decided to  conduct them on an unannounced basis because they believe doing so  best captures what procedures are normally in place. At some units  that scheduled the exams with the facility beforehand, however, Coast  Guard officials said conducting exams unannounced would slow the  process, because facility personnel would be less prepared with  information and because officials with the needed information might  be absent entirely. In such situations, delays might affect the unit\u2019s  ability to complete its inspection workload. An evaluation, done with  accurate and sufficient data, could provide information of the  effectiveness of various approaches.", "The type of enforcement action to take when deficiencies are  identified. The available data indicate that Coast Guard units vary  considerably in the extent to which they take formal enforcement  actions, such as fines or written warnings. Headquarters officials told  us that they could not explain the variation or its impact on continued  facility compliance, but that units were allowed to determine actions  taken based on the factors involved. These variations might occur for  several reasons. Inspectors in sectors we visited told us they rely on  Coast Guard guidance and take other factors into consideration, such  as the nature of the deficiency, or history of the facility. They said that  the decision on what enforcement action is taken depends in part on  guidance from the sector\u2019s Captain of the Port, and the judgment of the  inspector as to the severity of the incident. For example, an inspector is  given discretion to decide to issue a facility a fine or written warning at  a high-volume port where the consequences for an incident are high, or  to take no formal action because it is in a low-volume port where  facilities are dispersed and the consequences are less severe. An  evaluation, done with accurate and sufficient data, could analyze such  differences as possible criteria for deciding when formal or informal  actions are most appropriate.", "Variation in establishing the applicable MTSA regulation for a  specific deficiency. We observed situations in which different  inspectors cited different MTSA regulations for the same type of  deficiency. For example, deficiencies in which security personnel  lacked required training were classified in two different ways\u2014 sometimes as noncompliance with the regulation requiring security  personnel to be knowledgeable of security-related areas, such as  screening, and other times as noncompliance with regulations related  to the security officer\u2019s responsibilities. Similarly, failure to log a drill  or exercise was sometimes categorized as noncompliance with  regulations on drills and exercises and sometimes as a recordkeeping  deficiency. An analysis of the differences would help managers  determine if sectors have varying interpretations, if additional training  is needed for facility inspectors regarding the applicability of the  regulations, or if the regulations themselves could be improved. The  Coast Guard plans to revise its MTSA regulations by 2009, and such an  analysis could be instructive in that effort.", "We are not the only independent reviewer to point out the need for such  an evaluation. In 2006, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  issued an assessment of Coast Guard performance in meeting goals for the  Ports, Waterways and Coastal Security program, which includes MTSA  facility oversight. OMB noted that there have been no reviews indicating  whether or how the program is achieving results.

In MISLE, however, data and  database fields were missing, duplicative, and inconsistent, with data entry  a particular concern. Specific problems we identified include the  following:    Deficiency data may not be entered at all, or entered twice, officials  said. For example, if a facility corrects a deficiency immediately,  inspectors can decide not to include it in their report. On the other  hand, Coast Guard data analysts acknowledged that there are duplicate  deficiencies and enforcement actions in MISLE for example, resulting  from the same deficiency being recorded at the sector and subunit  levels, or lack of coordination in conducting an exam so that the  activities are entered twice.", "Headquarters officials said that some units are unclear about what to  enter into MISLE, and the biggest challenge to consistent and  comprehensive data is proper data entry. Although inspectors choose  from a standardized pick-list of enforcement action citations, the  selection process is subjective and as we discussed earlier, a particular  violation can fit under multiple citation categories.", "Headquarters officials said that the citation for a deficiency is not  always provided when inspectors enter the activity into MISLE. Not  entering this information means that the Coast Guard has difficulty  showing data on the basis of specific MTSA regulatory deficiencies or  specific enforcement actions. Coast Guard officials voiced varying  opinions about whether the deficiency citation is a required field for  inspectors to enter in MISLE, as well as about what MISLE fields to use  to identify security-related deficiencies and enforcement actions.", "While the data themselves may pose problems, so too do the data fields  into which the data are placed.

We  identified two types of analysis that were limited\u2014comparisons across  sectors and analysis by year.", "Although the Coast Guard began reorganizing its field units into sectors  in 2004 and made sectors the primary management unit, data continues  to be entered into MISLE that cannot readily be presented by sector.  This limitation makes assessing oversight performance, variability, and  facility compliance by sector more difficult.", "The Coast Guard cannot report the number of facilities it regulated  under MTSA during a particular period. Although MISLE contains a  field to indicate whether a facility is currently regulated by MTSA, it  does not have a field for the facility\u2019s activation date. (Vessels regulated  under MTSA do have an activation date.) Without it the Coast Guard  cannot establish the number of facilities that have been regulated, and  is unable to calculate a percentage of MTSA facilities that received the  required annual compliance exam during a particular period.

Furthermore, the annual reports did not provide a comprehensive picture  of Coast Guard compliance activities. The Coast Guard and Maritime  Transportation Act of 2004 mandated an annual report from the Coast  Guard on the agency\u2019s MTSA compliance-related activities, and so far the  agency has issued two reports\u2014one covering part of 2004 and much of  2005 (July 1, 2004 to November 17, 2005), the second covering all of 2006.  According to Coast Guard officials, there is no set format for the report,  and the type of information reported varies by reports. The report for  2004-2005, for example, includes information about the number of annual  compliance exams conducted, while the report for 2006 does not. Coast  Guard officials said they did not include information about the number of  exams conducted in 2006 as part of an effort to reduce the annual report\u2019s  size.

The more significant issue, however, is  not resolving the effect of these three factors, but rather recognizing the  fundamental limitation reflected in being unable to reconcile differences  between the numbers in the annual report with the numbers in the  database. The ability to monitor and oversee a program is limited if  officials cannot rely on the accuracy of the information they have at hand.", "At some sectors we visited, Coast Guard officials voiced similar concerns  about having to rely on MISLE data for assessing trends. Inspectors in all  seven sectors said they use MISLE to track compliance activities at  individual facilities, but several reported that using MISLE to produce  accurate aggregated information and trend data for the sector was more  difficult. Inspectors in four sectors mentioned creating their own  spreadsheets outside MISLE to more easily produce reports on  administrative information (such as facility addresses and phone  numbers), to check for MISLE report errors, and to track additional  information not requested in MISLE. They indicated a variety of ways in  which MISLE could be improved for use, including allowing MISLE to  capture facility-specific security enhancements and weaknesses and  linking MISLE data with information on security vulnerabilities captured  by the maritime security risk assessment model.", "A second concern about the annual report compliance data is its limited  scope that does not provide a complete picture of Coast Guard compliance  activities or a relevant context for reviewing them. Annual compliance  exams were not reported in 2006, and the number of deficiencies  identified by Coast Guard oversight was not included in either the 2005 or  2006 report. Further, the total number of inspections that the Coast Guard  conducted is not provided within the context of the total number of  facilities regulated, and the number of spot checks is presented without  the number of facilities that received the checks. As we pointed out earlier  in this report, some of this information, such as the number of facilities  subject to MTSA regulation, is not available in MISLE. To the degree that  relevant information is not available or is difficult to extract, decision  makers may not be able to see the Coast Guard\u2019s activities in full or in  context.", "The annual report\u2019s presentation may also under-represent the Coast  Guard\u2019s actions in ensuring that facilities comply with security plans. The  annual report presents enforcement actions issued, but does not report  deficiencies identified. As we discussed earlier in this report, only 16  percent of deficiencies in 2006 resulted in enforcement actions. Since the  Coast Guard prefers a strategy of working with facilities to improve  facility compliance, rather than a punitive strategy, there are many facility  deficiencies that are identified and corrected without an enforcement  action, and therefore are not reported in the Annual Report.

Coast Guard officials currently cannot document how much of inspectors\u2019  time is spent on the facility enforcement program versus conducting other  tasks. New spot check requirements may pose additional workload  requirements, not only because spot checks must now be conducted of all  facilities, but also because the Coast Guard\u2019s recent guidance calls for  placing an inspector inside the facility rather than just driving by.  Plans  for adding an additional 25 staff will help meet these needs, but without  considering all factors, the Coast Guard is at additional risk of inspection  requirements not being met.", "The Coast Guard gives considerable leeway to sectors and local units in  deciding how to implement requirements, and as this report has shown,  units have gone in somewhat different directions.

The  inspection program\u2019s growing maturity heightens the importance of being  able to determine what it is accomplishing and to assess alternative  practices sectors have adopted to ensure facility compliance. Coast Guard  headquarters, however, has not evaluated these various approaches to  determine which ones produce greater results or yield greater efficiency.  Finally, whether establishing that basic inspection requirements are being  met, comparing the various approaches used in individual sectors, or  evaluating other aspects of the facility compliance program, the Coast  Guard is handicapped without complete and accurate compliance data.

Over a period of 5 months, we requested and obtained  data from MISLE to document Coast Guard compliance and enforcement  activities related to MTSA facilities from July 1, 2004, the deadline for  facilities to be operating under a Coast Guard-approved facility security  plan, to December 31, 2006.

We used the  following approach to identify duplicates: when we identified activities  that had the same deficiency identification number and citation, we  checked 21 other data fields in MISLE for duplication. If two or more  observations had the same values in all of these fields, we retained one  observation, designating the others as duplicates. Using this process, we  classified 32 of 7,620 total observations, or less than 1 percent of  deficiencies in each year, as duplicative. We chose to keep the  observations in the analyses because it was not clear which activity to  delete because we lacked a more reliable means for identifying duplicates  that were not identical for all fields examined, and because of the small  number of observations our approach identified.", "After conducting the above steps, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable to provide a general indication of the magnitude and  relative frequencies of compliance activities.

The Coast Guard  provided a spreadsheet of personnel certified with one or more Maritime  Security Qualifications from this database. To assess the reliability of the  spreadsheet data, we looked for obvious errors and inconsistencies in the  data, and requested information from Coast Guard officials to understand  limitations in the data and make corrections where possible. We identified  limitations in the data related to duplicate entries and certifications not yet  entered into the system. Duplicate entries result, for example, because  staff may be listed twice if they are employed as both a reservist and  civilian Coast Guard employee, or may be listed under a sector and under  a pre-sector unit. We deleted duplicate entries identified by Coast Guard to  arrive at the number of trained personnel, but we were unable to  determine how many certifications had not yet been entered in the system.  Given this limitation, we found the Direct Access data to be sufficiently  reliable to provide only an approximate number of personnel qualified to  conduct MTSA facility inspections.", "The Coast Guard provided verbal information on the number of personnel  currently in facility inspection positions. We conducted several interviews  with relevant Coast Guard headquarters managers regarding the number  of inspectors that have been trained, the allocation of staff to inspection  positions, the training provided to current inspectors, and plans for future  training and resources for conducting facility inspections. We also  discussed current and planned guidance for conducting facility  inspections with headquarters officials. In the seven sectors we visited, we  met with facility inspectors to discuss facility inspector training, the  adequacy of inspection resources, guidance used to conduct inspections,  and other inspector responsibilities. We discussed the consistency of  inspections with facility security officers in facilities located in the seven  sectors. We also reviewed written Coast Guard guidance related to MTSA  facility inspections, such as relevant circulars, memos, and on-line  resources, and documents on planned revisions to facility oversight  regulations.", "To determine the extent to which the Coast Guard has assessed its MTSA  facility oversight program and ensured that program compliance data is  accurate, we requested the Coast Guard provide documentation of any  evaluation of activities related to facility oversight and reviewed the two  annual reports that the Coast Guard provided. We reviewed Office of  Management and Budget documents and prior GAO reports on assessing  program effectiveness. Our assessment of the accuracy of the Coast Guard  compliance data was based on our reliability assessment of MISLE data  we conducted as part of objective 1. We also discussed the accuracy and  utility of MISLE data with facility inspectors during our site visits to seven  sectors.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2006 through February  2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Total Nationwide Facility Deficiencies for 2004, 2005, and 2006 by MTSA Regulatory Citation", "paragraphs": ["This appendix summarizes GAO\u2019s analysis of deficiencies identified by  Coast Guard facility inspectors nationwide from 2004\u20132006 based on the  MTSA regulatory citation associated with each deficiency.
