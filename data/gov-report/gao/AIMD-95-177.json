As of January 1995, EPA reported it had pursued actions to recover costs for 1,625 sites. Through the end of fiscal year 1994, EPA reported that the Superfund program had about $1.4 billion in binding agreements from responsible parties to reimburse the federal government. About $934 million of this amount had actually been collected, including about $9 million in fines and penalties. The remaining $8.7 billion of Superfund past costs include costs such as those not pursued, unrecoverable costs, and costs currently being sought through litigation.", "Although Superfund was enacted 15 years ago, the bulk of EPA\u2019s cost recovery settlements has occurred in the last 7 years.

In addition, efforts to collect costs from responsible parties is more difficult, in part because the agency\u2019s financial system, IFMS, is not sufficiently sophisticated to address the complexity of the repayment agreements. As a result of these limitations, the cost recovery process is often longer and more tedious than necessary and must be supported by manual searches and ad hoc information systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data in Financial Systems Must Be Augmented by Manual Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Having sufficiently detailed financial information is essential for preparing and supporting cost recovery actions.

Further, the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program states that financial data reporting should be of proper scope, level of detail, timing, content, and presentation format to provide information of real value to users.", "EPA currently operates two financial management systems for maintaining Superfund cost data, IFMS and FMS. However, neither system currently records cost information at a level of detail that is often needed by EPA staff to prepare cost recovery packages. Specifically, EPA regions divide large or complex cleanup sites into smaller components called operable units. Cost recovery staff said that in order to properly assign the correct amount of costs to the appropriate PRP they need to be able to tracedetailed costs to these operable units.", "Because EPA systems do not currently record costs at the operable unit level, identifying which costs were incurred at different operable units becomes a time-consuming and tedious task. During the course of a cleanup, which often lasts for years, thousands of individual transactions are processed and stored, including payroll and travel costs for EPA employees, as well as contractor cleanup costs and costs incurred by other agencies, such as the Department of Justice and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. To trace these costs to individual operable units, EPA staff must identify all costs that have been recorded and accumulated by site, and then manually segregate the costs by operable unit.", "Staff in EPA\u2019s regions told us that this data limitation has resulted in wasted staff resources. For example, one region we contacted was managing a site with 18 operable units, involving $2.8 million in cost recovery. In order to identify costs at the operable unit level, three staff had to work full time for over 4 months to manually allocate the costs. This required them to go through numerous records, including individual time sheets and travel records. Similarly, a staff person in another region estimated that about 10 percent of his time was spent manually allocating costs, which he believed could be avoided if costs were recorded in greater detail. The independent public accounting firm\u2019s report on EPA\u2019s fiscal year 1993 financial statements for the Superfund Trust Fund stated that the system limitation may adversely impact EPA\u2019s ability to account for costs at Superfund sites and projects.

For example, in its 1994 report on IFMS, the OIG raised concerns about data integrity, including inaccuracies and omissions in the data. In our discussions with cost recovery staff, they too stated that they had encountered instances of inaccurate and incomplete data, including critical cost and site identification information, in the agency\u2019s financial information systems. Several of the examples cited by these staff are described below.", "Staff in three regions stated that they had identified instances of duplicative data. For example, during initial negotiations, one region initially overstated costs for a PRP by about $822,000. While staff identified and corrected this overstatement prior to final negotiations, they determined that the error was largely due to a cost figure that had been duplicated in the financial system. EPA staff were unsure whether this was a random problem or a systemic one.", "One region discovered, while attempting to support a cost summary it had provided to a PRP, that approximately $23,000 had been erroneously charged to a site. The overcharge occurred because contract lab costs that should have been charged to a site in another EPA region had instead been charged to this site, possibly due to a data entry error.", "Five regions expressed concerns that certain costs associated with work performed at individual sites, under national contracts, were not being recorded by site in the agency\u2019s financial management systems. For example, one EPA region reported in 1994 that about $90 million in technical assistance team contract charges associated with one of two national contracts could not be traced to specific sites through the agency\u2019s financial systems. According to EPA, most of these costs were incurred for non site-specific activities and are recovered from responsible parties as indirect costs through the annual allocation process. However, the regional analysis concluded that some of the costs that were site-specific in nature were not reflected in individual site accounts in IFMS.", "Two regions provided examples of missing or invalid data in the site/project identification field. This was corroborated by a report generated by EPA\u2019s Financial Management Division showing about 10,500 transactions, totaling about $129 million in expenditures, for which, according to EPA officials, the site/project identification field was missing.", "These examples are not intended to be representative of the overall integrity of data in the financial systems. However, EPA staff told us that as a result of these types of problems, they have to spend excessive time and effort in researching, reconciling, and correcting financial data needed to support cost recovery actions.", "EPA has no assurance that its application controls are sufficient to prevent these data quality problems. Such controls are critical for ensuring accurate data input, processing, and output. The independent public accounting firm that reviewed EPA\u2019s financial statements for the Superfund Trust Fund for fiscal year 1993 noted that weaknesses with the internal controls governing data entry made it possible for inaccurate or incomplete account numbers to be entered into IFMS. For example, they found there was no error check control of the site/project code portion of IFMS\u2019 account code.", "EPA officials believe IFMS contains adequate application controls. However, because these controls are not documented in accordance with federal policies, such as OMB Circular No. A-127 and the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, we could not assess these controls to determine if they are sufficient to prevent data integrity problems. The lack of documentation for application controls was identified in the OIG\u2019s February 1995 report, in which the OIG stated that it could not assess application processing controls due to a lack of technical system documentation. The OIG reported that such an internal control weakness could adversely affect EPA\u2019s ability to ensure that (1) obligations and costs were in compliance with applicable laws, (2) funds, property, and other assets were safeguarded against unauthorized use or disposition, and (3) transactions were properly recorded to permit the preparation of reliable financial statements.", "The previously mentioned example of missing site identification data for technical assistance team costs could have been prevented had additional controls been in place. Such controls would have alerted senior financial managers that these costs had been approved and paid, but were at risk of being excluded from cost recovery actions because they had not been allocated, where possible, to a specific Superfund site.", "Until EPA addresses the need for documented controls, data integrity problems could continue to adversely affect the efficiency of performing cost recovery. In addition, when site/project codes are missing, EPA may lose the opportunity to recover related costs in specific cost recovery actions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cost Recovery Documentation Not Readily Accessible", "paragraphs": ["To successfully defend its claims for cost recovery, EPA must be able to substantiate each cost item. To do this, the agency locates and provides a wide-range of supporting financial documents, such as invoices and travel vouchers, and supporting work-performed documents, such as contracts, contractor work assignments, and progress reports pertaining to a site. Such documents are needed to provide proof to PRPs and the courts that Superfund-led work to clean up hazardous waste sites was authorized, performed, invoiced, and paid.", "Despite the importance of these documents, EPA staff in regional offices believe that the difficulty in locating and retrieving supporting documents was a major contributor to the amount of time and effort required to assemble the packages detailing costs to be recovered. According to these staff, almost all financial documents generated since 1991 are available through the SCRIPS imaging system. However, most of the contract-related financial documents created prior to this time are not available from SCRIPS because the system was not operational until 1991. Pre-1991 contract-related financial documents are stored in EPA\u2019s financial management center in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and must be manually retrieved for inclusion in the cost recovery packages. Cost recovery staff said that it usually takes about 20 working days to retrieve these documents once identified, and that the time required to assemble the requisite financial documents could be substantially decreased if these documents could also be retrieved using SCRIPS.", "Staff also noted that the situation is worse for work-performed documents. There are estimated to be over 11 million pages of work-performed documents occupying about 6,000 linear feet of shelf space in EPA\u2019s ten regional offices. The regional offices maintain these work-performed documents as hard copy in various locations\u2014some in off-site storage, some in records management centers, and some in working files maintained by EPA staff responsible for managing or overseeing the cleanup process. In many cases, cost recovery staff have to rely on their memories to identify which contractors were used at a site and where relevant documents might be located. Cost recovery staff also noted that if the documents cannot be found in EPA\u2019s offices, they must then try to obtain replacements from the contractors\u2019 files. Staff in several regions said that assembling work-performed documents from various locations inside and outside of the agency is a time-consuming or labor-intensive process. For example, in one region it typically takes 2 months to assemble such documents. Another region said it takes about 4 months to identify, retrieve, and review work-performed documents.", "Although locating supporting documentation can be labor-intensive, the effect of not locating needed documentation can be worse. According to cost recovery staff, if supporting documents cannot be located or otherwise supported, the corresponding cost items are removed from the cost recovery summary, even though these costs may be recoverable. We could not determine the amount that EPA has lost because of such missing documentation because EPA does not track this information. While EPA maintains a record showing the reasons why costs are excluded from final settlements with PRPs, costs excluded from initial negotiations due to missing documentation are not a part of this record."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial System Does Not Efficiently Support Management of Superfund Cost Recovery Receivables", "paragraphs": ["EPA regional offices are primarily responsible for managing accounts receivable after the government reaches cost recovery settlements with responsible parties.

It also requires that agency financial systems satisfy the core financial system requirements developed by the Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, including a variety of functions to support the establishment, management, and collection of accounts receivable. These functions include calculating and generating customer bills, tracking receivables to be paid for under an installment plan, and accurately identifying receivables that are past due.", "IFMS does not meet these requirements. Although IFMS includes an accounts receivable module, which EPA began using in 1989, the module does not meet the special requirements needed to manage the settlement agreements reached with PRPs.

This module also lacks the ability to produce accurate aging reports for Treasury and EPA management.", "EPA has recognized that it has a receivables problem. It has reported this problem as a material weakness in its fiscal year 1994 Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act Report. This weakness is very significant, especially given that EPA data show that uncollected Superfund cost recovery receivables totalled about $498 million at the end of fiscal year 1994.", "Because EPA has not yet resolved its problem with receivables, some regional offices have developed their own automated systems or manual procedures to overcome these limitations. For example, four regional offices have developed local PC-based systems to provide some of these accounts receivable capabilities, while another region uses a combination of manual procedures and IFMS capabilities.

We chose regions 2, 3, and 5 because they had the highest levels of direct expenditures on cleanups. We chose regions 7 and 10 because they provided geographical diversity. We analyzed numerous documents related to cost recovery from each of these regions. Because integrity of data in EPA\u2019s financial systems has a direct impact on how well these systems support cost recovery, we sought information from cost recovery staff on the extent of problems with the financial data. However, because these staff were unable to provide quantified information on the extent of such problems, we relied on their oral responses and some documented instances in reaching our conclusions. We also contacted by phone records management officials in all ten EPA regions concerning the volume of documentation maintained and researched for supporting cost recovery.", "We met with representatives and analyzed workpapers and documents from the three firms involved in the audit of EPA\u2019s fiscal year 1993 financial statements for the Superfund Trust Fund. These firms were Leonard G. Birnbaum and Company; KPMG Peat Marwick; and American Power Jet Company. We met with officials from EPA\u2019s OIG and reviewed its past and current reports related to Superfund and cost recovery. We also met with officials in the Department of Justice\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Division concerning the quality of the cost recovery documentation that it receives from EPA and uses to pursue cost recovery actions.", "To evaluate the extent to which EPA\u2019s planned information systems modifications could improve the efficiency of cost recovery efforts, we (1) applied relevant segments of the information systems audit methodology published by the EDP Auditors Foundation, (2) interviewed officials from several EPA headquarters offices in Washington, D.C., and from EPA regional offices involved in developing new information systems or modifications to existing systems, and (3) reviewed and analyzed documents on EPA\u2019s actions, including documentation on users\u2019 requirements, feasibility, costs, benefits, and detailed specifications pertaining to the agency\u2019s efforts to enhance and develop system capabilities to support cost recovery. We also reviewed EPA planning documents, including the agency\u2019s Five-Year Plan, and Strategy and Master Work Plan for IFMS.", "Our work was performed at several offices at EPA headquarters including the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of Inspector General, and the Financial Management Division in the Office of Administration and Resources Management. These offices were located in Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia. We also worked at (1) EPA regional offices in New York, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Chicago, Illinois; and San Francisco, California; (2) the Department of Justice in Washington, D.C.; and (3) the office of Leonard G. Birnbaum and Company in Springfield, Virginia.", "We conducted our review from January 1994 to July 1995, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency. In August 1995, we received the agency\u2019s response from the Comptroller, the Director for the Financial Management Division, and the Director for the Policy and Program Evaluation Division. We have incorporated these comments where appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accounting and Information Management Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": ["Ronald W.
