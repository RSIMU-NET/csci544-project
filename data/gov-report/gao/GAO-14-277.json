GAO also estimates that prepositioning shortened delivery time frames by an average of more than 2 months for other organizations\u2014\u201ccooperating sponsors\u201d\u2014that receive USAID grants. In addition, USAID reduces delivery time frames when it diverts shipments en route to overseas prepositioning warehouses to areas with immediate needs. For all cooperating sponsors, GAO estimates that diversions saved, on average, about 2 months.", "Prepositioning food can increase the cost of emergency food aid because of additional warehouse, shipping, and commodity costs. For example, in fiscal year 2012, USAID paid approximately $8 million for its overseas and domestic prepositioning warehouses. USAID also paid $13 million to ship food by ocean freight from overseas prepositioning warehouses to recipient countries, in addition to the cost of shipping from the United States to the warehouses. Further, USAID generally paid higher weighted annual average prices for domestically prepositioned commodities than for standard shipment commodities. U.S. officials and vendors noted that factors such as limited commodity supplies and few participating suppliers may have contributed to higher prices.", "USAID has taken some steps to evaluate prepositioning, but the agency does not collect and analyze data needed to systematically monitor delivery time frames for prepositioned commodities.

From 2007 to  2012, USAID increased the tonnage of commodities that it ordered for  prepositioning under Title II from 6 percent to 22 percent of all emergency  food aid commodities.

To analyze prepositioning warehouse costs, we  obtained warehouse contracts from USAID. Each contract identifies  the annual expenditure target that USAID had established for the  warehouse as well as the daily storage charge per metric ton and  outlines other charges related to handling the commodities.", "Ocean shipping costs. We estimated the additional cost due to  prepositioning using the actual cost of the second leg of ocean  shipping, because the data required to re-construct the hypothetical  cost of direct shipping for every prepositioned shipment were not  available to us. Although the first leg of ocean shipping\u2014from a U.S.  port to the overseas warehouse\u2014is comparable to ocean transport for  standard shipping, the second leg does not exist in the standard  shipping process. We obtained data from USAID that track the mode  of transportation of shipments from each of the overseas warehouses,  the metric tonnage, and the freight cost. (See app. III for examples of  the additional ocean transportation costs.)", "Commodity procurement costs. To analyze prepositioning  commodity procurement costs, we focused on six commodities that  accounted for 76 percent of total prepositioning purchases. We  compared the weighted annual average prices of commodities  purchased for domestic prepositioning, overseas prepositioning, and  standard shipping. To understand the possible reasons for the  observed differences in prices for prepositioned commodities, we  interviewed U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) officials as well as  commodity vendors. (See app. IV for the results of the price  comparison.).", "To examine the extent to which USAID monitors prepositioning to  maximize time savings and cost effectiveness, we reviewed USAID  documentation related to prior, current, and future efforts to monitor its  prepositioning program, specifically efforts to monitor the delivery time  frames and program costs. We also interviewed USAID officials in  Washington, D.C., to discuss the extent to which the agency has taken  steps to monitor the program. We also interviewed WFP, one other  cooperating sponsor, and freight forwarders in Washington, D.C. We  reviewed evaluations and reports on USAID\u2019s prepositioning, such as a  2008 evaluation of the program and a 2013 USAID Inspector General  report on prepositioning. Using USAID criteria, we evaluated USAID\u2019s  efforts to monitor its prepositioning program. We also analyzed and  assessed the reliability of data on emergency food aid shipments that we  collected from cooperating sponsors\u2019 freight forwarders to determine  whether these data could be used to monitor delivery time frames of  prepositioned food. We found that the data provided by three freight  forwarders were not sufficiently reliable for tracking delivery time frames  for emergency food aid shipments owing to a number of limitations,  including incomplete or missing data and, in one freight forwarder\u2019s data,  lack of distinction between emergency and nonemergency shipments.

Although this affects the  average delivery time frames we calculated, it should be considered  as context for our regression analysis rather than exact estimates.
