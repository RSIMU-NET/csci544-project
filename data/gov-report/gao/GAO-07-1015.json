The plans also address DOD's challenges to a greater extent than they did in previous years. However, two areas continue to be of concern. First, the master plans do not address the issue of residual value--that is, the value of property being turned over to the host nation based on its reuse of property. Although DOD officials believe that residual value cannot be readily predicted and therefore should not be in the master plans, compensation received for U.S capital improvements at installations returned to host nations could affect U.S. funding requirements for overseas construction. Second, the master plan for PACOM, which provides details on the command's training limitations in Japan and several other challenges, does not provide details regarding training limitations for the Air Force in South Korea, which could cause the United States to pursue alternatives, such as training in other locations, downsizing, or relocating that could affect overseas basing plans. Without addressing the residual value issue and providing details on these training challenges, DOD cannot provide Congress a comprehensive view enabling it to make informed decisions regarding funding. GAO has previously recommended that overseas regional commands address residual value issues and that PACOM explain how it plans to address existing training limitations. Because these recommendations have not been fully addressed, GAO considers them to be open and believes that they still have merit. DOD's planning effort for the buildup of military forces and infrastructure on Guam is in its initial stages, with many key decisions and challenges yet to be addressed. Among the challenges to be addressed is completing the required environmental impact statement, initiated in March 2007. According to DOD officials, this statement and associated record of decision could take up to 3 years to complete and will affect many of the key decisions on the exact location, size, and makeup of the military infrastructure development--decisions needed to develop a master plan for the military buildup on Guam. DOD and the services are still determining the exact size and makeup of the forces to be moved to Guam, needed in order to identify the housing, operational, quality of life, and services support infrastructure required for the Marine Corps realignment and the other services' buildup. DOD officials said that additional time is needed to fully address other challenges associated with the Guam military buildup, including funding requirements, operational requirements, and community impact. Until the environmental assessment and initial planning efforts are completed, Congress will need to be kept abreast of developments and challenges affecting infrastructure and funding decisions to make appropriate funding and oversight decisions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the next several years, the ongoing implementation of the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) integrated global presence and basing  strategy will result in a global realignment of U.S. forces and installations,  including a reduction of the number of troops stationed overseas and a  consolidation of overseas bases. While the strategy is intended to make the  overseas posture of the United States more flexible and efficient, it will  also require new facilities costing billions of dollars, some of the cost to be  borne by the United States and some by other nations, such as Japan and  South Korea.

After the plans were issued,  we reviewed them to determine how the plans have changed since last  year and the extent to which the plans complied with the congressional  reporting requirements. We assessed whether the plans provided  information in a complete, clear, and consistent manner, and we discussed  with OSD and command officials whether improvements in the guidance  and reporting were needed. We generally concluded that a plan was  improved over those of prior years if it included details on base categories,  host nation funding levels, facility requirements and costs, environmental  remediation issues, and other challenges affecting implementation of the  plans. To determine the status of the Guam planning effort, we met with  officials of OSD, PACOM, and the Navy Joint Guam Program Office  (JGPO)\u2014the office established to plan and execute the military  development on Guam\u2014to discuss the status of DOD\u2019s planning effort and  the challenges associated with the buildup of military forces and  infrastructure on Guam.

For  example, PACOM\u2019s force structure plans are linked to the military buildup  on Guam and CENTCOM\u2019s increased troop strength and facilities in Iraq  and Afghanistan are linked to ongoing operations. In addition, the  commands generally provided more detailed information on a variety of  key areas, such as precise facility requirements and costs, time frames for  an end state, base categories, host nation funding levels, and effects of  other defense activities. For example:    Facility requirements and costs. This year, all of the regional  commands identified their precise facility requirements and costs for fiscal  year 2008 and for fiscal years 2009 through 2013, and reported estimated  facility sustainment costs for fiscal year 2008. In addition, CENTCOM  provided information on supplemental appropriations for facilities and  projects at Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan.", "Base categories. This year, all of the commands categorized their  installations into applicable base categories of main operating base,  forward operating site, and cooperative security location, which provided  users a clearer picture of the infrastructure plans and requirements at  these sites. The commands also supplemented the information on base  categories with detailed data on the installations\u2019 capabilities, overall  mission, population, and types of equipment and facilities located at each  site. For example, CENTCOM and EUCOM also identified adjustments to  the base categories, such as redesignating a main operating base as a  forward operating site or consolidating two cooperative security locations  into one. EUCOM also provided specific details on sites no longer  considered cooperative security locations in Bulgaria, Romania, and  Poland, such as sites with no operational importance and a commercial  facility readily available for military use that did not require U.S.  investment or presence.", "End state date. This year, all of the commands identified a common  strategic end state date of 2013, which identifies the last fiscal year of the  construction time frame. The strategic end state date of 2013 provides  users a more complete and clearer basis for tracking progress in meeting  the command infrastructure objectives for their areas of responsibility.  Previously, OSD had provided the commands the discretion in choosing an  end date from 2011 to 2015.", "Host nation funding levels. This year, all of the commands reported  host nation funding levels at the project level for fiscal year 2008 and at the  aggregate level for fiscal years 2009 through 2013, which provided users a  better basis to determine the extent to which U.S. funding is needed for  facility requirements. Also, PACOM identified host nation funding for its  bilateral agreements in South Korea, such as the Land Partnership Plan  and the Yongsan Relocation Plan. On the other hand, PACOM did not  identify specific host nation funding from the Defense Policy Review  Initiative\u2014while the Government of Japan\u2019s share for the Guam relocation  is $6.1 billion, the Government of Japan has not made an official, public  estimate of the costs for several major realignments within Japan.  Although, in relation to this initiative, the command did identify the need  for U.S. military construction funds to support realignment costs not paid  by the Japanese government. EUCOM provided information on North  Atlantic Treaty Organization contributions and discussed a burden-sharing  arrangement with the Government of Norway. CENTCOM also provided  host nation estimates and explained that its efforts to attain host nation  funding were ongoing.", "Effects of other defense activities. This year, all of the commands  described the effects of other defense activities on implementation of their  master plans. Last year, only PACOM\u2019s plan gave some indication of how  its implementation could be affected by another activity\u2014the potential  decrease in traditional Japanese construction funding that would help  Japan offset its Defense Policy Review Initiative costs, such as those  associated with the relocation of U.S. Marines to Guam. This year, PACOM  discussed this topic as well as the progress of bilateral negotiations with  Japan and challenges associated with this realignment. Last year,  EUCOM\u2019s master plan did not explain the potential effect of implementing  base realignment and closure recommendations on the movement of  troops from Germany to bases in the United States, commonly called  overseas rebasing. EUCOM and Army officials told us that any delay in the  implementation of base realignment and closure recommendations would  cause them to delay the movement of Army servicemembers and their  families if facilities were not available at receiving installations in the  United States. This would delay the closings of Army installations in  Europe and increase costs to operate those installations while they remain  open. This year, the overseas master plan identified that the base  realignment and closure recommendations supported overseas  restructuring and that EUCOM\u2019s transformation depends on this effort.  Last year, CENTCOM\u2019s master plan only made general references to  operations in Iraq and did not fully explain the potential effects of such  operations on other installations and facility requirements outside of Iraq  in its area of responsibility. This year, CENTCOM officials emphasized that  infrastructure requirements in their master plan directly supported and  responded to ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, in terms of  increased troop strength and its facilities requirements in theater. In  addition, CENTCOM\u2019s plan identified how future basing and infrastructure  will be defined by ongoing contingencies and global defense posture."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two Areas of Concern Continue to Be Overlooked", "paragraphs": ["While the overseas master plans have continued to evolve and have  provided more comprehensive data every year since 2004, two key topics  continue to be omitted from the plans. First, the master plans do not  address the issue of residual value\u2014the value of property being turned  over to the host nation based on its reuse of property. As we reported last  year, residual value was excluded from OSD\u2019s guidance because it is based  on the reuse of property being turned over to the host nation, which is  limited for most categories of military facilities and is often reduced by  actual or anticipated environmental remediation costs. Consequently, as  we have noted in the past, DOD officials believe that residual value  cannot be readily predicted and therefore should not be assumed in the  master plans. However, since these issues vary by host nation and may not  be clear to all users of the plans, we continue to believe that OSD should  require commands, at a minimum, to explain the issues with obtaining  residual value in each host nation and report the implications for U.S.  funding requirements. Also, the U.S. government has received  approximately $592 million since 1989 in residual value and payment-in- kind compensation from property returns in EUCOM\u2019s area of  responsibility, and EUCOM continues to aggressively seek compensation  for U.S. capital improvements at installations returned to host nations. As  EUCOM continues to return facilities in Germany, Italy, and Iceland, this  figure may increase. Accordingly, we continue to believe that residual  value should be addressed in the master plans.", "Second, while PACOM\u2019s master plan provided details on other challenges,  it did not describe the challenges the command faces in addressing  training limitations for the Seventh Air Force in South Korea, although  senior officials told us that these limitations could cause the United States  to pursue alternatives, such as training in other locations, downsizing, or  relocating, which could affect overseas basing plans. Specifically, we  found that the PACOM master plan did not point out that the Seventh Air  Force in South Korea may be unable to maintain combat capability in the  long term because of a lack of adequate air-to-surface ranges, according to  senior Air Force and USFK officials. For decades, the Government of  South Korea has attempted to relocate the Koon-Ni range, which had  served as the primary air-to-ground range for the Seventh Air Force. The  air and ground range management of the Koon-Ni training range was  transferred to the Government of South Korea, which closed the range in  August 2005. While there is an agreement with the Government of South  Korea to train at other ranges, according to senior Air Force and USFK  officials, the other ranges do not provide electronic scoring capabilities  necessary to meet the Air Force\u2019s air-to-surface training requirements and  there is difficultly in scheduling these ranges. As a result, the Air Force has  been using ranges in Japan and Alaska to meet its training requirements,  which results in additional transportation costs to the U.S. government. In  May 2007, officials said that some progress had been made in addressing  the Air Force\u2019s training challenges in South Korea and that they expected  the needed upgrades to be completed by mid-2007. In contrast, the  PACOM plan described the training limitations involving bombing and live  fire training ranges and the effects of airspace access restrictions in Japan  on C-130 training. In addition, the plan discusses how noise and land use  sensitivities and maneuver area limitations in Okinawa require U.S. forces  to deploy to other Pacific Rim locations to supplement their training,  which results in additional transportation requirements and costs. The  plan also discussed efforts by U.S. Forces Japan and the Government of  Japan to engage in bilateral discussions to address training shortfalls and  explore solutions.", "We have previously recommended that overseas regional commands  address residual value issues and that PACOM explain how it plans to  address existing training limitations in our prior reports. We believe that  identifying these issues would make Congress aware of potential  challenges to obtaining residual value and to training U.S. forces in South  Korea, which may affect facility requirements and funding in this country.

Under NEPA and the regulations for implementing NEPA established by  the Council on Environmental Quality, an environmental impact  statement must include a purpose and need statement, a description of all  reasonable project alternatives and their associated environmental  impacts (including a \u201cno action\u201d alternative), a description of the  environment of the area to be affected or created by the alternatives being  considered, and an analysis of the environmental impacts of the proposed  action and each alternative. Further, accurate scientific analysis, expert  agency comments, and public scrutiny are essential to implementing  NEPA. For example, federal agencies such as DOD are required to ensure  the professional integrity, including scientific integrity, of the discussions  and analyses in the environmental impact statement. Additionally, after  preparing a draft environmental impact statement, federal agencies such  as DOD are required to obtain the comments of any federal agency that  has jurisdiction by law or certain special expertise and request the  comments of appropriate state and local agencies, Native American tribes,  and any agency that has requested that it receive such statements. Until an  agency issues a final environmental impact statement and record of  decision, it generally may not take any action concerning the proposal that  would either have an adverse environmental impact or limit the choice of  reasonable alternatives.

The Marine  Corps forces remaining on Okinawa will consist of Marine Air-Ground  Task Force elements, such as command, ground, aviation, and combat  service support, as well as a base support capability. Approximately 10,000  marines plus their dependents are expected to remain on the island of  Okinawa following the realignment of forces to Guam. While these broad  estimates provide a baseline, according to officials we visited, the Marine  Corps is still determining the specific mix of units and capabilities needed  to meet mission requirements on both Guam and Okinawa. The mix of  units is significant because, according to Marine Corps officials, the  functional and base support requirements will be based on the type, size,  and number of units that will relocate to Guam.

According to DOD officials, this cost estimate includes the costs to move  Marine Corps forces from Okinawa to Guam, to construct a Navy pier for a  transient aircraft carrier, and to station an Army ballistic missile defense  task force. However, it does not include the costs of other defense  agencies to support the additional military personnel and dependents on  Guam. According to JGPO, these costs will eventually be identified once  further information is available on the master plan.", "Within the current DOD $13 billion cost estimate, the Marine Corps move  from Okinawa to Guam is estimated to cost about $10.3 billion. Of this  amount for the move, the Government of Japan has agreed to contribute  about $6.1 billion to develop facilities and infrastructure on Guam. Nearly  half of Japan\u2019s contribution, or $2.8 billion, is expected to be direct  contributions while the remaining $3.3 billion will consist of investment  incentives for family housing and on-base infrastructure, such as utilities,  which over time could be recouped by Japan in the form of rent or service  charges. For example, the Government of Japan will finance construction  of family housing units in Guam, but these construction costs will be  reimbursed by payments from the servicemembers\u2019 housing allowance  using U.S. funds. Furthermore, the Government of Japan\u2019s funds will not  be made available until it has agreed to specific infrastructure plans for  Guam. In addition, DOD officials recognize that the failure or delay of one  plan outlined in the Defense Policy Review Initiative may affect another,  since various planning variables need to fall into place in order for the  initiative to move forward. For example, DOD officials expect that if the  Futenma replacement facility in Okinawa (a facility intended to replace  the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma and estimated to cost from $4  billion to $5 billion) is not built, the Marine Corps relocation to Guam may  be delayed. DOD officials view the success of the Futenma replacement  facility as a key objective of the initiative that will need to be completed in  order for other realignment actions to take place. The Government of  Japan may encounter challenges in funding its share of the Marine Corps  move considering Japan\u2019s other national priorities and its commitments  associated with funding several other major realignments of U.S. forces in  Japan under the Defense Policy Review Initiative. At the time of our  review, the Japanese legislature had approved $228 million for planning  and initial construction funds for force posture realignments, including  efforts for project planning in Guam, and authorized the Japan Bank for  International Cooperation to invest in businesses for Guam development.", "DOD officials also expressed concern regarding the department\u2019s ability to  obtain a continuous flow of funds adequate to pay its share of the current  $13 billion cost estimate for military buildup on Guam in light of ongoing  operations and funding constraints and challenges. These officials said  that obtaining funding for the military buildup on Guam at current  estimated levels will be difficult because of the pressures the department  faces in funding other defense priorities and activities, including the  ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and procurement costs for  weapons systems. Also, there are other costs not included in the $13  billion cost estimate associated with the Marine Corps\u2019 move to Guam that  will increase overall costs. Historically, for example, the Government of  Japan has paid a large portion of the operation and maintenance costs of  the Marine Corps in Okinawa in the form of host nation support that will  be borne solely by DOD after the move. For example, the DOD Inspector  General reported that the relocation to Guam will increase the Marine  Corps\u2019 annual funding requirements by $465 million for operations and  maintenance costs currently borne by the Government of Japan and for  the costs of the additional strategic lift needed after the move.", "Additional costs will be incurred from building facilities that will house  equipment and aircraft during inclement weather, and there may be  additional incidental maintenance costs as a result of damage from  typhoons and seismic shocks. Guam is located in an area of the Pacific  commonly referred to as Typhoon Alley, where on average 31 tropical  storms develop annually. Also, earthquake risk in Guam is caused by the  island\u2019s proximity to the Mariana Trench, which leads to earthquakes  throughout the region. Marine Corps officials stated that in estimating  Guam facility development costs, DOD took into account that additional  costs will occur when constructing to Guam\u2019s typhoon and seismic  standards\u2014including concrete and structural reinforcement and providing  backup and redundant utility systems. Estimated costs to build  infrastructure in Guam are based on the DOD Facilities Pricing Guide.  The area cost factors identify Guam as one of the more expensive  locations for military construction in comparison with other locations in  the United States and its territories. Specifically, the construction costs for  Guam are 2.64 times more expensive than the baseline average presented  in the DOD Facilities Pricing Guide. The area cost factor is used by  planners to adjust average historical facility costs to a specific project  location, taking into consideration the costs of construction material,  labor, and equipment, along with factors such as weather, climate, seismic  conditions, mobilization, overhead and profit, labor availability, and labor  productivity for each area.

The sum of these increases is expected to have significant effects on  Guam\u2019s unique economic and infrastructure requirements. For example:    Construction capacity. As a result of Guam realignment actions, the  construction demands for infrastructure will exceed the availability of  local contract labor on the island, though the extent to which the Guam  local community and foreign workers can meet this increase has yet to be  determined. Historically, construction capacity on Guam has been  approximately $800 million per year, as compared with the estimated  construction capacity of more than $3 billion per year projected to be  needed to meet the fiscal year 2014 completion date for realignment  actions. Preliminary analysis indicates that 15,000 to 20,000 workers will  be required to support the development on Guam. Consequently, the  increased demand for workers may require workforce training for the  local population and possibly a need for foreign workers. Foreign workers  would have to temporarily enter the United States on temporary  nonagricultural workers visas, capped at 66,000 per year, and DOD  officials have already indicated that visa waivers might be needed in order  to mitigate limitations on the number of visas allowed into the United  States each year.

DOD and Guam officials recognize that the island\u2019s  infrastructure is inadequate to meet the projected demand and will require  significant funding to address these needs. For example, the Government  of Guam has estimated that it will cost about $2.6 billion to improve the  local infrastructure to accommodate forecasted military and civilian  growth on the island and that federal assistance is needed to meet these  requirements. DOD officials and the Guam Integrated Military  Development Plan identified several infrastructure areas that are in need  of improvements: (1) the two major roads in Guam are in poor condition  and, when ordnance (ammunition and explosives) is unloaded from ships  for the Air Force now and for the Marine Corps in the future, it must be  transported on one of these major roads that runs through highly  populated areas; (2) the Government of Guam plans a number of projects  to upgrade the capability and efficiency of Guam\u2019s port facilities that total  about $155 million with only $56 million funded at the time of our review;  (3) the utilities transmission lines are antiquated and the system is not  reliable, and voltage and frequency fluctuations are common; (4) the  wastewater treatment facilities have a long history of failing and are near  capacity; and (5) the solid waste landfills have a number of unresolved  issues related to discharge of pollutants and are near capacity.

In terms of existing  land, DOD owned about 40,000 acres of land in Guam at the time of this  review\u2014approximately 29 percent of the island. Former DOD land areas  have previously been a part of the base realignment and closure process or  released to the Government of Guam.

DOD\u2019s planning efforts for Guam are evolving and up-to-date information  on facility requirements and associated costs would be useful for funding  decisions and assessments of all available options to assist DOD, federal  departments and agencies, the Government of Guam, and other  organizations in addressing the challenges associated with the military  buildup."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not recommending executive action. However, to further facilitate  annual review and oversight by Congress and other users of the overseas  master plans, Congress should consider requiring the Secretary of Defense  to ensure that (1) future overseas master plans address the extent to  which the regional commands are seeking residual value compensation for  U.S. capital improvements at installations returned to host nations and (2)  future PACOM plans address existing training limitations in its area of  responsibility and the potential effects of those limitations on  infrastructure and funding requirements.", "To help ensure the best application of limited federal funds and the  leveraging of all available options for supporting the military buildup on  Guam until DOD prepares a master plan, Congress should consider  requiring the Secretary of Defense to report periodically to all the defense  committees on the status of DOD\u2019s planning efforts for Guam, including  DOD\u2019s efforts to complete its environmental impact statement, identify the  exact size and makeup of the forces to be moved to Guam and the  associated infrastructure required, and address the various challenges  associated with the military buildup."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In comments on a draft of this report, the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense for Installations and Environment responded that congressional  action is not necessary.", "In commenting on our matter for congressional consideration to require  that future overseas master plans address the extent to which commands  are seeking residual value compensation, the Deputy Under Secretary of  Defense stated that DOD already provides status reports on its residual  value negotiations to the Committees on Appropriations and Armed  Services and that prior legislation outlines reporting requirements on the  closure of foreign military installations worldwide, with specific reporting  requirements throughout the residual value negotiation process. While we  were aware of these reporting requirements, these reports do not provide  users of the master plans the kind of information needed to address their  concerns about the status of residual value negotiations or the  implications for U.S. funding. Our recommendation to Congress is  grounded in the fact that residual value issues vary by host nation and the  implications for U.S. funding also vary accordingly and thus may not be  clear enough to all users of the plans. We continue to believe that the  Secretary of Defense should require commands to explain the issues with  obtaining residual value from each host nation and report the implications  for U.S. funding.", "In commenting on our matter for congressional consideration that future  PACOM plans address training limitations in its area of responsibility, the  Deputy Under Secretary of Defense responded that the department agrees  that validated training requirements that are affected by force posture  transformation plans should be addressed in overseas master plans. He  further stated that nonprogrammed and nonvalidated training limitations  experienced by service components were not appropriate for inclusion  and would not be addressed in the overseas commands\u2019 risk assessment  for their master plans. While we are not aware of any nonprogrammed and  nonvalidated training limitations, our report discusses only those training  limitations raised by senior command officials during our review. We  assume that if there is a need to make a distinction between nonvalidated  versus validated training limitations, OSD and the overseas commands  would work together to identify those validated limitations that should be  addressed in their master plans. In addition, last year OSD included in its  guidance a requirement for the combatant commands to identify and  discuss risks to their master plans as well as steps taken to mitigate those  risks, including validated training requirements and limitations. In  response to this guidance U.S. Forces Japan provided information on  training limitations, while USFK omitted this information from the  overseas master plan. This inconsistency led to our recommendation that  Congress require such reporting, and we continue to believe that this  information is necessary to provide a complete picture of the potential  effects on infrastructure and funding requirements in South Korea.", "In commenting on our matter for congressional consideration that the  Secretary of Defense report periodically to all the defense committees on  the status of DOD\u2019s planning efforts for Guam, the Deputy Under Secretary  of Defense responded that the Guam master plan is scheduled to be  completed in 2008, at which time a copy will be provided to congressional  defense committees. It should be noted that Senate Report 109-286  directed DOD to submit a master plan for the military buildup on Guam by  December 2006; however, DOD did not submit the plan for several reasons  that we discuss in this report. Moreover, because the master plan cannot  be completed until the environmental impact statement is completed, a  process that could take until 2009, Congress may not see the master plan  for another 2 years at least. Also, DOD faces a variety of funding  challenges, operational challenges, and community impacts that may both  affect the development and timing of the Guam master plan and increase  costs for the U.S. government. Thus, in the interim before receiving a  master plan, congressional oversight could be enhanced by Congress  periodically receiving an update on the planning efforts in Guam, including  DOD\u2019s efforts to complete its environmental impact statement, identify the  exact size and makeup of the forces to be moved to Guam and the  associated infrastructure required, and address the various challenges  associated with the military buildup.", "The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense\u2019s comments are reprinted in  appendix II.

In order to  identify improvements to the overseas master plan, we compared and  contrasted the fiscal year 2007 and 2008 plans. We assessed the quantity  and quality of one plan\u2019s responses for each of the data elements,  including details on base categories, host nation funding levels, facility  requirements and costs, environmental remediation issues, and other  issues affecting the implementation of the plans, and compared them to  equivalent responses in other plans; formed conclusions as to the  completeness, clarity, and consistency of the latest plan\u2019s responses; and  generated observations and recommendations for improving the plans. We  also discussed with DOD officials our observations and recommendations,  specific reporting requirements, and whether improvements in the  guidance and reporting were needed. We also interviewed cognizant  officials from DOD about the various changes and challenges that were  identified within the plans. We met with officials from OSD and each of the  following commands and agencies: U.S. Pacific Command (PACOM); U.S.  Army Pacific; Commander, U.S. Pacific Fleet; U.S. Marine Corps Forces,  Pacific; U.S. Pacific Air Forces; U.S. Forces Korea; U.S. Eighth Army;  Seventh Air Force; Commander, Naval Forces Korea; U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, Far East District; DOD Education Activity; U.S. Forces Korea  Status of Forces Agreement Office; U.S. Forces Japan; U.S. Army Japan;  U.S. Air Forces Japan; Commander, Naval Forces Japan; U.S. Marine  Forces Japan; Naval Facilities Engineering Command-Pacific, Japan; U.S.  European Command; U.S. Army Europe; Commander, U.S. Naval Forces  Europe; Naval Facilities Engineering Command-Italy; U.S. Air Force  Europe; Army Installation Management Agency, Europe Regional Office;  U.S. Central Command; and Special Operations Command. In general, we  discussed the reporting requirements contained in OSD\u2019s guidance, host  nation agreements and funding levels, U.S. funding levels and sources,  environmental remediation and restoration issues, property returns to host  nations, and training requirements. We also analyzed available reports,  documents, policies, directives, international agreements, guidance, and  media articles to keep abreast of ongoing changes in overseas defense  basing strategies and requirements. To see firsthand the condition of  facilities and status of selected construction projects, we visited and  toured facilities at Camp Schwab, Camp Kinser, Camp Foster, Torii  Station, Camp Zama, Yokosuka Naval Base, and Yokota Air Base, Japan;  Camp Humphreys and Kunsan Air Force Base, South Korea; and Aviano  Air Base, Caserma Ederle, Dal Molin, and Naval Support Activity La  Maddalena, Italy.", "To determine the status of DOD\u2019s planning effort for the buildup of forces  and infrastructure on Guam, we met with officials from OSD, the Navy,  PACOM, and the Joint Guam Program Office (JGPO).

We also met  with officials from U.S. Pacific Fleet; U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific;  U.S. Marine Forces Japan; Third Marine Expeditionary Forces; U.S. Forces  Japan; U.S. Army Pacific; and Pacific Air Forces to discuss the various  factors that can affect U.S. infrastructure requirements and costs  associated with the buildup in Guam. We visited Naval Base Guam and  Andersen Air Force Base in Guam to see the installations and future  military construction sites firsthand. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s military  construction budgets for fiscal years 2007 and 2008 and planned for future  years to identify U.S. funding levels and sources planned for the military  buildup in Guam. To identify challenges associated with the buildup in this  planning effort, we met with the aforementioned DOD officials and other  interested parties in Guam, including the Governor, legislative leaders, the  Chamber of Commerce, the Civil Military Task Force, the Guam Women\u2019s  Group, and the Office of the Delegate from Guam to the U.S. House of  Representatives. We did not evaluate concerns raised by the officials, but  we reviewed relevant federal laws and discussed them with DOD officials.
