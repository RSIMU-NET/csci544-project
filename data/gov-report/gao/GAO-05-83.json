The Program process relies on staff reports of close calls and adverse events. GAO found that achieving success requires a cultural shift from fear of punishment for reporting close calls and adverse events to mutual trust and comfort in reporting them. GAO used ethnographic techniques to study the Patient Safety Program from the perspective of direct care clinicians at four VA medical facilities. This approach recognizes that what people say, do, and believe reflects a shared culture. The focus included (1) the status of VA's efforts to implement the Program, (2) the extent to which a culture exists that supports the Program, and (3) practices that promote patient safety. GAO combined more traditional survey methods with those from ethnography, including in-depth interviews and observation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO found progress in staff familiarity with and participation in the VA Patient Safety Program's key initiatives, but these achievements varied substantially in the four facilities we visited. In our study conducted from November 2002 through August 2004, three-fourths of the clinicians across the facilities were familiar with the concepts of teams investigating root causes of unintentional adverse events and close calls. One-third of the staff had participated in such teams, and most who participated in these teams found it a positive learning experience. The cultural support clinicians expressed for the Program also differed. At three of four facilities, GAO found a supportive culture, but at one facility the culture blocked participation for many clinicians. Clinicians articulated two themes that could stimulate culture change: leadership actions and open communication. For example, nurses need the confidence to disagree with physicians when they find an unsafe situation. Although VA has conducted a cultural survey, it has not set goals or explicitly measured, for example, staff familiarity and mutual trust. Clinicians reported management practices at one facility that had helped them adopt the Program, including (1) story-telling techniques such as leaders telling about a case in which reporting an adverse event resulted in system change, (2) management efforts to coach staff, and (3) reward systems. The Patient Safety Program Process shows how ideally (1) clinicians have cultural support for reporting adverse events and close calls, (2) teams investigate root causes, (3) systems are changed, (4) feedback and reward systems encourage reporting, and (5) patients are safer."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report on the Department of Veterans Affairs Patient Safety Program  examines the Program\u2019s status, the creation and implementation of a  culture that supports close call and adverse event reporting, and practices  that medical facility leaders have used to promote patient safety.

Before the institute published this figure, the Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) had launched a Patient Safety Program that  included teams investigating the root cause of medical close calls and  adverse events and confidential staff reporting systems. The Program\u2019s  ultimate goal is to create a culture in which VA can discover and correct  unsafe systems and processes before they harm patients. \u201cVA could also better ensure success if it prepared a detailed implementation plan that  identifies how and when VA\u2019s various patient safety Programs will be implemented, how  they are aligned to support improved patient safety, and what contribution each Program  can be expected to make toward the goal of improved patient safety.\u201d", "One of the most challenging aspects of VA\u2019s Patient Safety Program is  creating an atmosphere in which employees are willing to reveal system  problems and find system solutions to them. Traditionally, hospital  employees have been held responsible for adverse patient outcomes,  whether they stemmed from employees\u2019 mistakes or the health care  system. For example, a nurse might be blamed for administering the  wrong medicine, even when the system was at fault, as when two  medicines with similar names\u2014one deadly, the other not\u2014were stored on  the same shelf in similar bottles.", "The poster and story in figure 1 show how complicated a day in the life of  a healthcare provider can be. In this instance, a VA nurse recognized a  potentially dangerous flaw in the system that could have caused  unintentional harm to patients.

In  effective safety cultures, frontline workers trust one another and report  close calls and adverse events without fear of blame. Healthcare, which  traditionally employs a culture of blame, must place a premium on  learning from staff reporting of adverse events and close calls. Experts in  patient safety acknowledge that emphasis on culture is important in  preventing medical adverse events and close calls and promoting patient  safety.", "To describe the culture in VA\u2019s medical facilities and to search for a  deeper understanding of patient safety from the viewpoint of VA staff, we  proposed to answer the following questions in the context of four VA  medical facilities:  1.

We intend this study to complement  our earlier reports on organizational culture and changing organizations.

VA\u2019s original,  nonrandom survey contained questions regarding shame and staff  willingness to report adverse events when the safety of patients was at  hazard during their care.

To achieve the informal, open, and honest discussions we  needed, we conducted private, nonthreatening, conversational interviews  with randomly selected clinicians and other staff in a judgmental sample.  At each site, we chose one random and one judgmental (nonrandom)  sample of staff to interview in a conversational manner, using similar  semistructured questionnaires (see app. III).", "For the first sample, we interviewed a random selection of 10 physicians  and 10 nurses at each of the four facilities. While this provided us with a  representative sample of clinicians (physicians and nurses) from each  facility, the sample size was too small to provide a statistical basis  for generalizing our survey results to an entire facility. To give us a better  understanding of the culture and context of patient safety beyond the  clinicians involved in direct patient care at each facility, we also  interviewed more than a hundred other staff in the four study sites,  including medical facility leaders, Patient Safety Managers, and hospital  employees from all levels\u2014maintenance workers, security officers,  nursing assistants, technicians, and service chiefs.

When staff did not recognize a key  element of the Program, our interviewers explained it to them. (We were  not giving the respondents a test they could fail.) Selecting clinicians  randomly at each of four facilities, and asking some close-ended questions  such as those expecting \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answers, allowed us to analyze and  present some issues as standard survey data. This combined survey and  ethnographic approach afforded us most of the advantages of standard  surveys while establishing an environment in which the respondents could  talk, and did talk, at length about the cultural context of patient safety in  their own facilities.", "Clinicians responded to a standard set of questions, many open ended,  such as, To what extent do you perceive there to be trust or distrust within  your unit or team? Among the advantages these questions had were that  they allowed the clinicians to discuss issues spontaneously and they  allowed us to discover what facilitates trust from their point of view. Thus,  if clinicians thought leadership was important, we had an opportunity to  see this from their viewpoint rather than starting from the premise that  leadership would be important to them.", "An important part of our approach was content analysis, which we used to  analyze answers to both the standard and open-ended questions. Content  analysis summarizes qualitative information by categorizing it and then  systematically sorting and comparing the categories in order to develop  themes and summarize them.

We observed staff in their daily work activities at each  medical facility, which helped us understand patient safety in context.
