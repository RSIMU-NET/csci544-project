The plan, according to the agency's Chief Information Officer (CIO), was developed to help FDA's Office of Information Management and Technology (OIMT) address business challenges facing the agency through the implementation of IT. The plan describes the current state of the agency's IT environment, along with OIMT's mission, vision, and the objectives of three strategic themes\u2014quality service, security, and efficiency. The plan also defines performance measures and initiatives intended to support the office's strategic themes.", "Nevertheless, the plan lacks key elements that GAO previously recommended be included in a comprehensive strategy to align with the agency-wide mission and goals, and allow the plan to be used for managing IT investments to more effectively address business challenges. For example, FDA's IT strategic plan does not align with strategic priorities and goals that the agency defined for 2014 through 2018. Further, it does not identify results-oriented goals and performance measures and milestones, or targets for measuring the extent to which outcomes of IT initiatives support FDA's ability to achieve agency-wide goals and objectives; strategies that the governing IT organization will use to support agency-wide goals and objectives; and key IT initiatives and interdependencies to be managed. The agency's CIO stated that this version of the strategic plan was developed to address challenges related to processes, technologies, roles, functions, and capabilities for improving the operations of OIMT, which has the responsibility for managing IT. However, FDA has not yet defined schedules or milestones for managing and completing the development and implementation of future versions of the plan that would reflect actions intended to address the agency-wide mission and goals. Until FDA incorporates these key elements of comprehensive IT strategic planning into its plan and fully implements the plan, it will lack critical information needed to align information resources with business strategies and investment decisions, and be hindered in determining whether outcomes of its IT initiatives are succeeding in supporting agency-wide goals.", "FDA has made progress in implementing GAO's prior IT-related recommendations. Although it has not yet developed a comprehensive IT strategic plan, the agency has improved enterprise architecture development and IT human capital planning by implementing four of nine prior recommendations. FDA implemented two recommendations to develop an IT systems inventory that can be used to help manage IT investments and to improve information-sharing capabilities of one of its centers, and took steps toward implementing the remaining two recommendations related to improvements in scheduling and monitoring progress of a key IT modernization initiative. However, the agency did not complete all actions needed to implement these two recommendations. Specifically, it did not develop project schedules or conduct IT project monitoring in accordance with best practices. FDA's continued efforts to implement the remaining recommendations are critical to assuring that the agency's ability to manage IT investments and resources will meet its overall mission and goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDA define schedules and milestones for incorporating into its IT strategic plan elements that align with the agency's mission and business strategies, and fully implement the plan.

The table also provides information about the status of the milestones\u2019  implementation.", "Nevertheless, in its current state, the document that FDA has developed  does not include the key elements of a comprehensive IT strategic plan.  First, the new plan does not align OIMT\u2019s objectives with the agency-wide  strategies and goals that were defined by the Commissioner in FDA  Strategic Priorities: 2014-2018. Specifically, the plan identifies objective  areas aimed at accomplishing OIMT\u2019s mission that include, among other  things, information security, training of staff, and project management.

Rather than emphasizing the agency-wide mission to  protect public health, the plan reflects an office-level (OIMT) mission to  \u201cprovide effective and fiscally responsible technology services in a  manner that promotes high standards.\u201d Thus, the performance measures  and milestones for achieving goals were defined to be used to determine  the success of initiatives such as applications development, staffing, and  training. In addition, because the plan does not align with agency-wide  goals and mission performance, it cannot provide information the agency  needs to define appropriate performance measures and mechanisms for  monitoring the outcomes of any IT objectives or initiatives to determine  whether they contribute to FDA\u2019s progress toward meeting its mission  goals.", "The 2015 IT strategic plan also does not identify initiatives that can be  aligned with agency-wide strategies described in FDA\u2019s strategic priorities  document. Rather, it identifies specific IT initiatives that can be linked to  OIMT\u2019s mission, such as contract and project management, customer  service, IT security, infrastructure, and application development. For  example, the IT strategic plan includes a \u201ccybersecurity\u201d initiative and  identifies activities for securing internal and external data. While this  initiative could help support one of the strategies for achieving the fourth  goal of the agency-wide plan\u2014secure mission critical and sensitive  assets and information\u2014the IT strategic plan does not link this initiative to  the agency-wide strategy.", "Finally, the plan does not identify interdependencies among planned and  established IT initiatives. Further, it does not identify specific initiatives  that support strategies and goals for fulfilling the agency\u2019s public health  mission. For example, the agency-wide plan identifies a strategic goal to  enhance oversight of FDA-regulated products. However, the IT strategic  plan does not identify any planned OIMT initiatives or ongoing  modernization projects that could be aligned with this goal, such as the  MARCS program\u2014a collection of subprojects intended to enhance  existing applications and develop new systems in support of the  surveillance and safety of FDA-regulated products. Given the limitations  noted, FDA\u2019s current IT strategic plan is not a comprehensive tool for  providing its officials the information they need to determine and manage  interdependencies across IT projects throughout the agency.", "In discussing our concerns, the CIO stated that the intent of the first  version of the September 2015 IT strategic plan was to identify  improvements, based on an assessment of FDA\u2019s IT environment, that  needed to be made to existing IT processes, technologies, roles,  functions, and capabilities within OIMT. In October 2015, the CIO  documented a process for maintaining milestones in the plan on a  monthly basis, and for adding initiatives and milestones to updated  versions that the agency intends to release on an annual basis. However,  according to OIM officials and the CIO, they have not yet established or  documented schedules or milestones for managing and completing the  development and implementation of the next version of the IT strategic  plan. As such, it is not known if and when FDA will have a comprehensive  plan that can be implemented to provide the guidance and direction  needed for effectively managing IT initiatives and ensuring that outcomes  of the initiatives help the agency meet its overall mission and goals.", "Until FDA incorporates into its IT strategic plan necessary elements that  align the goals and objectives with its overall mission, the agency will  continue to lack critical information needed to ensure that information  resources support business strategies and investment decisions. In  addition, without defined performance measures that support the goals of  the agency, along with mechanisms for assessing system outcomes  against them, FDA will be hampered in its ability to determine whether its  IT initiatives are successful in supporting agency-wide goals.

For example, in  fiscal year 2013, the agency developed \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d enterprise  architectures in terms of business and applications, and proposed  solution architectures for certain segments, including Adverse Events  Analysis and Reporting and Regulatory Science. Further, FDA reported in  its July 2012 Enterprise Architecture Program Management Plan that it  had plans to complete the development of its enterprise architecture and  transition plan and, in an update to the plan, stated that it intended to  complete the segment architectures.", "In conjunction with these efforts, FDA took steps to manage the increased  risks of proceeding without the guidance that would be provided by a  complete architecture. For example, in August 2013 it formed an  Engineering Review Board to discuss and reach mutual agreement on  architectural solutions for modernization projects that promote  interoperability among systems. Further, the FDA centers jointly  conducted reviews of solutions already in progress to identify IT  capabilities that could be reused to avoid duplication. As a result of its  actions, the agency should be better positioned to proceed with  modernization projects and reduce risks of introducing inefficiencies, such  as the lack of interoperability and duplication of efforts, that could occur  without a complete enterprise architecture."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Agency Addressed IT Human Capital Planning", "paragraphs": ["In our 2009 report, we also noted that FDA had not inventoried the skills  of its current IT workforce, determined present and future skills needs, or  analyzed gaps\u2014steps it needed to take to determine critical skills and  competencies for achieving IT program results.

Specifically, in  September 2013, the office identified critical skill shortages, including  insufficient cybersecurity skills. It also concluded that network,  engineering, and infrastructure operations skills were outdated. In  addition, OIM made plans to use a tool that allowed it to collect skills  information about its staff on an ongoing basis, and conducted a skills  gaps analysis, which identified gaps relating to eight job descriptions in  two of its office components. FDA officials also took actions to address  the skills gaps, including offering project management training and hiring  staff, such as database administrators.

However, it has taken some actions, but has  not yet fully implemented two recommendations regarding the  development and use of schedules for managing and monitoring the  progress of IT initiatives.", "Table 2 summarizes the status of the four recommendations, and a  discussion of each recommendation follows the table.", "Our 2012 report noted that FDA did not have a complete list of IT systems  that it was using or developing. We recommended that the agency  develop an inventory that includes key information for each of its systems.", "In response, FDA took actions to implement our recommendation.  Specifically, in May 2015, FDA developed an inventory that identified and  described 205 systems that were reported in the agency\u2019s fiscal year  2016 budget estimates for IT systems to the Office of Management and  Budget. The inventory includes, for each system, data such as the  system\u2019s name; description; annual costs of development, maintenance,  and operations; effective date the system became operational; and a  unique identifier that links each system to a corresponding investment  reported to the Office of Management and Budget. Further, in June 2015,  the agency issued a draft procedure for maintaining the inventory, which it  intends to follow to help ensure that the inventory is consistently updated.", "In addition, FDA incorporated use of the system inventory into the  agency\u2019s IT investment management process. For example, FDA  identified for each system the business capabilities that they support,  such as strategic planning, emergency response, and product review and  approval. These data enable the agency to organize systems and  investments into portfolios according to business capabilities and to view  systems as they relate to other systems that perform similar functions,  rather than as unrelated IT systems. This portfolio view is intended to be  used to help FDA better manage its IT investments as it allows agency  officials to identify any gaps in its ability to support specific business  capabilities that may arise after a system is retired. According to OIM  officials, when such gaps are identified, the agency may then identify and  appropriately fund IT investments that are needed to fill the gaps and  ensure continued support of the agency\u2019s mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Assessed Information-sharing Needs and Capabilities for CFSAN", "paragraphs": ["We reported in 2012 that, although we had previously identified  deficiencies in CFSAN\u2019s ability to effectively share critical information,  such as information on recalls of contaminated food, FDA had not  performed a comprehensive review to identify opportunities for improving  data sharing within the center. We therefore recommended that the  agency perform a full assessment of the center\u2019s data-sharing needs and  capabilities, and develop a plan to address such needs and provide any  additional capabilities.", "In response, FDA implemented our recommendation. Specifically, FDA  assessed and documented CFSAN\u2019s information-sharing needs and  capabilities. The resulting document, entitled Office of Foods and  Veterinary Medicine Data Management Strategy and Roadmap (OFVM  Roadmap), identifies IT shortfalls that contribute to information-sharing  issues, such as the lack of integration between systems, and cases when  systems do not store data in a central warehouse that could be used to  share information. The document includes plans, with milestones and  dates for addressing the center\u2019s information-sharing needs, such as  access to data needed to conduct food facilities and import inspections.", "The roadmap also describes an existing capability for data sharing, the  Online Reporting and Analysis Decision Support System (ORADSS) Data  Warehouse. It noted that the warehouse was being used to store  significant amounts of data used by CFSAN, such as data provided by  FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs, but that most data from the center\u2019s  systems were not stored in a data warehouse. Specifically, the roadmap  identified 17 systems that were assessed as \u201clikely candidates\u201d for  integration with ORADSS, but did not store data in the warehouse. The  roadmap also identified systems from other centers that could share data  via the warehouse, and further stated that incorporating data from these  systems into the warehouse would support data sharing by allowing  access to information from one location, thereby improving collaboration  within and between FDA\u2019s centers.", "In addition, consistent with plans described in the OFVM Roadmap, the  agency documented a plan for sharing scientific computing data among  CFSAN and its partners. This plan is focused on systems for sharing  genomics data that are used to identify and track bacteria that  contaminate food products. OFVM officials determined that scientific data  should be maintained and stored separately from other data because,  unlike the transactional data that are structured and can be stored in a  data warehouse, scientific computing data are less structured and can be  more voluminous, and require additional computational and data transfer  capabilities. To address the need for additional data storage and sharing  capabilities for these data, the agency established two scientific  databases\u2014the Bionumerics SQL and the Next Generation Sequencing  databases.", "By taking these actions, FDA has completed important steps toward  developing an IT environment in which data from multiple systems and  databases can be more efficiently stored and accessed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FDA Has Begun but Has Not Completed Efforts to Develop an IMS for MARCS", "paragraphs": ["In 2012 we noted that considerable work remained to be completed on  the MARCS program, one of FDA\u2019s largest and most costly IT  modernization efforts. We recommended that the agency develop an IMS  to assist in managing and monitoring projects that are part of the MARCS  program. We stressed that such a schedule should (1) identify which  legacy systems will be replaced and when, (2) identify all current and  future tasks to be performed by contractors and FDA, (3) define and  incorporate information reflecting resources, and (4) define critical  dependencies between tasks.", "FDA took a number of steps to implement the recommendation, but there  are shortfalls in its approach for identifying tasks and resources. For  example, FDA developed an IMS that identified legacy systems and  included associated tasks and time frames for updating or maintaining the  systems from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018. In addition, the  agency identified detailed tasks to be completed in fiscal years 2014 and  2015, and also included in the schedule some summary-level tasks to be  completed in future years, such as those for maintaining legacy systems.", "However, we could not determine if the tasks in the schedule included all  tasks that needed to be completed to implement the MARCS projects. We  could not make this determination because the agency had not  documented the information that it needed to identify all tasks that should  be included in the schedule\u2014i.e., it had not developed a work breakdown  structure that could be used to identify all tasks needed to be completed  for the program.", "In addition, the schedule did not identify all resources needed to complete  certain tasks\u2014i.e., it did not identify specific FDA staff or the skills needed  to complete tasks. Instead, the schedule identified responsible entities  within the agency, thus increasing the risk that needed staff and skills  could be assigned to another task and, therefore, would not be available  to work on others.", "Lastly, we found errors in the way dependencies between tasks were  defined. Specifically, the MARCS IMS did not identify external  dependencies between activities, such as projects to be completed by  contractors, and dependencies that were identified between tasks  contained errors. For example, there are a significant number of tasks in  the schedule for which there are no identified dependencies, and some  remaining tasks have restrictions on their start date that are not justified\u2014 i.e., the restrictions are not based on the start or finish of an activity on  which the tasks are dependent.", "Agency officials from the Office of Regulatory Affairs and the MARCS  program said that the IMS identifies detailed tasks for the current fiscal  year because FDA develops its schedule based on work that is to be  accomplished during that year. According to the officials, this is done  because projects are funded on an annual basis; therefore, they cannot  know what projects will be conducted in future years. The officials further  explained that the IMS is updated at least annually based on changes in  business priorities and funding availability, and as the planning horizon  advances. While this approach can be taken for developing schedules,  according to best practices defined in our schedule assessment guide,  all tasks needed to complete the program should be identified within a  work breakdown structure to ensure that the total scope of work is  accounted for within the schedule.", "The officials also noted that they do not identify specific FDA staff or  estimate the percentage of time required of those resources because they  assume that the responsible entities will dedicate one staff person to work  full time on each project. However, a schedule that does not identify  specific resources assumes unlimited availability and, thus, the risk of the  program\u2019s schedule slipping significantly increases if needed staff or skills  are not available when needed.", "In addition, officials said that, while they identify some dependencies  between contractors\u2019 projects, they do not identify all of them because  some of the projects are not tightly integrated. The program officials  further stated that the objectives and scope of the MARCS program today  are much different from those at the time we recommended the  development of an IMS, and that the program does not currently have the  cross-task dependencies that existed in the prior scope that would be  addressed by such an integrated schedule. However, the identification of  interdependencies between all activities is important to allow program  officials to recognize delays that could occur when activities that slip early  in the schedule impact concurrent or future activities.", "Lacking certainty that the IMS includes all short- and long-term tasks,  reliable estimates of resources, and dependencies between individual  tasks and contractors\u2019 activities, the value of the schedule as a critical  management tool is diminished\u2014i.e., it cannot be used to accurately  gauge the level of effort required to implement the MARCS program,  determine whether staff will be available when needed, or predict the  effect of factors such as delayed contractor activities on the schedule.  Thus, the MARCS schedule cannot be used as an effective tool for  managing and monitoring the progress of the project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA Has Not Yet Used the IMS to Monitor Progress of MARCS", "paragraphs": ["In our 2012 report, we also noted that the agency lacked an IMS for  MARCS that provided a summary of progress on lower-level tasks and  effects of changes to lower-level schedules and tasks on the overall  project. Thus, we reported that the agency did not have the information it  needed to gauge the progress of the entire project. We recommended  that, in addition to developing a complete IMS, agency officials use it to  monitor progress of the MARCS program.", "Agency officials have implemented certain activities that could help them  use the IMS to monitor the progress of MARCS; however, they have not  developed the schedule to include all the information needed to do so.  First, agency officials began to conduct monthly updates that, for  example, reflected actual progress from individual system subproject  schedules. In addition, the program office developed a baseline schedule  that could be used for measuring and monitoring project performance and  progress. These actions are important steps to be taken toward  addressing our recommendation that agency officials use the MARCS  IMS to monitor the program\u2019s progress.", "Yet, because of deficiencies in the agency\u2019s practices for conducting  these activities, along with other deficiencies noted previously, the  usefulness of the schedule for monitoring the program is limited. For  example, although program officials update the IMS on a monthly basis, it  includes activities with projected start or finish dates that are prior to the  date the schedule was updated. However, according to best practices  defined in our schedule assessment guide, projected start and finish  dates should never be prior to the date the schedule was updated; that is,  dates cannot be projected to start in the past. Agency officials within  OIMT stated that they manually update the schedule each month, and do  not use a tool for automated updating. As a result, the updates often are  not accurate or complete, which could account for projected dates for  activities not being modified during the monthly updates.", "MARCS program officials also developed a baseline schedule that is  aligned to the MARCS IMS, and is intended to be used to monitor the  progress of the program. For example, data in a baseline schedule  represent important information that program management could use to  assess the validity of the program\u2019s initial duration estimates and the  program\u2019s progress toward beginning and finishing work on time and  according to plan\u2014i.e., trend data. While program officials stated that  they planned to analyze trend data provided by the baseline schedule at  the end of fiscal year 2015, and use the results of the analysis to manage  and monitor the progress of MARCS, they have not yet done so.", "While FDA officials have taken some steps to use the IMS and a baseline  schedule to monitor the progress of the MARCS implementation, they are  doing so with inaccurate or incomplete information. Therefore, the agency  may not have necessary information to monitor and make any needed  changes to program plans to ensure that the schedule for implementing  MARCS remains on track and the project is providing results that meet  the agency\u2019s needs.", "The fiscal year 2016 business case that was reported to the Office of  Management and Budget indicates that funding for MARCS is planned  through fiscal year 2019. However, officials with the Office of Regulatory  Affairs told us that the agency has chosen to restructure the MARCS  investment to better reflect current business needs and objectives.
