Local areas found all of the sources of information they used to be at least moderately useful. To identify occupations that are in demand, GAO estimates that nearly 90 percent of local areas used state job banks and occupational projections, both of which are funded by the Department of Labor (DOL). All percentages presented on this highlights page are estimates from the survey and have a sampling error of no larger than plus or minus 7 percentage points. In addition, 93 percent of areas used at least one local initiative, such as a partnership with the local economic development agency, to identify such jobs. As compared to other sources, areas reported using local initiatives because they provided more detailed information and better reflected local employers' needs. To guide participants toward training, most local areas required them to complete certain activities, such as meeting with a case manager to discuss training options (80 percent) or completing a skills assessment (78 percent). Most local areas faced challenges in guiding participants toward training. Specifically, local areas faced challenges related to participants' lack of financial or work supports, such as child care or transportation (67 percent); participants' lack of the basic skills necessary even to participate in training (66 percent); difficulty finding training providers who could quickly adapt curricula to employers' changing needs (62 percent); and high training costs (54 percent). However, in 57 percent of local areas, these challenges did not affect their ability to guide participants toward training.", "Local areas had difficulty helping employers fill certain jobs for a variety of reasons, including the low skills of some participants, according to GAO estimates. Eighty percent of local areas reported that employers had difficulty filling certain jobs, some of which can be considered \"middle-skilled\" jobs, such as welders and machinists, because they require more than a high-school diploma but less than a 4-year college degree. These local areas had difficulty supplying such workers because participants lacked relevant qualifications or the basic skills needed to participate in related training, among other reasons. To help participants improve their skills, DOL and other agencies have encouraged the use of career pathways approaches that combine job training with basic skills education and support services. According to these agencies, such approaches aim to enable participants to secure industry relevant certification and obtain employment within an occupational area and advance to higher levels of future education and employment in the area. However, little is known about the extent to which local areas are using career pathways approaches--or how they are using these approaches--specifically to prepare participants for middle-skilled jobs that employers have had difficulty filling. Without information on whether and how local areas are using these approaches to prepare participants for such jobs, DOL may not be well-positioned to help local areas use these approaches to better meet employers' needs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL collect and disseminate information on how local areas have used career pathways approaches to prepare workers for middle-skilled jobs that employers have difficulty filling.

Eighty  percent of local areas we surveyed said that employers had difficulty  filling jobs in certain occupations. Local areas most frequently cited the  following jobs as those that employers had difficulty filling: welders,  machinists, heath care occupations, computer occupations, and truck  drivers (see app. II for a complete list of occupations identified by WIBs  as those that employers had difficulty filling).

However, DOL officials disagreed that WIA performance  measures encourage local areas to place participants into employment  quickly. Also, DOL officials cited customer choice as a reason why some  low-skilled participants do not receive training for middle-skilled jobs.

In each of these  states, we asked representatives of the state WIB to classify each local  WIB in their state as either primarily urban or primarily rural. We then  randomly selected one primarily urban and one primarily rural WIB in  each state to interview, excluding those that were part of our survey  sample. We interviewed a total of eight local WIBs and one statewide  WIB. Of the eight local WIBs, five were primarily urban and three were  primarily rural."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Skills Gap Analysis", "paragraphs": ["We did not conduct a skills gap analysis as part of this study primarily  because reliable data on the conditions associated with a skills gap were  not available at the local or state levels. According to officials from DOL\u2019s  Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the following conditions would be  associated with a skills gap in a particular occupation: 1) jobs remain  unfilled for a longer-than-normal time period, 2) wages are increasing,  and 3) unemployment is low. We explored the possibility of using existing  datasets to identify occupations that have rising wages and low  unemployment rates, and then asking the WIBs we surveyed whether  employers in their local areas had difficulty filling these jobs. However, we  concluded that reliable data on occupational unemployment rates are only  available on the national level. Because national data may not reflect  local labor market conditions, we did not incorporate such data into our  survey. Instead, we asked the WIBs we surveyed to list occupations that  employers in their area had difficulty filling and then coded their  responses to Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) codes. For  more information on the occupational coding, see appendix II.", "Specifically, BLS\u2019 Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program  provides data on employment and wages by occupation, but officials told  us that local-level OES data on occupational wage growth may not be  reliable, and noted that data on occupational unemployment rates are not  available at the local level. In addition, we determined that state-level  data on occupational unemployment rates are not sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. Specifically, we were unable to use state-level data from  the Current Population Survey (CPS) to identify occupations with lower  than average unemployment rates because the standard error associated  with these estimates was over 20 percent in states with small  populations. While data from online job openings\u2014such as that  published by The Conference Board\u2014are used by some researchers to  estimate state-level unemployment by broad occupational categories,  these data are not available at the local level, and the reliability and  validity of the data is not known.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2012 to December 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Occupations That Employers Had Difficulty Filling in Calendar Year 2012", "paragraphs": ["Our web-based survey of 200 workforce investment boards (WIB)  included a question asking if employers in their local area had difficulty  filling jobs in certain occupations in calendar year 2012 (see appendix I  for more information on the survey\u2019s methodology). If WIBs answered  yes, they were asked to list up to five occupations that employers had  difficulty filling in open-ended boxes and also to indicate if the WIB  considered each occupation to be high growth in its local area. A total of  110 WIBs listed one occupation that was difficult to fill, 95 WIBs listed 2  occupations, 70 WIBs listed 3 occupations, 47 WIBs listed 4 occupations,  and 32 WIBs listed 5 occupations. We coded these open-ended  responses to the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification (SOC)  codes. The 2010 SOC system is used by federal statistical agencies to  classify workers into occupational categories for the purpose of collecting,  calculating, or disseminating data.", "In order to code the survey responses to the most appropriate SOC code,  we searched the SOC titles or definitions or the related Direct Match Title  File (DMTF) on keywords or phrases provided in the open-ended survey  responses. Survey responses were coded to the most detailed SOC code  allowable based on the search results. In many cases, there was a one- to-one match at the detailed SOC level for many detailed occupations,  including registered nurses, welders, and machinists. Survey responses  that had a one-to-one match at a broad, minor group, or major group  SOC level were coded at that higher level, including engineers and  driver/sales workers and truck drivers.", "Some survey responses resulted in multiple matches at the detailed SOC  level. If all of the matches were among related occupations, the response  was coded at the SOC level that incorporated all of the title matches. For  example, a survey response of web designer and programmer matched  to several detailed occupations that could be rolled up into the minor  group of computer occupations.", "Some survey responses matched to multiple detailed occupations that  could not be rolled up to a higher SOC level. For example, a survey  response of accounting matched to accountants and auditors which is a  business and financial occupation, and also to bookkeeping, accounting,  and auditing clerks which is an office and administrative support  occupation. Responses were coded to more than one SOC code if May  2012 Occupational Employment Survey data indicated that workers were  employed in all of the matched occupations in the metropolitan statistical  area that contained the WIB. The most codes that were assigned to one  survey response were two codes. Of the 354 survey responses that were  coded, only 17 responses were assigned two SOC codes resulting in a  total of 371 SOC codes assigned.", "Survey respondents frequently cited manufacturing (15) or advanced  manufacturing (14), which are considered industries, not occupations,  and matched to multiple SOC codes in different occupational groups. We  created separate categories for these two responses in order to preserve  the specificity of these responses given the relatively large number of  survey responses where WIBs indicated these jobs were difficult to fill.  Similarly, we created a separate code for the 20 responses that just  stated health care without specifying an occupation, and also for the 7  responses that just stated nurse without specifying registered nurse or  licensed practical nurse. Other survey responses that were vague or  could not otherwise be matched to SOC occupations were coded as  unknown.", "A second analyst reviewed the SOC code matches and codes assigned  by the first analyst to see if the assigned codes had face validity. In cases  where there was disagreement or additional information was needed, the  two analysts met to reconcile differences. A third analyst independently  verified the counts of the codes listed in table 3 below. The number of  coded occupations represents those most frequently cited by WIBs that  responded to the survey question and cannot be generalized beyond that  population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Patrick DiBattista (Assistant  Director), Caitlin Croake, Hedieh Fusfield, Linda Siegel, and Paul Wright  made key contributions to this report.
