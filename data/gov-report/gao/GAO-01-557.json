S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) estimates that it will spend at least $15 billion to $20 billion to clean up contamination and other hazards (hereafter hazards) at thousands of properties that were formerly owned, leased, possessed, or operated by the Department of Defense (DOD) or its components. These properties, located throughout the United States, are known as formerly used defense sites (FUDS). The properties may contain hazardous, toxic, and radioactive wastes in the soil and water or in containers such as underground storage tanks. Such wastes can contribute to mortality and serious illness, or pose a threat to the environment. Other hazards, including unexploded ordnance and unsafe buildings, may also be present on the properties. As of October 1, 2000, the Corps, states, and other parties had identified 9,171 properties for potential inclusion in the FUDS cleanup program. The Corps is responsible for cleaning up the hazards, including removing underground storage tanks, and demolishing unsafe structures.", "Concerned about the ongoing presence of defense-related hazards on property that is no longer controlled by DOD, you asked us to determine (1) how many properties identified for potential inclusion in the FUDS cleanup program are actually eligible for cleanup under the program and require or have required cleanup and (2) the geographic distribution, by state, of the potentially eligible FUDS properties and their locations, type(s) of hazard, including unexploded ordnance, and cleanup status. For those properties with unexploded ordnance, you also asked us to indicate if they are former training ranges, which often have large amounts of ordnance present after many years of use and may be costly to clean up. Our review of these issues encompassed all potentially eligible properties included in the Corps\u2019 FUDS inventory as of the end of fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Identification, investigation, and cleanup of hazardous substances under DOD\u2019s FUDS program are authorized by the Defense Environmental Restoration Program (DERP). Such actions must be carried out consistent with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA) as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA), which established DERP. The goals of the program also include the correction of environmental damage. To fund the program, SARA set up the Defense Environmental Restoration Account.", "DOD has established specific goals for the cleanup of properties, including FUDS, that have hazardous, toxic, and radioactive wastes in the soil and water. These goals include having an approved cleanup process in place or cleanup complete at 100 percent of all such properties by the end of fiscal year 2014. DOD has not yet set any goals for projects involving hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste in containers, unexploded ordnance, other explosive wastes, or unsafe building demolition.", "Total spending for the FUDS cleanup program since fiscal 1984 is $2.6 billion. During the most recent past five fiscal years (1997-2001), annual program funding for FUDS cleanup averaged about $238 million, with program funding in fiscal year 2001 of $231 million. The Corps\u2019 estimate of the additional cost to complete cleanup of the 4,467 currently identified projects is about $13 billion, not including program management or support costs or inflation beyond fiscal year 2007. Also omitted from the estimated cost is a revised cost projection for the cleanup of unexploded ordnance, which resulted from a recent survey of DOD training ranges. According to Corps officials, the revised cost projection for ordnance cleanup would add another $5 billion or more, depending on the level of cleanup selected, to the estimated cost to complete all FUDS projects. By the time all projects are completed, the Corps estimates that it will spend at least $15 billion to $20 billion cleaning up FUDS properties. At the current funding level, the Corps does not expect to meet the established goal of cleaning up FUDS properties with hazardous, toxic, and radioactive waste by fiscal year 2014, even if work could be deferred on all other projects, such as containerized wastes, unexploded ordnance, and building demolition, for which no goals have been established.", "In deciding which actions, if any, need to be taken at a potential FUDS property, the Corps generally follows the process established for cleanup actions under CERCLA. The process usually includes the following phases:   Preliminary assessment of eligibility\u2014The Corps determines if the property is eligible for the FUDS cleanup program based on whether there are records showing that DOD formerly owned, leased, possessed, or operated the property or facility. The Corps also identifies any potential hazard on the property related to DOD activities. The results of this assessment are detailed in an Inventory Project Report. If the property is eligible but there is no evidence of hazards, the property is categorized as requiring \u201cno further action.\u201d", "Site inspection\u2014The Corps inspects the site to confirm the presence, extent, and source(s) of hazards.", "Remedial investigation and feasibility study\u2014The Corps evaluates the risk associated with the hazard; determines whether cleanup is needed; and, if so, selects alternative cleanup approaches.", "Remedial action\u2014The Corps designs the remedy, performs the cleanup, and conducts long-term monitoring if necessary.", "When all of these steps have been completed for a given project, or if no cleanup is needed, the Corps considers the project to be \u201cresponse complete.\u201d After all projects at a property are designated as response complete, the property can then be closed out. Property closeout may require concurrence by federal or state regulators depending on the type of hazard involved.", "A flow chart showing the decision process in the preliminary assessment of eligibility phase is shown in figure 1.", "Upon completion of the preliminary assessment of eligibility phase, a property enters the site inspection phase. The site inspection phase involves a more detailed examination of the property and related records to confirm that a hazard exists and that a cleanup project is required to remove or reduce the hazard to a safe level. After the site inspection phase, the Corps conducts a remedial investigation to assess the risk posed by the hazard and determine if a cleanup is necessary. A feasibility study is then performed to select a cleanup approach. The Corps develops more detailed plans for constructing and carrying out the selected cleanup approach during the remedial design phase. A project next moves into the remedial action phase. The remedial action phase can involve several steps including constructing or installing the selected cleanup approach, operating the approach, and long-term monitoring, if necessary.", "A flow chart for the site inspection through long-term monitoring process is shown as figure 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Potential FUDS Properties Are Ineligible or Do Not Require Cleanup", "paragraphs": ["Corps review of potential FUDS properties found that many properties are ineligible because they are still part of an active DOD installation or there are no records available showing that DOD ever owned or controlled the property.

However, after further investigation the Corps determined that projects identified at 405 properties were ineligible because other outside parties were responsible for contaminating the properties after DOD relinquished control. At another 33 properties, the identified projects were not recommended for further action or were not approved. The reasons for not recommending a project for further action or not approving a project varied.

The completed projects figure includes those removed from the active inventory either as a result of a study or an administrative action or as the result of an actual cleanup action such as removing toxic wastes or treating contaminated groundwater. In fact, our analysis showed that over 57 percent of the projects reported as complete did not require any actual cleanup and were reported as complete on the basis of a study or an administrative decision. For example, 183 of the 205 unexploded ordnance projects reported as complete were closed based on a study, while only 22 required an actual cleanup phase. Further, the completed figure includes 774 projects that were ineligible for cleanup as part of the FUDS program. The Corps initially thought that these projects were eligible but later determined that they were ineligible because the contamination was caused by other parties after DOD relinquished control of the properties.

On the other hand, many of the remaining cleanup projects are high cost and technologically difficult. Consequently, cleanup of the approximately 2,100 remaining projects will require at least $13 billion (revised estimates may raise this to $18 billion or more) and take more than 70 years to complete based on current planned funding of about $200 million per year.
