At 15 offices, contractor employees outnumbered DOD employees and comprised up to 88 percent of the workforce. Contractor employees perform key tasks, including developing contract requirements and advising on award fees for other contractors. In contrast to federal employees, few government ethics laws and DOD-wide policies are in place to prevent personal conflicts of interest for defense contractor employees. Several laws and regulations address personal conflicts of interest, but just one applies to both federal and contractor employees. Some DOD offices and defense contractor companies are voluntarily adopting safeguards. For example, realizing the risk from personal conflicts of interest for particularly sensitive areas, the 19 DOD offices GAO reviewed that used contractor employees in the source selection process all use safeguards such as contract clauses that prohibit contractor employees' participation in a DOD procurement affecting a personal financial interest. In certain other tasks, only 3 of the 23 defense contractors GAO reviewed had safeguards requiring employees to identify potential conflicts of interest so they can be mitigated. In general, government officials believed that current requirements are inadequate to prevent conflicts from arising for certain contractor employees influencing DOD decisions, especially financial conflicts of interest and impaired impartiality. Some program managers and defense contractor officials expressed concern that adding new safeguards will increase costs. But ethics officials and senior leaders countered that, given the risk associated with personal conflicts of interest and the expanding roles that contractor employees play, such safeguards are necessary."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Contractors have long played an integral role in the development of  equipment and systems that fit the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) unique  needs and in the delivery of certain support services, such as building  maintenance, food service, and information technology services.  Increasingly, however, contractors are also being hired to perform tasks  affecting billions of dollars in DOD spending to oversee and execute high- risk programs, such as the acquisition of major weapon systems, and to  assist in some of DOD\u2019s most sensitive and restricted operations. In DOD  facilities, certain contractor employees work side-by-side with federal  employees on substantially the same mission-critical tasks.", "Given concerns with protecting the integrity of DOD\u2019s operations and  federal spending, you asked us to review existing safeguards intended to  prevent contractor employees from having personal conflicts of interest  when performing tasks for DOD. In response, because DOD does not  maintain departmentwide data on the numbers of contractor employees  working side-by-side with federal employees, this report assesses (1) the  roles being played by certain contractor employees by identifying how  many of them are working at the DOD offices we reviewed as well as what  responsibilities they have. This report also assesses (2) what safeguards  there are to prevent conflict of interests for contractor employees and (3)  whether government and defense contractor officials believe additional  safeguards are necessary.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed the conflicts of interest and ethics  laws and regulations applicable to DOD government employees and  defense contractor employees and DOD and federal policies on  contracting. To assess the mission-critical roles being played by certain  employees across a representative cross-section of DOD, we obtained  information from five major organizations judgmentally selected for  having large DOD contractor workforces: Air Force, Army, Navy, Missile  Defense Agency, Tricare Management Activity, and DOD organizational  sponsors for four federally funded research and development centers  (FFRDC), which are nonprofit organizations established under long-term  contracts with the federal government to meet some special long-term  research or development need. To describe the types of mission-critical  services that certain defense contractor employees are providing to those  five DOD organizations, we judgmentally selected 21 DOD offices for  review which were identified by DOD officials as having large contractor  workforce and representing a cross-section of DOD organizations. We  obtained information from these offices to document how many DOD and  contractor employees worked there and the types of mission-critical  contracted services performed by contractor employees and interviewed  program managers, ethics and contracting officials about personal conflict  of interest safeguards. We obtained information about ethics programs  from 23 contractor and 4 FFRDC organizations judgmentally selected  because their employees are performing contracted services at the 21 DOD  offices we reviewed. We also interviewed officials from those contractor  and FFRDC organizations to obtain information on conflict of interest  safeguards and met with the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) to obtain  views and information about conflict of interest safeguards appropriate for  contractor employees. We conducted this performance audit from  November 2006 through March 2008 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.  We believe that the evidence obtained provides a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.  Appendix I provides additional details of our scope and  methodology.", "This report focuses specifically on individual, or personal, conflicts of  interest among DOD contractor employees as opposed to organizational  conflicts of interest.

By contrast, an organizational conflict of interest occurs when a  defense contractor has present or currently planned interests that either  directly or indirectly (including business or relationships with other  contractors) relate to the work to be performed under a DOD contract and  (1) may diminish its capacity to give impartial, technically sound, objective  assistance or advice, or (2) may result in it having an unfair competitive  advantage."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD hires contractors to provide a wide range of services that may include  basic services (custodial and landscaping); administrative types of services  (travel and management support); and complex professional and  management (i.e., advisory and assistance) services that closely support  inherently governmental functions, decisions, and spending, (acquisition  support, budget preparation, developing or interpreting regulations,  engineering and technical services, and policy development). Contractor  employees often work inside DOD facilities, alongside DOD employees, to  provide these services.", "DOD\u2019s increased spending on services in recent years indicates there are a  large number of contractor employees working side-by-side with federal  employees. In fiscal year 2006, DOD obligated more than $151 billion on  services contracts, a 78 percent real increase since fiscal year 1996.  Overall, according to DOD, the amount obligated on services contracts in  fiscal year 2005 exceeded the amount the department spent on supplies  and equipment, including major weapon systems. Some categories of  spending on services have grown significantly in recent years. For  example, obligations for professional, management, and administrative  support has grown about 161 percent from 1996 to 2005; obligations for  medical services grew by more than 400 percent during the same time  period.", "Several reasons are behind DOD\u2019s increased reliance on contractors for  services. In addition to the belief that it is more cost-effective to hire  contractor employees instead of government employees, reasons include  the need for skills and expertise not currently found in DOD; the flexibility  and the relative ease in obtaining necessary support from contractor  employees instead of hiring more government employees; and ceilings on  the authorized number of government employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contractor Employees Outnumber DOD Employees at Many Offices That GAO Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not compiled departmentwide data on the numbers of contractor  employees working at its facilities.

Some of these tasks  are similar to functions performed by federal employees. For example, at the  front end of the acquisition process, contractor employees who work in  various DOD program offices study alternative ways to acquire desired  capabilities, help develop requirements, and help design and evaluate  requests for proposals as well as responses to those proposals and provide  advice on the past performance of external contractors competing for that  work. In the course of an acquisition, contractor employees recommend  actions to program offices to correct other contractors\u2019 performance  problems, they analyze other contractors\u2019 cost, schedule and performance  data, and they assist in award-fee determinations for other contractors. In  addition, contractor employees help DOD program offices develop long-range  financial plans as well as yearly budgets. They also assist in administrative  tasks to support program offices by tracking travel budgets and researching  and reconciling payment discrepancies.", "Although we view the types of roles being played by contractor employees as  closely supporting inherently governmental functions, some DOD officials  had a different perspective. That is, when discussing contractor employees\u2019  roles in the decision-making process, program managers we spoke with  characterize contractor employee involvement as \u201ctechnical\u201d input into the  decision-making process versus direct involvement in the decisions  themselves. It should be noted, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  defines contractor participation in the evaluation of contract proposals as one  of those functions that may approach being in the inherently governmental  function category.", "Appendix IV provides more details on the key services contractor employees  are performing in the DOD offices we reviewed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Laws or DOD- Wide Policies Address Personal Conflicts of Interests among Contractor Employees", "paragraphs": ["Contractor employees are not subject to the same laws and regulations  that are designed to prevent conflicts of interests among federal  employees.

On the other hand, some program managers, realizing the risk from  potential personal conflicts of interest, have established their own  safeguards for particularly sensitive areas where contractor employees  provide support to decision processes. For example, all DOD offices we  reviewed that used contractor employees in the source selection process  use additional safeguard controls such as contract clauses designed to  prevent personal conflicts of interests.

According to a policy alert sent  out in August 2007 to the command\u2019s contracting activities, an underlying  principle behind the policy is preventing the existence of conflicting roles  that might bias a contractor employee\u2019s judgment.

According to the senior vice president,  this conflict of interest safeguard applies to every employee working on  this subcontract. The company\u2019s safeguard is similar to the financial  disclosure process used for DOD employees covered by federal conflict of  interest safeguards.

Except in three cases,  the policies did not require written disclosure forms identifying potential  conflicts of interest with the employees\u2019 work at DOD.", "More specifically, our review of the documents showed that:    policies for 4 of the contractor firms did not address avoidance of  personal conflicts of interests at all;    policies for 18 of the firms did address avoidance of personal conflicts  of interest, but just 3 specifically required written disclosures  identifying potential conflicts of interest with respect to their work for  customers, including DOD, so they can be screened and mitigated by  the firms; and     16 of the firms extended their conflicts policies to the employees\u2019  family members.", "Our analysis of contractors\u2019 ethics documents found variation in how the  contractors\u2019 policy and procedural safeguards address how employees\u2019  financial interests that could conflict or create the appearance of a conflict  in the work they do for clients such as DOD. For example, several  companies have conflict of interest policies addressing business ethics and  standards of conduct requiring all employees to avoid having a range of  financial or personal interests that would interfere in any way with their  work for the company and could make others question the company\u2019s  integrity, or give the appearance of impropriety. These contractors\u2019  conflicts of interest policies generally describe a range of potential  activities that include employees\u2019 financial or other interests,  arrangements, and outside business interests and personal relationships  that could pose an actual or the appearance of a conflict to be avoided.", "In three cases, however, the policies required written disclosure forms  identifying potential conflicts of interest related to work carried out for  DOD. That is, three contractor firms we reviewed require their employees  to disclose potential conflicts related to their work at DOD and have  employees working at the Air Force, Navy, and Army advising and  assisting on engineering development and operation of aircraft and missile  programs and acquisition management support on a communications  program.  For example as presented below, two firms have measures for  ensuring that their employees do not have personal interests that would  conflict with their work at DOD. According to the firms\u2019 ethics  documentation, these measures are part of the corporate mission and  values statements so that all levels of their employees are aware that their  services to clients as well as individual and company decisions are based  on core business values such as honesty and the highest standards of  ethics and integrity. For example:     One small business contractor has employees who work on a range of  aeronautical systems programs of the Air Force Materiel Command.  Their responsibilities for one of the offices we visited in the area of  acquisition management include tasks in various phases of the  acquisition cycle, such as development, award, management, and  contract closeout. The company has a 3-page Financial Conflict of  Interest Reporting Form\u2014and according to company officials, it is  modeled on the federal financial disclosure form\u2014that each of its  professional employees must submit when initially hired and annually  thereafter. The contractor\u2019s reporting form asks each employee if there  are any personal or household financial interests in the matters dealt  with under the Air Force contract, such as stock ownership in any of  the contractors who are involved in the aeronautical systems programs  that the employee works on as part of his or her tasks. The company\u2019s  vice-president stated that, as the employee\u2019s supervisor, he evaluates  reported interests on the financial conflict of interest form and reviews  the circumstances in light of present and prospective duties of the  individual to ensure that both actual and apparent conflicts of interest  are avoided. According to the vice-president, he also decides on how  any conflict or apparent conflict will be resolved, such as  reassignment, divestiture, or disqualification.", "A large business defense contractor has employees who work on  missile programs under the Naval Sea Systems Command. Their  responsibilities for the Navy include systems engineering and program  office support, including contract management input for award fee  deliberations and contract modifications.  The company has a 1-page  Certificate on Conflict of Interest, Relationships with Suppliers, and  Standards of Business Conduct that, according to contractor officials,  employees are required to submit annually by e-mail, fax, or on-line.  The certification form requires yes or no answers to seven questions  that serve to prompt each employee to disclose certain interests in the  company\u2019s suppliers or prospective suppliers, such as whether they or  a member of their family has a substantial financial interest. The form  also asks each employee if they or their family members have any  other interest or agreement which may violate the Standards of  Business Conduct or may otherwise result in an actual or perceived  conflict of interest.  According to the company\u2019s ethics and Navy  contracting managers, the annual conflict-of-interest certification  process receives a fair amount of supervisory review and screening by  corporate business ethics offices in order to prevent or mitigate actual  or even the appearance of an employee being in a position with a  personal conflict of interest."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stricter Conflict of Interest Safeguards Recently Developed for DOD FFRDC Employees", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s FFRDCs are private nonprofit organizations established to meet  specialized or long-term research or development needs that cannot be  met by existing government or contractor resources.

Moreover, they pointed out that their employees would know to  advise their supervisors of any potential conflicts, consistent with the  companies\u2019 ethics program procedures. Contractor officials also  contended that the creation of new safeguards could drive up costs for the  government because of contractor administrative costs for collecting and  maintaining employee financial conflict of interest paperwork.", "Company officials cited other reasons for not establishing additional  conflict of interest safeguards for contractor employees, but we found  evidence that contradicted these positions. For example, one reason was  that defense contractor companies\u2019 business ethics and standards of  conduct for their employees are already consistent with the government\u2019s  ethics requirements for federal employees. Our review of 22 contractors\u2019  ethics program documents found that they did not address the same issues  that the government ethics programs are required to address. Also, in  some cases, they were designed to protect the contractor\u2019s interests, not  the government\u2019s.", "Another reason was that the risk of conflicts of interest for contractor  employees was low because it would be obvious if these employees tried  to steer decision making to favor a personal interest or bias. Some  contractor officials also stressed that the role that their employees were  playing in decisions was minimal. Some government officials we spoke  with, however, indicated that these types of inputs into decisions are not  trivial and that it may not always be obvious when employees are  providing biased information.", "On the other hand, many company officials told us that if the federal  government were to require contractor employees to submit financial  conflict of interest certifications or disclosures, then the companies would  comply in the interest of maintaining the public\u2019s confidence in the  integrity of government operations supported by contractor employees. In  addition, a manager of one small business defense contractor said that the  company\u2019s personal conflicts of interest and ethical conduct policy already  requires all employees to submit annual financial conflict of interest  reporting forms when assigned to perform government work. He added  that most support contractor employees are retired military and have been  accustomed to abiding by government rules for 30 years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Viewpoints of Ethics Officials and Senior Leaders", "paragraphs": ["Senior officials within DOD responsible for ensuring integrity in employee  conduct and in the contracting function as well as the OGE told us that  they believed that there are risks associated with personal conflicts of  interests not just in program offices that involve contractors in source  selection, but those that use contractors in other ways to support spending  decisions. In fact, during our review, DOD undertook steps to begin  assessing the need for departmentwide policies for preventing personal  conflicts of interests for its contractor employees.", "OGE: OGE, which promulgates ethics guidance for the executive branch,  has expressed concerns that current federal requirements and policies are  inadequate to prevent certain kinds of ethical violations on the part of  contractor employees. The office is specifically concerned with potential  financial conflicts of interest, impaired impartiality, and misuse of  information and authority.  As such, additional conflict of interest  safeguards should be targeted at contractor employees engaged in the  types of services that influence governmental spending, contracting, and  mission delivery decisions and concern the type of processes and  operations upon which considerations of management and delegation  must turn. OGE has also observed that federal and contractor employees  work so closely on a day-to-day basis, it is difficult to distinguish whether  employees are government or contracted and they see greater risks to the  integrity of decisions given the growing influence that contractors appear  to be having on government operations and expenditure of funds.", "OGE has advocated policy changes to apply conflicts of interest  requirements to contractors. In considering additional contract-based  safeguards to ensure that the government\u2019s interests are not  compromised by contractor employees\u2019 conflicts of interest, OGE\u2019s  acting director has expressed concerns in several areas, such as:    advisory and assistance services support, especially those where  contractor personnel regularly perform in the government workplace  and participate in deliberative and decision-making processes along  with government employees;    management and operations contracts involving large research  facilities and laboratories, military bases, and other major programs;  and  large indefinite delivery or umbrella contracts that involve  decentralized ordering and delivery of services at multiple agencies or  offices.", "DOD ethics and general counsel officials: Defense ethics and other general  counsel officials we spoke to from several DOD offices responsible for  DOD-wide standards of conduct and ethics compliance had generally the  same concerns raised by OGE. For example, according to the director of  DOD\u2019s Standards of Conduct Office in 2006, as DOD increases its  integration of contractor employees into the actual administration of its  organizations and offices, the larger the gap between employees in its  blended workforce in terms of the conflict of interest requirements that  apply only to federal employees, and the more difficult it becomes to  ensure the integrity of government decision making. DOD ethics and  general counsel officials also expressed concerns about risks associated  with reliance on contractor employees, particularly when they perform  many of the same advisory and management functions as federal  employees. An Army general counsel official observed that contractor  employees are exerting greater influence over Army operations given that  the Army has lost expertise and leadership over the years.", "Further, DOD ethics and general counsel officials stated that those  contractor employees participating in and supporting the government\u2019s  decision-making processes should be subject to stricter conflict of interest  rules so that agencies can better judge the objectivity of their advice to the  government. An Air Force ethics official said his office has come across  situations in which contractor employees would have been in violation of  the government ethics rules had they been government employees. An  Army general counsel official told us that not requiring financial disclosure  statements from contractor employees poses the greatest risk to the  integrity and impartiality of the work they perform under contract for the  government. Unlike for federal employees who are prohibited under  conflict of interest law from participating in a particular matter involving  specific parties in which they have a financial interest, there is no way to  know whether contractor employees are doing so.", "In 2006, an approach to apply conflict of interest laws to contractor  employees was identified by DOD\u2019s Standards of Conduct Office director,  who offered his personal views at one public policy discussion on the  issue of contractor ethics that the FAR Council should consider some  model language, or instruction to government agencies to include conflict  of interest provisions within contracts.", "DOD\u2019s Directorate of Defense Procurement and Acquisition Policy (DPAP):  The DPAP director concurred with the views of ethics officials across the  department and recently directed a DOD panel examining various aspects of  contracting integrity to specifically examine the need for departmentwide  policies to prevent conflicts of interest with its contractor employees. The  Panel on Contracting Integrity is comprised of senior leaders representing a  cross section of DOD. The director told us that existing policy may be  inadequate given the growing reliance on contractor employees across DOD  program offices. He was specifically concerned with contractors who are  involved in source selection and contract management.", "Acquisition Advisory Panel: This panel, comprised of recognized experts in  government acquisition law and policy, was established by a congressional  mandate to examine and report on ways to improve federal acquisition  practices. According to the panel, the trend toward more reliance on  contractors in the federal workplace raises the possibility that the  government\u2019s decision making could be undermined as a result of personal  conflicts of interest on the part of contractor employees. The panel  concluded that, in view of the tremendous amount of federal contracting  for services, and particularly in the context of the blended workforce,  additional safeguards to protect against personal conflicts of interest by  contractor employees are needed. The panel believed that conflict of  interest safeguards are more critical for certain types of contracts  (primarily services contracts) and that further study was needed to  identify those types of contracts where the potential for contractor  employee conflicts of interest raises a concern.", "The panel believed that achieving greater governmentwide consistency in  safeguarding against contractor employees conflicts of interest would be  beneficial, in that it would allow agencies to implement best practices and  it would also help to assure that all bidders on federal contracts\u2014whether  successful or not\u2014are aware of their responsibilities and that they  structure their operations knowing what was expected of them. The panel  concluded that it was not necessary to adopt any new federal statutes to  impose additional conflict of interest safeguards on contractors or their  employees. Rather, the additional safeguard requirements should be  imposed\u2014where appropriate\u2014through contract clauses.", "As a result, the panel recommended to the Office of Federal Procurement  Policy (OFPP) that the FAR Council should determine when contractor  employee personal conflicts of interest need to be addressed, and whether  greater disclosures, specific prohibitions, or reliance on specified  principles are needed to maintain public confidence in the integrity of  government operations reliant on contractors. The panel recommended  that the FAR Council\u2019s efforts should consider whether development of a  standard ethics clause or a set of standard clauses that establish the  contractor\u2019s responsibility to perform the contract with a high level of  integrity needs to be included in solicitations and contracts.", "According to OFPP officials, the FAR council was asked to initiate a  case review process to consider changes to the FAR to include new  conflict of interest safeguards for contractor employees. This  anticipated action would be separate from the November 2007  amendment to the FAR requiring certain contractors to have written  codes of ethics and business conduct, employee ethics and compliance  training programs, and internal control systems to guard against  violation of these codes. The final rule does not speak to development  of a standard ethics clause concerning when contractor employee  personal conflicts of interest need to be addressed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The environment in which DOD makes its most significant spending  decisions is changing. As programs grow more complex and costly, DOD  has increasingly become reliant on technical, business, and procurement  expertise supplied by contractors\u2014sometimes to a point where the  foundation on which decisions are based may be largely crafted by  individuals who are not employed by the government, who are not bound  by the same rules governing their conduct, and who are not required to  disclose whether they have financial or other personal interests that  conflict with the responsibilities they have performing contract tasks for  DOD. To its credit, DOD has recognized that this condition and its risks  needs to be studied and addressed by adding personal conflicts of interest  among contractor employees as a tasking for its Panel on Contracting  Integrity and adopting stricter safeguards for FFRDC employees early in  2007. Such attention is important.", "While few cases of improper conduct have been publicly identified, there  are also few safeguards in place to identify whether personal conflicts of  interest even exist. The new FAR requirements making it mandatory for  certain contractors to set and follow written codes of business ethics and  conduct will not assure that the advice and assistance received from  contractor employees is not tainted by personal conflicts of interest. The  officials in most offices we reviewed that operate within this environment  believe that the risk to the government is considerable enough to warrant  safeguards when contractors are involved in source selection; at least  some believe that risk extends to contractors that are involved in other  activities that feed into spending decisions. Arguments that no change is  needed focus on costs, which may be calculable. Yet, costs of contractor  employees constructing options for their personal gain\u2014an outcome  increasingly likely based on sheer numbers\u2014would likely never be known,  let alone calculable as long as there is no transparency. Changes to current  policy and practices that are targeted, tailored and implemented at the  lowest practicable level are a way to minimize the cost of addressing  personal conflicts of interest among contractor employees and to  maximize the value of any additional safeguards. Several program offices  have already demonstrated this is possible through the use of contract  clauses and processes to identify potential conflicts and at least one small  company has adopted similar safeguards on its own."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary  of Defense (Acquisitions, Technology, and Logistics), to develop and  implement policy that requires personal conflict of interest contract clause  safeguards for defense contractor employees that are similar to those  required of DOD\u2019s federal employees.
