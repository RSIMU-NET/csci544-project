In response to two of GAO's recommendations, VA expanded its screening requirements for all VA applicants to include a verification of all state licenses and national certificates and requires facility officials to query the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB), which contains information on individuals involved in health care-related civil judgments and criminal convictions and licensing and certification actions. VA, however, has not yet expanded these screening requirements to apply to all health care practitioners currently employed at VA facilities, as GAO recommended. In response to the third GAO recommendation, VA issued a policy in August 2005 that requires individuals who previously were exempt from receiving any level of background investigation to have, at a minimum, their fingerprints screened against a criminal history database. As of October 19, 2005, 37 VA medical facilities had not fully implemented this new requirement because they had not obtained or installed the necessary electronic fingerprint equipment. Since then VA has made progress; as of February 1, 2006, 2 medical facilities had not installed the equipment. Finally, VA has partially implemented GAO's fourth recommendation to conduct oversight of its facilities' compliance with VA practitioner screening requirements; however, GAO found the oversight does not address all of the facility compliance issues GAO previously identified. GAO found poor compliance with four of the five selected VA practitioner screening requirements at the seven VA facilities visited in 2005. None of the seven facilities had a compliance rate of 90 percent or more for all five screening requirements GAO reviewed. Two facilities that had implemented VA's fingerprint-only background investigations--a relatively new form of background investigation--did not comply with VA's requirement to document that the results of the fingerprint check against a criminal history database had been reviewed and used to make a decision on the individual's suitability to work at a VA medical facility."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is responsible for ensuring that  its health care practitioners are qualified to provide care to their patients.  VA employs more than 193,000 individuals at its medical facilities,  including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and therapists. In addition, VA  supplements these salaried health care practitioners with nonsalaried  health care practitioners obtained through contracts and fee-for-service  arrangements (fee basis), as well as nonsalaried practitioners working  without direct compensation from VA (without compensation or WOC).  To help ensure that VA\u2019s salaried and nonsalaried health care practitioners  hold the necessary professional credentials to provide care, VA has  screening requirements that VA medical facility officials must follow in  verifying these credentials and checking practitioners\u2019 personal  backgrounds for evidence of incompetence or criminal behavior.", "In March 2004, we reported and testified on gaps in VA\u2019s screening  requirements. We found that VA did not require that all of its health care  practitioners with access to patients be thoroughly screened. In addition,  we found mixed compliance with existing VA screening requirements at  each of the four VA medical facilities we visited. We concluded that the  gaps in and mixed compliance with VA\u2019s screening requirements created  vulnerabilities that could allow VA to employ health care practitioners  who could either place patients at risk of receiving poor care or cause  them intentional harm.

In this report, we determined the extent to which (1) VA has  taken steps to improve health care practitioner screening by implementing  the four recommendations made in our March 2004 report and (2) VA  medical facilities are in compliance with VA\u2019s health care practitioner  screening requirements.", "To determine the extent to which VA has taken steps to improve health  care practitioner screening by implementing the four recommendations  made in our March 2004 report, we interviewed VA headquarters and  facility officials and reviewed VA\u2019s policies and procedures that contain  current health care practitioner screening requirements to see if the gaps  we identified in 2004 were closed. We also reviewed the report of a task  force VA formed to improve its health care practitioner screening  procedures following the issuance of our 2004 report.", "To determine the extent to which VA medical facilities complied with VA  health care practitioner screening requirements, we selected seven VA  medical facilities to visit. These facilities varied in terms of size and  geographic location. Two of the seven facilities we visited were sites from  our previous review. We visited facilities located in Fargo, North Dakota;  Kansas City, Missouri; Miami, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; Salt Lake  City, Utah; San Antonio, Texas; and the District of Columbia. For each  facility, VA provided from its automated pay system a list of salaried  health care practitioners in the 43 occupations we included in our previous  report. At each facility we reviewed a random sample of personnel files to  determine whether the files included documentation demonstrating that  the facility\u2019s health care practitioners had their professional credentials  verified and backgrounds checked in compliance with VA\u2019s screening  requirements. At each of the facilities, our sample of personnel files  consisted of about 50 personnel files for salaried health care practitioners  who were hired prior to October 1, 2004, and 10 to 12 personnel files for  salaried health practitioners who were hired on or after October 1, 2004.  In addition to the random sample of salaried health care practitioners, we  also reviewed at each facility 20 personnel files for nonsalaried health care  practitioners paid by VA on a fee basis and all of the files for the facility\u2019s  WOC health care practitioners who work in a clinical area at the facility.  In collecting information on the screening requirements from personnel  files at each facility, we employed standard data collection techniques to  ensure the accuracy and reliability of the data used in this report. At each  facility we also reviewed about five contracts that the facility used to  supplement its health care practitioner staffing in order to determine how  facility officials screen the personal backgrounds and professional  credentials of these nonsalaried health care practitioners. Finally, at each  facility we also interviewed the officials responsible for coordinating  volunteer activities to determine how volunteers are screened prior to  beginning work at the facility.", "To measure the seven facilities\u2019 compliance with VA\u2019s health care  practitioner screening requirements, we selected five requirements for our  review. Although VA has multiple employment screening requirements,  we selected five that pertain to safeguarding veterans receiving health care  in VA facilities. The screening requirements we selected for salaried health  care practitioners are (1) completing VA Form 2280, which medical facility  officials must do in order to determine the appropriate type of background  investigation needed for each health care practitioner job category;   (2) performing a background investigation; (3) querying HIPDB;   (4) completing an employment checklist, which VA officials are to use to  document the completion of VA screening requirements for those salaried  health care practitioners VA intends to hire; and (5) verifying the status of  state licenses and national certificates. In addition, we measured facility  compliance with one of these screening requirements, performing a  background investigation, for VA nonsalaried fee basis and WOC health  care practitioners. To show the variability in the level of compliance  among the seven VA facilities we visited, we distinguished between  facilities that had a compliance rate of at least 90 percent of the personnel  files we reviewed for each of the five screening requirements and facilities  that did not. VA requires a compliance rate of 100 percent. Our findings for  the screening requirements cannot be generalized to other VA facilities.", "For a complete description of our scope and methodology, see appendix I.

VA also utilizes national  and local medical professional services contracts to supplement its health  care practitioner staffing. In addition to providing medical care, VA is the  largest educator of health care professionals, training more than 28,000  medical residents annually, as well as other types of health care  professionals.", "Depending on the employment requirements of their positions, health care  practitioners who work at VA facilities are required to hold either valid\u2014 meaning current and unrestricted\u2014state medical licenses or national  certificates. State licenses are issued by state licensing boards, which  generally establish state licensing requirements governing their licensed  health care practitioners. Current and unrestricted licenses are those in  good standing in the states that issued them, and licensed health care  practitioners may hold licenses from more than one state. To keep a  license current, health care practitioners must renew their licenses before  they expire and meet renewal requirements established by state licensing  boards, such as continuing education. Renewal procedures and  requirements vary by state and occupation. When licensing boards  discover violations of licensing practices, such as the abuse of prescription  drugs or the provision of substandard care that results in adverse health  effects, they may place restrictions on licenses or revoke them.  Restrictions from a state licensing board can limit or prohibit a health care  practitioner from practicing in that state. Some, but not all, issued state  licenses are marked to indicate that the licenses have had restrictions  placed on them. Generally, state licensing boards maintain a database of  information on restrictions, which employers can often obtain at no cost  either by accessing the information on a board\u2019s Web site or by contacting  the board directly.", "National certificates are issued by national certifying organizations, which  are separate and independent from state licensing boards. These  organizations establish professional standards that are national in scope  for certain occupations, such as respiratory and occupational therapists.  Health care practitioners who are required to have valid national  certificates to practice in VA may renew these credentials periodically by  paying a fee and verifying that they obtained required educational credit  hours. National certifying organizations can place restrictions on a  certification or revoke certification for violations of the organization\u2019s  professional standards. Like state licensing boards, national certifying  organizations maintain databases of information on disciplinary actions  taken against health care practitioners with national certificates, and many  can be accessed at no cost.", "VA policy requires officials at its medical facilities to screen applicants for  positions at VA to determine whether each applicant possesses at least  one current and unrestricted state license or an appropriate national  certificate, whichever is applicable for the position sought by the  applicant. VA also requires officials at its medical facilities to periodically  verify licenses or national certificates held by health care practitioners  already employed at VA (employed health care practitioners). The  frequency of when health care practitioners\u2019 credentials must be checked  depends on their occupations and the renewal requirements of the state or  national organizations that issued the credentials.", "In general, for both applicants and employed health care practitioners,  VA\u2019s screening process proceeds in two stages. First, applicants and  employed health care practitioners are required to disclose to VA, if  applicable, their state licenses and national certificates. Applicants  disclose their credentials to VA during the application process, and  employed health care practitioners disclose credentials to VA as they  expire and are renewed with the state licensing board or certifying  organization. Second, VA facility officials are required to verify whether  the disclosed credentials are valid.", "In addition to holding valid professional credentials, upon hiring, health  care practitioners are required to undergo background investigations that  verify their personal and professional histories. Depending on the  position in question, the extent of the background investigations for health  care practitioners may vary. For example, background investigations in VA  may vary from a traditional background investigation covering a health  care practitioner\u2019s personal and professional background for up to   10 years to the minimum of a fingerprint-only background investigation.  VA facility officials are required to complete VA Form 2280, which  documents the level of risk posed by a particular position and determines  the level of background investigation required for employment.", "The traditional background investigation is the most common type of  background investigation conducted by VA on its health care practitioners.  A traditional background investigation verifies, for instance, an  individual\u2019s history of employment, education, and residence. It also  includes a fingerprint check that searches for evidence of criminal activity  by comparing fingerprints against a database of criminal records. The  Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducts background  investigations for VA and reports its results to the facility that requested  the investigation. VA facilities are required to review background  investigation results, determine employment suitability, and report their  decisions to OPM within 90 days.", "In 2001 OPM began to offer a new type of background investigation for use  by federal agencies, a fingerprint-only background investigation.  Compared to traditional background investigations, which verify personal,  professional, and criminal histories and typically take several months to  complete, fingerprint-only background investigations verify criminal  histories only and can be completed within 3 weeks or less and cost less  than $25, about a quarter of the cost of a traditional background  investigation.", "In March 2004, we reported on VA\u2019s screening policies and the gaps we  found in VA\u2019s requirement for screening applicants that may result in VA  health care practitioners\u2019 personal backgrounds and professional  credentials not being thoroughly screened. For example, for health care  practitioners who were required to have national certificates to work in  VA, facility officials were required to physically inspect each applicant\u2019s  national certificate. However, we found a gap wherein officials were not  required to contact the organization issuing the certificate, even though  restrictions may have been placed on the certificate after it was issued. In  contrast, we found that for state licenses VA\u2019s policy required officials at  its medical facilities to screen applicants to determine whether they  possessed at least one current and unrestricted state license. Applicants  were required to disclose to VA any state licenses they held. To verify a  state license, VA officials were required to contact the issuing state  licensing board to determine if the license was current and unrestricted.  Officials were also required to document that they verified the status of  the license.", "As part of our 2004 report, we also found gaps in VA\u2019s screening  requirements for health care practitioners currently employed at its  medical facilities. For example, not all VA currently employed health care  practitioners with licenses were required to disclose all of their current  licenses. Some currently employed health care practitioners, such as  nurses and pharmacists, were required to disclose only one license, even if  they possess multiple licenses, and facility officials were not required to  contact the issuing state board to determine if the license is current and  unrestricted. Instead, facility officials were required to physically inspect  the one state license, even though some licenses are not marked to  indicate restrictions.

For example, we found that VA requires medical facilities to  verify with the appropriate state licensing boards or national certifying  organizations all state licenses or national certificates held by some health  care practitioners, such as physicians and applicants for VA employment,  but not for other health care practitioners, such as nurses currently  employed by VA. In the interim, while VA is developing a policy that would  apply screening requirements consistently across all licensed and certified  health care practitioners and satisfy one of our recommendations, it has  established two requirements that apply to new health care practitioners  entering VA\u2019s health care system. As a result of the continuing gaps in VA\u2019s  health care practitioner screening process, practitioners may continue to  have access to patients without thorough screening of their professional  credentials and personal backgrounds.", "Furthermore, although VA agreed with our 2004 recommendation to  oversee its facilities to ensure their compliance with key screening  requirements, VA\u2019s limited oversight has not ensured facility compliance.  As a result, VA may not know whether its facilities are in compliance with  its screening requirements. This raises concerns because we found that  none of the VA medical facilities we visited were in compliance with all of  the new or existing VA screening requirements we reviewed for salaried or  nonsalaried health care practitioners. We found that the extent to which  facilities complied with four of the five selected VA screening  requirements was poor at the VA facilities we visited. For example, while  there was improvement at the two facilities we revisited, these facilities  did not meet our 90 percent compliance rate for conducting background  investigations on salaried health care practitioners. Moreover, we found  that all seven medical facilities did poorly in conducting background  investigations on fee basis and WOC health care practitioners as required  by VA even though these practitioners have the same access to patients  and their information as other VA health care practitioners. Further, two  of the three facilities that were conducting VA\u2019s new fingerprint-only  background investigation did not have documentation that the results  were being reviewed by officials as required. This lack of compliance with  current screening requirements continues to place veterans at risk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure the safety of veterans receiving health care at VA medical  facilities, we recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs take the  following two actions:    expand the HRM oversight program to include a review of VA facilities\u2019  compliance with screening requirements for all types of salaried and  nonsalaried health care practitioners and    standardize a method for documenting facility officials\u2019 review of  fingerprint-only background investigation results and decisions regarding  suitability to work in VA medical facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, VA agreed with our findings and  conclusions and concurred with our recommendations. VA agreed that  expanded program oversight and standardizing a method for documenting  fingerprint-only background investigation results would be useful. VA  stated that while it believes that most facilities continue to improve their  practitioner screening effectiveness, VA also recognizes that there is  variability and lack of standardization across its health care system. VA  stated that it would provide an action plan for implementing our  recommendations after issuance of this report.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  date.

Specifically, we determined the extent to which (1) VA has  taken steps to improve health care practitioner screening by implementing  the four recommendations made in our March 2004 report and (2) VA  medical facilities are in compliance with VA\u2019s health care practitioner  screening requirements.", "To determine the extent to which VA has taken steps to improve health  care practitioner screening by implementing the four recommendations  made in our March 2004 report, we reviewed VA employment screening  policies and interviewed VA headquarters and facility officials. Based on  our review of VA documents and interviews with officials, we determined  what steps VA has taken to ensure that gaps we identified in its  verification of state licenses and national certificates and background  investigation requirements have been closed. We also reviewed the report  of a task force VA formed to respond to our recommendations to improve  VA\u2019s screening of professional credentials and personal backgrounds. We  interviewed officials at VA\u2019s Office of Security and Law Enforcement in  Little Rock, Arkansas, and VA\u2019s National Acquisition Center in Hines,  Illinois, to review how VA screens the professional credentials and  personal backgrounds of health care practitioners working in VA medical  facilities through a contract.", "To determine how VA conducts oversight of its facilities\u2019 compliance with  screening of applicants and current employees, we interviewed officials  responsible for implementing VA\u2019s Office of Human Resource Management  (HRM) evaluation and accountability program. We also observed an  oversight review site visit conducted by VA\u2019s HRM at the VA medical  facility in Providence, Rhode Island, and attended a VA training class that  provided facility human resource managers with the knowledge necessary  to review the results of background investigations.", "To determine the extent to which selected VA medical facilities we visited  are in compliance with VA\u2019s health care practitioner screening  requirements, we chose a judgmental sample of seven VA medical facilities  that varied in geographic location to assess the extent to which these  selected facilities complied with the screening requirements included in  our review. The seven facilities were located in Fargo, North Dakota;  Kansas City, Missouri; Miami, Florida; New Orleans, Louisiana; Salt Lake  City, Utah; San Antonio, Texas; and the District of Columbia. Two of the  seven facilities we visited were sites from our previous review. Of the  seven facilities we visited, six were large facilities located in major  metropolitan areas and the remaining facility is of a smaller size.", "For each facility, VA provided from its automated pay system a list of  salaried health care practitioners in the 43 occupations we included in our  previous review. See table 1 for a list of the 43 occupations included in our  review. Because we used VA\u2019s automated pay system, our sample does not  include those health care practitioners providing care through a contract  or fee-for-service agreement or without compensation (WOC) from VA.", "For each of the seven facilities we selected a random sample of about   50 salaried health care practitioners who were hired prior to October 1,  2004, from VA\u2019s list of salaried employees. In addition, we selected 10 to 12  files of salaried health care practitioners who were hired on or after  October, 1, 2004, to determine if new VA requirements for health care  practitioner screening had been implemented by the facility. In addition to  the random sample of salaried employees we reviewed at each facility, we  also requested 20 personnel files for health care practitioners paid by VA  through a fee-for-service arrangement (fee basis) and all health care  practitioners who work in a clinical area at the VA facility but receive  compensation from a source other than VA (WOC).", "We reviewed each selected health care practitioner\u2019s personnel file to  determine whether the facility had documented evidence that it complied  with the following VA screening requirements:    determine the position risk level by completing VA Form 2280;    ensure completion of background investigations;    query the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) for all  applicants after October 1, 2004;    complete an employment checklist for those hired after October 1, 2004;    verify state licenses and national certificates for applicants and employed  health care practitioners.", "For each screening requirement, we reviewed practitioners\u2019 personnel files  to determine whether the files contained documented evidence that the  screening requirement had been completed. See table 2 for the documents  required to demonstrate evidence of facility compliance. Compliance  could also be demonstrated if facilities were able to provide additional  documentation not available in the personnel files we reviewed. Using a  standard data collection instrument, we collected information on each  facility\u2019s compliance with the five screening requirements from a sample  of personnel files. To ensure the reliability of the data collected, the  information collected at each facility was double-checked for a sample of  files. The data from all data collection instruments were entered into an  electronic database, and 100 percent of the electronic files were verified  against the completed data collection instrument.", "In addition to the personnel files, we reviewed about five contracts at each  of the seven medical facilities that the facilities use to supplement health  care practitioner staffing to determine how these nonsalaried health care  practitioners\u2019 professional credentials and personal backgrounds are  screened. We also interviewed VA officials about the process the facilities  use to screen trainees, including medical residents, and volunteers who  work in patient care areas.", "In order to show the variability in the level of compliance among the seven  VA facilities we visited, we distinguished between facilities that had a  compliance rate of at least 90 percent for each of the five screening  requirements that we reviewed and those that did not. For each facility  and screening requirement included in our review, we compared the  percentage of personnel files found in compliance to an acceptance level  of 90 percent. In order to confirm that a requirement had a compliance  rate less than 90 percent, we performed a one-sided significance test at the  95 percent confidence level. See appendix II for detailed information on  the seven VA facilities\u2019 compliance with each VA screening requirement in  our review.
