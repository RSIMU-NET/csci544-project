These vacancies in critical  positions at overseas posts have adversely affected State\u2019s ability to carry  out its mission effectively and threaten State\u2019s ability to ensure the  security and safety of its employees, their families, and post facilities.  While State has made some efforts to address Foreign Service  vacancies, addressing chronic vacancies in critical positions at overseas  posts requires a thoughtful, coherent, and integrated action plan that  defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at  overseas posts along with suggested corrective measures to reduce such  vacancies, following what was called for in our 2017 High-Risk Series  report. Developing such an action plan would help State address its  persistent staffing gaps, improve its ability to achieve U.S. foreign policy  goals, and help ensure secure and efficient operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of State should develop an integrated action plan that  defines the root causes of persistent Foreign Service vacancies at  overseas posts and provides suggested corrective measures to reduce  such vacancies, including steps necessary to implement solutions.

We also interviewed staff at 10  overseas posts. We conducted in-person interviews with staff at 3 of  these posts\u2014the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the U.S. Consulate in  Shanghai, China, and the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India. We  conducted telephone interviews with staff at the other 7 posts\u2014the U.S.  Embassies in Abuja, Nigeria; Bogota, Colombia; Kinshasa, Democratic  Republic of the Congo; Kabul, Afghanistan; Mexico City, Mexico; and  N\u2019Djamena, Chad; and the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany. We  used the following criteria to select overseas posts for interviews: (1)  posts with larger numbers of Foreign Service vacancies; (2) posts with  diversity in the types of Foreign Service positions that were vacant; (3)  posts with higher relative importance to U.S. economic, national security,  and other foreign policy interests; and (4) posts in a range of geographic  locations by State region.", "To examine vacancies in State\u2019s Foreign Service staffing at overseas  posts, we analyzed State\u2019s personnel data on Foreign Service staffing at  overseas posts from the department\u2019s Global Employment Management  System (GEMS), as of March 2018. Our analysis of the GEMS data  includes Foreign Service positions filled by permanent Foreign Service  employees as well as positions filled by nonpermanent Foreign Service  employees, such as Consular Fellows. This analysis does not include the  number of staffed and vacant positions at overseas posts in Libya, Syria,  and Yemen, which, at the time of our review, were in suspended  operations status, as well as U.S. Mission Somalia, which was operating  under special circumstances at a different location.", "To calculate vacancy rates, we divided the total number of positions by  the number of positions listed as vacant in GEMS. For example, a post  with 10 positions and 2 vacancies would have a vacancy rate of 20  percent. We calculated vacancy rates for each of the following categories:  type (i.e., generalist or specialist), function (e.g., consular or information  management), regional bureau (i.e., Bureau of African Affairs or Bureau  of Western Hemisphere Affairs), and embassy and nonembassy rankings  from State\u2019s Overseas Staffing Model (i.e., Embassy 3+ or 5).", "According to State officials, the data in GEMS have a number of  limitations:", "The number of vacant positions at overseas posts listed in GEMS  may be overstated, because State has not yet decided to remove  some of these positions from its database.", "Some of the vacancies in GEMS are short-term or temporary. Foreign  Service employees periodically rotate out of their positions at their  overseas posts, sometimes creating temporary vacancies until the  positions are filled by incoming Foreign Service employees.", "The GEMS data show larger numbers of vacant Foreign Service  positions at posts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan than actually  were unstaffed at these posts. According to State officials, this  discrepancy results from State\u2019s relying heavily on shorter-term  assignments to fill Foreign Service positions at these locations. These  shorter-term assignments are not reflected in GEMS, and the  positions therefore appear vacant.", "The GEMS data may not reflect Foreign Service employees who have  been temporarily reassigned from one overseas post to another.", "The GEMS data may show positions as filled although the Foreign  Service employee filling the position has not yet arrived at post.", "To assess the reliability of the GEMS database, we asked State officials  whether State had made any major changes to the database since our  2012 report, when we assessed the GEMS data to be sufficiently reliable.  State officials indicated that no major changes had been made. We also  tested the data for completeness, confirmed the general accuracy of the  data with officials at selected overseas posts, and interviewed  knowledgeable officials from State\u2019s Office of Resource Management and  Organizational Analysis concerning the data\u2019s reliability. We found the  GEMS data to be reliable for the purpose of determining the numbers and  percentages of vacant Foreign Service positions at overseas posts. We  did not validate whether the total number of authorized overseas Foreign  Service positions was appropriate or met State\u2019s needs.", "We also reviewed State workforce planning documents and budget  documents, such as State\u2019s Five Year Workforce and Leadership  Succession Plan: Fiscal Years 2016-2020 and Quadrennial Diplomacy  and Development Review. In addition, we reviewed State Office of  Inspector General reports as well as our previous reports on human  capital challenges at State and effective strategic human capital  management across the federal government. In particular, our report  High-Risk Series: Progress on Many High-Risk Areas, While Substantial  Efforts Needed on Others notes that strategic human capital management  is a high-risk issue across the federal government and lists five key  elements as a road map for agency efforts to improve and ultimately  address such issues. For our third objective, we assessed whether  State\u2019s efforts to address vacancies were guided by a corrective action  plan that identifies the root causes of persistent Foreign Service  vacancies at overseas posts and suggests corrective measures to reduce  such vacancies, including steps necessary to implement solutions.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2017 to March 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
