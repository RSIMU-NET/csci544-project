For example, National Security Strategies released in 2002, 2006, and 2010 emphasize the importance of denying safe haven to terrorists. The current \"National Strategy for Combating Terrorism,\" which was last updated September 2006, also stresses the importance of eliminating terrorist safe havens. The document identifies eliminating terrorist safe havens as a priority action against which all elements of national power--including military, diplomatic, financial, intelligence, and law enforcement--should be applied. According to National Security Staff officials, an updated \"National Strategy for Combating Terrorism\" is currently being drafted and its release is expected in the coming months. However, these officials stated that denying safe haven to terrorists will remain an important element of U.S. counterterrorism strategy. Since 2006, State has identified existing terrorist safe havens in a dedicated chapter of its \"Country Reports on Terrorism.\" According to U.S. agencies, a variety of groups that pose threats to the United States operate in countries identified by State as terrorist safe havens. For example: (1) Pakistan: Various terrorist organizations operate in Pakistan. First, al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was located in a compound in Pakistan from which U.S. officials have stated he was actively involved in planning attacks against the United States. The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for several attacks against U.S. interests, including an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar in April 2010. (2) Yemen: The foreign terrorist organization al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) is based in Yemen. In response to the killing of Osama Bin Laden, AQAP issued a press release vowing revenge against the United States. (3) Somalia: Al-Shabaab is a foreign terrorist organization active in Somalia. Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for several bombings and shootings throughout Somalia, as well as the July 2010 suicide bomb attacks in Kampala, Uganda, which killed more than 70 people. The U.S. government has not fully addressed reporting requirements to identify U.S. efforts to deny safe haven to terrorists. Congress required the President to submit reports outlining U.S. government efforts to deny or disrupt terrorist safe havens in two laws--the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA) and the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2010. The IRTPA required the President to submit a report to Congress that includes an outline of the strategies, tactics, and tools the U.S. government uses to disrupt or eliminate the security provided to terrorists by terrorist safe havens, and recommended that State update the report annually, to the extent feasible, in its \"Country Reports on Terrorism.\" In response to these provisions, State submitted a report to Congress in April 2006, which it has updated annually as part of its \"Country Reports on Terrorism.\" These reports include a section on U.S. strategies, tactics, and tools that identifies several U.S. efforts to address terrorist safe havens. In the \"Country Reports on Terrorism\" released in August 2010, State identified several U.S. efforts for addressing terrorist safe havens, including programs such as State's Regional Strategic Initiative and Antiterrorism Assistance programs.

As shown in figure 2, State identified 13 terrorist safe havens in its August  2010 report.", "Terrorist safe havens pose a threat to U.S. national security. The National  Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11  Commission) noted that safe haven in Afghanistan allowed al Qaeda the  operational space to gather recruits and build logistical networks to  undertake planning for the attacks on September 11, 2001. State reports  that denying safe haven is central to combating terrorism, which it cited as  the United States\u2019 top security threat. According to U.S. agencies, a variety  of groups that pose threats to the United States operate in countries  identified by State as terrorist safe havens.

First, al  Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was located in a compound in Pakistan  from which U.S. officials have stated he was actively involved in  planning attacks against the United States. Additionally, according to  State, al Qaeda also uses the Federally Administered Tribal Areas  (FATA) to launch attacks in Afghanistan, train and recruit terrorists, and  plan global operations. State also reports that the Pakistani Taliban has  used the FATA to plan attacks against civilian and military targets across  Pakistan. The Pakistani Taliban have claimed responsibility for several  attacks against U.S. interests, including an attack on the U.S. Consulate  in Peshawar in April 2010. Moreover, according to the National  Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), the Pakistani Taliban has repeatedly  threatened to attack the U.S. homeland and claimed responsibility for  the failed vehicle bombing in New York City\u2019s Times Square in May 2010.  In addition, according to State, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba\u2014the group  responsible for attacks in Mumbai, India, in November 2008, which killed  at least 183 people\u2014continues to plan operations from Pakistan and  views American interests as legitimate targets.", "Yemen: The foreign terrorist organization al Qaeda in the Arabian  Peninsula (AQAP) is based in Yemen. According to the NCTC, AQAP is  pursuing a global agenda. For example, the group attempted to bomb a  plane headed to the United States on December 25, 2009. AQAP also  claimed responsibility for the attempted package bombings of cargo  planes in October 2010. More recently, in response to the killing of  Osama Bin Laden, AQAP issued a press release vowing revenge against  the United States. In addition, members of AQAP have been named  Specially Designated Nationals by the United States government. In  July 2010, the United States designated Anwar al-Aulaqi, a U.S. citizen  and key leader for AQAP, for supporting acts of terrorism and for  acting for or on behalf of AQAP.", "Somalia: Al-Shabaab is a foreign terrorist organization active in  Somalia. Al-Shabaab has claimed responsibility for several bombings  and shootings throughout Somalia, as well as the July 2010 suicide  bomb attacks in Kampala, Uganda, which killed more than 70 people.  State reports that rank-and-file members of al-Shabaab are  predominantly interested in issues within Somalia, rather than pursuing  a global agenda. However, NCTC and State note that al-Shabaab\u2019s core  leadership is linked ideologically to al Qaeda and that some members  of the group previously trained and fought with al Qaeda in  Afghanistan. In 2009, the Deputy Director of Intelligence at the NCTC  testified that a number of young Somali-American men traveled to  Somalia, possibly to train and fight with al-Shabaab, including one who  conducted a suicide bombing attack. While noting there is no specific  evidence that the Americans previously trained in Somalia planned to  conduct attacks inside the United States, the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI) has expressed concern that this threat remains a  possibility. In August 2010, the FBI arrested two U.S. citizens and  indicted 12 others, including five U.S. citizens, on charges of providing  support to al-Shabaab."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The U.S. Government Has Not Fully Addressed Reporting Requirements to Identify Efforts to Deny Terrorists Safe Haven", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has not fully addressed reporting requirements to  identify U.S. efforts to deny safe haven to terrorists.

The NDAA for FY 2010 requires the President to submit to  Congress a report on U.S. counterterrorism strategy, including an  assessment of the scope, status, and progress of U.S. counterterrorism  efforts in fighting al Qaeda and its affiliates and a provision to create a list  of U.S. counterterrorism efforts relating to the denial of terrorist safe  havens.
