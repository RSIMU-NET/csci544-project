The statement is to encompass significant federal natural  resources other than oil and gas under management by the federal  government. For fiscal year 2014, only one federal entity (the Department  of the Interior) provided to Treasury a discussion of significant federal  natural resources under entity management, specifically related to coal  leases. As a result, the RSI for federal natural resources other than oil  and gas included in the fiscal year 2014 Financial Report reported only  coal leases from the Department of the Interior.
