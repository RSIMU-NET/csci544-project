On the basis of a review of 238 loan files at 18 lenders, GAO observed that the most common reasons these lenders cited to substantiate that borrowers could not obtain credit elsewhere were that the borrower needed a longer maturity than the lender's policy permitted and the borrower's collateral did not meet the lender's requirements. These factors are two of the six listed in SBA's guidance as acceptable to substantiate that a borrower could not obtain conventional credit. SBA has issued little guidance on how lenders should document in their files that borrowers could not obtain credit elsewhere. Internal control standards for federal agencies specify that good guidance (information and communication) is necessary to help ensure the proper implementation of program rules. While SBA's guidance requires lenders to explain why the borrower could not obtain credit elsewhere in the loan file, it does not specify what exactly lenders should include in their explanations. Between October 2006 and March 2008, SBA reviewed 97 lenders and determined that 31 of them had failed to consistently document that borrowers met the credit elsewhere requirement or personal resources test. All but one of the lenders with whom GAO met documented their credit elsewhere decisions in some way; however, given the broad authority granted to lenders, the explanations were generally not specific enough to reasonably support the lender's conclusion that borrowers could not obtain credit elsewhere. A number of these lenders used a checklist that simply listed the six acceptable reasons cited in SBA's guidance for substantiating that a borrower could not obtain credit elsewhere and did not prompt them to provide more information specific to the borrower--for example, details on insufficient collateral. Absent detailed guidance on what exactly SBA wants lenders to document in their credit elsewhere determinations, lenders likely will continue to offer limited information in their files, making meaningful oversight of compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement difficult."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The recent tightening of the credit markets has raised concerns about the  ability of small businesses to obtain credit and has increased attention on  alternative sources of credit for this segment of the economy. The Small  Business Administration (SBA) was created in 1953 to assist and protect  the interests of small businesses, in part by addressing constraints in the  supply of credit for these firms. The 7(a) program, named after the section  of the Small Business Act that authorized it, is SBA\u2019s largest business loan  program. The program is intended to serve creditworthy small business  borrowers who cannot obtain credit through a conventional lender at  reasonable terms and do not have the personal resources to provide  financing themselves. In fiscal year 2008, SBA guaranteed over 69,000  loans valued at about $13 billion. The loan guarantee covers part of a  lender\u2019s losses in the event of a default, reducing the risk of lending to  small businesses that would otherwise not qualify for a conventional loan.  To streamline the lending process, SBA works with lenders that have  \u201cdelegated authority\u201d\u2014that is, the ability to make credit determinations  without prior review by SBA. According to SBA, the majority of loans that  it guarantees each year are made by lenders with delegated authority.", "Because the 7(a) program is intended to serve borrowers who cannot  obtain conventional credit at reasonable terms, lenders making 7(a) loans  must ensure that borrowers meet the \u201ccredit elsewhere\u201d requirement. This  requirement stipulates that to receive 7(a) loans, borrowers must not be  able to obtain financing under reasonable terms and conditions from  conventional lenders. In addition, because 7(a) borrowers must not have  the personal resources to cover the needed funding, lenders also must  apply a \u201cpersonal resources\u201d test to confirm that the desired funds are not  available from any principal of the business. Lenders may reject a small  business\u2019s application for a conventional loan for a variety of reasons. For  example, a business may need a loan with longer maturity than the  lender\u2019s policy permits or an amount that exceeds the lender\u2019s legal  lending limit or policy limit for a single customer. Lenders also may  require more collateral than a small business can offer or may not lend to  start-ups or firms in certain industries.", "To assist you in overseeing the 7(a) program, you asked us to review how  lenders implement and SBA oversees the program\u2019s credit elsewhere  provision. Specifically, this report (1) describes SBA\u2019s criteria for  determining that borrowers cannot obtain credit elsewhere and practices  lenders employ to determine that borrowers cannot obtain credit  elsewhere and (2) examines SBA\u2019s efforts to ensure that lenders are  complying with the credit elsewhere provision.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed applicable statutes and the  legislative history of the 7(a) program, SBA\u2019s regulations and guidance for  administering the program, our previous reports, and studies of the  program conducted by the SBA Inspector General and external  organizations. To determine lender practices for implementing the credit  elsewhere provision, we visited 18 lenders with delegated authority and  reviewed 238 of their approved applications for 7(a) loans. We selected  these lenders based on the size of their SBA loan portfolios and geography,  among other things. The number of files we reviewed at each lender was  based on the size of the lender\u2019s portfolio; we reviewed more files at larger  lenders than we did at smaller lenders. While our samples of 18 lenders  and 238 loans files are nongeneralizable, they offer perspectives on how  some lenders implement the credit elsewhere provision. We interviewed  SBA officials and contractor staff to discuss lender oversight efforts and  reviewed all 97 on-site review reports completed between October 2006  and March 2008 and related correspondence and enforcement action data.  Appendix II discusses our scope and methodology in further detail.", "We conducted our work in Atlanta, Georgia; Chicago, Illinois; Houston,  Texas; Los Angeles, California; New York City, New York; San Francisco,  California; and Washington, D.C., between February 2008 and February  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Small Business Act created SBA to aid, counsel, assist, and protect the  interests of small business concerns. The first version of Section 7(a) of  the act empowered SBA to make loans to small businesses with the  restriction that \u201cno financial assistance shall be extended \u2026 unless the  financial assistance applied for is not otherwise available on reasonable  terms.\u201d While there have been numerous amendments to Section 7(a), the  credit elsewhere restriction has remained, with slight modifications. For  instance, the phrase \u201ccredit elsewhere\u201d was introduced in 1981 and the  provision was changed to read that \u201co financial assistance shall be  extended pursuant to this subsection if the applicant can obtain credit  elsewhere.\u201d At the same time, a definition of credit elsewhere was added.", "The 7(a) program\u2019s legislative history emphasizes the program\u2019s role in  meeting the credit needs of certain small businesses. The legislative basis  for the program recognizes that the conventional lending market is the  principal source of financing for small businesses and that the loan  assistance that SBA provides is intended to supplement rather than  compete with that market. As the legislative history suggests, conventional  lending may not be a feasible financing option for some small businesses  under certain circumstances. The design of the 7(a) program is consistent  with the statute and its legislative history. First, the loan guarantee limits  the lender\u2019s risk in extending credit to a small firm that may not have met  the lender\u2019s own requirements for a conventional loan. Second, the credit  elsewhere requirement is intended to provide some assurance that  guaranteed loans are offered only to firms that are unable to access credit  on reasonable terms and conditions in the conventional lending markets.  Third, an active secondary market for the guaranteed portion of a 7(a)  loan allows lenders to sell the guaranteed portion of the loan to investors,  providing additional liquidity that lenders can use for additional loans.", "Under the 7(a) program, SBA guarantees loans made by commercial  lenders to small businesses for working capital and other general business  purposes. These lenders are mostly banks, but some are nondepository  lenders, including small business lending companies (SBLC)\u2014 nondepository lenders previously chartered by SBA to provide 7(a) loans  to qualified small businesses. The guarantee assures the lender that if a  borrower defaults on a loan, the lender will receive an agreed-upon  portion (generally between 50 percent and 85 percent) of the outstanding  balance. For a majority of 7(a) loans, SBA relies on lenders with delegated  authority to process and service 7(a) loans and to ensure that borrowers  meet the program\u2019s eligibility requirements. To be eligible for the 7(a)  program, a business must be an operating for-profit small firm (according  to SBA\u2019s size standards) located in the United States and meet the credit  elsewhere requirement, including the personal resources test.", "SBA is not authorized to extend credit to businesses if the financial  strength of the individual owners or the firm itself is sufficient to provide  or obtain all or part of the financing or if the business can access  conventional credit. To assess whether borrowers can obtain credit  elsewhere, lenders must determine that the desired credit, for a similar  purpose and period of time, is unavailable to the firm on reasonable terms  and conditions from nonfederal sources without SBA assistance, taking  into consideration prevailing rates and terms in the community or locale  where the firm conducts business. Nonfederal sources may include any  lending institutions. In addition, lenders must determine that the firm\u2019s  owners are unable to provide the desired funds from their personal  resources. When applying this personal resources test, the lender must  assess the liquid assets of each owner of 20 percent or more of the equity  of the applicant company to determine the overall dollar value of the  allowable exemption, which is defined as the amount of personal  resources that do not have to be injected into the business. The allowable  exemption is determined on the basis of the \u201ctotal financing package.\u201d The  total financing package includes any SBA loans, together with any other  loans, equity injection, or business funds used or arranged for at the same  general time for the same project as the SBA loan. If the total financing  package  is $250,000 or less, the exemption is two times the total financing package  or $100,000, whichever is greater; is between $250,001 and $500,000, the exemption is one and one-half times  the total financing package or $500,000, whichever is greater; or   exceeds $500,000, the exemption equals the total financing package or  $750,000, whichever is greater.", "Once the exemption is determined, it is subtracted from the liquid assets.  If the result is positive, that amount must be injected into the project.", "When the 7(a) program was first implemented, borrowers were generally  required to show proof of credit denials (rejection documentation) from  no fewer than two banks that documented, among other things, the  reasons for not granting the desired credit. Similar requirements remained  in effect until 1985, when SBA amended the rule to permit a lender\u2019s  certification made in its application for an SBA guarantee to be sufficient  documentation. This certification requirement remained when the rule  was rewritten in 1996. SBA stated that requiring proof of loan denials was  demoralizing to small businesses and unenforceable by SBA.", "Within the 7(a) program, there are several delivery methods\u2014including  regular 7(a), the preferred lender program (PLP), and SBAExpress. Under  the regular (nondelegated) 7(a) program, SBA makes the loan approval  decision, including the credit determination. Under PLP and SBAExpress,  SBA delegates to the lender the authority to make loan approval decisions,  including credit determinations, without prior review by SBA. The  maximum loan amount under the SBAExpress program is $350,000 (as  opposed to $2 million for other 7(a) loans). The program allows lenders to  utilize, to the maximum extent possible, their respective loan analyses,  procedures, and documentation. In return for the expanded authority and  autonomy provided by the program, SBAExpress lenders agree to accept a  maximum SBA guarantee of 50 percent. (Other 7(a) loans have a  maximum guarantee of 75 or 85 percent, depending on the loan amount.)  According to SBA, as of December 31, 2007, there were 672 PLP and 1,889  SBAExpress lenders. Of these, 603 lenders were approved for both  programs.", "In the federal budget, the 7(a) program is currently a \u201czero subsidy\u201d  program, meaning that the program does not require annual  appropriations of budget authority for new loan guarantees. To offset  some of the costs of the program, such as default costs, SBA assesses  lenders two fees on each 7(a) loan. The guarantee fee must be paid by the  lender at the time of loan application or within 90 days of the loan being  approved, depending upon the loan term. This fee is based on the amount  of the loan and the level of the guarantee, and lenders can pass the fee on  to the borrower. The ongoing servicing fee must be paid annually by the  lender and is based on the outstanding balance of the guaranteed portion  of the loan.", "SBA\u2019s Office of Credit Risk Management (OCRM) is responsible for  overseeing 7(a) lenders, including those with delegated authority. SBA  created this office in fiscal year 1999 to ensure consistent and appropriate  supervision of SBA\u2019s lending partners.

The criteria or thresholds established in the  lender\u2019s underwriting policies are representative of the level of risk the  lender is willing to assume on a loan. Many factors influence lenders\u2019 risk  tolerance levels, including the size of the institution, its location, and its  financial position.

Some of the lenders said that  they relied on automated underwriting systems that primarily considered  quantitative factors such as credit scores and financial ratios to determine  whether a borrower qualified for a conventional loan or required a  guarantee. But some other lenders said that they also considered  qualitative factors such as the borrower\u2019s relationship with the bank\u2014for  example, the amount on deposit or a prior lending history\u2014when  determining whether to extend conventional or guaranteed credit.", "An Urban Institute report on lenders\u2019 implementation of the credit  elsewhere requirement reached similar conclusions.

In general, SBA-guaranteed loans  provide more generous terms to borrowers than conventional loans. In  2007, we found that almost 80 percent of 7(a) loans had maturities of more  than 5 years, compared with 5 years or less for an estimated 83 percent of  conventional loans (see fig. 1).", "In general, longer terms mean lower payments, which allow borrowers to  service debt with a lower net operating income (see table 2).", "Many lenders with whom we spoke said that they generally required a  business to have an actual or projected debt service coverage ratio  (DSCR) of at least 1.10 to 1.25 to obtain a conventional or guaranteed loan.  DSCR is the ratio of net operating income (or cash flow) to debt payments,  with a lower ratio indicating less ability to meet debt service payments.  Our analysis of DSCRs showed that both the average and the mean ratios  for all borrowers in our sample were higher than the 1.10 to 1.25 lender  requirement (see fig. 2). We also found that lenders sometimes deviated  quite substantially from their required minimums. In some instances,  lenders provided loans to businesses with low or negative ratios,  suggesting that those borrowers compensated for a lack of cash flow in  the short term with collateral, for example. In other instances, lenders  provided loans to businesses with ratios well above the minimum  requirement, suggesting that factors other than cash flow were behind the  reasons for requiring an SBA guarantee.", "Of the loans that we reviewed, 46 percent were cited as having insufficient  collateral (because of its low value or uniqueness) for a conventional loan.  SOP 50-10 stipulates that a 7(a) loan request cannot be denied on the basis  of inadequate collateral, noting that one of the primary reasons lenders  used the 7(a) program was to provide credit to small businesses that could  repay a loan but lacked the collateral needed to cover it in case of  default. One lender that we interviewed required all conventional loans to  be fully securitized. If a borrower was unable to provide 100 percent  collateral against the value of the loan, the lender would require an SBA  guarantee. Other lenders had more lenient policies relating to collateral,  allowing borrowers to obtain conventional financing with more limited  collateral.", "Finally, as shown in table 3, our review of lender files showed that all but 2  of the 18 lenders made at least one 7(a) loan to a new business, but that  some made significantly more of these loans than others.

For instance, a number of lenders we met with  used a checklist to document their credit elsewhere decisions. These  checklists allow lenders to select one or more of the six acceptable factors  outlined in SBA\u2019s SOP 50-10 that \u201cdemonstrate an identifiable weakness in  the credit of a borrower or exceed the policy limits of the lender.\u201d  However, they do not prompt lenders to provide more specific  information, such as how a longer maturity would improve a business\u2019s  ability to repay a loan or the details on insufficient collateral.", "Some lenders also documented their credit elsewhere decisions in credit  memos, but the information provided was generally not very specific.  Some examples of credit elsewhere statements in lender files included the  following:  \u201c examined the availability of credit and determined that the  desired credit is unavailable to the Applicant on reasonable terms and  conditions without SBA assistance taking into consideration prevailing  rates and terms in the community in and near where the applicant will be  conducting business. Specifically, the Applicant would not be able to  obtain the proposed financing for this specific purpose without federal  assistance.\u201d  \u201cThe terms and conditions offered are not available in the marketplace  without the assistance of the SBA guarantee.\u201d  \u201cRepayment capability requires maturity that exceeds  policy;  value of available collateral is unacceptable; credit unavailable through  conventional loan without a lower loan-to-value ratio.\u201d", "As evidenced by the above examples, our review of loan files showed that  most lenders generally did not provide specific information about the  borrower in the statements they included in their explanations, nor did  they elaborate upon the items they indicated on the checklist. The lack of  details pertaining to the individual borrower or the lender\u2019s financial  condition raised questions about the usefulness of the credit elsewhere  documentation provided by lenders. Given the broad authority granted to  lenders, more information specific to the borrower\u2019s or the lender\u2019s  financial condition would help support the lender\u2019s assessment that the  borrower could not obtain credit elsewhere. For example, a statement  containing both the borrower\u2019s available collateral and the amount of  collateral the lender requires for a conventional loan would support the  conclusion that the \u201cvalue of available collateral is unacceptable.\u201d", "However, one lender we visited provided more detailed information about  borrowers\u2019 credit/financial positions and the reasons that 7(a) loans were  more suitable than conventional loans, which provided greater assurance  that the borrower could not obtain credit elsewhere. In addition to  substantiating that the borrower could not obtain credit elsewhere, the  lender provided notes documenting why the borrower was denied a  conventional loan. For example:    Credit elsewhere documentation: \u201cBusiness is new and does not have  sufficient operating history.\u201d Conventional loan denial: \u201cLength of time in  business and/or current management; inadequate cash flow; delinquent  past or present credit obligations with others; revolving balances to  revolving credit limits is high.\u201d", "Credit elsewhere documentation: \u201cBusiness and personal scores are below  the conventional requirement.\u201d Conventional loan denial: \u201cForeclosure,  repossession, collection judgment, terms and conditions requested are not  offered on this product. Inadequate cash flow.\u201d", "In addition, two other lenders provided more detailed information in some  instances. For example:  \u201cCredit is not available elsewhere due to the fact that the applicant  business is not fully secured by the liquidation value of the collateral being  pledged. In addition, there is only 1 year old repayment ability from past  operations and the applicant requires a maturity greater than the 12 years  that  will go out on commercial loans.\u201d \u201c would not be willing to provide conventional financing on  this project at rates and terms acceptable to provide sufficient cash flow  for repayment. The fact that the applicants will be injecting 10 percent into  the project and have requested a 20 year term does not qualify for  conventional financing under our present loan policy. We would not be  able to provide funds without the use of the SBA guaranteed loan  program.\u201d", "The results of our file review show that most lenders tend to use generic  language to meet credit elsewhere compliance requirements, making it  difficult to determine with certainty whether borrowers could not obtain  credit elsewhere. When conducting oversight, SBA needs to ensure that  lenders are making loans only to borrowers that meet the eligibility  requirements of the program. In the absence of detailed guidance on what  exactly SBA wants lenders to document or a more prescriptive credit  elsewhere requirement, lenders will likely continue to offer limited credit  elsewhere statements in their files, making meaningful oversight of  compliance with the requirement difficult.

In most cases, SBA relies on the lender to determine if a  borrower is eligible for a 7(a) loan, including determining whether the  borrower could obtain credit elsewhere. Relying on lenders with delegated  authority underscores the importance of SBA guidance and oversight.  However, SBA\u2019s lack of guidance to lenders on how to document  compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement impedes the agency\u2019s  ability to oversee compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement.", "SBA\u2019s guidance to lenders on documenting compliance with the credit  elsewhere requirement is limited. SOP 50-10 requires lenders to retain  explanations of their credit elsewhere determinations in borrowers\u2019 loan  files but does not specify the amount of detail lenders should include in  their explanations. Even with the lack of detail required, the results of  SBA\u2019s on-site reviews of 7(a) lenders\u2014the agency\u2019s primary means of  ensuring compliance with the credit elsewhere requirement\u2014indicated  that documenting credit elsewhere determinations was a problem for  some lenders. Our review of a recent six-quarter period found that SBA  had determined that nearly a third of the lenders reviewed had not  consistently documented that borrowers met the credit elsewhere  requirement or personal resources test. Further, the results of file reviews  we conducted at 18 lenders raise questions about the usefulness of credit  elsewhere documentation provided by lenders in assessing compliance  with the credit elsewhere requirement. We found that lenders tended to  provide general statements about a borrower\u2019s ability to obtain credit  elsewhere, generally citing just one of the six acceptable factors listed in  SOP 50-10 without customizing the statement to fit the borrower or lender  in question. This practice made it difficult to reasonably conclude that  borrowers met the credit elsewhere requirement. The statute, regulations,  and guidance allow lenders to use their own conventional lending policies  to make case-by-case decisions about which borrowers need an SBA  guarantee. Given the broad authority granted to lenders, requiring  documentation of the analysis supporting their credit elsewhere decisions  could help SBA ensure that the eligibility requirement is being met. By  collecting and analyzing this additional information on how lenders are  applying the credit elsewhere standard, SBA could better ensure that  lenders are complying with the standard. Further, identifying promising  practices used by lenders to document their credit elsewhere  determinations could help SBA develop more specific guidance for  lenders.

For example:    SBA issued an interim rule allowing new SBA loans to be made with an  alternative base interest rate, the 1-month London Interbank Offered Rate  (LIBOR), in addition to the prime rate, which was previously allowed.  According to SBA, the prime and LIBOR rates have fluctuated away from  their historical relationship, typically 300 basis points, squeezing SBA  lenders out of the lending market because their costs are based on the  LIBOR rate.", "SBA has allowed a new structure for assembling SBA loans into pools for  sale in the secondary market. According to SBA, the enhanced flexibility in  loan pool structures can help affect profitability and liquidity in the  secondary market for SBA-guaranteed loans.

For  example, SBA could establish some general guidelines describing quantitative  thresholds or ranges for cash flow and credit score that lenders could  consider when making 7(a) loans. The agency could require lenders who  made loans to borrowers who fell outside of the recommended ranges to  document the reasons for their decisions. Further, additional guidelines could  help lenders determine when it was acceptable to cite reasons associated  with the lending institution itself to substantiate that a borrower could not  obtain credit elsewhere. In such a scenario, some of these reasons might  apply only to certain institutions. For example, only nondepository  institutions, such as small business lending companies (SBLC), might be  allowed to cite as a reason for extending 7(a) credit the need to sell the  guaranteed portion of the loan on the secondary market.", "A more prescriptive credit elsewhere requirement would address some of  the challenges with the requirement as it is currently written. For example,  as previously discussed, a broad requirement allows lenders to make case- by-base decisions about the types of borrowers that cannot obtain credit  elsewhere. Because different lenders have different lending policies, the  types of borrowers they serve under the program also differ. The absence  of well-defined eligibility criteria makes it difficult for SBA to determine  whether borrowers receiving 7(a) loans actually could not obtain  conventional credit. In addition, these variations in lending policies and  the types of borrowers served make it challenging for SBA to collect  relevant information for evaluations of how well the 7(a) program is  serving its intended mission. In a July 2007 report on the 7(a) program, we  highlighted the need for SBA to improve upon its current efforts to collect  and evaluate performance data for the 7(a) program. According to SBA, it  is in the process of developing additional performance measures.", "A more prescriptive standard could be beneficial in light of proposals that, if  enacted, would reduce fees for borrowers and temporarily change the  program from a zero subsidy program to a positive subsidy program. Such  proposals have been made for reasons such as expanding credit for small  businesses during the current economic downturn. According to SBA and  lenders interviewed as part of an Urban Institute report, the higher fees  currently associated with the 7(a) program act as a credit-rationing  mechanism. They explained that the higher fees deter borrowers who could  obtain credit elsewhere from participating in the program, as the fees  associated with conventional loans are significantly lower. However, if the  fees associated with the program were lowered or eliminated, the impact of  this rationing mechanism would be reduced. With the reduction of fees, a  more prescriptive credit elsewhere requirement that clearly outlines which  businesses are eligible for the 7(a) program could help to minimize incentives  for lenders to make loans to borrowers that have access to credit elsewhere.", "However, the increased burden on lenders resulting from a more prescriptive  credit elsewhere requirement could limit their participation in the program  and, as a result, decrease small businesses\u2019 access to credit. In addition, a  more prescriptive standard could arbitrarily exclude some borrowers from  obtaining guaranteed credit but compel lenders to make loans to borrowers  that they and the market did not deem creditworthy. Finally, restricting  lenders\u2019 ability to cite their own reasons to substantiate that a borrower could  not obtain conventional credit might limit access to credit in some  communities, especially those with few lending institutions to supply credit or  those that rely on SBLCs\u2014nondepository institutions with delegated  authority to make 7(a) loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Small Business Administration", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Paige Smith (Assistant  Director), Benjamin Bolitzer, Tania Calhoun, Marcia Carlsen, Emily  Chalmers, Janet Fong, Marc Molino, Carl Ramirez, Cory Roman, and  Jennifer Schwartz made contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
