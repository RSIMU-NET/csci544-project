However, the responses also showed that several agencies had yet to identify essential functions during a pandemic that cannot be performed remotely. In addition, although many of the agencies' pandemic plans rely on telework to carry out their functions, several agencies reported testing their information technology capability to little or no extent. GAO's three case study agencies also showed differences in the degree to which their individual facilities had operational pandemic plans. The Bureau of Prisons' correctional workers had only recently been required to develop pandemic plans for their correctional facilities. Nevertheless, the Bureau of Prisons has considerable experience limiting the spread of infectious disease within its correctional facilities and had also made arrangements for antiviral medications for a portion of its workers and inmates. The Department of the Treasury's Financial Management Service, which has production staff involved in disbursing federal payments such as Social Security checks, had pandemic plans for its four regional centers and had stockpiled personal protective equipment such as respirators, gloves, and hand sanitizers at the centers. Air traffic control management facilities, where air traffic controllers work, had not yet developed facility pandemic plans or incorporated pandemic plans into their all-hazards contingency plans. The Federal Aviation Administration had recently completed a study to determine the feasibility of the use of respirators by air traffic controllers and concluded that their long-term use during a pandemic appears to be impractical. There is no mechanism in place to monitor and report on agencies' workforce pandemic plans. Under the National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was required to monitor and report on the readiness of agencies to continue operations while protecting their employees during an influenza pandemic. The HSC, however, informed DHS in late 2006 or early 2007 that no specific reports on this were required to be submitted. Rather, the HSC requested that agencies certify to the council that they were addressing in their plans the applicable elements of a pandemic checklist in 2006 and again in 2008. This process did not include any assessment or reporting on the status of agency plans. Given agencies' uneven progress in developing their pandemic plans, monitoring and reporting would enhance agencies' accountability to protect their employees in the event of a pandemic. GAO has previously reported on the importance of internal control monitoring to assess the quality of performance over time. Without appropriately designed monitoring and reporting, the President and the Congress cannot fully assess the ability of the agencies to continue their operations while protecting their federal employees in the event of a pandemic."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Protecting federal workers essential to ensuring the continuity of the  country\u2019s critical operations will involve new challenges in the event of an  influenza pandemic.

While the commitment of federal worker carry out the missions of their agencies during natural and man-made  disasters and emergencies is evident from past disasters, critical federal  workers have sometimes been left to fend for themselves during such  situations. For example, in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, many essential federal personnel in New Orleans did not have housin and, therefore, were not able to return to work.

DOJ\u2019s primary function with its components in pandemic planning is its  periodic random assessments of component continuity programs.", "BOP\u2019s pandemic influenza plan was developed through its Office of  Emergency Preparedness and was disseminated to its central office and  six regional offices in May 2008. In conjunction with BOP\u2019s pandemic plan,  BOP\u2019s Health Services Division developed four supplemental pandemic flu  modules for facility-level planning\u2014Surveillance and Infection Control,  Antiviral Medications and Vaccines, Health Care Delivery, and Care of  the Deceased\u2014which provide detailed instructions for health-related  aspects of pandemic flu emergency response. Specifically, the modules  contain guidelines, standard operating procedures, checklists, and  screening forms. The final modules became available to individual BOP  facilities in August 2008, and the deadline to submit facility-specific  pandemic plans was extended from September to November 2008. Prior to  the plan\u2019s release, BOP held conferences with the Health Services Division  and infection control officers to solicit feedback on the draft plan\u2019s  feasibility and to encourage the facilities to start implementing elements of  the plan, such as early coordination with local communities, surveillance  of seasonal influenza, and promotion of good health habits among the  correctional workers and the inmates.", "BOP\u2019s Antiviral Medications and Vaccines outlines guidance on  stockpiling, distribution, and dispensation of antiviral medications. The  module also requires the facilities to review HHS priority groups for  receiving antiviral medication and pandemic vaccine; develop local  procedures for dispensing antiviral medication and vaccine to employees  and inmates according to the central regional office guidance issued by the  medical director; and coordinate with local health departments to ensure  the facility\u2019s inclusion in the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS),which is a  national repository of medical supplies that is designed to supplement and  resupply local public health agencies in the event of a national emergency.", "BOP headquarters provided funding to the central regional offices to  stockpile Tamiflu, an antiviral medication, and a list of GSA-approved  sources to procure additional supplies. Based on a historical review of the  1918 pandemic influenza and HHS planning assumptions, BOP intends to  supply antiviral medication to 15 percent of the correctional workers and  inmates in each facility if the influenza outbreak is geographically spread  throughout the United States. BOP\u2019s pandemic plan anticipates that its  supply of Tamiflu will come from two sources\u2014BOP\u2019s established  stockpile and each BOP facility\u2019s coordinated effort with its local health  department to ensure inclusion in the SNS for antiviral medication for  treatment. According to a regional BOP official, antiviral medication is  already stockpiled at designated storage sites in each region, and each  storage site is responsible for plans to distribute the antiviral medication  throughout its respective region. For example, the North Central Regional  Office in Kansas City, Missouri, reported managing its stockpile through a  GSA contract with McKesson Pharmaceuticals. Under the terms of the  contract, the regional office can exchange the antiviral medication after 5  years if a pandemic does not occur. Upon expiration of the antiviral  medication, the contract requires either recertification of the existing  medications or a new shipment.", "At the time of our review, no BOP-wide pandemic or health care  management exercise had been conducted; however, the Office of  Emergency Preparedness was planning such exercises. At the same time,  individual institutions and regional health services offices have conducted  exercises on specific aspects of pandemic preparedness. For example, the  North Central Regional Office in Kansas City reported participating in  pandemic tabletop exercises and interagency tests coordinated by the  Kansas City FEB. Regional directors have had basic pandemic training, but  there have not been exercises on how to manage a pandemic or manage a  local facility in the event of a pandemic. The regional managers have  ongoing conferences and have been trained on overarching BOP pandemic  plans and strategies, such as social distancing, hand hygiene, and  stockpiling.", "BOP\u2019s pandemic plan addresses the need for infection control measures to  mitigate influenza transmission and calls for education of correctional  workers and the inmate population. Accordingly, all facilities are  instructed that they should have readily available and ample supplies of  bar soap and liquid soap in the restrooms, alcohol-based wipes throughout  the facility, and hand sanitizers if approved by the warden. A BOP official  noted that alcohol-based antibacterial hand sanitizers would not be  available to the inmates because of the sanitizer\u2019s high alcohol content,  which can be misused by the inmates. The Surveillance and Infection  Control details recommendations for use of personal protective equipment  such as surgical or procedure masks; N95 respirators, which BOP  stipulates should only be used in the context of an OSHA-defined  respiratory protection program; and gloves, when directly involved in  caring for ill correctional workers and inmates. BOP\u2019s pandemic influenza  plans also require training and education of correctional workers and  inmates on pandemic influenza and aspects of facility management in case  of an outbreak at the component and facility levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Protecting Correctional Workers", "paragraphs": ["The use of social distancing measures to protect correctional workers in  the event of a pandemic presents a challenge. Although BOP\u2019s  Surveillance and Infection Control advocates social distancing during a  pandemic outbreak, according to several BOP officials, social distancing  measures are difficult to implement at the facility level. In older facilities,  such as USP Leavenworth, there may be a greater need for correctional  workers to be physically present and work in proximity to one another  and the inmates to maintain facility security, address emergencies, and  deal with the inmate population. On the other hand, recently constructed  facilities such as the Allenwood Federal Correctional Complex have  closed-circuit video monitoring systems throughout the facilities, which  enable the correctional workers to better monitor the inmate population  and minimize contact. However, BOP officials said that there are many  situations in which close contact is inevitable between correctional  workers and inmates and where personal protective equipment, such as  gloves and masks, would not be feasible. In the event of a fight between  inmates, for example, correctional workers would not have time to put on  gloves or masks and any in-place masks would be likely to fall off. In  addition, according to a medical officer at USP Leavenworth, gloves  cannot be worn for a long period of time without compromising the health  of the skin. Another BOP official said that various facilities have unique  requirements that they need to factor into planning for the use of social  distancing measures. Examples include prisons with different layouts;  facilities where inmates have increased needs, for example, inmates with  diabetes or those who need wheelchairs; and facilities where there are  inmates who cannot be colocated for security reasons.", "A unique pandemic planning challenge facing federal correctional workers  is the maintenance of an effective custodial relationship between them and  the inmates in federal prisons. According to BOP officials, this relationship  depends on communication and mutual trust, as correctional workers in  federal prisons do not carry weapons or batons inside the cellblocks.  Rather, they use verbal methods of communication to keep order. The  BOP officials at USP Leavenworth said that they would not allow a  situation where correctional workers wear N95 respirators or surgical  masks but the inmates do not. Seeing a correctional worker wearing a  mask may cause fear among inmates and could potentially contribute to  an unstable situation. The BOP officials at the Allenwood Federal  Correctional Complex said that they would provide personal protective  equipment to both correctional workers and inmates and use antiviral  medication combined with social distancing strategies to mitigate the  spread of influenza. An Allenwood Federal Correctional Complex official  noted that education of staff and the inmate population about pandemic  influenza would be an important part of the facility\u2019s pandemic effort.", "The guidance provided by BOP\u2019s central office and regional offices does  not clearly determine prioritization and allocation of pandemic  pharmaceutical interventions to the facilities. For example, an official at  USP Leavenworth said that the facilities do not know how much antiviral  medication they can rely on from the SNS in addition to the 15 percent  BOP allocation. The distribution of antiviral medications to Leavenworth  correctional workers and inmates would take into account a variety of  factors, such as age; health factors, including preexisting conditions; and  severity of the pandemic event. Based on these factors, the numbers of  antivirals needed would be difficult to calculate in advance. In addition,  priority would always depend on the situation, and the warden working  with the facility\u2019s medical director would make the final determinations.", "Despite the challenges BOP faces with pandemic influenza planning, the  bureau has advantages, which are unique to its facilities. Every  correctional facility is a closed and self-contained system, and each facility  is somewhat self-sufficient, maintaining a 30-day supply of food, water,  and other necessities for any type of contingency. Correctional facilities  also have well-tested experience in emergency and health hazard planning  and management and infection control, which provide them with a solid  foundation to build on for pandemic influenza preparedness. Additionally,  correctional facilities generally have strong ties with their local  communities, important because pandemic influenza will be largely  addressed by the resources available to each community it affects. For  example, in addition to their own medical staff, BOP facilities rely on local  hospitals and work with community first responders in emergencies.  Having medical staff on board, an advantage some of the other agencies  lack, also makes pandemic planning and decision making easier."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FMS Has Operational Pandemic Plans for Production Staff Responsible for Disbursing Federal Payments", "paragraphs": ["FMS, a component of Treasury, provides central payment services to  federal agencies, operates the federal government\u2019s collections and  deposit systems, provides governmentwide accounting and reporting  services, and manages the collection of delinquent debt owed to the  government.

The KFC Deputy Director commented that in the event of a  pandemic, the KFC would encourage the use of N95 respirators and gloves  and that the facility had made a decision to pre-position these supplies.  The KFC plans to stock enough for 15 to 20 employees per day for the first  pandemic wave. Preceding the first wave, the KFC plans to order  additional supplies from GSA at the onset of the first pandemic trigger.  KFC officials believe that this will allow the center to have enough  supplies to last during subsequent pandemic waves. The KFC has also  discussed housing some employees on-site during a pandemic, but this will  be a greater possibility once the exercise facility, including showers and  lockers, is finished.

At this time, FAA has  provided PAPRs for short-term use by air traffic controllers so that they  can transfer control of air traffic to other air traffic facilities, per existing  contingency plans. This use was intended primarily for situations involving  asbestos in air route traffic control centers. PAPRs cost approximately  $1,000 each plus filter and battery expenses, and FAA estimates the total  cost for PAPRs for its air traffic controller workforce would reach $15  million. In addition to the cost, the study findings suggested there are  many potential problems, including noise, visibility, and comfort, with the  PAPR approach that FAA would have to address. The study concluded  that FAA would need to evaluate many concerns in a more operationally  realistic environment before recommending PAPRs for use by air traffic  controllers.

Although the directive in the Implementation Plan required  DHS to report to the Executive Office of the President, the Congress may  want DHS to report to it on agencies\u2019 progress on their pandemic plans to  allow it to carry out its oversight role.

Our intent was to survey the pandemic coordinators from  the 24 agencies covered by the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990. We  developed the survey questions based on guidelines for worker protection  from the Homeland Security Council (HSC), Occupational Safety and  Health Administration, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  and Federal Emergency Management Agency. We asked the pandemic  coordinators questions about (1) their pandemic plans, (2) the  department- and component-level functions the agencies consider  essential in the event of a pandemic that are not first response and cannot  be continued remotely, (3) measures planned to protect workers who will  not be able to work remotely, (4) social distancing strategies, (5)  information technology testing, and (6) communication of human capital  pandemic policies. Furthermore, in addressing the first objective, we  reviewed national pandemic plans, prior GAO work assessing influenza,  and additional relevant documents that assess influenza, public health, and  other emergency preparedness and response issues. We defined essential  functions based on Federal Continuity Directive 1 as those functions that  enable an organization to provide vital services, exercise civil authority,  maintain the safety of the public, and sustain the industrial and economic  base during disruption of normal operations. We defined first responders  as emergency personnel called to the scene of a crisis or responding to  emergency calls for assistance and medical personnel. The scope of our  work did not include an independent evaluation of the effectiveness of the  workforce protection measures recommended by federal lead pandemic  planning agencies.", "From April 8 through April 17, 2008, we conducted a series of pretests with  current and former federal pandemic coordinators and emergency  managers to further refine our questions, clarify any ambiguous portions  of the survey, and identify potentially biased questions. Upon completion  of the pretests and the development of the final survey questions and  format, we sent an announcement of the upcoming survey to the 24  pandemic coordinators on May 13, 2008. These pandemic coordinators  were notified that the survey was available online on May 15, 2008. We  sent a reminder e-mail message to nonrespondents on May 28, 2008, and  conducted follow-up calls over the next few weeks. The survey was  available online until July 25, 2008, and the results were confirmed or  updated in early 2009. All 24 pandemic coordinators completed the survey  for a response rate of 100 percent.", "To address the second and third objectives and to provide a more in-depth  examination of agencies\u2019 pandemic planning, we reviewed agency-level  pandemic planning for protection of employees for three case study  occupations. Our case studies included correctional workers from the  Department of Justice\u2019s Bureau of Prisons (BOP); production staff  responsible for disbursing federal payments from the Department of the  Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS); and air traffic controllers  from the Department of Transportation\u2019s Federal Aviation Administration  (FAA). The primary criteria for selecting the case studies were that they  represent non-first response occupations involved in an essential function  that federal employees need to provide on-site. In addition, we excluded  from our case study selections occupations in agencies that have a  primary role in the federal response to pandemic influenza.", "To assess the extent to which the case study agencies, BOP, FMS, and FAA  have operational plans to protect their workforce, we reviewed agency  and component pandemic plans and conducted interviews with agency  officials, employees in the case study occupations, and facility managers  and emergency planners for the sites at which the employees work. We  also met with union representatives from the American Federation of  Government Employees, the National Treasury Employees Union, and the  National Air Traffic Controllers Association to get their perspective on  plans to protect the federal workforce in the event of a pandemic. In  addition, we conducted interviews with the executive directors of the  Kansas City, Minnesota, and Oklahoma Federal Executive Boards (FEB)  to better understand federal planning for workforce protection in the  event of a pandemic at the regional level. Minnesota and Oklahoma were  selected because we had identified them in a previous report as leaders in  pandemic planning; Kansas City was selected because of the large  population of federal workers in its jurisdiction, including many in our  case study occupations.", "To better understand the challenges and assess the progress made in  planning to protect employees, we visited several facilities where the  employees in our case study occupations worked. Kansas City, Kansas;  Kansas City, Missouri; and Leavenworth, Kansas, were selected as site visit  locations because all of the case study agencies had facilities in the  metropolitan statistical area that were also in the jurisdiction of an FEB,  namely the Kansas City FEB. We selected as site visit facilities the United  States Penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, and BOP\u2019s North Central  Regional Office in Kansas City, Kansas, as the supporting regional office  for that facility; the Kansas City Financial Center in Kansas City, Missouri;  and FAA\u2019s Central Regional Office in Kansas City, Missouri. We also  visited the Allenwood Federal Correctional Complex in Allenwood,  Pennsylvania. We selected FAA air traffic facilities to cover the array of  types of facilities in which air traffic controllers work. We visited the  Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport in Arlington, Virginia; the  Potomac Terminal Radar Approach Control Facility in Warrenton,  Virginia; the Washington Air Route Traffic Control Center in Leesburg,  Virginia; and the Air Traffic Control Systems Command Center in  Herndon, Virginia. Although we did not conduct a site visit, the  Philadelphia Financial Center provided us with written answers to our  questions.", "We conducted interviews with officials from HHS, the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), the Office of Personnel Management (OPM),  and the Department of Labor (DOL). We met with HHS officials to get a  better understanding of how access to antiviral medications and vaccines  by federal agencies is envisioned in the event of a pandemic. HHS is  responsible for the overall coordination of the public health and medical  emergency response during a pandemic. DHS has responsibility for  coordinating the overall domestic federal response during an influenza  pandemic, including implementing policies that facilitate compliance with  recommended social distancing measures, developing a common  operating picture for all federal agencies, and ensuring the integrity of the  nation\u2019s infrastructure. OPM has responsibility for providing direction to  the FEBs and the Chief Human Capital Officers Council as well as  responsibility for developing human capital policy guidance for federal  employees in the event of a pandemic. DOL\u2019s Occupational Safety and  Health Administration has responsibility for promoting the safety and  health of workers.
