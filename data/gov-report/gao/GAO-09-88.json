Of the 71 reports issued by the OIG's Office of Audits in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, only 1 report had recommendations to address the economy and efficiency of NASA's programs and operations with measurable monetary accomplishments. Over the 5-year period of fiscal years 2003 through 2007, audit reports contributed to only 1 percent of the OIG's total monetary accomplishments. The remaining 99 percent came from the OIG's investigative cases. Of about $9 million in total reported monetary accomplishments from audits over the 5-year period, almost $7 million was from one audit completed in fiscal year 2007. When the monetary accomplishments of both audits and investigations in fiscal year 2007 are combined and compared to the OIG's budget of $34 million, the return for each budget dollar is $0.36. This calculation for all 30 OIGs with IGs appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate averages $9.49, or 26 times that of the NASA OIG. The OIG's relative lack of monetary accomplishments from audits is due, at least in part, to the OIG's strategic and annual audit plans, which do not provide assurance that NASA's economy and efficiency will be addressed or that measurable monetary accomplishments will be achieved. We believe that during the planning process, the OIG should consult with an objective third party with experience in providing economy and efficiency audits with potential monetary savings. The OIG's budgets and staffing kept pace or did slightly better than all of NASA for these same resources during fiscal years 2003 through 2007. When comparing the fiscal year 2007 budgets of all 30 IGs appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate with their respective agencies' budgets, the NASA OIG ranked 11th. Nevertheless, GAO noted that the OIG's ability to retain experienced audit personnel was adversely affected by a staff attrition rate that has increased from 12 percent to almost 20 percent over fiscal years 2003 through 2007. Due to the relatively high attrition rates, GAO believes that the OIG should use the assistance of an objective expert to identify the causes of staff turnover. The NASA OIG's most recent peer reviews for both audits and investigations have resulted in unqualified opinions. A recent investigation by the Integrity Committee of the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency and the Executive Council on Integrity and Efficiency reported that the NASA IG had an appearance of a lack of independence. The investigation was closed, but corrective actions did not address this finding and the Integrity Committee considers the issue unresolved. This issue has been raised by members of the Congress as a limitation in obtaining independent oversight of NASA."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report responds to your request that we review the operations and  activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s (NASA)  Office of Inspector General (OIG).

The IG Act provides protections to IGs\u2019  organizational independence through key provisions that require specified  IGs, including the NASA IG, to be appointed by the President with the  advice and consent of the Senate. This appointment is required to be  without regard to political affiliation and is to be based solely on an  assessment of the candidate\u2019s integrity and demonstrated ability. Such  presidentially appointed IGs can only be removed from office by the  President who must communicate the reasons for removal to both houses  of the Congress. The current NASA IG was appointed by the President on  April 16, 2002, after Senate confirmation.

As of the date of this report the new Council has not yet been  established, and the PCIE, ECIE, and their Integrity Committee continue  operation.", "Since 1990, we have periodically reported on government operations that  we have designated as high risk because of their greater vulnerabilities to  fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement as well as challenges to  economy, efficiency, or effectiveness. In January 2007, we identified 27  high-risk areas across the federal government. These included high-risk  areas applicable to NASA that had been reported in prior high-risk reports.  We specifically identified NASA\u2019s contract management as a high-risk area  because of weaknesses in NASA\u2019s integrated financial management  system. For example, we have reported that NASA\u2019s contractor cost  reporting process does not provide cost information that program  managers and cost estimators need to develop credible estimates and  compare budgeted and actual cost with the work performed. Also, NASA  has lacked a modern financial management system to provide accurate  and reliable information on contract spending and placed little emphasis  on product performance, cost controls, and program outcomes. On a  governmentwide basis, we also identified protecting the federal  government\u2019s information systems and strategic human capital  management across the executive branch as high-risk areas.", "Beginning in 1997, the IGs were asked by congressional leaders to identify  the 10 most serious management problems in their respective agencies.

Those objectives and  activities include audits that result in recommendations to improve the  economy and efficiency of NASA\u2019s programs and operations with  measurable cost savings, as well as receiving whistleblower complaints."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comment 9.", "paragraphs": ["Our review compared the NASA OIG\u2019s total budgetary resources to  NASA\u2019s total budgetary resources for fiscal years 2003 through 2007 to  determine whether the OIG\u2019s budgets were increasing or decreasing  relative to NASA\u2019s overall budgets. As stated in our report, the OIG\u2019s  budget as a percent of NASA\u2019s budget increased from 0.15 to 0.17 percent  during this period. The NASA IG states that $3.5 million in funding was  shifted from NASA to the OIG to pay for financial audits but cites this as  having no actual impact on funds available for OIG operations. We  disagree that these funds do not contribute to the resources available for  OIG operations. The NASA IG is subject to the Chief Financial Officers Act  of 1990 which specifies that the IG is responsible for the financial  statement audits of the agency. The increase of $3.5 million provides  resources in the OIG\u2019s budget for these mandated audits. As stated in our  report, over the 5-year period we reviewed the OIG\u2019s budgets kept pace  with or were slightly better than NASA\u2019s budgets as a whole. In addition,  when compared to other OIGs for fiscal year 2007, the NASA OIG ranked  11th out of 30 agencies in the ratio of the OIGs\u2019 budgets to their agencies\u2019  budgets."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jackson Hufnagle, Assistant  Director; Francis Dymond; Jacquelyn Hamilton; Jason Kirwan; and  Clarence Whitt made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
