Citing jurisdictions' unexpended program funds, HHS reallocated some fiscal year 2004 funds to support other local and national bioterrorism initiatives. Jurisdictions and associations representing jurisdictions disputed HHS's assertion that large amounts of funds remain unused, noting that HHS did not acknowledge obligated funds that had not yet been expended. GAO was asked to provide information on (1) the extent to which jurisdictions had expended the fiscal year 2002 funds awarded for the program's third budget period as of August 30, 2003, and August 31, 2004, and the fiscal year 2003 funds awarded for the program's fourth budget period, as of August 30, 2004; (2) the extent to which fiscal year 2001, 2002, and 2003 funds awarded for the third and fourth budget periods remained unobligated as of August 30, 2004; and (3) factors jurisdictions identified as contributing to delays in expending and obligating funds and actions some jurisdictions took to address them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Jurisdictions have expended a substantial amount of Bioterrorism program funds.

As of that date, they had expended slightly over half of P account funds awarded for the program's fourth budget period. Jurisdictions continued, as authorized, to expend funds beyond the budget period for which they were awarded. For example, some expenditures, such as contract payments, extend beyond one budget period. A t the end of the program's third budget period, jurisdictions reported that less than one-sixth of all bioterrorism funds awarded for that period--including both fiscal year 2001 and 2002 funds--remained unobligated, and some jurisdictions reported that none of their funds remained unobligated. As of August 1, 2004, jurisdictions estimated that less than one-quarter of all funds awarded for the fourth budget period would remain unobligated as of August 30, 2004, and five jurisdictions estimated that they would have no funds remaining unobligated. Many jurisdictions reported facing challenges, partly related to administrative processes, that delayed their obligation and expenditure of bioterrorism funds. These included workforce issues such as hiring freezes; contracting and procurement processes to ensure responsible use of public funds; and lengthy information technology upgrades. Some jurisdictions have simplified these processes to expedite the obligation and expenditure of funds.

Total funding  awarded through the program ranged from about $40 million in 1999 to  about $50 million in 2001 annually. The events of September 11, 2001,  increased concern about bioterrorism. In addition, the anthrax incidents  during the fall of 2001 strained the public health system, including  surveillance and laboratory workforce capacities, at the state and  municipal levels. Following these incidents, program funding increased  almost twentyfold, and this increased level of funding continued in fiscal  years 2003 and 2004.", "With the substantial increase in funding after the terrorist attacks in 2001,  CDC modified the program\u2019s budget periods.

However, the third budget period, which was  already under way at the time of the September 11 attack, was extended to  24 months, running from August 31, 2001, to August 30, 2003. It used funds  from both fiscal years 2001 and 2002. The fourth budget period reverted to  a 12-month period, running from August 31, 2003, to August 30, 2004, and  used funds from fiscal year 2003.", "In May 2004, HHS reported that large unexpended balances remained of  the fiscal year 2002 and 2003 funds awarded to jurisdictions for the  program\u2019s third and fourth budget periods. Citing these large unexpended  balances, HHS made the decision to reallocate approximately $55 million  of the funds for the fifth budget period (August 31, 2004, to August 30,  2005) to support other local and national bioterrorism initiatives. States  and national associations representing jurisdictions have disputed HHS\u2019s  assertion that large amounts of funds remain unused, noting that HHS  chose to focus only on expenditures, and did not focus on obligated funds,  which are funds that a jurisdiction has legally committed to spend\u2014for  example, through a contract for services\u2014but has not yet expended.", "You asked us to provide information on the expenditure and obligation of  funds awarded under the Public Health Preparedness and Response for  Bioterrorism program cooperative agreements and factors that may affect  these expenditures and obligations.

These expenditure data  come from PMS\u2019s public assistance accounts (P accounts)\u2014awardee  accounts that are specific to particular cooperative agreements, such as  the Bioterrorism program, or grants. The Bioterrorism P accounts do not  include fiscal year 2001 funds awarded during the first half of the third  budget period. Therefore, we were not able to include fiscal year 2001  funds in our analysis of the third budget period\u2019s expenditures. In addition,  the P accounts do not include funds carried over, with CDC\u2019s approval,  from prior budget periods, funds related to the Strategic National  Stockpile awarded after fiscal year 2002, or funds provided to  jurisdictions as direct assistance. However, while the P accounts are a  subset of the total Bioterrorism funds awarded to jurisdictions, they  accounted for over 90 percent of program funds awarded. We determined  the percentage of both the third budget period\u2019s fiscal year 2002 and fourth  budget period\u2019s fiscal year 2003 funds expended by comparing  expenditures recorded in the PMS P accounts to the total funds in the   P accounts.

We also reviewed the  Notices of Cooperative Agreement (NCA), which are provided by CDC to  jurisdictions and contain information on the total bioterrorism funds  awarded to the jurisdiction for a budget period. Unlike PMS\u2019s P account  data, the FSRs and NCAs include information on all bioterrorism funds  awarded as financial assistance, including both fiscal year 2001 and 2002  funds, funds carried over from prior periods, and funds related to the  Strategic National Stockpile. Because the FSR data related to obligation  are self-reported by jurisdictions, we interviewed officials from CDC,  HHS\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG), and jurisdiction audit  agencies to obtain information on any efforts to determine the reliability of  these data. Based on the work of the OIG and jurisdiction audit agencies,  obligation data for the third budget period from 18 jurisdictions and for  the fourth budget period from 1 jurisdiction can be considered reliable. In  other cases, the information presented is as reported by jurisdictions, and  we cannot attest to its reliability.", "To describe factors that jurisdictions said contributed to delays in  obligating and expending funds and actions some jurisdictions took to  address those factors, we selected 19 jurisdictions, taking into account  diversity in geographic location, population size, urban and rural status,  and their expenditure and obligation patterns.

As we  previously reported, such barriers included noncompetitive salaries and a  general shortage of people with the necessary skills. Officials told us they  had difficulty finding qualified workers, particularly epidemiologists and  laboratory technicians, and two officials indicated that problems related to  recruiting have delayed the expenditure of funds. In one of those  jurisdictions, the public health laboratory had so many vacancies that  there were not enough staff to fully implement a new bioterrorism and  emergency preparedness initiative. Officials indicated that, within their  jurisdictions, skilled workers could find better-paying positions with other  organizations. In one case, a municipality had to persuade a job candidate  to take a significant pay cut to work on the program. In another instance,  the salaries offered by a federal agency within a state were about   25 percent higher than those offered by the state. The same state reported  that competition from the private sector and other agencies has resulted  not only in a shortage of qualified applicants for positions, but also in the  loss of highly qualified personnel who had gained extensive experience  and expertise working for the state.", "Hiring freezes and complex staffing processes were also cited as delaying  the obligation and expenditure of funds. According to jurisdiction officials  with whom we spoke, as well as officials from the National Association of  County and City Health Officials, program officials in some jurisdictions  were not permitted to hire staff during an across-the-board freeze,  regardless of the federal funding available. Moreover, jurisdiction officials  reported that in some cases the release of a hiring freeze inundated the  hiring process, lengthening it in one state to as long as 10 months.  Jurisdiction officials stated that other staffing constraints also hindered  their hiring process. One state mandated mass layoffs in December 2002,  which resulted in the loss of approximately 60 health agency employees,  including the entire unit that was handling bioterrorism contracts. This  was followed in early 2003 by an early retirement plan that resulted in the  loss of support staff for the cooperative agreement. The layoffs and early  retirement program delayed bioterrorism contract payments. Moreover,  employees who had been laid off had contractual rights to placement in  new positions, which resulted in the placement into bioterrorism program  positions of some employees with little or no background in public health.  Some fiscal support positions remained unfilled for several months as a  result of the layoffs and early retirement program, which in turn affected  the state\u2019s ability to process bioterrorism program payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contracting and Procurement", "paragraphs": ["Because expenditures related to contracting for services and procuring  equipment can occur after the end of a given budget period, program  officials stressed the importance of being able to expend obligated funds  up to 12 months beyond the budget period, as CDC allows for in this  program. To illustrate the importance of such an allowance, one official  gave the example of a contract for $100,000 that began in June 2003,  during the third budget period. Under the terms of the contract, the  contractor would bill the program quarterly. The state in question would  draw down funds for the contract from PMS on a quarterly basis. If the  program received the first bill of $25,000 in September 2003, the first  drawdown related to this contract would occur in December 2003 and  subsequent drawdowns would occur in March 2004, June 2004, and  September 2004, all within the next budget period.", "Jurisdiction officials provided a number of examples of the complexity of  their jurisdictions\u2019 contracting processes and the resulting effect on  obligations and expenditures. An official in one state reported that the  state had to negotiate and develop contracts with over 100 local health  agencies after it received an influx of funding during the Bioterrorism  program\u2019s third budget period. After the local health contracts were  developed, they needed approval by the municipalities or health district  boards, a process that in some cases took several months. Another state  indicated that its contracting process takes a minimum of 2 months. Yet  another stated that the process could take from 3 to 6 months, depending  on which complexities arise. In addition, officials reported that the request  for proposals (RFP) process and bidding requirements delayed their ability  to create contracts and orders for services and equipment. In one state, the  RFP process takes 4 to 7 months, while in another the process can take as  long as 9 months.", "The necessity of developing large infrastructure projects related to the  bioterrorism preparedness cooperative agreement has also had an effect  on obligations and expenditures in a number of jurisdictions. These  projects, such as setting up a syndromic surveillance system, require the  assistance and expertise of a limited number of national contractors. A  state official informed us that since many of the jurisdictions began these  projects at the same time\u2014after the influx of fiscal year 2002 funds during  the third budget period\u2014some jurisdictions have had to wait for these  contractors to become available. Therefore, some jurisdictions have had to  wait to receive services and equipment, in effect delaying both obligations  and expenditures. In addition, jurisdictions indicated that effective  planning or the development of RFPs for these large projects required  extended periods of time.

According to another state official, many of the program staff were  hired as contractual or \u201cat will\u201d employees, to bypass the state\u2019s lengthy  hiring process. Another state, which was reluctant to hire permanent full- time program staff because of concern about the sustainability of federal  funding, employed temporary staff instead.", "Some officials also described techniques they had developed to address  challenges related to procurement issues. Prior to receiving fiscal year  2002 funds during the program\u2019s third budget period, one jurisdiction\u2019s  program elected to use a nonprofit fiscal and administrative intermediary  to reduce the delays caused by the municipality\u2019s regulations. A program  official told us that using the intermediary also allowed the program to  expedite the routine processes of recruitment, contracting, purchasing,  and ensuring fiscal accountability. According to the official, the  intermediary has a long history of collaborating with that health agency to  quickly and successfully implement new initiatives and is experienced in  grant management. The official stated that the intermediary has reduced  the time that it takes to implement program procedures because it does  not have to follow the municipality\u2019s normal requirements. For instance,  unlike the health agency, the intermediary is not subject to certain  municipal contracting and procurement requirements. Consequently, it is  able to use statewide general services contracts that can have as little as a  2-day turnaround. In addition, the intermediary has reduced the  municipality\u2019s RFP process from the usual 6 months to 2 months.", "One state official indicated that the state health agency had made a  concerted effort to streamline its procurement process. Prior to this effort,  the procurement process had taken as long as 18 months, including time  for the development and distribution of an RFP and for appeals. The  official said that one of the major improvements involved compiling a list  of preapproved contractors, which enables bioterrorism program officials  to purchase directly from those contractors without going through the  time-consuming RFP process.", "Another official told us that the health agency staff can place orders and  contracts more rapidly than usual if they designate them as \u201csole source\u201d  and \u201csingle source\u201d procurement, meaning that the needed equipment or  service is available from only one vendor. The official indicated that the  state\u2019s bioterrorism program uses this designation whenever they can  demonstrate that only one vendor can provide the equipment or service.  Additionally, the state has \u201cmaster price\u201d agreements with some vendors  for certain goods and services that are commonly needed by the various  agencies in the state.

In 2004, HHS expressed concern that jurisdictions had not  moved quickly enough to use these funds. However, jurisdictions  expended and obligated a substantial amount of program funds as of  August 30, 2004. In assessing the pace at which jurisdictions are spending  these funds, it is useful to consider that prudent use of public funds\u2014 particularly for new programs\u2014requires careful and often time-consuming  planning. Once plans have been developed, obligating and expending the  funds to implement them takes additional time. It is also important to  recognize that because some expenditures, such as those for contracts,  take place over a period of time rather than as one lump sum early in the  budget period, it may take longer than the program\u2019s budget period to  expend these funds.

We also provide information  on the extent to which fiscal year 2001, 2002, and 2003 Bioterrorism funds  awarded for the program\u2019s third and fourth budget periods were obligated,  and challenges jurisdictions have faced when attempting to expend or  obligate the Bioterrorism funds. To provide information on the  expenditure and obligation of Bioterrorism program funds awarded to  jurisdictions, we analyzed documents and interviewed officials from HHS\u2019s  Office of the Secretary, CDC, Division of Payment Management (DPM),  and Office of the Inspector General (OIG). In addition, we reviewed  documents and interviewed officials from the Association of State and  Territorial Health Officials and the National Association of County and  City Health Officials, two national associations representing state and  local health officials. We also interviewed jurisdiction audit and  Bioterrorism program officials to obtain information on program  obligations and to determine challenges faced by jurisdictions in  expending and obligating funds, and reviewed documents from the  Congressional Research Service, the Association of Public Health  Laboratories, and other organizations.", "To determine expenditures as of August 30, 2003, and August 30, 2004, we  analyzed expenditure data from DPM\u2019s Payment Management System  (PMS). We obtained and reviewed data from both the public assistance   (P) accounts and the general (G) accounts. Funds accounted for in the   P accounts are specific to certain grants or agreements, while G accounts  merge funds from grants and agreements made to one grantee into one  overall account. While over 90 percent of funds awarded to jurisdictions  through the Bioterrorism program are tracked in P accounts, some funds  are tracked in the G accounts, including all unexpended funds from budget  periods prior to the fiscal year 2002 funds awarded during the third budget  period and funds related to the Strategic National Stockpile before and  after fiscal year 2002. Because expenditures from the G accounts related  to a specific grant or agreement cannot be linked to funds from specific  budget periods, we are not able to describe the rates of expenditure of  Bioterrorism funds tracked in the G accounts. Moreover, because all funds  awarded to jurisdictions prior to the fiscal year 2002 funds are tracked in  the G accounts, we are not able to account for all expenditures during the  program\u2019s third budget period\u2014August 31, 2001, to August 30, 2003.  Rather, we are able to track expenditures for only the second portion of  that budget period, starting with the fiscal year 2002 emergency  supplemental appropriation. Expenditure data provided in this report  were obtained from PMS\u2019s P accounts and include only funds awarded as  financial assistance beginning with the fiscal year 2002 emergency  supplemental appropriation. (See table 2 for information on funding  included in the data sources reviewed.) The OIG annually contracts for an  audit that provides reasonable assurance about the design of controls  included in DPM\u2019s PMS, including controls for recording award  authorizations, processing awardee requests for funds, and reporting  payment and recipient disbursement information to the awarding agency.  We did not conduct a review to determine the appropriateness of any  jurisdiction expenditure.", "To determine obligation data, we reviewed the financial status reports  (FSR) jurisdictions were required to submit to CDC at the end of the third  budget period (August 31, 2001, to August 30, 2003) and the estimated  FSRs for the fourth budget period (August 31, 2003, to August 30, 2004)  that jurisdictions were requested to submit by August 1, 2004. Unlike  PMS\u2019s P account data, the FSRs include information on all Bioterrorism  funds awarded as financial assistance, including both fiscal year 2001 and  2002 funds awarded during the third budget period, funds carried over  from prior periods, and funds related to the Strategic National Stockpile.  Along with FSRs for the entire third budget period, CDC asked  jurisdictions to submit FSRs reflecting only the fiscal year 2002 emergency  supplemental appropriation funds. However, because few jurisdictions  submitted such emergency supplemental FSRs, we were unable to use  these FSRs. Because of this, we are reporting on obligation data obtained  from the FSRs for the entire third budget period, encompassing both fiscal  year 2001 and 2002 funds; this is a different period from that used for the  expenditure data provided in this report, which describe only  expenditures of the third budget period\u2019s fiscal year 2002 funds. Final  FSRs for the fourth budget period were not available in sufficient time to  be used in our work. For this period, we used the estimated FSRs  jurisdictions were asked to submit prior to the end of the budget period.  While the unobligated amounts reported on the final FSR may vary from  the estimates, CDC determined that these estimates were sufficiently  accurate to use for planning purposes. Seven jurisdictions did not submit  an estimated FSR, but did provide information in their application for  budget period five funds on estimated unobligated balances as of August  30, 2004. Eight jurisdictions did not provide any information on estimated  unobligated balances and were excluded from our analysis.", "In addition to reviewing jurisdictions\u2019 FSRs, we also reviewed the Notices  of Cooperative Agreement (NCA), which are provided by CDC to  jurisdictions and provide information on total Bioterrorism program funds  awarded to them for a budget period. Unlike the PMS P account data, the  NCAs include information on all funds awarded for the program\u2019s entire  third budget period, including funds from both fiscal years 2001 and 2002,  and information on funds carried over from previous periods, funds  related to the Strategic National Stockpile, and funds awarded as direct  assistance. To determine obligation rates, we compared the information  on total funds awarded obtained from the NCAs and FSRs to obligation  data that jurisdictions reported in the third budget period FSRs and  estimated in the fourth budget period FSRs.", "We interviewed CDC staff to resolve any inconsistencies between the  information provided on the FSRs and information provided in the NCAs  and modified data as appropriate. In addition, because the data related to  obligation are self-reported by jurisdictions to CDC, we interviewed  officials at CDC and HHS\u2019s OIG to obtain information on any work done to  determine the reliability of these data. We also contacted the jurisdiction  audit agencies in all the jurisdictions by e-mail or telephone to determine  whether they had performed any work to determine the reliability of the  obligation data. Data for the third budget period from 18 jurisdictions and  for the fourth budget period from 1 jurisdiction can be considered reliable  based on the work of OIG and jurisdiction audit agencies. However, in  many cases, insufficient work had been done to assess the reliability of the  obligation data reported by jurisdictions. In these cases, the information  presented is as reported by the jurisdictions, and we cannot attest to its  reliability. In addition, we did not conduct a review to determine the  appropriateness of any obligations reported by jurisdictions to CDC.", "To describe factors that jurisdictions say contributed to delays in  obligating and expending funds and actions some jurisdictions took to  address those factors, we contacted selected jurisdictions via e-mail in two  phases. Initially, the team contacted 10 jurisdictions to gather information  on why they may have had unobligated Bioterrorism funds. We analyzed  the obligation and expenditure data to identify jurisdictions with high and  low rates of unobligated and unexpended Bioterrorism funds, for both the  third and fourth budget periods. Jurisdictions were categorized as those  with (1) reported high unobligated balances, (2) reported low unobligated  balances, or (3) reported low unobligated balances and high levels of  unexpended funds. We then selected jurisdictions from each of the groups,  taking into account diversity in geographic location, population size, urban  and rural status, and their expenditure and obligation patterns. We   e-mailed each jurisdiction, and we followed up by telephone to obtain any  necessary clarification on responses.", "For phase 2, we e-mailed 3 jurisdictions from the phase 1 group and 9  additional jurisdictions. These 12 jurisdictions had expended from 50 to   87 percent of their third budget period funds by August 30, 2003, the end of  that period, but had expended 100 percent of those funds by August 30,  2004. We followed up by telephone and e-mail to obtain any necessary  clarification on responses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Bioterrorism Program\u2019s Budget Period Three Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["Data on funds awarded to California, Illinois, and New York do not include funds awarded to   Los Angeles County, Chicago, or New York City."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Bioterrorism Program\u2019s Budget Period Four Expenditures", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Unobligated Bioterrorism Program Funds Reported by Jurisdictions", "paragraphs": ["Percentage of awarded  funds reported  Data on awarded funds were not consistent between jurisdiction FSRs and the Notices of  Cooperative Agreement.
