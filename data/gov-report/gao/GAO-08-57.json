ONDCP selected the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to operate the grant program in fiscal year 2005. In 2005, ONDCP did not award grants to some coalitions who had previously received grant funds (renewal grantees). GAO was asked to assess (1) the extent to which ONDCP and SAMHSA administered grant-related activities for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 consistent with federal internal control standards, statutory requirements, and other guidance and (2) the steps ONDCP has taken since 2006 regarding its administration of grant-related activities.

Standards for internal control in the federal government call for agencies to conduct ongoing monitoring of a program's performance, but ONDCP did not conduct such monitoring of SAMHSA or the program overall. Thus, ONDCP increased its risk of not providing reasonable assurance that SAMHSA conducted grant activities, such as eligibility screening. Internal control standards also require that agencies maintain documentation that grant applicants met eligibility requirements each fiscal year. While SAMHSA officials said that they screened all renewal grantees for eligibility in 2005 and ONDCP officials said they screened all initial grantees in 2006, documentation indicating that such screening had occurred was missing from 47 of the 66 grantee files GAO reviewed. ONDCP also lacked a process to ensure that all renewal applicants met statutory eligibility requirements. For example, ONDCP used a separate screening process in fiscal year 2005 that included a criterion that grantees limit funding for direct services, such as enrolling individuals in a drug prevention program. Only renewal grant applicants that met this or one of two other criteria underwent further screening for statutory eligibility. As a result, ONDCP funded about 86 percent of renewal grantees in 2005 without ensuring that they met the statutory eligibility criteria. Leading practices for collaborating agencies call for strategies to ensure common outcomes. However, the inter-agency agreement between ONDCP and SAMHSA did not fully define roles and responsibilities and lacked specific guidance to SAMHSA on eligibility screening. As a result, confusion occurred over issues, such as the eligibility criteria to apply, hampering the two agencies in their efforts to effectively manage the grant-making process. Since 2006, ONDCP has addressed some of the issues described above, by (1) clarifying its role for the program in its 2007 agreement with SAMHSA, (2) establishing management groups to address monitoring issues, and (3) eliminating its use of the direct services eligibility criterion. However, some internal control and other challenges remain. For example, ONDCP has not yet put a mechanism in place to ensure that documentation confirming eligibility is maintained in the grant files. ONDCP also has not documented its approach to overseeing SAMHSA and the program. Without defined oversight activities for ensuring completion of the work, ONDCP lacks reasonable assurance that required tasks are being performed in accordance with management's directives. Also, roles and responsibilities for key elements of grant administration remain largely undefined in that the agencies have not clarified certain services SAMHSA is to provide related to awarding grants or the role of the program Administrator. Without defining these roles, confusion on the steps to follow in managing the program could continue to occur. Finally, as in 2006, ONDCP officials told GAO that they did not screen renewal grant applicants for eligibility in 2007 because the screening that applicants undergo when they first receive a grant is sufficient."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Twenty-five percent of American students between the ages of 13 and 17  Twenty-five percent of American students between the ages of 13 and 17  reported using illicit drugs in 2007, according to a government survey.

By statute, eligible coalitions may  receive Drug-Free Communities Support Program grants for two 5-year  cycles (generally, an initial grant and four renewal grants per 5-year  cycle). According to ONDCP, a coalition, after award of an initial grant,  will continue to receive funds during the 5-year cycle if ONDCP  determines that the coalition makes satisfactory progress in its efforts to  reduce substance abuse among youth and the coalition complies with the  conditions of their award, and remains eligible for the grant. For example,  the coalition must have as its principal mission the reduction of substance  abuse in a comprehensive and long-term manner, with a primary focus on  youth in the community.

Since the program\u2019s inception in  1997, ONDCP has delegated authority for the execution of certain grant  management activities to other agencies, as authorized by statute. From  fiscal years 1998 to 2004, ONDCP managed the Drug-Free Communities  Support Program in conjunction with the Office of Juvenile Justice and  Delinquency Prevention, an office within the Department of Justice (DOJ).  In fiscal year 2004, as a result of a recommendation from the program\u2019s  Advisory Commission aimed at determining the appropriate agency to  execute certain grant management activities of the program, ONDCP  selected the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  (SAMHSA), a component of the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS), to help manage the program. Fiscal year 2005 was the first year  that the grant program was operated by ONDCP and SAMHSA under an  inter-agency agreement.

Further, to determine whether ONDCP and SAMHSA had documented  eligibility screening, we reviewed systematic random samples of available  grant applications for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. Because the 126  applications we reviewed (of which 66 were awarded grants) were not  representative of all of the approximately 1,690 applications, we cannot  generalize the results to the larger populations of fiscal year 2005 (about  990 applications) or fiscal year 2006 applicants (over 700 applications).  Even so, our review of these applications provided us with perspective on  how ONDCP and SAMHSA handled these applications. Additionally,  because accurate counts of the total numbers of applications in fiscal  years 2005 and 2006 were not available, we provide approximate numbers  of applications to illustrate orders of magnitude. We compared ONDCP\u2019s  and SAMHSA\u2019s grant-related activities in fiscal years 2005 through 2007  with criteria in GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. These standards, issued pursuant to the requirements of the  Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), provide the  overall framework for establishing and maintaining internal control in the  federal government. Also pursuant to FMFIA, the Office of Management  and Budget (OMB) issued Circular A-123, revised December 21, 2004, to  provide the specific requirements for assessing the reporting on internal  controls. Internal control standards and the definition of internal control  in OMB Circular A-123 are based on GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government. We also considered our prior work on results- oriented government related to leading practices for federal  collaboration. In addition, we compared ONDCP\u2019s and SAMHSA\u2019s grant- related activities in fiscal years 2005 through 2007 with statutory criteria  included in the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997; the Drug-Free  Communities Support Program Reauthorization Act of 2001; and the  Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006.", "To identify the steps ONDCP has taken since fiscal year 2006, if any,  concerning its administration of grant-related activities, we reviewed the  documents and grant applications described above.

For example, the screening sheet did not capture whether an applicant  had described and documented the nature and extent of the substance  abuse problem in the community; described the substance abuse  prevention and treatment programs and activities; developed a strategic  plan to reduce substance abuse among youth in a comprehensive and long- term fashion; and worked to develop a consensus regarding the priorities  of the community to combat substance abuse among youth as required by  statute.

Without defined oversight activities for ensuring  successful completion of the work across all activities, ONDCP lacks  reasonable assurance that required tasks are being performed in  accordance with its directives.", "ONDCP officials acknowledged that they were aware that grant file  documentation was missing during fiscal years 2005 and 2006. However, as  of fiscal year 2007, ONDCP had not yet put in place mechanisms to ensure  that documentation of eligibility screening were included in grant files, as  called for by internal control standards. Nor had ONDCP amended the  eligibility screening sheets for fiscal year 2007 to capture all the statutory  eligibility criteria. Without ensuring that screening sheets contain all the  required statutory eligibility criteria, ONDCP increased its risk that  grantees were not statutorily eligible to receive grants.", "ONDCP and SAMHSA have taken steps to clarify their respective roles and  responsibilities for handling program administration and coordination  issues in their fiscal year 2007 inter-agency agreement. For example,  whereas the inter-agency agreement for fiscal year 2005 did not delineate  roles and responsibilities for administering the grant-making process, the  inter-agency agreement written for fiscal year 2007 provides additional  information. Specifically, the fiscal year 2007 agreement includes a new  attachment describing ONDCP\u2019s role and responsibilities for the program.  The fiscal year 2007 inter-agency agreement states, for example, that  ONDCP will convene \u201ccooperative partners\u201d meetings with the Center for  Substance Abuse Prevention to enhance program coordination and  collaboration. Further, the inter-agency agreement states that SAMHSA  would provide certain services in connection with the awarding of grants  in accordance with policies and procedures agreed upon by ONDCP and  SAMHSA. However, all of these policies and procedures that ONDCP and  SAMHSA agreed to are not documented in the inter-agency agreement or  in other documentation. For example, the agreement states that ONDCP  and SAMHSA shall agree on terms of the programmatic and budget review  prior to reviewing renewal applications and that ONDCP shall make final  funding decisions for these grants. However, the fiscal year 2007  agreement does not specify what the programmatic and budget review  processes are and when they should be completed and by which agency.", "While efforts to clarify how the grant program is to be administered and  the designation of the Director of ONDCP as responsible for making final  funding decisions represents a step in the right direction, the  Administrator\u2019s role is still not specified in the inter-agency agreement. As  noted earlier, the Administrator\u2019s role is defined by statute as the entity  that generally carries out the grant program. While the fiscal year 2007  agreement states that the Director of ONDCP will make final funding  decisions, the role of the Administrator is not specifically identified,  described, or defined in the inter-agency agreement. Leading practices for  collaborating agencies state that agreement on roles and responsibilities is  a necessary element for a collaborative working relationship. Because  the Administrator is responsible for generally carrying out the grant  program, it is particularly important that the agencies agree upon and  document what this leadership role entails. Without doing so, confusion  over managing the program could continue to occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite ONDCP\u2019s Elimination of Certain Eligibility Criterion in Response to Reauthorizing Legislation, ONDCP Did Not Screen Renewal Grantees for Statutory Eligibility", "paragraphs": ["In response to congressional concerns and complaints from renewal grant  applicants that were not funded in fiscal year 2005, the ONDCP  Reauthorization Act of 2006 prohibited the Director of ONDCP from  imposing any eligibility criteria on initial applicants or renewal grantees  not included in the statute. ONDCP officials said that, as a result of the  prohibition in the reauthorizing act, they eliminated their use of the 20  percent direct services eligibility criterion for fiscal year 2007. Moreover,  the fiscal year 2007 inter-agency agreement no longer contains the 20  percent direct services criterion, consistent with the reauthorization act.  Instead, ONDCP officials stated that they take direct services into account  as part of the overall evaluation of an application during the peer review  process.", "Nonetheless, ONDCP continues to not screen renewal grant applicants for  statutory eligibility. As stated earlier in this report, by statute, to be eligible  to receive a renewal grant, a coalition shall meet all of the statutory  eligibility criteria. However, ONDCP officials stated that they consider the  initial screening they conduct to be sufficient for the remaining 4 years for  renewal grantees. In fiscal year 2007, renewal grant applicants were not  required to submit any supporting documentation (e.g., proof of eligible  coalition members) to verify that they met all the statutory eligibility  criteria nor were they screened for statutory eligibility. ONDCP\u2019s approach  does not take into account that a coalition\u2019s eligibility status could change  from one fiscal year to another if, for example, representatives from the  different sectors in fiscal year 2006 left the coalition in fiscal year 2007 and  were not replaced. ONDCP\u2019s decision to not screen renewal grant  applicants for eligibility in fiscal year 2007 raises questions about whether  the agency could provide reasonable assurance that participating  coalitions remain statutorily eligible. ONDCP officials told us that the  eligibility criteria that were missing from the eligibility screening sheets  (e.g., whether an applicant had described and documented the nature and  extent of the substance abuse problem in the community) are not used  during the eligibility process, but rather are considered during the peer  review process. However, these criteria are intended to be used to  determine statutory eligibility for grant funds. According to ONDCP\u2019s  practices, peer reviewers do not typically determine eligibility; they  examine only eligible applications for an application\u2019s strength. Without  ensuring that all statutory eligibility criteria were met, ONDCP cannot be  certain that all funded grant applicants were eligible."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal years 2005 and 2006, ONDCP and SAMHSA did not adhere to key  federal internal controls standards in the federal government and did not  meet all statutory requirements in administering the Drug-Free  Communities Support grant program. ONDCP has been unable to show  that only eligible coalitions received grants in accordance with the Drug- Free Communities Support Program\u2019s statutory framework. In particular,  because ONDCP has decided not to conduct eligibility screening each  fiscal year for renewal grant applicants, it is unable to ensure that these  coalitions remain eligible for their duration in the program, consistent with  statutory requirements. Without well-functioning internal controls, such as  maintaining grant documentation and conducting on-going monitoring,  ONDCP cannot demonstrate consistent implementation of the key steps  required in the grant-making process\u2014notably, the screening of grantees  to determine their eligibility\u2014to Congress, grant-seeking applicants, and  the public at large. Such lack of assurance raises questions about whether  public resources are properly safeguarded.", "ONDCP took steps following fiscal year 2006 to enhance its administration  of the grant program, such as informing applicants of changes in its  eligibility screening processes and revising its procedures to address  internal control and other deficiencies. However, ongoing weaknesses in  the monitoring and oversight of the program mean it may not be possible  to ensure that all appropriate guidance and policies are being met or  communicated to grant applicants. And while ONDCP and SAMHSA have  made an effort to define roles and responsibilities in the fiscal year 2007  inter-agency agreement, important functions, such as the leadership role  of the Administrator, remain unaddressed. Without fully defined and  agreed upon roles and responsibilities, the agencies may not be able to  avoid miscommunication and lack of collaboration over the grant-making  process in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen its administration, oversight, and internal controls for the  Drug-Free Communities Support Program, we recommend that the  Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy take the following  three actions:  1.  Develop and document its approach to monitoring and overseeing  SAMHSA and the program as a whole.  2.  Ensure that the coalitions receiving an initial grant or a renewal grant  satisfy all of the statutory eligibility criteria for each fiscal year and  that this is fully documented.  3.  Fully define the roles and responsibilities of SAMHSA and ONDCP,  including those of the Drug-Free Communities Support Program  Administrator, in the inter-agency agreement prepared for each fiscal  year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to ONDCP, HHS, and DOJ for review  and comment.

In addition, ONDCP and DOJ provided technical comments,  which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In commenting on the draft report, the Director of ONDCP described the  efforts it has underway or planned to address our recommendations.  Although these actions are intended to strengthen the management of the  grant review process, based on the ONDCP Director\u2019s response, additional  efforts could help ensure that our recommendations are fully  implemented, as discussed below.", "Regarding our first recommendation on developing and documenting an  approach to program monitoring and oversight, the Director noted that  ONDCP has added more detail in the inter-agency agreement on the roles  and responsibilities of ONCDP and SAMHSA and created and implemented  a policy manual for the program, which was implemented in 2007.  However, our analysis of ONDCP\u2019s policy manual showed that it does not  include information on whether and how ONDCP will conduct oversight  and monitoring. The Director also stated that ONDCP has documentation  of minutes and activities that take place at their monthly interagency  management meetings. During our review, we repeatedly requested these  minutes but ONDCP officials said that no formal minutes were developed  or maintained and did not provide them. However, we have modified the  report to delete the statement that minutes were not available. We  continue to believe that this recommendation remains valid because,  without defined oversight activities for ensuring successful completion of  the work across all activities, ONDCP increases its risk that it cannot  provide reasonable assurance that required tasks are being performed in  accordance with its directives.", "Concerning our second recommendation that ONDCP ensure that the  coalitions receiving an initial grant or a renewal grant satisfy all of the  statutory eligibility criteria for each fiscal year and that these decisions are  fully documented, the ONDCP Director noted that they have taken steps to  ensure that all renewal applicants are screened for eligibility, consistent  with our recommendation, and documentation related to screening  applicants is maintained in grant files. However, the ONDCP Director took  issue with our position that all statutory eligibility requirements should be  included on the screening sheets used to document application reviews.  The Director said that the initial joint review by ONDCP and SAMHSA  staff, combined with the application review and scoring process  conducted during peer reviews, effectively ensure that applications  recommended for funding meet statutory eligibility requirements.  However, we continue to maintain that including all statutory eligibility  requirements on the screening sheets could increase ONDCP\u2019s assurance  that all funded applicants are statutorily eligible and that these decisions  are fully documented.", "Regarding the third recommendation on clearly defining roles and  responsibilities, the ONDCP Director noted that ONDCP plans to add  additional details to the inter-agency agreement on the role of the Drug- Free Communities Support Program Administrator.", "The ONDCP Director commented on some of the data we presented in this  report. Specifically, the Director expressed concern that we were unable  to accurately identify the number of applications for fiscal years 2005 and  fiscal years 2006, noting that ONDCP had provided us with spreadsheets  that identified the number of applications received and their disposition.  During our review, we worked continuously with ONDCP officials in an  effort to obtain accurate data on the number of applications received.  Nonetheless, we were unable to do so because, despite our numerous  attempts, we could not resolve inconsistencies in the information ONDCP  provided over the course of our review, causing us to question its  accuracy. However, we believe that the numbers we present on grant  applications are sufficient to illustrate orders of magnitude. We revised  our scope and methodology discussion in appendix I to explain the efforts  we took to obtain the most accurate information available from ONDCP.", "Moreover, the Director took issue with our presentation of ONDCP\u2019s data  in figure 4, which showed that ONDCP excluded approximately 190 initial  applicants in fiscal year 2005 from the possibility of being funded without  being screened for statutory eligibility. He indicated that by doing so  ONDCP would have incurred an unnecessary expenditure of taxpayer  dollars to review applications which fell below the funding threshold  (range of peer review scores for which applicants are awarded funding).  We agree that taxpayer dollars should not be expended unnecessarily.  However, we disagree that figure 4 conveys the point the director is  asserting; rather, our analysis of ONDCP\u2019s data shows that some of these  approximately 190 initial applicants had peer review scores above the  funding threshold and were excluded on the basis of one or more of the  other criteria in the separate screening process.", "The Assistant Secretary for Legislation at HHS also commented on a draft  of this report. Specifically, he described actions that SAMSHA has taken,  in partnership with ONDCP, to strengthen internal controls and  management of the DFC grant program. For example, the Assistant  Secretary said that program information has been consolidated into the  SAMHSA Drug-Free Communities Support Program Operations Manual,  SAMHSA and ONDCP officials are meeting monthly to enhance inter- agency coordination, and SAMHSA and ONDCP are currently jointly  screening applications for statutory eligibility and SAMHSA retains the  screening checklists.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the  date of this report.

We  compared ONDCP\u2019s and SAMHSA\u2019s grant-related activities in fiscal years  2005 through 2007 with criteria in GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government. These standards, issued pursuant to the  requirements of the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982  (FMFIA), provide the overall framework for establishing and maintaining  internal control in the federal government. Also pursuant to FMFIA, the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) issued Circular A-123, revised  December 21, 2004, to provide the specific requirements for assessing the  reporting on internal controls. Internal controls and the definition of  internal control in OMB Circular A-123 are based on GAO\u2019s Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. We also considered our prior  work on results-oriented government related to leading practices for  federal collaboration as well as leading practices for awarding grants. In  addition, we compared ONDCP and SAMHSA\u2019s grant related activities in  fiscal years 2005 through 2007 with statutory criteria included in the Drug- Free Communities Act of 1997, the Drug-Free Communities Support  Program Reauthorization Act of 2001, and the Office of National Drug  Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006. Further, to determine  whether ONDCP and SAMHSA had documented eligibility screening, we  reviewed grant applications for fiscal years 2005 and 2006. We did not  review all available applications because this was not practical. Instead,  we attempted to select probability samples of applications to review; this  would have allowed us to generalize the results to all of the fiscal year  2005 and 2006 applications (about 990 and over 700, respectively, for a  total of about 1,690). However, because ONDCP and SAMHSA were unable  to provide accurate counts of the total numbers of applications in either  year, we were unable to do so. We made numerous attempts to resolve  inconsistencies in the information ONDCP provided over the course of our  review, which caused us to question its accuracy. Consequently, we  reviewed systematic random samples of available funded and unfunded  applications for these years. For fiscal year 2005, we reviewed 20 funded,  initial applications and 21 funded, renewal applications, 30 unfunded,  initial applications, and 20 unfunded, renewal applications. For fiscal year  2006, we reviewed 25 funded, initial applications and 10 unfunded, initial  applications. Although the applications we reviewed for both fiscal years  were randomly selected, because the applications were not representative  of all applications in either year we cannot generalize the results to the  larger populations of fiscal year 2005 or 2006 applicants. Even so, our  review of these 126 grant applications provided us with perspective on  how ONDCP and SAMHSA handled these applications. Additionally,  because accurate counts of the total numbers of applications in fiscal  years 2005 and 2006 were not available, we provide approximate numbers  of applications to illustrate orders of magnitude.", "In addition to our review of documents and grant files described above, we  interviewed key staff at ONDCP and SAMHSA about how they conducted  and documented grant-related activities since 2006. While our discussions  with the agency officials from ONDCP and SAMHSA focused on the  agencies\u2019 review methods and funding decisions implemented in fiscal  years 2005 and 2006, we also obtained information for fiscal year 2007  wherever possible to provide the most current information on the  program. We did not review the fiscal year 2008 grant-making process  because the process was underway during our review and the results of  the process were not yet available.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2006 through July 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
