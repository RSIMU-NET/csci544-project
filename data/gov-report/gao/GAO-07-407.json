In 2003, at the request of Congress, GAO issued a management review of AOC that contained recommendations designed to help AOC become more strategic and accountable. Subsequently, Congress directed GAO to monitor AOC's progress in implementing recommendations. This is the fourth status report on AOC's progress and summarizes GAO's assessment of AOC's overall progress and remaining actions in becoming more strategic and accountable, including AOC's responses to specific recommendations GAO made in January 2003 and subsequently. To assess AOC's progress, GAO analyzed AOC documents; interviewed AOC officials; and relied on the results of related GAO reviews, including reviews of the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC). AOC generally agreed with GAO's assessment of its progress, but noted that 2 additional recommendations--1 on financial management practices and 1 on collecting worker safety data--should be considered implemented. GAO acknowledges AOC's efforts in these areas, but maintains that further steps are necessary to fully implement these recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["AOC has made progress in becoming more strategic and accountable, but critical actions are needed to sustain and build on this progress. To date, AOC has filled key leadership positions, revised its strategic plan, improved communication, and continued initiatives to improve internal controls and accountability. AOC is thus establishing a foundation for becoming more strategic and accountable. However, completing the transition to new leadership--including the transition to a new Architect of the Capitol (a position that is now vacant)--and other actions remain to bring about lasting improvements in performance. For example, AOC must integrate nine new managers into the agency while ensuring its continued progress. In addition, the Chief Operating Officer faces the challenge of performing the Architect of the Capitol's responsibilities and his own during the CVC project's completion and AOC's management transition. Furthermore, although AOC has revised its strategic plan to better focus on its mission and goals, it has not determined whether it can better deliver the services that support its mission and goals through outsourcing or in-house resources. Finally, a continued focus on communication and other areas that are key to greater internal control and accountability--including financial, information technology, and project management--is needed to sustain and further AOC's progress to date. For example, full implementation of AOC's cost accounting system--a key financial management initiative--is needed to more accurately track facilities management cost measures. Improvements in project management could be achieved, in part, by applying lessons learned in managing the CVC project. Appendix I of this report summarizes AOC's progress on recommendations that GAO has made since January 2003 to help AOC establish a strong strategic management and accountability framework. This year, AOC has implemented 21 recommendations. For example, AOC implemented 6 of the strategic management recommendations, including the development of congressional protocols and the involvement of stakeholders in developing the revised strategic plan. For project management, AOC implemented 7 recommendations, including the development of performance measures. Implementing these 21 recommendations brings the total number of implemented or closed recommendations to 43 out of 64."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) is responsible for the operations,  maintenance, renovation, and new construction of the Capitol Hill  complex, including such high-profile and historic buildings as the U.S.  Capitol Building, Senate and House Office Buildings, Library of Congress,  and Supreme Court.

Preserving and modernizing these buildings while  meeting the needs of Congress and the visiting public poses challenges for  AOC. In 2001, Congress raised concerns about management shortcomings  at AOC and asked us to review the management of AOC\u2019s operations. In  response, we issued a report in January 2003 containing recommendations  that were designed to help AOC establish a strong strategic management  and accountability framework.

AOC also has centralized  staff that perform administrative and project management functions. AOC  has managed major projects throughout the Capitol Hill complex and is  currently managing the construction of the CVC. The historic nature and  high profile of many of these buildings create a complex environment for  AOC to carry out its mission; AOC must balance the diverse and  sometimes divergent needs of congressional leaders, committees,  members, and staffs as well as the visiting public.", "Congress has raised concerns about management shortcomings at AOC.  For example, in 2001, the Senate Appropriations Committee cited several  management issues, including a lack of strategic planning, inadequate  financial and project management controls, and an unacceptably high level  of worker injuries.

The recommendations were in seven areas, including  strategic management, human capital management, financial management,  project management, IT management, worker safety, and recycling. The  report recognized this transformation as a long-term effort that involves a  fundamental change in AOC\u2019s culture. For example, AOC faces the  challenge of how best to marshal its jurisdiction-based resources to  address the strategic planning and other functional issues that cut across  the organization. Changes of this magnitude require the sustained  commitment of the agency\u2019s top leadership.", "Subsequent reports on AOC\u2019s progress that we issued in 2004 and 2006  concluded that, while AOC was making progress on all recommendations,  substantial work remained to achieve the goal of becoming more strategic  and accountable, and that sustained commitment and assertive  involvement by AOC\u2019s leadership would be key to instilling long-term  management improvements. Specifically, our last report in this series,  issued in February 2006, concluded that the agency had not addressed two  issues\u2014communication with external stakeholders and development of  internal controls\u2014that affect a wide range of AOC operations, including  cost accounting, procurement, and information security. Furthermore,  leadership support is vital to ensure that needed improvements are  implemented and sustained, but key leadership positions\u2014including those  of the COO, CFO, Chief Administrative Officer, and Director of CPP\u2014were  vacant and the term of the agency head, the Architect, was due to expire in  less than a year. Therefore, it was critical for AOC to quickly fill the vacant  management positions with qualified people so AOC would have a  cohesive management team in place in preparation for a change in the  agency\u2019s top leadership.

These new managers comprise 9 of the 20  managers that report directly to the Architect or the COO. (See fig. 1.)  Most of these positions, including those of the CFO and the Chief  Administrative Officer, were vacant because of retirements and  resignations. To help AOC better meet the needs of its customers, AOC  also created and filled two new leadership positions\u2014the Director of  Congressional and External Relations and the Director of Planning and  Project Management. In addition to these nine positions, AOC has filled  seven other management positions over the past year, such as the Deputy  Director for the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer, Deputy Director  of the Project Management Division, and Director of the Information  Technology Division.", "While these new managers can bring new energy and ideas to the agency,  the introduction of so many new managers within a short period makes it  challenging to integrate them into AOC while sustaining the progress made  thus far.

AOC has taken steps to mitigate these  factors and integrate the new managers into the agency by, for example,  holding weekly senior leadership meetings and monthly detailed briefings  on various AOC construction projects. These managers are also part of  AOC\u2019s senior executive performance management system, which links the  managers\u2019 performance plans to AOC\u2019s mission-critical goals and holds the  managers accountable for results.

The process for hiring the new Architect is in  the early stages, and according to the COO, hiring the previous Architect  took over a year. Until a new Architect is in place, the COO is authorized  to act as the Architect and is assuming the Architect\u2019s duties along with his  own. In general, the Architect\u2019s responsibilities include overall  management of AOC, support and representation on boards and  commissions\u2014including the Capitol Police Board\u2014and management of  the CVC project, while the COO\u2019s responsibilities involve developing the  agency\u2019s strategic and performance plans, proposing organizational and  staffing changes needed to carry out AOC\u2019s mission, and reviewing and  directing the operational functions of AOC. The COO identified the  management of the CVC project as one of the agency\u2019s major challenges to  becoming more strategic and accountable, because the CVC requires  significant management attention that could otherwise be focused on  AOC\u2019s transformation initiatives. The management responsibilities for the  CVC project could increase if, as scheduled, the CVC reaches a critical  juncture in the next year as the construction phase ends and operations  begin. For example, before the CVC becomes operational, the roles and  responsibilities for managing CVC operations, including those of AOC, will  need to be determined. Furthermore, the CVC project executive is  planning to leave the agency in March 2007, which is likely to place  additional responsibilities on the COO. Given these factors, it will be  challenging for one person to fulfill the critical roles of the Architect and  the COO in completing the CVC and continuing AOC\u2019s progress in  becoming more strategic and accountable.", "AOC has begun preparing for the transition to a new Architect by  determining how to support the COO in the absence of an Architect and  establishing a transition team for bringing in a new Architect. To support  the COO, AOC has begun identifying individuals to assist the COO in  managing various areas, such as project management and facilities  management. While this strategy will provide support to the COO, it  remains to be seen whether the strategy will provide the necessary  support during the transition. AOC has also established a transition team  that is chaired by the Director of Congressional and External Relations  and that includes the COO and the Chief Administrative Officer, among  others. This team has begun to prepare background materials for quickly  bringing the new Architect up to speed on the agency and its initiatives,  once a new Architect has been selected.

However, AOC has not comprehensively reviewed all the  services it provides to determine whether the services could better be  provided through outsourcing or in-house resources. Consequently, few  activities are outsourced consistently throughout AOC, and contracts are  seldom consolidated to obtain similar services across jurisdictions. In  2006, the House Appropriations Committee instructed AOC to develop a  plan that analyzes the costs, cost-effectiveness, benefits, and feasibility of  the Architect\u2019s entering into contracts with private entities for managing  and operating its facilities.

Although AOC developed a plan to address problems in the utility  tunnels, the tunnel workers expressed concern that they had no clear idea  of when the problems would be solved. To improve communication, AOC  began holding weekly meetings with the tunnel shop workers in April 2006  to discuss tunnel issues and the actions being taken, but workers  continued to express frustration about the lack of progress in addressing  their safety and health concerns.

The potential limited, near-term progress leads us to observe  in this report that successful implementation of these systems and  processes, which impact all of AOC\u2019s operations, will require sustained  organizational commitment to ensure these efforts are appropriately  funded, staffed, and monitored. We maintain that full implementation of  these initiatives is necessary for institutionalizing internal control and  accountability and strengthening and supporting effective budgeting,  financial, and performance management at AOC. For the recommendation  on collecting worker safety data, AOC officials noted that they believe  their current practices\u2014including conducting biennial focus groups,  conducting daily shop safety meetings, and establishing a safety hazards  hotline\u2014sufficiently meet the requirements of this recommendation. While  we recognize that these initiatives provide the agency with some  information on worker safety, these initiatives do not provide a rigorous  and confidential approach for collecting employee perceptions of AOC\u2019s  safety climate, such as perceptions of management commitment,  discipline policies, and hazard corrections. This lack of confidentiality can  impede the quality of information collected. Furthermore, although AOC  established a schedule to collect employee feedback every other year,  AOC has not conducted focus groups since fiscal year 2004 and does not  have plans to do so until possibly fiscal year 2008. AOC\u2019s recently revised  employee feedback manual specifies that AOC can use other means or  tools to collect and provide employee feedback information. This would  allow AOC to pursue another, more rigorous and confidential method for  collecting worker safety data. AOC also made clarifying and technical  comments that we addressed in the text of this report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees.

To ensure that the strategic plan is current and useful  to the agency, AOC leadership should review and update the strategic plan  regularly and incorporate any changes that may result from AOC\u2019s review  of options and strategies for delivering its services and operations.  Furthermore, AOC should continue to work with congressional  stakeholders to develop and report key measures that are meaningful to  AOC\u2019s customers and reflect the agency\u2019s day-to-day operations.

Although hiring the contractor is an important  step, AOC\u2019s current effort to develop a strategic workforce plan will not  include an assessment of how best to deliver (either through outsourcing  or in-house resources) the services it provides.

However, AOC\u2019s senior management needs to continue supporting the full  implementation of key financial management and accountability efforts  that are critical to AOC\u2019s operations. Although AOC senior management  has helped to strengthen AOC\u2019s financial accountability by regularly  monitoring and overseeing AOC\u2019s efforts to prepare agencywide  comprehensive financial statements and have them audited, it needs to  increase focus and attention on completing the development and  implementation of the other three key financial management improvement  initiatives\u2014an internal control framework, a cost accounting system, and  a management reporting system. According to AOC officials, current  staffing shortages and funding constraints will likely limit meaningful near- term progress on these efforts.

AOC also  has established the management structure for developing, implementing,  and maintaining an enterprise architecture (EA) and has made significant  progress toward planning for and implementing the practices in our  architecture management guide. These practices include ensuring that  adequate resources (i.e., funding, people, tools, and technology) are  devoted to the program and developing a written policy for architecture  development and maintenance.", "In addition, AOC has made progress toward addressing our remaining  recommendations. For example, it has developed a policy that describes  the procedures, practices, and guidelines that govern the management of  its IT systems and the required processes that are to be followed when  acquiring and developing these systems. Furthermore, AOC has taken  steps toward establishing and implementing an effective information  security program by designating a chief information security officer with  the authority to implement an agencywide security program and by  certifying and accrediting its general support systems and major  applications. However, more work remains to fully implement our  recommendations. For example, AOC has yet to prioritize all IT  investments, develop an IT investment portfolio, and oversee each  investment using a portfolio approach to ensure that AOC achieves its  cost, benefit, schedule, and risk expectations. Until AOC completes these  activities, it cannot ensure that the investments address not only the  agency\u2019s mission and strategic goals and objectives, but also the impact of  the investments on each other. Moreover, AOC has yet to fully implement  key architecture practices, such as defining \u201cas is\u201d and \u201cto be\u201d architecture  descriptions in terms of performance. Without instituting these practices,  AOC risks limiting the quality and utility of its architecture and may not  realize the benefits of a well-managed architecture program. In addition,  the agency has not consistently demonstrated quality assurance,  configuration management, and contract tracking and oversight processes.  Until AOC consistently demonstrates these key acquisition processes, the  agency runs the risk of projects not performing as intended, being  delivered late, and not meeting estimated cost and schedule goals. AOC  also has yet to develop system contingency plans for all of its systems and  implement a security process to monitor and evaluate policy and control  effectiveness.

AOC also has clarified the roles and responsibilities  for staff in the Project Management Division and updated guidance for  managing projects. In addition, AOC is continuing efforts on longer-term  initiatives to improve project management and accountability. For  example, AOC plans to modify its project information system to assist  managers in more proactively managing projects, provide needed cost and  schedule data on projects, and track reasons for changes across all  projects. AOC has developed the requirements for this system, which  includes the automation of AOC\u2019s quarterly construction projects progress  report, and plans to begin modifications with available in-house resources  in fiscal year 2007.

However, the new cost accounting system\u2014a system that will be phased  in over several years\u2014must be completed before AOC can implement all  of the recommendations intended to improve accountability for the  Construction Division. Furthermore, AOC is reviewing its methods for  estimating Construction Division project costs, including contingency  costs and allocations for construction management and administration, to  improve the accuracy of project cost estimates.

As implementation  continues, AOC plans to continue analyzing its workload data to develop  metrics for the new system. Additionally, AOC officials plan to benchmark  AOC\u2019s performance measures with peer organizations. These officials said  that they used the International Facilities Management Association\u2019s key  performance indicators to develop performance measures for AOC\u2019s  revised strategic plan.
