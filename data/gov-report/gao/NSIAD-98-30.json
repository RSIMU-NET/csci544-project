U.S. interagency 1996 estimates indicated that of the 608 metric tons of cocaine destined for the United States, 234 metric tons flowed through the Eastern Pacific, 264 metric tons flowed through the Western Caribbean, and 110 metric tons flowed through the Eastern Caribbean. About 52 percent of the U.S.-bound cocaine transited Mexico and Central America.

According to interagency estimates, Mexico and Central America received 59 percent of the cocaine during this period. The Caribbean countries accounted for 30 percent of the flow, and 11 percent was shipped directly to the United States from source countries. Also, U.S. law enforcement agencies noted some changes in trafficking patterns in and around Puerto Rico. They attributed this change to increased U.S. law enforcement efforts in this area.", "According to the DEA Caribbean Field Division, the Eastern Caribbean corridor remains a prolific drug-trafficking route. South American traffickers continue to use the Bahamas and islands in the Leeward, Windward, and Hispaniola routes as staging and transshipment areas. Cocaine loads originate in Colombia or Venezuela and are moved by air or large motherships to smaller vessels in the Eastern Caribbean. The many unguarded airstrips and coastlines of the Caribbean islands make it easy for traffickers to refuel or store cocaine for further shipment directly to the United States or through Puerto Rico.", "According to DEA, Puerto Rico is a popular gateway to the United States and a principal staging destination for South American drug traffickers. Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Jamaica have also experienced increased drug-smuggling activity. For example, DEA has indicated that, in the past, the role of Dominicans in the drug business was limited to \u201cpick-up crews\u201d and couriers who assisted Puerto Rican smugglers. Today, Dominicans have sophisticated drug-smuggling operations and use advanced security systems and telephone communications to move and sell cocaine in the Caribbean and the United States, according to DEA. Even with heightened enforcement, offshore airdrops along the southern coast of the Dominican Republic and in the Mona Passage between Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic continue. In addition, the Department of State has reported that thousands of kilograms of cocaine have been smuggled over the border from Haiti into the Dominican Republic, whose army has had little success in stopping the flow of drugs.", "Although the Eastern Caribbean remains a major route for illegal drug trafficking, the larger quantities of cocaine pass through Mexico via the Eastern Pacific and Western Caribbean corridors. U.S. interagency estimates show that, in 1996, 314 metric tons of cocaine reached Mexico for eventual movement to the United States through the Eastern Pacific and Western Caribbean channels. Of this amount, about 70 percent was shipped through the Eastern Pacific. Multiton shipments of cocaine depart Colombia, Panama, or Ecuador predominantly by noncommercial maritime means and travel north via the Pacific Ocean.

The \u201cgo-fast\u201d boats are difficult to detect and interdict because they are small and capable of speeds that enable them to successfully evade law enforcement pursuits, according to the U.S. Coast Guard. The boats are between 25 and 45 feet in length, can routinely carry up to a ton of cocaine per trip, travel predominantly by night, and have refueling capability to complete cocaine runs in one day. In the first quarter of 1997, 38 of the 69 known maritime events, or 55 percent, in the transit zone involved \u201cgo-fast\u201d boats. As illustrated in figure 2, maritime smuggling events by \u201cgo-fast\u201d boats is on an upward trend.", "DEA has also reported an increase in the use of canoes by Jamaican smugglers and \u201cyolas\u201d by Dominican smugglers. The yola is an open vessel with twin motors for propulsion and the ability to refuel rapidly. DEA reported that Bahamian and Jamaican transportation groups use yolas to smuggle cocaine loads into the Bahamas from either airdrops or boat-to-boat transfers off the coast of Jamaica. These groups then use the territorial waters of Cuba to shield their movements for eventual unloading to pleasure craft, which can easily blend in with inter-island boat traffic. A U.S. Customs Service official told us that \u201cgo-fast,\u201d recreational, and commercial fishing vessels move rapidly from the Bahamas to smuggle drugs into Florida.", "In the Eastern Pacific, cocaine traffickers use large fishing vessels that have been retrofitted with hidden compartments and have been known to carry as much as 11 metric tons of cocaine. The largest amount of cocaine is smuggled through the Eastern Pacific, and the vast majority is delivered into Mexico, where it continues northbound over land.

In recognition of this need, the Department of State provided about $7 million for training 6,700 persons throughout the world in fiscal  year 1996. Other U.S. agencies also have funded and conducted training for some host nations. In addition, at the Barbados Summit, the United States committed to continuing to provide technical assistance in such areas as law enforcement, judicial systems, antimoney laundering, and other counterdrug activities. To further assist in implementation of U.S. commitments, the Director of ONDCP issued budget guidance that tasks departments and agencies to implement commitments made at the summit.", "In March 1997, the Department of State reported corruption-related problems in various transit zone countries, including Antigua, Aruba, Belize, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, St. Kitts, St. Vincent, and others. Once the influence of drug trafficking becomes entrenched, corruption inevitably follows and democratic government may be placed in jeopardy. Even in countries where the political will to support antidrug activities exists, corruption can hinder counterdrug efforts.

In 1996, cocaine seizures in most Caribbean countries were much lower than 15 percent. In Jamaica, for example, the seizure rate was only 1.2 percent, while in Haiti it was 4.5 percent; the Dominican Republic, 3.6 percent; and Mexico, 7 percent.

DEA officials noted that the wholesale price, considered a better indicator, doubled in San Juan, Puerto Rico, from April to late May 1997. As of September, prices had declined but were still higher than in April.", "Seizures of cocaine during the first year of Operation Gateway increased by about 30 percent in comparison to seizures before the start of the operation. In the year prior to the operation, seizures were about 11 metric tons while seizures during the first year of the operation were about 14 metric tons. Actual fiscal year 1996 funding for Operation Gateway was $2.4 million, and planned funding for fiscal year 1997 was $30.1 million. In its One-Year Report on the Operation (covering the period ending February 28, 1997), the U.S. Customs Service noted a number of problems, including duplication and confusion in the procurement of equipment and services, a lack of public affairs coordination with other agencies, and lengthy delays in filling numerous authorized staff positions. The U.S. Customs Service noted, however, that some of these problems were not within its control and did not affect the overall performance of Operation Gateway.", "The first 3 months of the U.S. Coast Guard\u2019s Operation Frontier Shield began with an initial \u201csurge\u201d of activity. Subsequently, operations were somewhat reduced but remained higher than before the operation began. According to the U.S. Coast Guard, shipdays and flight hours devoted to counterdrug missions increased to support the surge operation. During the first 10 months of the operation, cocaine seizures totaled 10.7 metric tons, an increase of 5.8 metric tons over the prior comparable 10-month period. In July 1997, the Secretary of Transportation reported that \u201cassessments show a decisive shift in drug traffic away from the Frontier Shield area of operation\u201d and that \u201cdrug runners are being forced to move their operations elsewhere.\u201d U.S. Coast Guard officials stated that the shift in trafficking routes was anticipated in planning Operation Frontier Shield and that additional efforts are planned or underway to address this trafficking shift."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Intelligence Sharing Issues", "paragraphs": ["In 1996, we reported that intelligence sharing was a contentious issue among various collectors and users of such data, including most federal counterdrug agencies. Since then, some initiatives to improve intelligence sharing have begun. For example, an interagency review, initiated by ONDCP on September 18, 1997, is underway to look at the national drug intelligence architecture. The review will assess the drug intelligence missions, functions, and resources of the major federal counterdrug agencies. According to ONDCP, coordination among the intelligence program and between intelligence producers and consumers will be a focus of the review.", "In addition, the Federal Bureau of Investigation noted that other law enforcement agencies with jurisdiction in the Caribbean are developing a regional plan for law enforcement in the Caribbean that calls for expanding intelligence coordination. A draft of the regional plan is scheduled to be completed by January 1998.", "JIATF-East officials told us that there are inherent barriers in sharing information between and among federal counternarcotics agencies.Specifically, law enforcement agencies are mainly focused on individuals and drug organizations in the context of building cases for arresting and prosecuting criminals. In contrast, JIATF-East is focused on tactical operations and obtaining information in support of detecting and monitoring suspects and making successful and timely law enforcement interdictions.", "DEA officials referred to their comments in our prior report that noted that there are limitations on what intelligence DEA can legally provide other federal agencies developed from grand jury information, wiretaps, and court sealing orders. They also noted that some intelligence is not released to protect sources and the integrity of ongoing investigations. DEA officials also stated that the El Paso Intelligence Center provides JIATF-East with the necessary information to track suspect aircraft and vessels until the respective U.S. and foreign authorities can take appropriate law enforcement action."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "U.S. Caribbean Counterdrug Action Plan Not Fully Developed", "paragraphs": ["In April 1996, we recommended that the Director of ONDCP develop a Caribbean plan of action that should at a minimum determine resources and staffing needed and delineate a comprehensive strategy to improve host nation capabilities. In response to our recommendation, ONDCP told us it provided a framework for addressing strategic objectives in the transit zone in its classified annex to the National Drug Control Strategy issued in February 1997. ONDCP officials noted that the operational tasks for implementing the framework, including targets for measuring performance in that area, are still under development. They also noted that implementation of the strategy for the transit zone is the responsibility of other federal agencies such as the U.S. Coast Guard, DEA, and DOD.", "According to ONDCP, its performance measurement system will provide policymakers with new insights about which programs are effective and which are not. The system is intended to help guide adjustments to the National Drug Control Strategy as conditions change, expectations are met, or failure is noted. The goals of the strategy form the foundation of a 10-year plan, supported by a 5-year budget. Each goal is to be related to a measurable objective, further defined by an outcome that the objective is to produce by 2002. Each outcome is to be quantified by performance targets that identify measurable attainments. ONDCP has instructed agencies to develop plans, without being constrained by budget considerations, identifying how they will make meaningful progress toward achieving a drug control mission. As of October 1, 1997, the performance measurement system remains incomplete because proposed measurable targets, the core of ONDCP\u2019s system, are still under review. Since these measurable targets have not yet been developed, agencies cannot be held accountable for their performance."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Organizational Issues", "paragraphs": ["In April 1994, ONDCP and the participating agencies approved the National Interdiction Command and Control Plan. This plan provided for establishing three geographically oriented counterdrug joint interagency task forces. The task forces were to be led and staffed by DOD, the U.S. Customs Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard. A major premise of the plan was that the full-time personnel assigned to the task forces would become stakeholders in their operations. It was anticipated that this would ensure close planning and operational coordination; the availability of federal assets; and a seamless handoff of suspected air, sea, or land targets. Other agencies that either had an interest in or were affected by the operation were to provide liaison personnel. Nevertheless, participating agencies have not provided the required staffing to JIATF-East and, thus, it has been dominated by DOD personnel and has not achieved the intended interagency composition. According to ONDCP, the revised September 17, 1997, plan places the task forces more under the control of DOD sponsorship rather than remaining an interagency center.", "As of July 1997, little has changed since our last report; many of the key civilian positions have remained unfilled. Thus, JIATF-East is still predominately staffed by DOD personnel and has not achieved the interagency mix initially hoped for at its creation. Of the 184 authorized permanent positions, 132 were DOD, 21 were U.S. Coast Guard, and 31 were other agencies\u2019 position. Thirty-seven authorized positions were vacant. DOD had filled 117 of its 132 authorized positions and the U.S. Coast Guard had filled 17 of 21. However, various other agencies had assigned staff to only 13 of 31 authorized positions, compared to having assigned staff to  11 of 27 authorized positions as of November 1995. The U.S. Customs Service, for example, had filled only 7 of 22 positions, compared to 1995 when it had filled 8 positions; the 1 authorized Department of State position has never been filled.

Also, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Customs Service have launched two surge operations in and around Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands that have resulted in seizing additional quantities of cocaine and changing drug-trafficking patterns. By identifying the anticipated benefits from providing additional resources to the transit zone, JIATF-East has taken an important step in adding accountability to the drug-interdiction effort. Notwithstanding these efforts, the overall amount of cocaine seized in the transit zone has not disrupted the flow and availability of cocaine in the United States.", "We believe ONDCP has not fully addressed our prior recommendation to develop a regional plan. We continue to believe that a transit zone plan that includes quantitative goals and objectives that will allow policymakers to determine resource requirements and to evaluate the potential benefits of regional interdiction efforts is essential. An effective transit zone operation is an integral part of the U.S. strategy to limit drug availability in the United States. But it alone will not be the solution to the drug problem. A regional plan should be a subset to ONDCP\u2019s overall strategy. Therefore, it is important that ONDCP develop a comprehensive plan that provides a blueprint for how efforts in the transit zone countries are going to reduce the flow of cocaine.

ONDCP recognized that current assets in the transit zone are inadequate to accomplish the strategy and identified recent initiatives to implement the strategy. These initiatives included a Caribbean action plan, a short-term enhancement to transit zone interdiction, a 5-year asset plan for the transit zone, intelligence sharing efforts, and a deterrence study. These initiatives are expected to provide linkage between planning, development of performance measures, and assets required to implement the strategy. However, ONDCP did not provide time frames for completing these initiatives.", "We obtained oral comments on a draft of this report from the Department of State, DOD, DEA, the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs Service, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
