Agency- provided retirement education is generally the primary source of the information that employees need to plan for these issues before they retire.  Retirement benefits represent an important portion of total federal compensation and employees often cite these benefits as a primary reason for staying in government service.  Thus, agencies also benefit from sponsoring retirement education programs, which allow them to capitalize on their comparative advantage in competitive labor markets as well as invest in the government's human capital.", "The Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System Act of 1986 (FERSA) granted the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and federal agencies broad authority to design and implement retirement education programs for employees covered by the two largest federal civilian retirement programs\u2014the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) and the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System (FERS).  Specifically, FERSA authorizes agencies to designate retirement counselors who are responsible for providing employees with benefits information, and mandates that OPM establish a training program for these agency retirement counselors.FERSA also created the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board to administer the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP).  The Thrift Board provides training and information on TSP to agency personnel offices and groups of employees upon agency request; however, it is not responsible for providing retirement education for the federal workforce.", "CSRS, which was established in 1920, currently includes an annuity and TSP.  CSRS\u2019 annuity predates the Social Security system by several years. When the Social Security system was established, Congress decided that employees in CSRS would not be covered by Social Security through their federal employment.  Starting in 1987, employees covered by CSRS may also contribute up to 5 percent of their salary to TSP; however, they receive no government contributions.  CSRS was closed to new entrants after December 31, 1983, and, according to OPM actuaries, is estimated to end in about 2070, when all covered employees and survivor annuitants are expected to have died.", "FERS was implemented in 1987 and generally covers those employees who first entered federal service after 1983.  The primary impetus for the new program was the Social Security amendments of 1983, which required all federal employees hired after December 1983 to be covered by Social Security.  Thus, FERS includes Social Security, an annuity that is smaller than that provided under CSRS, and TSP.  The government automatically contributes an amount equal to 1 percent of salary to TSP accounts for all employees covered by FERS, regardless of whether those employees make any voluntary contributions to their accounts.  In addition, employees covered by FERS may contribute up to 10 percent of their salaries, up to the current legal maximum of $10,000, and receive government matching contributions on the first 5 percent.", "At the beginning of fiscal year 1998, CSRS and FERS covered about 2.7 million employees, or 93 percent of the civilian workforce, including U.S. Postal Service employees.  As of fiscal year 1995, FERS covered slightly more federal employees than CSRS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In response to the request of Senator Carl Levin, in his former capacity as Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee on International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services, Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, our objectives in preparing this report were to provide information on what OPM officials and retirement experts view as the recommended content, presentation formats, and timing of retirement education programs and", "OPM\u2019s and agencies\u2019 retirement education roles, responsibilities, and practices in the context of these recommendations.", "Because of time and resource constraints, we limited the scope of our review to the education provided to employees covered by CSRS and FERS, who represent the majority of federal civilian employees.", "To identify OPM\u2019s views on the recommended content, presentation formats, and timing of a retirement education program, we interviewed OPM officials and reviewed OPM\u2019s published guidance on how agencies are to design and implement federal retirement education programs.  To identify retirement experts\u2019 views, we interviewed a judgmentally selected group of 15 retirement experts using a structured interview that had been pretested and provided in advance.  The experts also responded to a close- ended questionnaire.  We used a summary of the experts\u2019 responses as our principal basis for identifying the recommended content, presentation formats, and timing of a retirement education program.  In summarizing the experts\u2019 responses to the close-ended questionnaire, we used a super- majority criterion (i.e., agreement on the part of 10 or more experts) to classify a list of 21 potential topics, or content, as (1) essential; (2) recommended, but not essential; or (3) optional.  Specifically, we identified a topic as \u201cessential\u201d when 10 or more experts responded that the topic was essential.  If the topic did not meet the criterion for being essential, we identified it as \u201crecommended\u201d when 10 or more experts responded that the topic was either essential or recommended.  Similarly, if the topic did not meet the criteria for being essential or recommended, we identified it as \u201coptional\u201d when 10 or more experts responded that the topic was essential, recommended, or optional.", "To identify candidates who had the appropriate background and experience to serve as retirement experts, we solicited and received nominations from the following eight associations and organizations that specialize in retirement and/or financial planning issues:  the American Association of Retired Persons, the Employee Benefit Research Institute, the International Association for Financial Planning, the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans, the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, the National Conference of Public Employee Retirement Systems, the Pension Research Council, and the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.", "For each candidate nominated, we reviewed the biographical information provided by the nominating organization(s).  We selected 16 individuals who each had extensive experience with pension or retirement issues and specific expertise on retirement education.  The selected experts collectively represented a breadth of professional backgrounds in both the public and private sectors, including academics, unions, financial planning, pension administration, advocacy, financial services, and human resource management consulting.  We invited each of the selected candidates to share their views on retirement education, and 15 agreed to do so. Appendix I provides more information on the experts with whom we consulted.", "To identify OPM\u2019s and agencies\u2019 retirement education roles, responsibilities, and practices in the context of the recommendations on program content, presentation formats, and timing, we interviewed officials representing OPM, the Thrift Board, and 12 randomly selected federal agencies that had 1,000 or more employees and whose headquarters were located within the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. We used a structured interview that had been pretested and provided to the 12 agencies in advance.  We also analyzed documents and data provided by the agencies\u2019 officials.  We used a summary of the agencies\u2019 practices as the principal basis for comparing the actual practices of the 12 agencies with the recommended content, presentation formats, and timing identified by OPM officials and the experts.  We did not independently verify agencies\u2019 responses regarding the specifics of the content, performance formats, and timing of their retirement education programs. Thus, although we used terms such as \u201cprovided\u201d and \u201csponsored\u201d to describe agencies\u2019 practices, we were generally referring to what agencies told us they did.", "To develop the sample of agencies for our review, we used information from the spring 1997 Central Personnel Data File (CPDF)\u2014an automated information system that contains individual records for most federal civilian employees and is maintained by OPM.  The list of agencies used in selecting this sample included 68 organizations that represented a total of 1,682,391 federal employees who were covered by CSRS or FERS.  We stratified the 68 organizations according to size (1,000 to 9,999 employees; 10,000 to 99,999 employees; and 100,000 or more employees) and randomly selected 4 agencies from each group.  For the Department of Defense (DOD), our list of 68 organizations included only the Departments of the Army, Air Force, and Navy.", "On this basis, we selected the following 12 agencies for review: the International Trade Administration and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) of the Department of Commerce; the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior; the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), U.S. Customs Service, and U.S. Secret Service of the Department of the Treasury; the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the National Institutes of Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS); the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD); the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA); and the Departments of the Navy and Air Force of DOD.  The sampled agencies employed about 42 percent of the employees covered by CSRS or FERS from our sampling universe.", "As agreed, our analysis did not address the effectiveness of OPM's administration of federal retirement education, agencies\u2019 programs, or the retirement education that individual federal employees might receive. Also, we did not attempt to independently validate the information provided to us by OPM and the 12 agencies.  Although we audited the reliability of CPDF data for fiscal year 1996 and found it sufficiently reliable for most governmentwide analyses, we did not update that audit.However, we are not aware of changes in the way that agencies submit or OPM processes CPDF data that would materially affect the reliability of the data.  We used a random sample to have an objective, unbiased sample. However, as a consequence of our small sample size, the retirement education practices described in this report are not generalizable to all agencies that employ 1,000 or more employees and have headquarters in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.

The agencies also provided information on how employees could provide these benefits for their survivors if they so choose.", "Agencies\u2019 officials told us that they also included information in their retirement education programs on how Social Security is integrated with federal annuity and TSP benefits.  This information is particularly important to those employees covered by FERS, because Social Security represents one of the three components of their retirement plan.  Agencies likewise provided information on Social Security to employees covered by CSRS, because a portion of these employees may also be eligible for full or reduced Social Security benefits on the basis of their spouses\u2019 work histories, work they did before joining the federal workforce, and/or work they plan on doing following their retirement from federal service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Retirement Education Programs Included a Variety of Presentation Formats", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with OPM and expert recommendations, the officials representing the agencies we surveyed told us that they used a variety of presentation formats in their retirement education programs, including written publications, interactive formats such as seminars and one-on-one counseling, and electronic formats such as Web sites and automated systems.", "Agencies we surveyed used numerous publications, such as brochures and newsletters, to provide detailed information to employees on their retirement plans and issues to consider in planning for their retirement. Although a few agencies generated some of their own customized materials, the agencies we surveyed generally used written materials made available by OPM or the Thrift Board.  According to the agencies\u2019 officials, these materials were convenient and high-quality sources of information for employees.  Agencies also used Web sites to make many of these publications more readily available.", "Agencies\u2019 officials said that they supplemented their written reference materials by using more interactive formats, in particular, seminars and one-on-one counseling.  Agencies offered seminars to expose employees to information on a wide variety of topics, which employees could then individually pursue in more detail as needed or desired. When employees requested one-on-one counseling sessions, agencies provided employees with highly customized retirement planning information, including benefits decisions that needed to be made at retirement and the specific steps needed to apply for retirement.  To ensure that employees received expert information on a wide range of topics, agencies we surveyed generally contracted out for seminars.  However, the agencies did not contract for one-on-one counseling.  Agencies\u2019 officials told us that their staff were best able to provide counseling to employees, because they had access to employees\u2019 personnel records, were well-informed on the inherent complexities of the federal retirement programs, and were in a position to take personnel actions on behalf of employees, if necessary.", "Agencies we surveyed also used a variety of electronic media to further distribute retirement education to their employees, including videos, telephone response systems, Intranet/Internet Web sites, and computer simulation models.  For example, several agencies\u2019 officials told us that they videotaped their retirement seminars (1) to make these sessions available to geographically dispersed employees who might otherwise be unable to attend and/or (2) allow employees to view the seminars multiple times at their convenience.  The agencies also commonly provided retirement information using Web sites that included links to other federal sources of retirement information, including OPM, the Thrift Board, and the Social Security Administration.", "The Air Force, IRS, and HUD also used a centralized and automated call center to provide retirement information to geographically dispersed employees in a manner that they considered to be consistent and cost efficient.  Each of these agencies used an interactive system that allowed employees to access a variety of personnel information, including retirement education, by calling a toll-free telephone number.  In addition to prerecorded information, employees could reach a benefits counselor who had access to individual personnel records and could provide answers to specific questions.  Agencies\u2019 officials said that these centralized and more automated systems were developed in response to downsizing that resulted in the agencies having fewer personnel staff available to provide retirement education to employees.  Other agencies, including HRSA and VHA, told us that they were considering adopting a similar approach.  OPM officials believed that such systems are likely to become more common across the federal service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Made Retirement Education Available Throughout Employees\u2019 Careers", "paragraphs": ["Consistent with OPM and expert recommendations, the agencies we surveyed made retirement education available continuously throughout employees\u2019 careers.  Agencies\u2019 officials told us that they view retirement education as a shared responsibility between the agencies and employees. That is, agencies were responsible for making such information readily available; however, employees were also responsible for determining when and how often to seek this information.", "Agencies\u2019 officials told us that they provided brochures and other written retirement education materials to employees early in their careers as a part of new employee orientations.  Written materials were then provided periodically on an as-needed basis.  For example, agencies\u2019 officials told us that they provided their employees with revised publications during the 1998 CSRS to FERS open season.  The agencies\u2019 officials also told us that their payroll offices mail annual benefits statements to employees that contain information on benefits earned to-date and their projected future value at the time of retirement eligibility.  Agencies also provided publications on a self-serve basis using centralized benefits resource centers/libraries and/or posting these documents on their retirement Web sites.", "All of the agencies we surveyed sponsored retirement seminars that were designed for employees who were approximately within 5 years of being eligible to retire.  However, several agencies\u2019 officials told us that employees who had more than 5 years before becoming eligible were also allowed to attend these seminars, space permitting.  Moreover, five of the surveyed agencies (i.e., the Air Force, NOAA, the Bureau of Reclamation, HRSA, and Customs) sponsored separate midcareer seminars that were designed to address topics most relevant to employees with approximately 15 years of federal service.  These agencies\u2019 officials told us that they provided these additional seminars because they felt that attending a seminar for the first time at 5 years before retirement might be too late to allow some employees to fully prepare for retirement when they first become eligible.  Thus, many federal employees had the option of taking more than one retirement seminar during their careers.", "Finally, the agencies we surveyed made retirement education available to employees throughout their careers using a variety of other formats, including the Web sites and automated information systems we previously discussed.  All of the agencies we surveyed told us that one-on-one counseling was available to employees at any point in their careers upon request."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["OPM, Commerce, DOD, and IRS agreed with our findings.  In its written comments (see app. II), OPM said it believes very strongly that employees should receive information about their benefits regularly throughout their careers so that retirement is simply the culmination of a long planning process.  OPM also commented that it is very important to make information available in a variety of ways to meet the varying needs of both employing agencies and their employees.  IRS said that it is currently delivering preretirement and ongoing education programs that generally include the information recommended by OPM and our retirement experts, and that it may consider whether improvements could be made to the education provided to employees early in their careers."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
