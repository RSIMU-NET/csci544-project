Civilian senior leaders--some of whom occupy positions that might be cut during DOD's latest attempts to reduce overhead costs--are among those who manage DOD's civilians. In 2007, Congress mandated that DOD assess requirements for its civilian senior leader workforce in light of recent trends. DOD reported its recent reply to this requirement in its 2009 update to the Civilian Human Capital Strategic Plan, which used information from a 2008 baseline review to validate its senior leader requirements. GAO was asked to review DOD's approach for (1) assessing its civilian senior leader workforce requirements, (2) identifying and communicating the need for additional senior leaders, and (3) developing and managing this workforce. GAO reviewed submissions for DOD's baseline review and requests for additional senior leaders, including DOD's intelligence agencies. GAO also interviewed DOD and Office of Personnel Management officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD conducted a baseline review to assess and validate its civilian senior leader requirements but did not document its analysis or summarize the results of the review. Standards for internal controls call for significant events to be documented and summarized to facilitate tracing transactions and related information. Specifically, in April 2008, DOD issued guidance for components outside its intelligence community to conduct a baseline review of its senior leader needs. While DOD reported to Congress that this was a rigorous analysis, GAO found that some of the components' information was incomplete and DOD was unable to provide documentation of an analysis summarizing its results. DOD officials said that they did not summarize the analysis because the information was only intended to support a number of human capital management efforts, including a report to Congress on DOD's Civilian Human Capital Plan. Similarly, DOD's intelligence community, in 2007, issued guidance for assessing its workforce needs but also did not summarize its analysis. DOD officials stated that while the analysis was not summarized, it resulted in a number of key decisions--for example, a reduction in one agency's senior leader needs. However, without documenting and summarizing information in an analysis that could be traced to component submissions, DOD may not be able to provide Congress and stakeholders in its chain of command insight into how it assessed its senior leader needs. While most DOD entities used a consistent, clearly documented approach to identify and communicate needs for additional civilian senior leaders, the defense intelligence community's approach lacked similar consistency. Outside of the defense intelligence community, DOD used common criteria to identify its most urgent needs for additional senior leaders and communicated those needs and justifications through the chain of command. The defense intelligence community, however, assessed its needs for additional personnel using various sets of criteria and communicated those needs as one aggregate number without providing specific justifications to stakeholders and, ultimately, to Congress. GAO's prior work has shown that establishing common criteria and clear communication strategies strengthens agency processes. Without such criteria and a well-defined set of communication expectations, requests to increase senior leaders in the defense intelligence community will not appear to be supported and justified. DOD's approach for managing and developing civilian leaders includes policies and an executive education program but has some limitations. For example, the executive education program--which, according to program officials, costs an average of $6.5 million per year--was created to address problems of a predecessor program, including the lack of a plan for how graduates would be used in the future. The new program, however, does not have clearly defined metrics to measure the progress or success of the program. GAO previously reported that high-performing organizations recognize the importance of measuring how programs meet their goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) document analyses and clarify assessment criteria for determining certain senior leader requirements and (2) create clearly defined metrics for its executive education program. DOD generally concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) is facing the complex challenges of  supporting heavy involvement in overseas military operations, rebuilding  readiness, and preparing forces to counter emerging threats. To help  military forces meet these challenges, DOD is turning increasingly to the  almost 718,000 personnel in its civilian workforce. This civilian workforce  performs a wide variety of duties and responsibilities, including mission- essential combat support functions such as logistics support and  maintenance that traditionally have been performed by the uniformed  military. Further demonstrating its reliance on civilians, DOD has  increased the size of its Civilian Expeditionary Workforce, which provides  deployable civilian experts to Afghanistan, Iraq, and other theaters of  operation, and plans to convert 33,400 contractor positions to federal  civilian positions through 2015. To manage the civilian workforce DOD  depends on, among others, civilian senior leaders and must ensure that  they are sufficient in number and properly developed to help meet the  department\u2019s complex challenges. Managing these senior civilian leaders  effectively is imperative, especially in light of DOD\u2019s recently announced  plans to eliminate unnecessary overhead costs, including plans to possibly  reduce the number of civilian senior leader positions by 150 over the next  2 years.", "DOD relies on five types of civilian senior leaders to operate and oversee  nearly every activity in the department. These are DOD\u2019s: (1) Senior  Executive Service, (2) Senior Level, (3) Senior Technical, (4) Defense  Intelligence Senior Executive Service, and (5) Defense Intelligence Senior  Level workforces. Most of the department relies on the Senior Executive  Service workforce to fill positions with managerial, supervisory, or policy  advisory responsibilities; on the Senior Level workforce to fill positions  that require less than 25 percent of the time to be spent on supervisory or  related managerial responsibilities; and on the Senior Technical workforce  to perform high-level research and development in the physical, biological,  medical, and engineering science fields. DOD\u2019s intelligence community  has its own specialized civilian senior leader workforce, as a result of  authority provided by Congress in fiscal year 1997 to create a separate  senior leadership system. Specifically, the defense intelligence community  relies on the Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service workforce to  fill positions with managerial, supervisory, or policy advisory  responsibilities and on the Defense Intelligence Senior Level workforce to  fill positions that require that less than 25 percent of the time to be spent  on managerial or supervisory responsibilities.", "Recently, Congress, GAO, and DOD have addressed the management of  DOD\u2019s civilian senior leader workforces. For example, in 2009, Congress  passed legislation requiring DOD to, among other things, conduct  assessments of its need for civilian senior leader workforces and establish  a program to recruit and develop civilian employees as civilian senior  leaders. Additionally, we reported on DOD\u2019s Civilian Human Capital  Strategic Plan and identified limitations in the department\u2019s efforts to meet  previous legislative requirements related to planning for the civilian senior  leader workforces. These requirements included assessing gaps in DOD\u2019s  civilian senior leader workforces and identifying specific strategies for  developing and training civilian senior leaders. Further, in our 2008 report  on diversity in the federal government\u2019s Senior Executive Service, we  noted that if a significant number of retirement-eligible Senior Executive  Service personnel left government service, a loss of leadership continuity,  institutional knowledge, and expertise could be experienced across the  government. According to more recent data reported in DOD\u2019s 2009  Civilian Human Capital Strategic Plan, 82 percent of DOD\u2019s Senior  Executive Service workforce, 93 percent of DOD\u2019s Senior Level workforce,  and 88 percent of DOD\u2019s Senior Technical workforce will be eligible to  retire within the next 10 years. DOD also recognized, in this 2009 update,  the importance of having civilian leaders who are trained and capable of  serving in positions that cut across all of DOD. Finally, in its 2010  Quadrennial Defense Review, DOD acknowledged that it is working to  synchronize civilian and military leadership training with the goal of  ensuring common professional training and education between Senior  Executive Service personnel and flag officers and increasing joint  capability for deployment of Senior Executive Service personnel.", "You asked us to review DOD\u2019s management of the civilian senior leader  workforces. In response to that request, we evaluated DOD\u2019s approach for  (1) assessing civilian senior leader workforce requirements, (2) identifying  and communicating the need for additional civilian senior leaders, and (3)  developing and managing civilian senior leaders capable of leading DOD\u2019s  civilian workforce.", "For our first objective, we analyzed documents related to DOD\u2019s efforts to  assess existing civilian senior leader workforce requirements. These  documents include an April 2008 memorandum from the Office of the  Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness providing  instructions for a baseline review of DOD\u2019s Senior Executive Service,  Senior Level, and Senior Technical workforce requirements. Because  DOD\u2019s intelligence community has its own specialized civilian senior  leader workforces, we also reviewed instructions the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Intelligence issued in 2007 for assessing Defense  Intelligence Senior Executive Service and Defense Intelligence Senior  Level workforce requirements. We reviewed the 2008 memorandum and  the 2007 instructions and compared them to guidance for classifying  civilian senior leader positions issued by the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), which includes the Guide to Senior Executive  Service Qualifications and the Senior Executive Service Desk Guide.  We reviewed all of the available information the components provided for  DOD\u2019s 2008 baseline review, per DOD officials. This included information  from a total of 21 DOD components. However, during the final months of  our review, DOD was unable to provide information obtained from its 2007  review of the defense intelligence community\u2019s senior leader  requirements; as a result, we used testimonial information provided by  responsible officials in the defense intelligence community. We also  interviewed DOD officials responsible for conducting the 2008 baseline  review. We considered the information obtained from DOD in the context  of internal controls associated with conducting such assessments\u2014 specifically, requirements for documenting and summarizing the  information gathered. While we reviewed the department\u2019s efforts to  assess the civilian senior leader workforce requirements, we did not  validate DOD\u2019s requirements for the existing civilian senior leader  workforces.", "For our second objective, we reviewed the process DOD used to identify  and communicate needs in the request for additional civilian senior leader  positions submitted for OPM\u2019s 2010-11 Biennial Review of Executive  Resource Allocations, which is the process OPM uses to allocate civilian  senior leader workforces to federal agencies across the government. We  also reviewed the efforts by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness to assess DOD\u2019s requirements for additional  civilian senior leaders and develop and submit requests in accordance  with OPM\u2019s guidance. Because DOD\u2019s intelligence community has its own  specialized civilian senior leader workforce, we also reviewed the  approach that the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence  took from fiscal years 2001 to 2010 to identify and communicate the needs  for additional Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service personnel  and reviewed efforts to develop legislative proposals for submission to  Congress regarding those needs. Further, we examined documents  related to adjustments in the size of the Defense Intelligence Senior Level  workforce, which is established by the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence. Additionally, we reviewed DOD policies and workforce  planning documents related to strategies for addressing gaps in its civilian  senior leader workforces. We also examined and reported on OPM  workforce data. We assessed the reliability of the data and believe they are  sufficiently reliable to present allocation and workforce figures.", "For our third objective, we reviewed applicable documents, including  those related to DOD\u2019s emphasis on the importance of enterprisewide  perspectives for its civilian Senior Executive Service. We also reviewed  our prior work regarding performance measures and federal government  human capital planning efforts. We interviewed officials in the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Army,  the Navy, the Air Force, the Office of the Director of Administration and  Management, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Civilian  Personnel Management Service. In addition, we interviewed officials in the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness  Office of Leader Development Programs Branch, which, according to DOD  officials, is the office responsible for developing and administering the  Defense Senior Leader Development Program\u2014DOD\u2019s main program for  developing the civilian senior leader workforces. We reviewed documents  related to that program and also interviewed officials at OPM who are  responsible for leadership development and for the certification of Senior  Executive Service candidate programs. Further details on our scope and  methodology can be found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 through  November 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the  audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness is the adviser to the Secretary of Defense for total force  management, and as such the Under Secretary, among other things, is  responsible for identifying civilian requirements for Senior Executive  Service, Senior Level, and Senior Technical positions. Specifically, the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness  directed the last review of DOD\u2019s Senior Executive Service, Senior Level,  and Senior Technical positions in a 2008 baseline review. The Principal  Deputy directed that the review be completed in 60 days and stated that  the results would be used to respond to reporting requirements in the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. This act  required DOD to, among other things, assess its requirements for senior  management, functional, and technical personnel (including scientists and  engineers) in light of recent trends. Similarly, the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Intelligence exercises overall supervision and  policy oversight for human capital within the defense intelligence  community. In 2007, this office sent DOD\u2019s intelligence community  guidance for a review of Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service  and Defense Intelligence Senior Level civilian leader workforce  requirements. This review, according to the guidance, was intended to  spur an examination and validation of senior civilian requirements,  provide DOD management with evidence that resources were being used  wisely, and provide an explanation of what resources the intelligence  community required and why, so that officials could make budget  allocations decisions and defend those requirements before Congress. The  intelligence community had 120 days to conduct its review. Recently,  however, a September 3, 2010, memorandum directed the department to  perform a similar study of these positions to support efficiency initiatives  that are expected to result in a reduction of at least 150 civilian senior  leader positions.", "In addition to the above, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness oversees the process for identifying the need for  additional Senior Executive Service, Senior Level, and Senior Technical  personnel. When an entity in DOD identifies a need for an additional  Senior Executive Service, Senior Level, or Senior Technical allocation, the  need is sent to either an executive board or office that reviews the request.  Once the executive board or office has reviewed all requests, they are  forwarded to an approving official, typically the secretary of the service,  an under secretary, or someone in an equivalent position. Once the list is  approved, it is sent to the Civilian Personnel Management Service within  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness,  which aggregates, levels, and forwards the list to the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness who reviews and approves the list  before it is sent to OPM. OPM, in consultation with the Office of  Management and Budget, assigns Senior Executive Service, Senior Level,  and Senior Technical allocations every 2 years to DOD and all other  federal agencies. During the biennial review, OPM establishes guidelines  for executive branch agencies to follow when requesting additional Senior  Executive Service, Senior Level, and Senior Technical allocations;  evaluates agency requests for new allocations; and authorizes increases in  the number of allocations for each agency. OPM conducted the most  recent biennial review in 2009 for allocations to be granted for fiscal years  2010 through 2011. Figure 1 depicts DOD\u2019s process for identifying and  communicating the need for additional DOD Senior Executive Service,  Senior Level, and Senior Technical requirements for the services, the  Office of the Secretary of Defense, the defense agencies, the Joint Staff,  and DOD\u2019s combatant commands.", "Because the maximum number of Defense Intelligence Senior Executive  Service allocations is established by law, DOD uses a separate process to  communicate the need for additional Defense Intelligence Senior  Executive Service personnel. On the basis of requirements identified by  the military services\u2019 intelligence branches and the defense intelligence  community agencies, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence develops legislative proposals to request increases in the  number of Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service allocations. The  office provides the legislative proposal to the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, which submits the  proposal to DOD\u2019s General Counsel for inclusion in DOD\u2019s general  legislative proposal program. The Secretary of Defense was provided with  authority to create a separate Defense Intelligence Senior Executive  Service workforce by section 1632 of the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 1997. The legislation also stipulates that the Defense  Intelligence Senior Executive Service workforce is equivalent to the Senior  Executive Service workforce. A DOD draft directive\u2014which department  officials said was in use at the time of our review\u2014states that individuals  serving in Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service positions have  the same administrative requirements and responsibilities as federal  Senior Executive Service personnel. Figure 2 depicts DOD\u2019s process to  support requests to Congress for additional Defense Intelligence Senior  Executive Service allocations.", "As of September 2009, DOD was authorized 2,934 allocations for its  civilian senior leader workforces, representing less than 1 percent of  DOD\u2019s total civilian workforce.

However, our  review of the documents provided showed that at least 6 of the 21 defense  components did not submit complete responses. For example, the Office  of the Joint Chiefs of Staff provided information on its civilian senior  leader positions, such as the responsibility of the positions; the operation,  project, or program managed; and whether the positions are responsible  for managing resources. However, the Joint Staff did not provide required  narrative responses, such as position validation and missions and  strategies supported. Additionally, according to a DOD official the Army  and the Air Force did not submit information as specified in the 2008  memorandum for the baseline review.

Table 3 describes the different  sets of criteria used by the military service intelligence branches and  agencies in the defense intelligence community to ensure any additional  Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service allocations meet statutory  minimum requirement to be classified above the General Schedule 15  level.", "Once their needs were identified, each of the military service intelligence  branches and defense intelligence community agencies reported them to  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence. According to  defense intelligence officials, these reports had detailed justification  statements that included a description of each position, its reporting  relationships, the number of people directly supervised, the position\u2019s total  supervisory span of control, and a justification/mission-critical  requirement statement. Unlike the process that the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness used\u2014which required  various DOD entities to provide justifications for additional positions\u2014the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence communicated its  request for positions to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness only as an aggregate number without  justifications. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness, in turn, as part of DOD\u2019s general legislative program,  communicated that aggregated number to Congress. According to officials  in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, they had  detailed information on the justifications for each position needed;  however, these officials stated that by communicating the need for  additional allocations only as an aggregate number, they did not provide  sufficient details about their need for additional Defense Intelligence  Senior Executive Service allocations.", "When the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997  authorized the Secretary of Defense to create the Defense Intelligence  Senior Executive Service, it set the maximum number of allocations at  492. The current maximum is 594. As stated above, to increase the  statutory cap on the number of allocations for that workforce, the defense  intelligence community must submit legislative proposals. According to  DOD directives, the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence is  responsible for the overall supervision and policy oversight for human  capital within the defense intelligence community. Typically, the Office of  the Under Secretary for Intelligence communicates its legislative  proposals to Office of the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness,  which then approves and submits them for potential inclusion in DOD\u2019s  general legislative program.", "While we have not validated DOD\u2019s Defense Intelligence Senior Executive  Service requirements, we note that during the past 10 years, Congress has  enacted increases to the maximum number of Defense Intelligence Senior  Executive Service positions only three times\u2014in the Floyd D. Spence  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, and the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006. In January 2006, for example,  section 1125 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2006 increased the maximum number of positions by 50 while DOD\u2019s  legislative proposal requested an increase of 150.", "Our prior work has shown that when agencies are working toward a  common goal establishing common criteria and communication strategies  strengthens agency processes by providing stakeholders with shared  expectations to guide stakeholder efforts. Because the intelligence  agencies submit a single request for additional allocations, the individual  components should use common criteria for making that request.  Regarding the absence of common criteria used to identify the need for  additional positions, in its 2008 update to DOD\u2019s Civilian Human Capital  Strategic Plan, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence stated that while the criteria being used by the components  are not uniform, the situation should be resolved by development of  unifying guidance in a dedicated volume of the Defense Civilian  Intelligence Personnel System\u2014DOD\u2019s overarching evaluation and  performance-based pay framework for agencies and departments in the  intelligence community. However, according to DOD officials, this  guidance is not yet final, and the defense intelligence community  continues to operate without common criteria. Without the use of  common criteria and without better communication of its justifications for  additional positions, requests to Congress to increase the number of  Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service personnel will not appear to  be well-supported."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Uses Several Strategies to Address Gaps between the Additional Civilian Senior Leader Allocations It Requests and Those It Receives", "paragraphs": ["DOD relies on several different human capital strategies when it  experiences gaps in its Senior Executive Service, Senior Level, or Senior  Technical workforces. It may request additional civilian senior leader  workforce allocations from OPM, reassign existing civilian senior leader  allocations, temporarily fill civilian senior leader positions with other DOD  personnel when an allocation is not available for the position, float  unused allocations to fill pressing needs throughout the department, and  maintain reserve allocations.", "Requesting additional civilian senior leader workforce allocations from  OPM: DOD may request additional civilian senior leader workforce  allocations at any point between OPM\u2019s Biennial Review of Executive  Resource Allocations cycles.", "Reassignment of civilian senior leader workforce existing allocations:  Entities within DOD can reassign existing allocations to manage their  civilian senior leader workforces to meet changing mission requirements  and accommodate organizational structures.", "Temporary filling of civilian senior leader positions with other  personnel: According to DOD officials, when DOD does not have an  allocation for a civilian senior leader position, it sometimes assigns a  military officer or a high-level, civilian non-senior leader employee to  temporarily fill the position until an allocation for the position is made  available. In some cases, DOD has assigned a civilian senior leader to  temporarily fill an unallocated position.", "Floating allocations: OPM requires currently filled Senior Executive  Service, Senior Level, and Senior Technical positions to be covered by the  allocations OPM grants to federal agencies. However, agencies often have  positions that are vacant for reasons such as an employee\u2019s retirement.   Accordingly, agencies have some flexibility to move their vacant  allocations in the periods between OPM\u2019s biennial reviews to meet their  civilian senior leader requirements. The Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness, for example, established policy to  address certain pressing needs by \u201cfloating\u201d or borrowing unused  allocations from vacant positions to cover those needs. While this is based  on the assumption that some vacant positions will always exist, the policy  states that the office tracks, on a monthly basis, the number of float  allocations to ensure that DOD does not exceed its total OPM-authorized  senior leader allocations. The policy provides specific allocations for each  component and identified purpose, but in the aggregate DOD\u2019s  components are authorized 10 percent (138) of their Senior Executive  Service, 6 percent (2) of their Senior Level, and 6 percent (8) of their  Senior Technical allocations for use as floats.", "Reserve allocations: The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness maintains 25 of the 138 Senior Executive Service  floating allocations as a reserve, which it can distribute among DOD\u2019s  components to meet emergent needs when other strategies are fully  utilized or otherwise unsuitable.", "When the defense intelligence community has experienced gaps in its  Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service workforce, it has used three  strategies to fill them. First, the defense intelligence community has  reassigned existing allocations to positions of greater need. For example,  in 2007, during a restructuring of the defense intelligence community, the  Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence transferred Defense  Intelligence Senior Executive Service allocations within the community to  meet new civilian senior leader requirements. Second, the defense  intelligence community also has filled Defense Intelligence Senior  Executive Service positions temporarily with Defense Intelligence Senior  Level personnel when it lacked allocations. Third, officials explained that,  at times, they will divide up the responsibilities of a senior leader position  and distribute those responsibilities among other existing positions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Approach for Developing and Managing Civilian Senior Executive Service Personnel Includes Policies and an Executive Education Program, Though Limitations Exist", "paragraphs": ["In addition to identifying the need for civilian senior leaders, DOD has  recently established overarching policy for managing and developing its  Senior Executive Service workforce. In a directive issued in 2007 and an  instruction issued in 2009, DOD noted the importance of focusing on  talent management and on the exposure to enterprisewide perspectives, as  part of its process, to prepare civilian personnel to move into leadership  positions. The directive identified as a goal the development of a Senior  Executive Service workforce that is fully integrated with other  components of DOD\u2019s executive leadership, DOD\u2019s general and flag  officers, and political leaders. The instruction defines enterprisewide  perspective as a broad point of view of DOD\u2019s missions and an  understanding of individual or organizational responsibilities in relation to  larger DOD strategic priorities, which is shaped by experience and  education and characterized by a strategic, top-level focus on broad  requirements, joint experiences, fusion of information, collaboration, and  vertical and horizontal integration of information. More specifically, the  instruction indicates that enterprisewide perspective is a core competency  for civilian leaders, and includes, among other things, understanding  DOD\u2019s roles and responsibilities and comprehending the relationships  between all elements of power.", "In addition, chief among DOD\u2019s efforts to develop its Senior Executive  Service workforce is DOD\u2019s new Defense Senior Leader Development  Program, which DOD established in 2008 and, according to program  officials, costs an average of $6.5 million per fiscal year. According to DOD  documents, the Defense Senior Leader Development Program is designed  to span 2 years and support the enterprisewide effort to foster interagency  cooperation and information sharing by providing opportunities for  participants to understand and experience, firsthand, the issues and  challenges facing leaders across DOD and the broader national security  arena. Specifically, career civil service personnel at General Schedule 14  and General Schedule 15 and equivalent grades are eligible to apply for  this program and, if accepted, attend seminars and a professional service  school and enhance their individual development through substantive  enterprise-spanning activities. Furthermore, individuals who are already  members of DOD\u2019s Senior Executive Service workforce provide feedback  to participants on strengths and competency gaps. Beyond the Defense  Senior Leader Development Program, DOD and the services have other  programs focused on developing career civilian and current Senior  Executive Service personnel. Appendix V provides examples and  descriptions of some of these programs.", "DOD created the Defense Senior Leader Development Program to address  problems identified in the Defense Leadership and Management  Program\u2014a predecessor program that was discontinued at the end of  fiscal year 2010. In 2009, we reported on problems that DOD had identified  with that program. In our report we noted that DOD concluded that the  program lacked involvement by senior leadership in the career path or  progression of potential Senior Executive Service candidates, lacked  interaction and camaraderie among participants, and had no plan for how  participants would be used after graduation. The House Armed Services  Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation has also  expressed concerns about the quality of the graduates produced under this  program. Table 4 lists some key differences between the Defense  Leadership and Management Program and the Defense Senior Leader  Development Program.", "DOD has replaced the Defense Leadership and Management Program with  the Defense Senior Leader Development Program and has emphasized a  focus on developing future leaders with an enterprisewide perspective.  However, according to DOD officials, the department does not have  specific metrics for the program. Specifically, at the time of our review,  there were metrics in place to evaluate applicants prior to their being  admitted to the program and metrics in place to track their success while  enrolled; however, there were no metrics to measure the success of the  overall program. Without clearly defined program metrics to measure  them DOD cannot determine whether the implementation of the Defense  Senior Leader Development Program has been an improvement over the  Defense Leadership and Management Program. Our prior work on  effective strategic workforce planning has shown that high-performing  organizations recognize the importance of measuring both the outcomes  of human capital strategies as well as the ways that these outcomes have  helped the organizations accomplish their missions and programmatic  goals.", "Furthermore, program officials said that the department had not sought  OPM certification for its new Defense Senior Leader Development  Program, but is researching the requirements for OPM certification. While  agencies are not required to operate an OPM-certified Senior Executive  Service Candidate Development Program, federal regulations state that  agencies that wish to operate OPM-certified Senior Executive Service  Candidate Development Programs must obtain approval from OPM and  provide training that addresses OPM\u2019s Executive Core Qualifications.  These core qualifications include leading change, leading people, being  results driven, possessing business acumen, and building coalitions. Were  DOD to obtain OPM certification for the Defense Senior Leader  Development Program, OPM would be required by law to monitor the  implementation of the program and, when appropriate, take necessary  corrective action to bring the program into compliance with OPM- prescribed criteria. DOD would also be required by regulation, to  recruit candidates for the program from (at a minimum) all groups of  qualified individuals within the civil service.

Similarly, DOD  must be able to communicate those needs in a manner that facilitates  informed decision making. Where DOD has not been able to do this, key  decision makers have been left with insufficient information to determine  if requests for additional senior leaders are warranted. If decision makers  do not have a clear understanding of the highest-priority needs across the  department, they risk having a civilian senior leader workforce  inappropriately sized to meet DOD\u2019s missions.

Page 17, the third sentence of the last paragraph:  For the reasons described in item 1 above,  this sentence should be changed to read, \u201cWe could not verify these statements, however,  because DoD officials were not able to respond to requests we made in the last month of our  review to see or receive copies of supporting documentation to show analysis that could be  readily traced back to component submissions.\u201d   3.  Page 17, the fourth sentence of the last paragraph:  This sentence assumes that certain  information does not exist and declares DoD unable to provide clear insight into  requirements for senior civilian senior leaders.  The sentence should be replaced with \u201cDoD\u2019s  ability to provide Congress and other stakeholders clear insight and visibility into the defense  intelligence community\u2019s validation of requirements for its civilian senior leader workforces  can be improved by clearly documented analysis that can be traced back to component  submissions.\u201d 4.  Page 21, the last sentence:  This sentence implies the military service intelligence branches  and agencies in the defense intelligence community use position grading standards as the sole  measure of the need for new Defense Intelligence Senior Executive Service (DISES)  allocations.  That is not accurate and contradicts the last sentence of the first paragraph on  page 23, which states OUSD(I) officials confirmed they had \u201cdetailed information on the  justifications for each position needed.\u201d  As discussed with GAO, in addition to validating  that any additional DISES requirements involve responsibilities that exceed the GS-15 level  as required by statute, we also required the Defense intelligence components to submit a  description and detailed justification statements for each new DISES requirement, covering  the same kinds of criteria as for the Department\u2019s SES positions, to include reporting  relationships, the number of people directly supervised, the position\u2019s total supervisory span  of control, and a justification/mission-critical requirement statement.  While we did not  employ the weighted evaluation methodology used by the Civilian Personnel Management  Service to assess the relative importance of the new SES, SL and ST requirements, our  Human Capital Management staff carefully reviewed any new requirements against the  statutory criteria using the detailed justification information submitted by the Components.   The last half of the sentence should be changed to read \u201cto ensure any additional Defense  Intelligence Senior Executive Service allocations meet the statutory minimum requirement to  be classified above the GS-15 level.\u201d   5.  Page 22, description of Table 3:  For the reasons stated above, change the phrase \u201cEvaluate  the Need for\u201d to \u201cValidate\u201d and add after the word \u201cAllocations\u201d the phrase \u201cMeet the  Statutory Requirement to Be Classified Above GS-15.\u201d  6.  Page 22, the paragraph after Table 3:   For the reasons described in item 4 above, make the  following changes:  Add the following phrase at the end of the first sentence: \u201cwith detailed  justification statements that included a description of each position, its reporting  relationships, the number of people directly supervised, the position\u2019s total supervisory span  of control, and a justification/mission-critical requirement statement.\u201d  Change the remainder  of the paragraph to read as follows:  \u201cThe Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence evaluated the detailed justification statements submitted by the Defense  intelligence components, but did not employ the weighted evaluation methodology used for  DOD\u2019s Senior Executive Service requirements.  The Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Intelligence communicated its request for positions to the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel as an aggregate number without submitting the detailed  justifications or its analysis.  The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness, in turn, as part of DOD\u2019s general legislative program, communicated that  aggregated number to Congress.  By submitting solely the aggregate number, DOD may not  have provided sufficient details about the need for additional Defense Intelligence Senior  Executive Service allocations.\u201d 7.  Page 24, third, fourth, and fifth sentences :  Because these sentences refers to the criteria in  Table 3 (discussed in item 4 and 5 above), add the words \u201cposition grading\u201d after the word  \u201ccommon\u201d in each of these sentences.  8.  Page 28, line 7 from top of page:  Change the word \"levels\" to \"and equivalent grades\" and  change footnote 46 to read \"Equivalent grades include those under the National Security  Personnel System and other authorized pay plans.\" Rationale: This language is adapted from  DoDI 1430.16, enclosure 3, page 11, paragraph 2c(1), the official description of eligibility  for DSLDP. 9.

Comments 1 through 21  are on specific sections in the Department of Defense (DOD) letter dated  October 25, 2010, and received by GAO on October 28, 2010. The specific  section is entitled, \u201cDepartment of Defense Comments to the  Recommendations.\u201d Comments 22 through 30 are on specific sections in  the DOD letter dated October 23, 2010, and received by GAO on October 28,  2010. The specific section is entitled \u201cDepartment of Defense Intelligence  Comments to the Recommendations.\u201d  1.  DOD asserted that our statement that \u201csome of the components\u2019  information was incomplete\u201d was not accurate. DOD further  asserted that for its baseline review submission, certain DOD  components incorporated by reference their biennial allocation  activities they undertook in support of their requests for additional  civilian senior leaders, rather than duplicate those efforts. The  department further asserts that a copy of the component\u2019s work in  this regard was provided to the GAO review team. We disagree. As  we stated in our report, a DOD official told us that the Army and the  Air Force chose to use assessments of their Senior Executive  Service, Senior Level, and Senior Technical workforces that had  been conducted in response to OPM\u2019s 2008-2009 Biennial Review of  Executive Resources Allocations. However, this DOD official was  unable to provide us with copies of the assessments completed by  the Army and Air Force. Contrary to DOD\u2019s comments, information  the Army and Air Force submitted for the 2008-2009 biennial review  was not provided to us. As stated in our Scope and Methodology,  the only information we obtained related to the Biennial Review of  Executive Resources Allocations was for 2010-2011.  2.  DOD comments stated that the April 9, 2008, memorandum had a  number of objectives for the baseline review. We agree.  Nonetheless, we were unable to include all of those objectives on  the Highlights page, which is a summary of our report. However, we  have since added some of the objectives in other sections of our  report.  3.  DOD noted that the April 2008 memorandum results would be used  to respond to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2007. This information was referenced in the Background  section of our report.  4.  DOD explained that, given the multipronged application of results  of the baseline review and intent to inform a variety of strategic  human capital management initiatives, the department stands by its  decision to rely on the component submissions as source material,  reference material, or both, rather than summarizing and reporting  the analysis for any single initiative. In light of the internal control  standards, which we reference in our report, we continue to believe  that the department should have documented and summarized its  analysis.  5.  DOD stated that the second to the last sentence on the Highlights  page should be revised to read that the new program \u201chas  developed and is continuing to refine\u201d metrics and that the new  program \u201cdid not have\u201d clearly defined metrics to measure progress  or success. However, during the course of our review, DOD neither  discussed metrics to measure the success of the program nor  provided of such metrics.  We therefore made no change to our  report.  6.  DOD stated that the reference to the \u201cSenior Executive Service\u201d on  the first page of the report should be changed to say \u201creduce by 150  the number of senior civilian executive positions.\u201d We have revised  our report accordingly.  7.  DOD noted that \u201cSenior Technical\u201d should be  \u201cScientific/Professional.\u201d We clarified our use in a footnote in our  report.  8.  DOD\u2019s commented that \u201cUnder Secretary\u201d should be \u201cPrincipal  Secretary.\u201d We revised our report accordingly.  9.  DOD\u2019s commented that pages 7 and 8 of our draft report described  some but not all aspects of the allocation process and failed to  mention the criteria provided to the components and upon which  biennial allocation requests are justified. We disagree. DOD\u2019s  comments focused on the background of the report. The criteria are  clearly specified in the report on pages 17, 18, and 19.  10.  DOD\u2019s commented that pages 7 and 8 of the draft report did not  mention the analysis and evaluation aspect of the leveling process  utilized by the Civilian Personnel Management Service is omitted  and the ability of any component to submit an out-of-cycle request  for allocations outside of the biennial process is not mentioned. We  disagree. Information on out-of-cycle request is clearly specified on page 25 and in appendix IV of our report. Per comment 11, we have  changed \u201cprioritized\u201d to \u201cleveling.\u201d  11.  DOD\u2019s comments stated that the department objects to the  characterization of the leveling process as \u201creprioritizes\u201d and DOD  evaluates all component biennial allocation submissions as a whole  against the criteria developed for the biennial process. The  department notes that the leveling process is used to ensure that all  components have applied the criteria in a consistent manner and  prioritized their positions in a similar manner. We have revised our  report accordingly.  12.  DOD\u2019s commented that the decision to submit the combatant  commands\u2019 request for the fiscal year 2010-2011 biennial allocation  process was a reflection of an increased demand on those  organizations and was never intended to be a standard approach for  future combatant command allocation requests. We have revised  our report accordingly.  13.  DOD\u2019s comments asserted that the department\u2019s full 2008-2009  biennial allocation request was made available to GAO. We  disagree. While DOD provided 2010-2011 biennial review  documents, we were not provided, even though we asked, any  documents related to DOD\u2019s 2008-2009 biennial review submissions.  As indicated in our Scope and Methodology, we reviewed  documents related solely to DOD\u2019s 2010-2011 biennial review  submissions.  14.  DOD commented that our report stated that the department\u2019s  vacancy rate is about 20 percent but notes that the current Senior  Executive Service vacancy rate is approximately 8 percent and the  department\u2019s average over the last 3 years is 12 to 14 percent. We  have revised our report accordingly.  15.  DOD asked that we change \u201clevels\u201d to \u201cand equivalent grades\u201d and  the corresponding footnote to read \u201cEquivalent grades include  those under the National Security Personnel System and other  authorized pay plans.\u201d We revised our report accordingly.  16.  DOD asked that we change \u201cshadow professionals\u201d to \u201cenhance  their individual development through substantive enterprise- spanning experiential activity and feedback on strengths and  competency gaps from Talent Development Executives.\u201d We  paraphrased this passage in our report.  17.  DOD asked that we \u201cwill be\u201d to \u201cwas\u201d in recognition that fiscal year  2010 has ended. We revised our report accordingly.  18.  DOD asked that GAO make several minor word changes to table 4.", "We have revised our report accordingly.  19.  DOD commented that the statement \u201cthe department does not have  clearly defined goals and specific metrics for the program and has  not sought OPM certification\u201d should be changed. The department  stated that its goals and purposes were identified in DODI 1430.16,  enclosure 3, page 11, paragraph 2b. We have made modifications to  our report to reflect this information. Further, the department  acknowledged, as we stated, that it has specific metrics in place to  evaluate applicants prior to their admission to its program as well  as metrics to track participants. The department also stated that  summative metrics were currently being refined and will be  implemented for each cohort after the first cohort has completed  the program in April, 2011. However, at the time of our review, DOD  did not have summative metrics that are associated with the  program and did not provide documentation or information on  these metrics. Furthermore, the department\u2019s comments noted that  as these metrics are implemented the results would provide a more  complete evaluation of the entire program. Accordingly, we made  no modifications to our report.  20.  DOD asked that we add the following to the end of the first  sentence on page 30: \u201c\u2026but is researching the requirements for  OPM certification.\u201d We revised our report accordingly.  21.  DOD asked us to make the following changes in our conclusion  paragraph: delete the phrase \u201cit has not yet identified program goals  and measures\u201d and add the phrase \u201cit continues to refine the  program metrics.\u201d We made some modifications in accordance with  our response in comment 20.  22.  DOD commented that the statement \u201cduring the course of our  review officials were unable to provide supporting information from  the defense intelligence components or analysis related to the 120- day review of intelligence senior civilian requirements\u201d did not  accurately portray the circumstances or timing of the GAO request.  The department stated that the request to see or receive copies of  such reporting information was made in late August nearly a year  after the announcement of the GAO review and 7 months after GAO  met on January 26, 2010, with Human Capital Management staff of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence and executive  resources officers from all of the defense intelligence components.  Accordingly, DOD asked that the statement be revised from \u201cduring  the course of our review\u201d to \u201cDOD officials were not able to  respond to requests made in the last month of our review to see or  receive copies of supporting documentation.\u201d We note, however,  that we requested the information in July 2010 and stated at our  entrance conference that the scope of our work may expand as we  obtained additional information. In fact, we obtained DOD\u2019s 2009  update to its Civilian Strategic Workforce Plan, which identified a  baseline review of DOD\u2019s civilian senior leader workforce and a  120-day review of the defense intelligence senior leader workforce  requirements\u2014both of which were key to this review. As a result,  the scope of our work was expanded in July 2010. We made some  revisions to clarify our report.  23.  DOD asked, in light of the changes related to comment 22, that the  third sentence of the last paragraph on page 17 be revised to \u201cWe  could not verify these statements, however, because DOD officials  were not able to respond to requests we made in the last month of  our review to see or receive copies of supporting documentation to  show analysis that could be readily traced back to component  submissions.\u201d In light of our response in comment 22 and the fact  that we included a statement that the department needed to clearly  document or summarize an analysis that could be readily traced  back to the component submissions, we determined that this  information would be stated twice in our report. As a result, we did  not make this latter revision.  24.  DOD stated that the fourth sentence of the last paragraph on page  17 assumes that certain information does not exist and declares  DOD unable to provide clear insight into requirements for senior  civilian senior leaders. The department asked that the sentence be  changed to \u201cDOD\u2019s ability to provide Congress and other  stakeholders clear insight and visibility into the defense intelligence  community\u2019s validation of requirements for its civilian senior leader  workforces can be improved by clearly documented analysis that  can be traced back to component submissions.\u201d We disagree with  the assumption that certain information does not exist, and we did  not add the phrase \u201cclearly documented analysis that can be traced  back to components submissions\u201d because it was already stated in a  prior sentence in our report and would therefore be duplicative.  Accordingly, we did not make this revision.  25.  DOD\u2019s comments stated that the last sentence on page 21 implies  that the military service intelligence branches and agencies in the  defense intelligence community use position grading standards as  the sole measure of the need for new Defense Intelligence Senior  Executive Service allocations. They further stated that this is not  accurate and asked us to change the last half of the sentence to  read: \u201c\u2026to ensure any additional Defense Intelligence Senior  Executive Service allocations meet the statutory minimum  requirement to be classified above the GS-15 level.\u201d We agree and  have changed the report accordingly.  26.  DOD stated that the description of table 3 on page 22 should change  the phrase \u201cEvaluate the Need for\u201d to \u201cValidate\u201d and add after the  word \u201cAllocations\u201d the phrase \u201cMeet the Statutory Requirement to  Be Classified Above GS-15.\u201d We agree and have changed the report  accordingly.  27.  DOD asked that the following changes be made to the paragraph  after table 3 on page 23: at the end of the first sentence, add \u201cwith  detailed justification statements that included a description of each  position, its reporting relationships, the number of people directly  supervised, the position\u2019s total supervisory span of control, and a  justification/mission-critical requirement statement.\u201d We agree and  have made changes to the report accordingly. The department also  asked that we change the remainder of the paragraph to read as  follows: \u201cThe Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence evaluated the detailed justification statements  submitted by the defense intelligence components, but did not  employ the weighted evaluation methodology used for DOD\u2019s  Senior Executive Service requirements. The Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Intelligence communicated its request for  positions to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness as an aggregate number without  submitting the detailed justifications or its analysis. The Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, in  turn, as part of DOD\u2019s general legislative program, communicated  that aggregated number to Congress. By submitting solely the  aggregate number, DOD may not have provided sufficient details  about the need for additional Defense Intelligence Senior Executive  Service allocations.\u201d We note that the only additional DOD text that  was not covered in our report was the phrase, \u201cthe weighted  evaluation methodology.\u201d The focus, however, of our paragraph  was the absence of detailed justifications and not the methodology.  Accordingly, we did not make this latter change.  28.  DOD asked that the third, fourth, and fifth sentences on page 24 be  changed because these sentences refer to the criteria in table 3  (discussed in comments 25 and 26 above) by adding the words  \u201cposition grading\u201d after the word \u201ccommon\u201d in each of these  sentences. We disagree. The text is referring to GAO\u2019s prior work  on human capital management and not specifically to the defense  intelligence community criteria.  29.  DOD asked that we change the word \u201clevels\u201d to \u201cand equivalent  grades\u201d and change footnote 46 to read \u201cEquivalent grades include  those under the National Security Personnel System and other  authorized pay plans.\u201d We agree and have changed our report  accordingly.  30.  DOD asked that in footnote 52 on page 28 we add the word  \u201cequivalent\u201d before the word \u201cemployees.\u201d We agree and have  changed the report accordingly."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, David Moser, Assistant Director;  Marion Gatling, Assistant Director; Alysia Darjean; Scott Doubleday; Mae  Jones; Brian Pegram; Steven Putansu; Amie Steele; and Michael Willems  made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Human Capital: Further Actions Needed to Enhance DOD\u2019s Civilian  Strategic Workforce Plan.
