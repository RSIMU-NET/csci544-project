In 2001, the U.S. Department of Education (Education) strongly encouraged states and school districts to notify parents of these changes, but according to Education, IDEA does not provide it with statutory authority to require this notification. According to GAO's review of information provided by private school choice programs, and as confirmed by program officials, in school year 2016-17, 83 percent of students enrolled in a program designed specifically for students with disabilities were in a program that provided either no information about changes in IDEA rights or provided information that Education confirmed contained inaccuracies about these changes. Officials from national stakeholder groups, private choice programs, and Education told GAO that some parents do not understand that certain key IDEA rights and protections\u2014such as discipline procedures and least restrictive environment requirements\u2014change when parents move their child from public to private school.

For example, some  families we interviewed said they were not aware that some of the  disability services and therapies provided at private schools came at  additional costs, because these services at public schools were provided  free of charge. Parents of children with physical disabilities said they were  surprised that some private schools, including schools for students with  disabilities, were not accessible for children with physical disabilities.", "Education officials told us that IDEA does not provide it with statutory  authority to require states and school districts to give parents notice that  IDEA rights and protections\u2014such as discipline procedures and least  restrictive environment requirements\u2014do not apply when a student with a  disability is moved from public to private school by a parent.

School choice places more responsibility and decision making  in the hands of parents, increasing the importance of high quality  information to help parents make informed decisions. As more than half of  the current private school choice programs are designed specifically for  students with disabilities, it is critical that parents have access to quality  information about changes in special education rights when they are  considering moving their child from public to private school. Although  Education has strongly recommended that states and districts notify  parents that IDEA rights change when they move their parentally placed  child from public to private school, in 2016-17, more than 80 percent of  students in private choice programs designed for students with disabilities  were enrolled in a program that either provided no information about  changes in IDEA rights or provided some inaccurate information about  these changes. Absent a requirement in IDEA that states notify parents of  such changes, states are unlikely to begin providing parents with  consistent and accurate information about changes that affect some of  our nation\u2019s most vulnerable children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider requiring that states notify parents/guardians of  changes in students\u2019 federal special education rights when a student with  a disability is moved from public to private school by their parent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Assistant Secretary for Special Education and Rehabilitative Services  should review information provided by states related to changes in federal  special education rights when a parent places a student with a disability in  a private school and work with states to correct inaccurate information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Education for review and comment.

Education also  provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "Education generally agreed with our recommendation to correct  inaccurate information provided by states related to changes in federal  special education rights when a parent places a student with a disability in  a private school. During the course of our review, Education confirmed  that five private school choice programs provided information that  included inaccurate statements about rights under IDEA. However,  Education stated that the department believes it is necessary to review  the full documents containing information provided by states, so that it  can determine the context in which the information was presented. We  will coordinate with Education as appropriate to facilitate such a review.  Reviewing and evaluating the information provided by states are  important first steps. However, we continue to believe that it is critical that  Education take the next step to work with states to correct any inaccurate  information about the rights of students with disabilities under IDEA being  provided by private school choice programs.", "Our draft report also included a recommendation for Education to require  states to notify parents/guardians of changes in students\u2019 federal special  education rights, including that key IDEA rights and protections do not  apply when a student with a disability is moved from public to private  school by their parent. In response, Education stated that IDEA does not  include statutory authority to require such notice, and suggested that the  department instead encourage states to notify parents. However, as  noted in our draft report, Education already strongly encourages states  and school districts to provide such notice.  Despite these efforts, we  found that in 2016-17, more than 80 percent of students nationwide who  are enrolled in private choice programs designed for students with  disabilities were enrolled in a program that either provided no information  about changes in IDEA rights, or provided some inaccurate information  about these changes. We therefore continue to believe that states should  be required, not merely encouraged, to notify parents/guardians about  key changes in federal special education rights when a parent moves a  child with a disability from public to private school. To this end, we have  converted our recommendation into a Matter for Congressional  Consideration to require such notice.", "In its comments, Education stated that the draft report title could be  improved. Because, in the final report, we issued the Matter for  Congressional Consideration discussed above, we have revised the title  to reflect that federal actions are needed to ensure parents are notified  about key changes in rights for students with disabilities.", "Education also inaccurately asserted that statements in the draft report  about the availability of information for parents are based on limited  reviews and small samples. As stated in the draft report, our findings  about the information for parents are derived from two sources: private  school choice programs and private schools participating in these  programs. Our findings about information provided by private school  choice programs are based on a comprehensive review of all 27 voucher  and educational savings account programs operating in the United States  during the 2016-17 school year. In addition, as noted in the draft report,  we verified these findings with officials from each of these programs.  Our  findings about information participating private schools make available  are based on a nationally representative, generalizable sample of  websites from 344 private schools participating in voucher programs  during the 2016-17school year. Finally, contrary to Education\u2019s  assessment that we based findings on a small sample of 17 families, as  stated in the draft report, our discussion groups and interviews with these  families provided illustrative examples of the types of information families  used when making private school choice decisions. These illustrative  examples were not the basis of any findings. We have clarified the  language in the final report as appropriate.", "Further, Education commented that the draft report did not address  factors that often lead parents to enroll their children in private schools in  state choice programs. These factors were not addressed because they  are beyond the scope of our objectives for this report. Finally, Education  noted that parents may believe that educational benefits or services  provided by private schools to their children with disabilities outweigh any  rights conferred by IDEA or services provided by public schools. This is  an important point, and this perspective was included in the draft  Education reviewed. For example, in the draft Education reviewed, we  stated that some families with whom we spoke were not concerned about  any changes in rights because they felt their students were not being well  served in public schools.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

To determine key program  characteristics, including accountability mechanisms these programs had  in place and the type of information they provided publicly, we reviewed  publically available documents from all 23 voucher programs and four  education savings account (ESA) programs, referred to in this report as  private school choice programs, operating in the United States as of  January 2017 to obtain information about program design and  requirements. We confirmed this information with each program. In  addition, we reviewed documents and conducted interviews with program  officials in six private school choice programs in five states (Arizona,  Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin). We also interviewed officials from  the U.S. Department of Education (Education) as well as national  stakeholder groups and private school choice researchers, which we  selected to obtain a range of perspectives on private school choice  initiatives. To describe information that participating private schools make  available to the public, we conducted a review of a nationally  representative stratified random sample of 344 private schools  participating in one of the voucher programs to identify information  provided on school websites to parents and the public. To obtain  information on how parents are informed about changes in their child\u2019s  rights under federal law, we reviewed Education guidance and policy  documents on the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and  parentally placed private school students. To provide examples of how  individual schools and programs make information available to the public  and families, we also visited and interviewed officials at two private school  choice programs, three private schools, and one school district in  Florida.

The list includes  mechanisms likely to be used by multiple programs and is not meant to  be exhaustive. We confirmed the appropriateness of our list of selected  mechanisms during subsequent interviews with private school choice  researchers and national stakeholder groups who confirmed that the  mechanisms were common elements in program statutes, and/or  standard mechanisms for establishing accountability in education.
