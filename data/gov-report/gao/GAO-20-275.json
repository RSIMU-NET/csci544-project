The insider threat\u2014in  which an aviation worker uses their access privileges and knowledge of  security procedures to exploit vulnerabilities of the civil aviation system  and potentially cause harm\u2014is one of TSA\u2019s most pressing concerns.  TSA has consistently identified the vulnerability of the aviation system to  the insider threat among its highest enterprise-level risks. Recent  incidents where aviation workers stole or damaged an aircraft or  smuggled illegal drugs, firearms, and cash have highlighted this threat.  For example, in July 2019, an aircraft mechanic was charged with willfully  attempting to damage an aircraft. Additionally, in August 2018, a ground  services agent commandeered a small aircraft, which subsequently  crashed. Insider threats may arise from a malicious intent to cause harm,  or may arise from workers assuming a negligent or ignorant approach to  security procedures and potential risks.

TSA administered its questionnaire to all  category X and category I airports and a stratified random sample of  category II, III, and IV airports as part of a TSA information circular.  Respondents replied to the questionnaire by submitting answers into an  electronic system. TSA then shared the exported database with GAO for  analysis. The questionnaire, which TSA had previously issued to airport  operators in 2016, asked compliance hubs (field offices) to provide a  snapshot-in-time of current airport operator and air carrier policies and  procedures related to the use of intelligence, aviation worker training  courses, control of credentials that allow access to security-restricted  areas, control of access to secured and sterile areas of the airport, and  aviation worker screening, among other topics.

For example, all airports  operating under complete security programs generally implement TSA- approved security programs that address the same requirements.  However, the details of these programs and their implementation can  differ widely based on the individual characteristics of the airport. For  example, methods that airport operators use to control access into  security-restricted areas vary because of differences in the design and  layout of individual airports, but all access controls must meet minimum  performance standards in accordance with TSA requirements. Airport  operators and air carriers may also choose to implement measures  beyond what is required by TSA, but they may choose not to pursue  incorporating these additional measures into their security programs,  because if incorporated into their security programs, TSA could then hold  the regulated entities accountable for implementing such additional  measures. By not incorporating the additional measures into their security  programs, airport operators and air carriers retain the flexibility to alter  such measures without TSA approval.", "The security measures that airport operators and air carriers implement  are generally carried out within, or to prevent access to, security- restricted areas of an airport or aircraft.

However, like the  larger commercial airports, security programs for category IV airports  must provide for adequate law enforcement support, and airport operators  at these airports may choose to establish security-restricted areas and  implement access control technologies or other measures at their  discretion.", "According to our analysis of TSA data collected in July through  September 2019 from a representative sample of airports, officials from  most category X, I, and II airports reported that they have systems that  use more than one technology to control access to sterile and secured  areas of the airport, as shown in figure 3. Among category III airports,  officials from 27 of 54 also reported using multiple technologies. Among  category IV airports, officials from 37 of 58 reported using some type of  access control technology, the most common being locks and keys.", "Technology at two category X airports we visited is used specifically to  prevent workers from \u201cpiggybacking,\u201d or attempting to enter security- restricted areas by following close behind another worker without swiping  a proximity card or entering a PIN for access. For example, one airport  has sensor towers at high-traffic doors from unsecured to secured areas  of the airport. The two towers\u2014one on each side of the door\u2014can detect  if more than one person crosses the threshold after only a single  proximity card swipe and PIN entry. According to airport officials, when  this happens, the nearby security cameras will pan toward the door so  that security officials who monitor the feeds can view the individuals at the  door and respond appropriately. Figure 4, below, shows this technology,  as well as the proximity card reader and PIN pad, a separate reader and  pad for elevator access, and signs describing security rules.", "At a second category X airport we visited, locking turnstiles are used to  prevent piggybacking. Each worker who wishes to go through the access  point must present their proximity badge and provide a fingerprint. Only  then will the locked turnstiles unlock to allow that worker through. The  turnstiles are on a timer, so if a worker does not go through within a set  time, they will have to repeat the process from the beginning. Additionally,  if a badge is presented more than one time within a specified time period,  an alarm is triggered in the Airport\u2019s Security Operations Center to alert  airport security staff of a potential piggybacking incident. Figure 5 shows  the card reader, fingerprint reader, and turnstile in use at one access  point. Behind the turnstile, a TSA agent conducting ATLAS  countermeasures waits for workers to come through."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Training", "paragraphs": ["In general, according to TSA requirements, individuals with unescorted  access to security-restricted areas of category X, I, II, and III airports must  be trained on, among other things, escort procedures and the display and  use of identification media.

As described above, these may be  incorporated into an individual air carrier\u2019s security program, but not  necessarily. Air carriers we spoke with have implemented a variety of  security measures. For example:  To prevent unauthorized access to secured areas included in their exclusive area agreement or within their operations area, all air carriers we spoke to said they secure their facilities by employing at least one form of access control technology. The majority of air carriers (five of six) reported that they secure most access points with  proximity card or fob readers, including one air carrier that reported it  secures its access doors using additional measures beyond a  proximity card swipe, requiring a PIN and a fingerprint as well. The  sixth air carrier we spoke to said workers access security-restricted  areas using keys or cipher combinations.", "Prospective air carrier employees may require access media credentials from the airport operator in addition to the air carrier. In some cases, the air carrier will accept the criminal history records check conducted by the airport operator to issue its own credentials, but officials from some air carriers we spoke to said they conduct more rigorous checks before issuing their air carrier credentials. For instance, one air carrier reported that it checks both the applicant\u2019s employment history in addition to their criminal history, and it uses an additional set of disqualifying criteria beyond the regulatory minimum to determine suitability for hire.", "Some air carriers choose to further enhance their insider threat mitigation  efforts. For example, one air carrier has a dedicated insider threat  program and, at 16 airports, it implemented a screening program of  workers and their belongings at dedicated checkpoints. Another air carrier  created a team to monitor the use of the Known Crewmember program, a  screening program that provides flight and cabin crews with expedited  screening that may include a dedicated screening lane. According to air  carrier officials, at its largest hub airport, the team reports on workers  from all air carriers who violate the program\u2019s rules to TSA.

However, according to TSA officials, TSA did not fully  implement this Action Plan, and TSA did not renew or revise the Action  Plan after 2016 due to the departure of the key sponsoring senior leader.  Further, TSA officials said that the Action Plan does not reflect all the  existing activities that TSA\u2019s Insider Threat Program currently  encompasses because the program has changed since 2014.", "TSA is aware of the importance of strategic planning and took steps to  strategically plan for other programmatic efforts at the agency. For  example, in 2019, TSA revised its National Strategy for Airport Perimeter  and Access Control Security. This strategy describes how TSA seeks to  secure the perimeter and control access to security-restricted areas of  U.S. commercial airports, which is one concern related to insider threats.  In 2018, TSA published its Administrator\u2019s Intent to outline how TSA  planned to execute its agency-wide strategy in the short term. The  Intent includes one strategic objective to modernize elements of TSA\u2019s  Insider Threat Program, such as vetting capabilities. Also in 2018, TSA  published the Cybersecurity Roadmap 2018, which details the agency\u2019s  efforts to protect its information technology infrastructure from adversaries  who might seek to cause harm. Each of these documents contains the  critical elements of strategic plans that are laid out by the Office of  Management and Budget, including strategic goals and objectives. These  strategic planning documents contain elements related to insider threats  and can be drawn upon to help develop a comprehensive strategic plan  that encompasses the myriad of activities across its many offices that  compose TSA\u2019s Insider Threat Program.", "In October 2018, TSA established the Insider Threat Executive Steering  Committee in an effort to establish consistent executive-level engagement  and support from the agency\u2019s senior management. As described above,  TSA\u2019s Insider Threat Program is carried out by multiple, distinct offices at  TSA, and TSA officials have indicated that the program could benefit from  a more cohesive approach and oversight. During the course of our  review, the Steering Committee approved the development of an Insider  Risk Roadmap (Roadmap). According to TSA officials, the Roadmap is  under development as of January 2020, and when completed, is to  describe the future of insider risk mitigation for TSA. TSA officials were  uncertain, however, of when the Roadmap would be completed and  implemented. Given that TSA did not fully implement its 2014-2016  Insider Threat Action Plan, and it was never renewed or revised, it is  important that TSA remain committed to developing and implementing the  Roadmap and, as it moves forward in drafting the Roadmap, ensuring  that it contains the critical elements of a strategic plan, including strategic  goals and objectives.", "Federal internal control standards establish that management should  define the entity\u2019s objectives clearly and in alignment with the entity\u2019s  mission and strategic plan. Objectives should specifically identify what is  to be achieved, how, by whom, and in what time frame, and should be  defined in measurable terms so that performance toward achieving such  objectives can be assessed consistently. More specifically, the Office of  Management and Budget clarifies that a strategic goal articulates clearly  what the agency wants to achieve to advance its mission, while strategic  objectives reflect the outcome or impact the agency is trying to achieve  and should facilitate prioritization and assessment for planning,  management, reporting, and evaluation. For example, mission-focused  strategic objectives express specifically the path an agency plans to  follow to achieve or make progress on a single strategic goal.", "Having a strategic plan for its Insider Threat Program would better  position TSA to ensure it is effectively coordinating across its multiple  offices and leveraging each office\u2019s resources to mitigate insider threats,  a threat which has consistently been identified as the second-highest  enterprise level risk.

According to the Framework, program senior officials  should use metrics to represent progress and better articulate the central  role of its insider threat program in achieving the department or agency\u2019s  strategic objectives. The Office of Management and Budget specifies that  performance goals are statements of the desired performance target to  be accomplished within a certain timeframe, and a suite of performance  goals should be used to assess progress toward achieving each strategic  objective. Federal standards for internal control also state that entities  should use performance goals to evaluate their performance in achieving  their strategic objectives.", "Some TSA offices have developed indicators for measuring  characteristics of their insider threat activities, but these do not exhibit the  characteristics of performance goals as defined by the Office of  Management and Budget.

Further, in its May 2019 report to the Administrator, ASAC recommended  that TSA develop measures that assess the performance of its insider  threat efforts. For example, ASAC recommended that TSA commission a  comprehensive federally-funded research and development center to  assist TSA in evaluating the performance of random or unpredictable  aviation worker screening methods to mitigate insider threats. The report  indicated that establishing measures of effectiveness and evaluating  performance on such measures is \u201cvital to proactive and effective insider  threat management.\u201d TSA officials said that the planned Insider Risk  Roadmap may include performance goals for the Insider Threat Program,  in addition to strategic goals and objectives.

As a result, TSA would be able to reduce the likelihood of expending  resources on efforts that are not meeting the program\u2019s stated mission.  Focusing on the intended results of TSA\u2019s insider threat efforts can  promote strategic and disciplined management decisions that are more  likely to be effective because managers are better able to target areas  most in need of improvement and to select appropriate levels of  investment. TSA could determine the success of its strategies, adjust its  approach when necessary, and remain focused on results. Further,  agency accountability can be enhanced when both agency management  and external stakeholders\u2014such as Congress\u2014can assess an agency\u2019s  progress toward meeting its strategic goals.

In the last ten years, TSA and aviation  stakeholders have faced a consistent threat posed by insiders who used  their access privileges and knowledge to commit criminal acts, such as  drug smuggling, gun smuggling, theft, and attempted suicide bombing.  Having an effective Insider Threat Program is critical to TSA\u2019s ability to  mitigate the risk of insiders causing harm to the civil aviation system.  Since establishing its Insider Threat Program in 2013, TSA has taken  steps to strengthen its efforts to combat the insider threat such as by  implementing a program to physically screen aviation workers at high-risk  airports. However, responsibility for the Insider Threat Program is spread  across multiple offices within TSA and has made it challenging to  synchronize and integrate activities across each office\u2019s efforts. As of  January 2020, TSA officials said that the Insider Threat Program does not  have a strategic plan. However, officials said they are developing a new  strategic \u201croadmap\u201d for the Insider Threat Program but are uncertain  when it will be issued.

When  dealing with a program designed to keep the aviation system safe from  criminal and terrorist acts, agency leaders and policy makers need to  know how well the government is doing implementing its objectives.
