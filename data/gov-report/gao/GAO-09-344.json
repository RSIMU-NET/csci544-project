The Department of Defense (DOD) defines NLW as those that are explicitly designed and primarily employed to incapacitate personnel or materiel, while minimizing fatalities, permanent injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property and the environment. DOD created the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program in 1996 to have centralized responsibility for the development of NLW and coordinate requirements among the services. GAO was asked to review the status of NLW programs within DOD and the military services by identifying the extent to which (1) DOD and the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program have developed and fielded NLW since the program's inception; (2) DOD has established and implemented policy, doctrine, and training for NLW; and (3) DOD has conducted testing and evaluation prior to fielding NLW.

Three major factors contribute to the program's limited progress in fully addressing capability gaps. First, DOD did not prioritize departmentwide non-lethal capability gaps until 2007 and still does not fully address these gaps. Second, DOD has not consistently incorporated logistics and supportability considerations early in the development process. As a result, DOD may miss opportunities to allocate resources more effectively. Third, DOD has exercised limited general oversight of the NLW program which has resulted in gaps in key program guidance as well as limited measurement of progress and performance. For example, DOD's road map of ongoing and projected NLW capabilities and efforts could be used to discharge oversight responsibilities, but the road map lacks guidance about how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. Further, DOD has no single organization with visibility over all spending, and available budget information may not fully capture all spending associated with the development of non-lethal capabilities. DOD has begun to incorporate ideas about non-lethal capabilities into policy, doctrine, and training but has not yet clearly articulated what constitutes acceptable risk for fatality, fully developed weapons employment policies for the use of force in overseas warfighting or homeland applications, or ensured that warfighters and domestic responders are fully trained in NLW use. Until these issues are resolved, doctrine and training for non-lethal weapons may be limited, and the warfighter or domestic responder may have fewer options other than resorting to lethal force. DOD lacks a clear methodology for estimating the human effects of non-lethal weapons and does not fully test and evaluate many non-lethal weapons because they have been fielded under urgent operational requirements that abbreviate normal DOD testing standards. Testing can be bypassed for commercial items because DOD officials can use contractor test data instead of conducting their own tests. Therefore, when NLW are fielded, commanders are uncertain about acceptable risk on targets and bystanders and cannot accurately predict their effects. DOD has begun to develop elements of a risk assessment methodology to address human effects testing; for example, it has drafted a Risk of Significant Injury scale, which broadly categorizes levels of health care capabilities required to reverse NLW effects. However, DOD has not completed a risk assessment methodology that would provide information to commanders so that they may then make a determination about its acceptability in their operating environment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The armed forces expect to encounter a shifting military environment,  including greater mixing of enemy combatants with noncombatants, in  which there are likely to be situations where lethal force is undesirable.

In order to be flexible enough  to deal with the rapidly changing threat environment, in 2002 the services  and combatant commanders described a family of non-lethal capabilities  as a high-priority need that must be satisfied immediately. Such  capabilities may include applying targeted munitions, destruction of  enemy command and control, and electronic jamming, all of which may  have non-lethal effects. Non-lethal capabilities may also include non-lethal  weapons (NLW), which the Department of Defense (DOD) defines as  \u201cweapons that are explicitly designed and primarily employed so as to  incapacitate personnel or materiel, while minimizing fatalities, permanent  injury to personnel, and undesired damage to property and the  environment.\u201d", "Congress has long been interested in DOD management and organization  of NLW programs.

In 1997, DOD created the Joint  Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) to perform day-to-day  management activities and other coordination duties on behalf of the  Executive Agent. Over the past 12 years, the JNLWD has reported  receiving funding of about $462 million, of which it had reported spending  at least $386 million. This includes funding for more than 50 NLW  development efforts as well as related support activities such as exercises  and experimentation. The military services may also independently  pursue service-unique research efforts as well as procure, operate, and  maintain NLW and train personnel on their use. During the same 12-year  period, DOD budget data showed that funding for the military services  totaled at least $355 million for NLW, the majority of which was for  procurement of existing commercially developed products.", "The Army and Marine Corps have published strategies that direct  commanders to consider the use of NLW in scenarios across a range of  military operations \u2013 especially in such areas as military operations other  than war and military operations in urban terrain.

Evaluation refers to what is learned  from a test. The test and evaluation process provides an assessment of  the attainment of technical performance, specifications, and system  maturity to determine whether systems are operationally effective,  suitable, and survivable for intended use. Testing and evaluation is used at  a variety of levels, including basic technology, components and  subsystems, and a complete system or product. The fundamental purpose  of testing and evaluation is to provide knowledge to assist in managing the  risks involved in developing, producing, operating, and sustaining systems  and capabilities. In both DOD and commercial firms, product testing is  conducted by organizations separate from those responsible for managing  product development.", "Standard fielding processes require extensive testing for new programs.  For example, the Army\u2019s process to certify weapons for normal fielding  requires several different kinds of assessment before a weapon can be  fielded. Environmental and air worthiness statements are required. Results  of user safety reviews, inspections, and analyses are also required, in  addition to a safety confirmation from the Army Test and Evaluation  Command. The Army Test and Evaluation Command must also provide an  operational test report. Operational test and evaluation is conducted to  estimate a system\u2019s operational effectiveness and operational suitability.  The testing agency will identify needed modifications; provide information  on tactics, doctrine, organizations and personnel requirements; and  evaluate the system\u2019s logistic supportability. Thorough and complete  testing not only provides assurance that weapons achieve the desired  results intended by design, but also allows decision makers in charge of  fielding determinations some level of confidence that their selections will  perform as advertised. By contrast, an urgent or abbreviated fielding  decision allows much of this testing to be bypassed when there is an  established and immediate operational need, and then usually only user  safety testing is required. For example, one Marine Corps policy states that  abbreviated acquisition programs\u2014which the policy identifies as generally  small, low cost and low risk programs\u2014are not required to undergo  operational testing. Furthermore, another Marine Corps policy states that  with appropriate commanding general authority, all testing can be waived,  allowing weapons to be fielded in limited quantities to meet urgent  operational requirements. Testing for commercial-off-the-shelf items can  be even more limited than testing for those that are urgently fielded. DOD  guidance states that\u2014in order to take advantage of reduced acquisition  time and to ensure that testing is not redundant and is limited to the  minimum effort necessary to obtain the required data\u2014\u201ctesting can be  minimized by 1) obtaining and assessing contractor test results; 2)  obtaining usage and failure data from other customers of the item; 3)  observing contractor testing; 4) obtaining test results from independent  test organizations (e.g., Underwriter\u2019s Laboratory); and 5) verifying  selected contractor test data.\u201d Agency officials must determine that a  contractor\u2019s test results are sufficient before making the decision to use  those test results instead of conducting their own tests.", "In 1998 the JNLWD contracted The Pennsylvania State University to  convene the Human Effects Advisory Panel, a group of scientists who  provide assessment of NLW.

The team examined current  processes for evaluating NLW human effects and made three primary  recommendations to DOD: (1) establish an independent board to review  the human effects assessments accompanying NLW systems and to ensure  that all reasonable assessments have been performed based on available  technology and resources; (2) create a NLW Human Effects Center of  Excellence to serve as the NLW program managers one-stop resource for  information on human effects testing; and (3) adopt a risk assessment  approach to evaluating the NLW human effects data due to the  uncertainties involved with the science of human effects characterization.

Using this  approach, the JNLWD, which sponsored the 2008 Joint Capabilities  Document for Joint Non-Lethal Effects, identified 36 capability gaps that  represented specific tasks where needs were not met by existing or  planned systems. The tasks were categorized as either counter-personnel  or counter-materiel, and included numerous variations, such as stopping a  vehicle or vessel, suppressing individuals, and denying individuals access  to an area, all under varying conditions. The gaps were then prioritized  by service and combatant command representatives. The resulting list  represented the areas in which Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Program  research and development initiatives, service acquisition decisions, and  other related resource investments are most needed to satisfy the needs of  joint force commanders. Table 1 shows the 36 tasks that were analyzed  and found to represent gaps in DOD\u2019s NLW capability, as well as their  relative priorities.", "While DOD is now building on the results of this process to determine how  to fill the capability gaps, most of the gaps were already broadly identified  11 years ago.

Though the JNLWD and the services have been working on  non-lethal capabilities since 1997, most of these gaps in non-lethal  capabilities still exist today. Table 2 compares non-lethal capability needs  that DOD has identified prior to the ongoing capability-based assessment  process.", "During the recent capability-based assessment, several NLW efforts were  examined, including the 4 programs that have completed the development  process and been fielded by one or more of the military services. These  programs are    40 mm non-lethal crowd dispersal cartridge,    modular crowd control munition,    portable vehicle arresting barrier, and    vehicle lightweight arresting device.", "Of these, 3 are variations of or munitions for existing weapons, and the  portable vehicle arresting barrier was in an early stage of development  when the JNLWD began funding the program.", "Even when combined with the 12 additional efforts that are ongoing as of  March 2009, these programs will not completely eliminate the capability  gaps they were designed to address. Existing joint efforts will not fully  satisfy all of the tasks, conditions, and standards that DOD analyzed in the  process of identifying NLW capability gaps. Based on our analysis of the  JNLWD\u2019s program information worksheets and other documents, we  found that there are efforts under way to address the top two-thirds of the  list of 36 gaps, although we note that there was no comprehensive source  that identified each ongoing effort and linked it to the capability gap(s) it  addressed. Appendix III provides further detail on the gaps that lack a  corresponding effort to address them. Table 3 shows a list of current NLW  programs and the priorities of the gaps they are supposed to address.", "Even though the programs listed in table 3 are intended to address about  two-thirds of the capability gaps, they (along with systems already fielded)  still only partially meet DOD\u2019s NLW needs, based on the latest joint  capability assessment. For example, a vehicle stopper that uses spikes  and netting may not cause a quickly moving car to come to a complete  stop before it reaches a checkpoint. Therefore, those capability gaps will  not be fully addressed and will remain identified gaps.

The military services may also fund their own separate  development efforts to address service-unique needs, but with few  exceptions have not done so. According to both service and joint program  officials, this reflects the low priority that services place on funding non- lethal weapons development. In addition, service NLW proponents have  said that the existence of joint funding has made service funding more  difficult to obtain.

However, DOD has not given timely and consistent  consideration to NLW logistics and supportability because fielded NLW  items, which have generally been urgently requested, commercially  purchased, or both, have not been subject to the logistics requirements of  the normal acquisition process. Moreover, the JNLWD does not make the  best use of its own tools for assessing the status and progress of NLW  efforts.", "Specific logistics planning procedures vary by service. For example, under  Navy acquisitions policies, program managers are required to complete an  independent logistics assessment before a research and development  effort may advance through the acquisition process to the point, known as  Milestone B, at which an acquisition program is formally initiated.  However, only 6 ongoing joint directorate-funded NLW efforts have passed  Milestone B, of which 4 have reached Milestone C, by which point  operational supportability with particular attention to minimizing the  logistics footprint should be ensured. Another 18 efforts were terminated  for various reasons (one after passing milestone B), and two were  advanced concept technology demonstrations, which were not required to  follow the normal acquisition process while the demonstrations were  under way. One of the advanced concept technology demonstrations  pursued directed-energy technology research to develop a NLW that uses  millimeter waves to produce an intense heating sensation on the surface of  skin, causing an immediate response and movement by target personnel.  This effort, which cost about $35.5 million, yielded two prototypes known  as Active Denial Systems 1 and 2. The second prototype weighs more than  9 tons, and has been mounted on a heavier vehicle than the first prototype  to accommodate additional armor and air-conditioning (see fig. 3).  Because of its weight, it is not easily used for missions requiring mobility.  This system also needs about 16 hours to cool down to its operating  temperature of 4 degrees Kelvin (-452 degrees Fahrenheit), making it  difficult to use on short notice unless the compressor is kept continuously  running. In addition, the Marine Corps considered this system\u2019s gyrotron,  waveguides, super-conducting magnets, antenna, and some other major  subsystems too complex to allow extensive field repair, so its utility could  be further reduced. Combat damage to the antenna could create a logistics  problem as it is a large item making storage and replacement difficult. The  Joint Non-lethal Weapons Program sponsored a Concept Exploration  Program for crowd-control technologies which published an analysis of  multiple concepts in 2003. The report evaluated eight systems using a  variety of criteria, including logistics, and found that the Active Denial  System received the lowest benefit:cost score of these. JNLWD officials  have made multiple attempts to field the Active Denial System under the  rubric of an urgent operational need despite the logistics problems noted  above and even though, if it is deployed, its mobility could be further  limited where highway overpasses are present. In December 2008, the joint  NLW program executive agent terminated efforts to deploy Active Denial  System 2 overseas.", "The manner of purchase and fielding can also affect whether NLW  undergo full suitability and supportability evaluations. The fielding process  normally provides an opportunity to scrutinize items that a service has  procured and intends to provide to its personnel. They receive a formal  certification that they are safe, meet performance requirements, and are  logistically supportable when used within stated operational parameters.  However, nine NLW systems were purchased from commercial vendors  and fielded under urgent processes which allow services to certify  materiel on a limited basis in order to rapidly support an operational need.  In some cases, logistics weaknesses that might have been uncovered by  the normal fielding process were not discovered during the abbreviated  analysis that takes place prior to fielding. For example, the FN-303 Less- Lethal Launching System program, which DOD spent about $2 million to  evaluate, was terminated because the weapon was too heavy and  ergonomically cumbersome, the weapon and ammunition magazine was  too fragile, and the weapon required compressed air canisters in order to  launch its non-lethal munitions. However, several dozen FN-303s were  fielded to units even though their utility was limited by the availability of  the canisters and the infrastructure to replenish them (see fig. 4).", "In addition, human electro-muscular incapacitation is an ongoing program  that was initiated in fiscal year 2005. One such device, the TASER\u00ae X-26  (see fig. 5), has already been fielded to units\u2014both domestically and  overseas\u2014as part of the multiple-item Non-Lethal Capability Set.  According to NLW training course materials, however, the TASER\u00ae X-26E  will not be deployed near flammable materials or liquids, as the arcing  from the probes could ignite flammable material. In addition, if it is  exposed to significant moisture, operators should dry the weapon  thoroughly and wait at least 24 hours before proceeding. We believe that  these factors could limit the range of environments in which the X-26E  (which, like the X-26, has already been fielded) could be employed.", "We believe that the JNLWD is missing the opportunity to provide sufficient  visibility to logistics concerns in part because it does not make optimum  use of available tools to catalog and track progress and in part because  most of the efforts it funds have not advanced to the stage where these  concerns are paramount. The directorate\u2019s program information  worksheet, for example, is one of the means that the directorate uses to  gather information from program managers about ongoing and proposed  efforts, but it does not include a specific space for the program manager to  describe logistics supportability goals and how they will be met. The  JNLWD uses the program information worksheet to develop an Investment  Decision Support Tool, in which the directorate ranks proposed efforts  overall and according to five subcategories: cost, schedule, operational  contribution, and technology and human effects readiness levels. In our  review of available worksheets, we found that there was not necessarily a  direct link between the operational contribution score and logistics  concerns. For example, the Active Denial System and Mobility Denial  System have both received operational contribution scores of 100 despite  their supportability problems. Further, requirements for logistics analysis  in preparation for a Milestone B decision are often not yet applicable,  since 10 of the efforts that the JNLWD was funding as of March 2009 had  not yet advanced to that step. An Army official told us that his senior  leadership is beginning to require this earlier in the process for Army  programs. Without giving full and early consideration to logistics and  supportability issues, DOD increases the risk that developmental efforts  may not meet service requirements and obtain service funding beyond  research and development into acquisition and fielding. While the joint  program funds technology research, it is the services that pay to procure,  operate, and maintain equipment. DOD also increases its risk of fielding  items under urgent processes that are infeasible, difficult to sustain, or  both. While DOD has procedures to try to field needed capabilities quickly,  these procedures are designed to maximize utility to the warfighter. To the  extent that these procedures result in fielding cumbersome or fragile  equipment, they may not achieve that goal.

However, none of the  $172.1 million budgeted for the Spider through fiscal year 2009 was listed  as part of the NLW program.

For example, non-lethal capability sets, which account  for about $122 million, are being procured and distributed to units  overseas as well as to National Guard troops stationed in units in U.S.  states and territories, and are packed in several modules that may be  tailored according to mission, for example, checkpoint guards. However,  the sets contain such items as riot gear (face shields, shin guards, flex  cuffs, etc.) that are not, by DOD\u2019s own definition, non-lethal weapons.  Rather, they could more accurately be described as personal protective  equipment. Because of definition considerations such as this, we found  determining the exact amounts of NLW-related spending to be  problematic. DOD plans to spend about $789 million on non-lethal  weapons from fiscal years 2009 through 2013. The complex nature of  categorizing lethal versus non-lethal weapons and programs makes it all  the more important for DOD to have a much clearer understanding of all  the programs and investments it is making in NLW.

As such, NLW may have lethal effects and therefore carry some level of  risk that is not precisely defined. For example, non-lethal is described in a  joint functional concept as the degree to which the joint force is able to  create desired effects using incapacitating, nonfatal capabilities. In  addition, DOD stated as part of the capabilities-based assessment that  increasing non-lethality widens the range of effects the joint force is able  to achieve without using deadly force, or in the case of defense support to  civil authorities, that the avoidance of casualties is imperative. An early  assessment by the Human Effects Advisory Panel posited that acceptable  risk was 1 percent suffering permanent damage (of which half were  lethal), 98 percent incapacitation, and no effect on 1 percent of the  population, but senior NLW program officials said that those figures were  never considered authoritative and that acceptable risk had not been  quantified.", "DOD has also not fully clarified what constitutes acceptable risk short of  fatality. Current DOD policy defines NLW as weapons that are explicitly  designed and primarily employed so as to incapacitate, and are intended to  have \u201crelatively reversible\u201d effects. Based on the results of the capability- based assessment, the JNLWD has modified its definition of NLW to  include weapons, devices, and munitions that are explicitly designed and  primarily employed to \u201cimmediately incapacitate\u201d targeted personnel or  material, and that are intended to have \u201creversible\u201d effects. These changes  have not yet been incorporated into overarching DOD policy, although  JNLWD officials have said that they are understood within DOD. However,  publications are not fully synchronized throughout the department; for  example, Army doctrine states that the use of NLW should \u201ctemporarily  incapacitate.\u201d Furthermore, it states that NLW use must not result in  unnecessary suffering\u201d without defining this term in the context of NLW  effects. Each of these definitions has different implications for NLW  development and employment, because as the \u201cdose\u201d of a weapon  increases, so does its potential both to achieve the desired effect and to  produce permanent injury. Thus, a NLW that is more successful with  respect to onset \u2013 that is, immediately incapacitates \u2014 could be less so  with respect to duration \u2013 that is, proves irreversible.", "Once DOD does finalize a new common definition, though, uncertainty  about acceptable results of the use of NLW may still create unrealistic  expectations. For example, the Marine Corps prepared an urgent needs  statement to support its request to field a laser dazzler, in which it noted  that the flares then in use caused injury and one fatality. The Marine Corps  requesters wanted a capability that would avoid that outcome. The  uncertainty of outcome may lead to expectations that non-lethal actually  means never lethal, and moreover may not even cause any kind of serious  injury. According to a senior NLW program official, the term \u201cnon-lethal\u201d  itself sets up false expectations, and DOD should establish a concerted  strategic communications program to disabuse those who may be the  target of such weapons as well as military users of the idea that \u201cnon- lethal\u201d is risk-free. DOD\u2019s interservice NLW training course materials also  cite the possibility that political or military leaders might form an incorrect  perception that NLW will allow wars and military operations other than  war to be prosecuted without casualties. Other federal agencies, whose  personnel may use NLW within the United States, manage expectations  differently. For example, the Department of Justice uses the term \u201cless- lethal\u201d so as not to create the expectation that certain weapons never  produce fatal results. The Department of Homeland Security uses both  terms. Congress also defined NLW in a way that may reinforce  expectations. In the statute directing DOD to establish centralized  responsibility for the establishment of NLW technology it defined a \u201cnon- lethal weapon\u201d as a weapon or instrument the effect of which on human  targets is less than fatal.", "DOD has not been able to provide further clarification on acceptable risk  primarily because there is no departmentwide consensus on what  constitutes acceptable risk. DOD officials have been discussing the  development of a methodology for characterizing acceptable risk that can  be applied more specifically to individual non-lethal weapons or devices.  They told us that they are nearing agreement within the department on this  methodology. However, as of February 2009, the methodology had not  been formally approved. The lack of a consistent and clear methodology  regarding risk levels can hinder efforts to write formal requirements for  material solutions to identified capability gaps, without which new  products cannot progress through the acquisition process, and can  complicate efforts to field NLW that are purchased from commercial  vendors, to use them, or both. Until NLW terminology is clarified and fully  disseminated, it could continue to create unrealistic expectations that  could complicate the efforts of material developers, result in inconsistent  rules of engagement, and make operational commanders more hesitant to  employ any available NLW. Moreover, until DOD clarifies its policy on how  to assess the risk of fatality or permanent injury it is willing to accept, it  will be very difficult to develop, deploy, train for, and use any NLW that  have the potential either to be lethal or create detrimental political effects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Not Fully Explained How NLW Employment Should Differ by Scenario", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of DOD\u2019s policy and doctrine showed that DOD personnel  lack clear guidance about how to employ NLW across the range of military  operations, both overseas and domestically. This could be relevant, for  example, for a range of missions that involve force but occur in a  nominally \u201cpeacetime\u201d scenario, or in ambiguous situations across the  spectrum of conflict. NLW may be used to determine intent: a warning  NLW, such as the laser dazzler, might be used to induce an approaching  vehicle, individual, or group to stop, and failure to stop is then assumed to  mean hostile intent against which lethal force may be used. However, our  review and analysis of existing doctrine showed that it does not provide  adequate guidance for employing NLW in ambiguous situations, such as  when a vehicle or pedestrian is approaching a checkpoint and intent is not  obvious. In some cases, servicemembers might not be able to determine  intent until an individual is within a short distance. While there are NLW  such as the laser dazzler that can allow troops to attempt to provide  warnings over long distances, the existing suite of NLW that can  incapacitate an individual is only effective at close range, so  servicemembers have limited options. They could use blunt-force  munitions or electro-muscular incapacitation devices, both of which are  generally ineffective beyond a short range; or wait for an individual to  approach to within the range at which these work, at which point effective  self-defense may no longer be possible. These policy and weapons  employment considerations are important to the warfighter because they  represent a balance between safety/risk for U.S. service personnel and  safety/risk to individuals or groups targeted by NLW. They are also  important to provide context for the application of the standing rules of  engagement that apply to military operations, for use where U.S. forces  face hostile forces, hostile acts, or demonstrated hostile intent.", "Concepts of operations for use of DOD forces within the United States  consider the avoidance of civilian casualties imperative, and the standing  rules for use of force state that, normally, force is to be used only as a last  resort and the force used should be the minimum necessary. Deadly  force is to be used only when all lesser means have failed or cannot  reasonably be employed, which implies that all other options must be  exhausted first. By contrast, overarching DOD non-lethal weapons policy  states that the existence of NLW in no way constitutes an obligation their employment and that the United States retains the option for   DOD has not issued new guidance or immediate use of lethal weapons. instituted training that reconciles these two stances; for example Nation Guard Bureau guidance for the domestic employment of NLW contains little more than a restatement of passages from the DOD directive on non- lethal weapons. DOD also has not directed that any specific pieces of  al  equipment that could produce lethal effects be excluded from the  capability sets that have been fielded in the United States. For example,  non-lethal capability sets containing TASER\u00ae have been fielded to  National Guard units in every state. TASER\u00ae is controversial because of  concerns about injuries and fatalities that occurred in the course of its u se  in law enforcement. The Marine Corps proscribed use of these weaponsuntil it published a policy specific to TASER\u00ae, and the Army compone U.S. Central Command decided not to train troops in their use.", "Furthermore, the joint staff has issued doctrine that states the  employment of non-lethal weapons in certain supporting operations will  also be governed by their political impact, For such operations, weapons  employment policies would need to be developed and disseminated so  that the existing rules of engagement and rules for the use of force could  be adequately tailored to minimize detrimental political effects resulting  from the use of NLW. In particular, DOD policy for employment of  directed-energy NLW such as the Active Denial System is incomplete. The  Under Secretary for Policy deemed the system politically untenable for  detainee operations but has not yet issued employment policy for other  missions. While the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy has  approved the Active Denial System in principle, a former senior policy  official wrote that DOD would continue to require the development of  definitive concepts of operation; rules of engagement; and tactics,  techniques, and procedures before the Active Denial System could be  deployed. While the Joint Non-lethal Weapons Program executive agent in  December 2008 terminated efforts to deploy the existing Active Denial  System overseas, DOD continues to try to find ways to deploy the system  in the United States, possibly at the southern border.", "Unresolved questions about acceptable risk and proper employment  guidance can also have an impact on the quality of training that  warfighters and domestic responders receive. DOD\u2019s Interservice Non- Lethal Individual Weapons Instructor Course provides scenario-based  training that can be applied under the standing Rules for the Use of Force  and Rules of Engagement that apply to all services, but it cannot integrate  realistic training for specific situations into its curriculum unless  appropriate policy has been developed. Because currently available NLW  have short ranges, reaction time is limited and warfighters will need to  make quick decisions, possibly in rapidly changing circumstances. While  DOD can and does produce mission-specific rules of engagement, gaps in  policy and doctrine limit the training that can be provided prior to  deployment.

Testing of human effects would measure the  NLW\u2019s likelihood and degree of causing irreversible effects on human  targets and bystanders. There are, however, several limitations to human  effects testing. Although technology is improving to better test for and  predict NLW human effects, DOD policies limit the use of human  subjects for testing and the nature of nonlethality, which is aimed at  producing reversible effects, poses challenges to testing accuracy. DOD  policy states that \u201cthe rights and welfare of human subjects in research  supported or conducted by the DOD Components shall be protected.\u201d  Therefore, when possible, human effects are derived from animal and  computer-based models in substitution for direct effects on human  subjects.

For example, the Human Effects Center of Excellence reports that  testing non-lethal munitions requires accurate accounting for projectile  properties such as its mass, impact velocity, shape, target size, and impact  location. However, potential for injury on the target varies depending on  the weight and size of the target and the accuracy of the NLW projectiles\u2014 which are often hard to predict and test for. According to the Human  Effects Advisory Panel, there is a knowledge gap between the  expectations of the warfighter and the information that is being provided  by models and simulation tools from the scientific community. Testing  accuracy is inherently limited when extrapolations are based on subjects  other than human subjects. The Advanced Total Body Model is an example  of a simulation tool used to predict the risks associated with blunt impact  weapons and was designed to test for effects upon various body parts  (e.g., ribs, abdomen, head-neck). However, simulation tools are not  capable of testing for all possible effects derived from a NLW. A broken  rib, for example, could result in a punctured lung which may cause death.  According to officials at the Human Effects Center of Excellence, other  sources used to test and collect data for non-lethal effects are animals that  share similar human characteristics. For example, they said chinchillas  have similar inner ear structures to humans and are used to test for ear  damage caused from acoustic NLW such as flash bang grenades. However,  functional and anatomical differences between human and animal subjects  may limit the generalizability of test results to human populations. If  suitable testing that models NLW effects on humans is not conducted, then  it becomes unclear how and when to use non-lethal weapons given the  lack of assurance concerning the effects on the targets and bystanders."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Lacks Standardized Policy for Human Effects Testing and a Complete Risk Assessment Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Current DOD testing policies do not address testing of NLW effects on  human targets and bystanders.

Therefore, with the  exception of laser-related weapons, human effects testing is currently not  required, including the use of simulation tools and other methods. JNLWD  officials told us that all NLW programs that receive JNLWD funding must  be reviewed by the Human Effects Review Board before every major  acquisition milestone. Service-funded programs are not required to  undergo the same review; however, JNLWD officials said they encourage  it. Army officials told us that they conduct human effects testing for non- urgently fielded NLW. Further limiting the amount of human effects testing  being conducted is the fact that, to date, almost all NLW have been fielded  using abbreviated processes to meet urgent operational requirements.  When there is an established and immediate operational need, an urgent or  abbreviated fielding decision allows DOD to bypass most testing, other  than user safety testing, that is normally conducted for weapons fielded  through the standard process. For example, the Army\u2019s Urgent Material  Release process requires a safety assessment, but Army officials told us  that this safety testing is for the user of the weapon only, and does not test  for the safety of the target or bystanders. Marine Corps policy states that  with appropriate commanding general authority, weapons may be fielded  in limited quantities to meet urgent operational requirements, even if all  safety requirements are not met. A Marine Corps official told us that a  commander\u2019s willingness to accept safety risks associated with an NLW\u2019s  rapid acquisition given the urgent need of the weapon in the field is  ultimately what drives NLW deployment. He said that the most  complicating factor of streamlining and regulating the acquisition process  for NLW from beginning to end is managing this balance between urgency  and safety.", "DOD testing for commercial-off-the-shelf items can be even more limited  than for those urgently fielded because agency officials can use contractor  test data instead of conducting their own tests. The Defense Acquisition  Guidebook recognizes the importance of oversight and government  involvement in testing performed by contractors. Anytime agency  officials decide to use contractor test results without adequate oversight  or involvement in the testing, there is an increased risk that the testing was  biased, the testing environment was not relevant for the weapon\u2019s  intended operational use, or the test results were inaccurately  represented. One example of a commercial item where use of contractor  test data had the potential to lead to unpredictable results was the  TASER\u00ae. In 2002, the Human Effects Review Board reviewed the  TASER\u00ae M26 model and submitted an approved but limited fielding  recommendation. The recommendation was largely based on anecdotal  data and field experience gathered over the last 20 years from police  enforcement activities where TASER\u00ae was predominantly used on male  targets. The Human Effects Review Board was concerned by the lack of  unbiased, peer-reviewed scientific evidence of TASER\u00ae effects and  effectiveness that is necessary to support a stronger endorsement. In 2003,  the Army\u2019s safety office at Picatinny Arsenal issued a safety certification to  support the urgent fielding of the TASER\u00ae M26 model. However, the Army  did not field the M26 model and instead fielded an even more advanced  version of TASER\u00ae\u2014the X26E model\u2014that produces a 5 percent increase  in muscle contraction compared to the approved M26 because it uses a  waveform that is different from that of any preexisting models. Although  the Human Effects Review Board did evaluate testing results for the  TASER\u00ae X26 model in 2008 and determined that the human effects  research conducted was sufficient, DOD increased the risks of unintended  effects by reviewing testing data after the weapon was already being used  in the field. Although testing the effects of NLW is technologically  challenging, JNLWD recognizes that human effects, effectiveness, and risk  must be quantified in order to support legal, treaty, and policy reviews and  to ensure warfighter confidence in new technologies.", "DOD has begun to develop elements of a risk assessment methodology,  but the methodology will not be complete until human effects testing  requirements are standardized in DOD policy. In its Risk Management  Guide for DOD Acquisition, DOD recognizes that risk management is  critical to acquisition program success. In particular, DOD notes the need  to define a program by satisfying the user\u2019s need within acceptable risk.  According to this guide, the purpose of addressing risk in programs is to  help ensure that program cost, schedule, and performance objectives are  achieved at every stage in the program\u2019s life cycle and to communicate to  all stakeholders the process for uncovering, determining the scope of, and  managing program uncertainties. Although DOD policy does state that  NLW shall not be required to have a zero probability of producing fatalities  or significant injuries, our review found that the policy does not articulate  a methodology for what constitutes acceptable risk of fatality and  significant injuries across DOD and the services. Without a better  understanding of acceptable risk, NLW developers and designers have no  way of knowing whether the risk levels associated with the effects  produced from NLW are in compliance with standards and whether NLW  developments are progressing sufficiently to meet the needs of the  warfighter.", "Although DOD has not established standardized acceptable levels of risk  of fatality and significant injuries, DOD has a draft policy in development  for a Risk of Significant Injury scale that characterizes the amount of  treatment necessary to reverse the effects of an NLW (see fig. 6). The Risk  of Significant Injury scale broadly categorizes three levels of health care  capabilities required to reverse the effects of NLW once they are used on  targets, but it does not take into account the risk probabilities of injury for  each category for a given weapon or target. In other words, the Risk of  Significant Injury scale does not assess the likelihood that non-lethal  effects could cause a score of 0, 1, or 2 within the scale, and thus does not  provide information about what probability to expect for each category of  injury. The Human Effects Process Action Team concluded in 2000 that  the Human Effects Review Board should make adopting a risk assessment  approach to evaluating the NLW human effects data a priority because of  the uncertainties involved with the science of human effects  characterization. The team\u2014directed by a Marine Corps lieutenant general  and composed of each service\u2019s acquisition executive and surgeon  general\u2014stated that a risk assessment methodology would allow the  human effects of NLW to be expressed along with a measure of the  confidence in the data. Hypothetically, if testing showed that a NLW  carries a 15 percent risk for permanent injuries, a risk assessment  methodology would allow a risk level (e.g., low-to-moderate or moderate- to-high) to be assigned. A commander can then use this as a basis for a  decision on whether to accept that risk.", "DOD has not yet established a risk assessment methodology for human  effects testing that is capable of identifying the potential risks associated  with the use of NLW. Without a risk assessment methodology, NLW human  effects are not fully understood and cannot accurately be predicted, which  may result in unexpected effects upon targets and bystanders and cause  political consequences. DOD recognizes that part of a successful risk  management strategy includes sufficient testing and evaluation measures,  and DOD also recognizes the importance of assessing operational  effectiveness. Nevertheless, testing and evaluation that include human  effects testing measures could improve planning and commanders\u2019 ability  to avoid unintended effects of NLW use."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s Non-Lethal Weapons Program is intended to provide U.S. armed  forces with flexibilities for dealing with the rapidly changing threat  environment, especially when using lethal force is undesirable. However,  key aspects of this program, such as assessing the extent to which priority  capability gaps will be addressed, focusing on supportability and  operational utility in the field, and providing oversight and full funding  visibility, have been limited. These problems have contributed to the  program\u2019s overall limited progress in fielding suitable NLW. New weapons  requirements and development are often understandably affected by  technology hurdles and a preference to field an item that will partially  meet needs quickly rather than wait indefinitely for a perfect solution.  However, we note that 12 years have passed since DOD established the  JNLWD and that the services were working on NLW development efforts  even before that. Better planning, management, and oversight of NLW  developmental efforts to incorporate early consideration of technology  readiness, suitability, and supportability could improve the rate of  progress. While individual services may attempt to satisfy some service- unique gaps on their own, the measure of a successful joint program will  be whether it can successfully foster joint development. Without clearer  policy on acceptable risk to both warfighters and potential targets, in both  overseas and domestic scenarios, doctrine and training for NLW will  continue to be limited. Finally, conducting suitable testing and evaluation  is complicated in an environment where acceptable alternatives to human  testing \u2013 animal tests and modeling and simulation \u2013 are themselves both  limited and inherently difficult to extrapolate to humans. Although DOD  recognizes that it needs to develop a risk assessment methodology and has  taken steps toward that end, it still lacks the means to predict levels of risk  concerning non-lethal effects on targets and bystanders. As a result of all  these factors, DOD\u2019s NLW program has had limited success in planning,  developing, overseeing, and testing effective and efficient weapons. Unless  these factors are addressed, the ability of U.S. forces to conduct  operations across the full range of potential lethality where and when  needed will be hindered, and they will continue to lack the means to  escalate force while still achieving non-lethal effects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following eight  actions:    To help DOD better match program priorities to identified capability gaps,  the Secretary of Defense should direct the JNLWD, in consultation with  the services and combatant commanders, to assess and document the  extent to which NLW efforts at the technology development stage and  beyond (including procurement and operations and maintenance) address  the highest-priority Joint Staff-validated capability gaps.", "To help DOD better incorporate logistics and supportability  considerations, the Secretary of Defense should direct the JNLWD, in  consultation with the services and combatant commanders, to ensure that  appropriate logistics and supportability planning is integrated into  development efforts at the earliest possible stage, including both DOD- developed and commercial weapons and capabilities.

DOD stated that as we mentioned in our  draft report, the Risk of Significant Injury methodology will help address  our recommendation and that DOD intends for this methodology to be the  basis for the human effects characterization guidance document in  development. DOD stated that it does not believe that such a methodology  should articulate thresholds for acceptable risk and that such  determinations should be left to military commanders with the advice of  legal advisors. DOD also stated that it does not believe an acceptable risk  methodology should include the risk to operators of a weapon because  such risks are already addressed in the existing acquisition process. We  agree that military commanders (with the appropriate legal advice) should  make the determination of acceptable risk when employing any weapon\u2014 including NLW. Our intent was to highlight that in order to make these  decisions, military commanders require accurate information on what  effects a NLW should be expected to have. By finalizing and fully  incorporating the risk of significant injury methodology and guidance into  NLW efforts and properly implementing them, DOD should be able to  arrive at the kind of consistent and accurate information needed. To the  extent the acquisition process includes risk to the operator of a NLW, we  would expect that this information would be provided to commanders in  the same context as risk to targeted individuals and bystanders.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that DOD provide  clearer weapons employment guidance that can be used to modify or  augment existing rules of engagement or rules for the use of force for both  warfighters and domestic responders on how NLW should be used, and  incorporate this guidance into training curricula.

To the  extent that clear guidance on the employment of NLW overseas and in the  United States can be incorporated into existing or supplemental  documents, we agree this should allow DOD to clarify how NLW are  intended to be employed in the wide range of operational circumstances,  enhance the broad understanding of the use-of-force continuum, and  facilitate the modification of training curricula.

We acknowledged the fielding of  the Non-Lethal Capability Sets in our draft report. We also acknowledge  that DOD has made progress in adapting the way it conducts operations by  expanding the use and potential use of NLW, and also that several of the  commercial-off-the-shelf items fielded under urgent requests have proven  valuable and timely to the warfighter. Moreover, we recognize that the  Non-Lethal Capability Sets have been requested by Army units and that the  Army Chief of Staff directed a requirement that all brigade combat teams  be issued these sets. However, DOD officials, including some who are part  of the Joint Non-lethal Weapons Program, have pointed out to us that  range limitations of current munitions and other Non-Lethal Capability Set  items are important factors driving the JNLWD\u2019s and services\u2019 current  development efforts.
