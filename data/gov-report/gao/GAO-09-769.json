The rules that taxpayers must follow in determining the proper amount of mortgage interest to deduct can be complex. For example, there are limitations on the amount of debt for which interest can be deducted, special rules for refinancing, situations where alternative minimum tax (AMT) considerations apply, and rules on the deductibility of prepaid interest amounts called points.

The four main programs that IRS uses to enforce or research mortgage interest deduction compliance include the following. (1) A computer matching program designed to identify taxpayers whose mortgage interest deduction exceeds amounts reported on Form 1098; (2) IRS's National Research Program (NRP), the main ongoing study of taxpayer compliance based on examinations of a random sample of tax returns; (3) Routine examinations done by correspondence, in an IRS office, or on site; and (4) Two special compliance initiative projects (CIP) primarily examining acquisition debt for a limited segment of individual taxpayers with high mortgage interest deductions or high adjusted gross incomes. The mortgage interest deduction rules create compliance problems for taxpayers, reflecting the deduction's complexity. The effects of the problems, however, are uneven. Although many taxpayers might encounter few problems, others could face many more. Problems cited by tax practitioners and in our review of articles on deducting home mortgage interest included the following: (1) Taxpayers need to distinguish between acquisition and home equity debt but did not always do so. (2) Taxpayers deducted interest on loans exceeding the limitations, including the acquisition, home equity, and two-home limits. (3) Taxpayers who were subject to the AMT and thus not eligible to deduct home equity interest claimed it nonetheless. (4) Tax practitioners also missed the limitations and did not comply with the AMT rules. (5) Depending on the circumstances, some taxpayers and practitioners faced extensive recordkeeping and calculations related to such matters as refinancing, the AMT, business use of the home, other uses of loan proceeds, and the periodic use and repayment of home equity lines of credit. (6) Taxpayers may have been unaware that they might need documentation on matters such as how proceeds of home equity loans are spent to properly determine the amount of the mortgage interest deduction on their tax returns. (7) Mortgage interest deduction limits based on debt amounts are not directly comparable with the information on Form 1098, which lists interest paid. If taxpayers' debts exceed the limits, taxpayers must calculate how much interest they can deduct. Additional information about taxpayers' mortgages could help IRS identify the most productive cases to examine and determine whether taxpayers are claiming the correct amount of mortgage interest deduction. IRS could obtain more helpful information about taxpayers' mortgages by expanding information collected on Form 1098. IRS officials said that in implementing certain additional reporting requirements, the agency would need to meet the terms of the Paperwork Reduction Act, which requires agencies to minimize the paperwork burden they impose on the public and maximize the practical utility of the information they collect. Taken as a whole, IRS taxpayer guidance--Schedule A and its instructions, Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax, and Publication 936, Home Mortgage Interest Deduction--generally informed taxpayers that mortgage interest deductions are subject to limits. Even though the guidance was generally sufficient, Schedule A does not explicitly mention the limitations. IRS's examiners' guidance and training materials included information for identifying and calculating home-equity and the acquisition-debt limitations. Overall, examiners we interviewed were satisfied with training and guidance on the mortgage interest deduction. The three companies' tax preparation software for individuals that we analyzed differed from each other in how they treated the limitations on the amount of debt for which interest can be deducted."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The home mortgage interest deduction is the third most expensive federal  income tax expenditure, with the government expected to forgo about $80  billion of revenue for the deduction in 2009.

At that time, the deduction for home mortgage interest was part of  the deduction allowed for any interest paid. The Tax Reform Act of 1986  limited deductions for nonbusiness interest.  The 1986 act specifically  disallowed deductions by individuals of personal interest but included a  limited exception for qualified mortgage interest. The 1986 act was  amended the next year to include dollar limits on the amount of home  mortgage debt for which interest payments can be deducted.", "Taxpayers may deduct the interest they pay on loans secured by qualified  homes\u2014either their main home or their main home and a second home.  These loans include first or second mortgages, home equity loans, and  home equity lines of credit. Boats and recreational vehicles may qualify as  homes if they have sleeping, cooking, and toilet facilities.", "As table 1 shows, two kinds of debt may qualify for the mortgage interest  deduction. The first kind is acquisition debt, which is debt incurred in  acquiring, constructing, or substantially improving a qualified home and  that is secured by the home. Taxpayers may deduct all of the interest paid  on acquisition debt incurred on or before October 13, 1987, known as  grandfathered debt. Taxpayers\u2019 interest deductions for debt on qualified  homes purchased after October 13, 1987, is limited to the interest on $1  million of acquisition debt, reduced by any grandfathered debt.", "The second kind of qualified debt is home equity debt, which is any non- acquisition debt secured by the home. Its proceeds may be used for  anything other than to buy, build, or substantially improve the home. For  example, the proceeds may be used to pay off credit cards or finance cars  or vacations. Home equity debt is limited to the home\u2019s fair market value  minus the acquisition debt and grandfathered debt, or to $100,000,  whichever is less. Home equity debt for tax purposes should not be  confused with what is commonly called a home equity loan. The latter may  qualify as either acquisition debt or home equity debt depending on how  the proceeds are used.", "Table 1 also summarizes the deductibility of points. A point is a term used  to describe certain charges paid in connection with obtaining a mortgage  and is calculated at 1 percent of a mortgage\u2019s principal. Generally, points  are considered prepaid interest, and, as such, the deduction is usually  allocated over the life of the loan. However, if various conditions are met,  the taxpayer may deduct the points in the year paid.   Determining  whether points are fully deductible in the year paid may require that  taxpayers go through as many as 10 decision steps.", "Lending institutions and other entities engaged in a trade or business that  receive $600 or more during the year in mortgage interest and certain  points from an individual taxpayer are required to file a Form 1098,  Mortgage Interest Statement. Form 1098 reports are sent both to the  taxpayer and IRS to show how much mortgage interest was paid to the  lender that year.", "Taxpayers report their deductible mortgage interest information to IRS on  lines 10 through 13 of Schedule A, the schedule itemizing deductions for  the Form 1040 individual income tax return (see app. II). Typically, the  larger deductible amounts are reported on line 10, which shows home  mortgage interest and points reported to taxpayers on Form 1098. Lines 11  and 12 of Schedule A are for claiming mortgage interest and points,  respectively, not reported on Form 1098, and, starting in 2007, line 13 is  used for deductible qualified mortgage insurance premiums. Some interest  payments reported on Form 1098 may be deductible on other Form 1040  schedules, such as Schedule C for sole proprietorship businesses or  Schedule F for farming.", "Changes in the housing market over the years may have affected the  overall amount of home mortgage interest that taxpayers claimed. Table 2  shows the change in various indicators related to the mortgage interest  deduction from 2001 to 2006. The rise in home prices and thus mortgage  amounts, partly account for the large increases in mortgage interest  deductions claimed by taxpayers in 2006 compared to 2001. In 2006, the  median sales price for existing U.S. single-family homes was up from 2001.  Median sales prices varied widely across metropolitan areas, with some  locations exceeding $700,000. The home equity loan totals reported by the  Federal Reserve Board also increased significantly from 2001 to 2006.  According to the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s 2006 American Community Survey,  about a fifth of owner-occupied housing units with a mortgage had a home  equity loan.

For example, as already discussed, taxpayers cannot  claim a deduction for interest exceeding the $1 million acquisition debt  limit or other limitations.

For example, a check box could be added  to the Schedule asking taxpayers if either the $1 million or the $100,000  limitation applies to their loans. Making such a change not only would help  taxpayers preparing their own returns but also might prompt paid  preparers to more thoroughly interview their clients. However, with the  mortgage interest deduction, these types of changes would add some  burden to taxpayers whose deductions are not affected by the debt limits.  The effectiveness of such change is also unclear.", "Taxpayers might not read IRS guidance when preparing returns. To  counter this possibility but also be mindful of preparation, mailing, and  taxpayer service costs involved, IRS could test whether corresponding  with some taxpayers would cost-effectively reduce misreporting. Added  outreach\u2014through seminars or communications with stakeholders such  as paid preparers, tax return software providers, and industry groups\u2014 could communicate key rules and common mistakes and be targeted to  taxpayers, such as those reporting the deduction above a certain level.  Sending correspondence directly to taxpayers also could help inform paid  preparers of rules and common mistakes because the taxpayers would  likely share it with their preparers, according to representatives of the tax  return preparation industry.  IRS has used outreach programs on  mortgage interest deductions in recent years. For instance, IRS\u2019s tax tips  covered deducting refinancing costs.", "IRS\u2019s guidance on the acquisition debt limit is inconsistent with a prior tax  court ruling. Currently, Publication 936 guides the taxpayer to treat any  qualified mortgage debt above the $1 million acquisition debt limit as  home equity debt subject to the $100,000 limit, regardless of the loan\u2019s use.  In practice, this means that the taxpayer can deduct the interest on up to  $1.1 million in acquisition debt (treating the amount above $1 million as  home equity debt even if used to acquire the home). However, a 1997 U.S.  Tax Court case ruled that the acquisition debt limit is $1 million and no  additional deduction can be taken above the $1 million limit unless the  taxpayer truly has home equity debt.  One tax software company official  cited the 1997 case as support for the company\u2019s decision to change the  guidance in its software to allow interest deductions only up to $1 million  in acquisition debt, rather than follow the guidance in Publication 936. In  2008, IRS Chief Counsel began reviewing the inconsistency in the debt  limit allowances. However, a completion date for this work is uncertain.", "Until IRS completes its determination, taxpayers will calculate their  deductions using different debt limits depending on whether they, their tax  preparers, or their tax software follow the guidance in Publication 936 or  the tax court interpretation.

For example, the guidance does  not mention a problem that an examiner said she commonly found:  taxpayers owning a third home, waiting to sell one of their first two, and  deducting the interest paid on all three. Neither does the guidance address  situations that tax professionals described as challenging for IRS to  enforce, such as multiple refinancings, mortgages, or home equity lines of  credit.

For example, according to  one IRS training exercise, taxpayers could deduct interest on up to $1.1  million in mortgage debt even if they used the $1.1 million just to acquire a  home, contradicting the 1997 tax court ruling, discussed above. The  difference may lead examiners to inconsistently calculate the tax owed,  because some may calculate the acquisition debt limit as $1 million based  on the tax court determination and others may allow deductions on up to  $1.1 million as instructed by the training.

The absence of  specific information about the reasons for noncompliance also prevents  IRS from making efficient decisions on how to select cases for  examination. Simultaneously, the complexity of mortgage interest  deduction rules creates problems with some taxpayers trying to comply.  These problems are compounded by an inconsistency between IRS  guidance and a tax court ruling on acquisition debt limits. Because the  limits causing complexity are written in law, statutory changes may be the  most direct way to address the challenges of administering the deduction  and alleviate the compliance problems.
