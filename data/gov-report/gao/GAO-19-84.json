Specifically, NNSA has taken the steps described below:", "Program management. NNSA has begun to establish the program management functions needed to execute a W78 replacement program, as required by NNSA's program execution instruction. For example, NNSA has started to develop a risk management plan to define the process for identifying and mitigating risks.

Critical components within the W78 are aging, and the  military\u2019s requirements for, among other things, the safety and security  features of this warhead have changed since it entered the stockpile in  1979. NNSA is responsible for delivering nuclear warheads to the U.S. Air  Force and the U.S. Navy, which are organized under DOD, for use in their  weapons delivery systems. NNSA and DOD undertake life extension  programs (LEPs) to refurbish or replace nuclear weapons components to,  among other things, extend the lives of these weapons and enhance the  safety and security of the stockpile.", "The Nuclear Weapons Council is the joint DOD and DOE activity  responsible for matters related to executive-level management of the  nuclear weapons stockpile. The Nuclear Weapons Council serves as the  focal point for interagency analyses and decisions to maintain and  manage U.S. nuclear weapons, and reviews and approves proposed  LEPs. When undertaking an LEP, DOD, with input from NNSA, defines  the performance, safety, and security requirements for the warhead\u2014 known as the military characteristics\u2014which DOD refines over time and  finalizes before NNSA begins production. NNSA develops warhead  designs to meet these requirements and is ultimately responsible for  producing the warheads. The Nuclear Weapons Council is also used to  resolve larger questions regarding design and costs for LEPs.", "The April 2010 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR)\u2014which described  presidential policy on the role of nuclear weapons in national security\u2014 directed NNSA and DOD to study options to replace the capabilities of the  W78 nuclear warhead in an ICBM system. The NPR also directed the agencies to study whether the resulting warhead could also be fielded by  the U.S. Navy in its submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM) system,  making the weapon an \u201cinteroperable\u201d warhead. In September 2010,  DOD and NNSA began assessing concepts for an interoperable warhead  to extend the life of the W78 and the Navy\u2019s W88 warhead. DOD  subsequently began drafting military characteristics that captured a set of  joint Air Force and Navy requirements, including an interoperable nuclear  explosive package\u2014the explosive core of the weapon\u2014and adaptable  nonnuclear components for the Air Force\u2019s ICBM and Navy\u2019s SLBM  systems.", "From 2011 through 2014, NNSA, with input from DOD, assessed  concepts for the warhead based on the draft military characteristics and  completed initial feasibility studies analyzing various warhead design  options. NNSA concluded, on the basis of these studies, that the initial  design concepts that it proposed could, in principle, be fielded in both Air  Force and Navy delivery systems. During this period, the warhead  replacement program was initially referred to as the W78 LEP, then as  the W78/88-1 LEP, and then subsequently as the Interoperable Warhead  1 (IW1). During this four year period, NNSA expended about $114.5  million on the program, according to information provided by NNSA.", "In fiscal year 2014, in part because of budget constraints, the Nuclear  Weapons Council directed NNSA to suspend the program for an  anticipated 5 years, with resumption planned in fiscal year 2020.

The technology  readiness assessment noted that for technologies with a TRL of 3 or less,  an MRL of 1 or less is expected. In addition, according to the report,  Sandia estimated that it may cost about $7.1 million to develop the  material and manufacturing process to TRL 5 and MRL 4 during fiscal  years 2018 through 2023\u2014when the program is slated to reach Phase  6.3\u2014to achieve a level of readiness where it could potentially be included  in the design of the W78 replacement warhead.", "Among the 59 \u201cmust do (trade space)\u201d technologies that NNSA evaluated  were, for example, two new gas transfer system technologies developed  by Sandia that may offer advantages compared with the existing  technology. A gas transfer system is a required capability (or \u201cmust do\u201d)  but, according to the technology readiness assessment report, NNSA  needs to compare the costs, benefits, and risks of these new  technologies with the traditional technology (i.e., evaluate the \u201ctrade  space\u201d) and make a selection among them. The first new technology was  a gas transfer system bottle made out of aluminum that could be cheaper,  weigh less, and last longer than the gas transfer system used in the W78.  According to the technology readiness assessment report, the  assessment team estimated the aluminum-based bottle had completed  TRL 2 but did not have enough information to estimate an MRL. Sandia  estimated that it would cost about $6.5 million to achieve TRL 5 and MRL  4 during fiscal years 2018 through 2023. The second Sandia technology  involved an advanced gas transfer system technology. The assessment  team estimated that this technology had completed TRL 3 but did not  have enough information to estimate an MRL. Sandia estimated that it  would cost about $5.4 million to achieve TRL 5 and MRL 4 during fiscal  years 2018 through 2023.

Specifically, the assessment team estimated the Lawrence  Livermore and Los Alamos technologies to have completed TRL 4 and  Sandia\u2019s proposal to have completed TRL 3. Regarding MRLs, the  assessment team also estimated Lawrence Livermore\u2019s technology to  have completed MRL 1, Los Alamos\u2019s technology to be at MRL 1, and did  not have enough information to estimate the MRL for Sandia\u2019s  technology. In addition, according to the report, Lawrence Livermore  estimated costs of about $31.2 million to $45.6 million to further mature its  technology during fiscal years 2018 through 2023. Los Alamos estimated  costs of about $72.1 million to $154.5 million to further mature its  technology during the same period. Sandia estimated costs of about $8.2  million to further mature its technology during the same period.

According to the  program manager, collecting the information that identifies facilities and  capabilities\u2014including a rough idea of key milestone dates for when the  program will need to use them\u2014is the first step in producing a major  impact report, which is required upon completion of Phase 6.2 and  accompanies the final Phase 6.2 study report delivered to the Nuclear  Weapons Council. Among other things, a major impact report identifies  aspects of the program\u2014including facilities and capabilities to support it\u2014 that could affect the program\u2019s schedule and technical risk, according to  the Phase 6.X guidelines.", "According to an NNSA official and contractor representatives, many of the  existing nuclear and nonnuclear components of the W78 are outdated or  unusable and a W78 replacement will need all newly manufactured  components. As a result, NNSA will need to exercise numerous  manufacturing capabilities in support of this effort, and the facilities and  capabilities must be ready to support the work. However, many of the  facilities that may be needed to provide components for a W78  replacement program are outdated and are undergoing modernization to  either build new facilities or repair existing facilities and capabilities, which  represents a critical external risk to the program. According to NNSA\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, these  planned modernization activities will require sustained and predictable  funding over many years to ensure they are available to support the  weapons programs. Some examples of NNSA activities to build or repair  facilities and capabilities that will provide nuclear or nonnuclear  components for a W78 replacement warhead\u2014and which may have  schedule, cost, or capacity issues that could impact the program\u2014 include:", "Plutonium pit production facilities. NNSA does not currently have  the capability to manufacture sufficient quantities of plutonium pits for  a W78 replacement program. NNSA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2018 Stockpile  Stewardship and Management Plan stated that the agency will  increase its capability to produce new pits over time, from 10 pits per  year in fiscal year 2024 to 30 pits per year in fiscal year 2026, and as  many as 50 to 80 pits per year by 2030. NNSA is refurbishing its pit  production capabilities at Los Alamos to produce at least 30 pits per  year. In addition, in May 2018, NNSA announced its intention to  repurpose the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication Facility at the Savannah  River Site in South Carolina to produce at least an additional 50 pits  per year by 2030. NNSA officials told us that they will need both the  Los Alamos and Savannah River pit production capabilities to meet  anticipated pit requirements for the W78 replacement program and for  future warhead programs.", "Uranium processing facilities. NNSA\u2019s construction of the Uranium  Processing Facility at the Y-12 National Security Complex will help  ensure NNSA\u2019s continued ability to produce uranium components for  the W78 replacement program. NNSA plans to complete the facility  for no more than $6.5 billion by the end of 2025\u2014approximately 4  years before the scheduled delivery of the first production unit of a  W78 replacement program warhead. This effort is part of a larger  NNSA plan to relocate and modernize other enriched uranium  capabilities performed in a legacy building at the Y-12 National  Security Complex to other existing buildings or in newly constructed  buildings.", "Lithium production facility. NNSA will require lithium for a W78  replacement warhead. The United States no longer maintains full  lithium production capabilities and relies on recycling as the only  source of lithium for nuclear weapon systems. According to the Fiscal  Year 2018 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, NNSA has  analyzed options to construct a new lithium production facility, and a  conceptual design effort is next, with an estimated completion date of  fiscal year 2027 for the new facility. Until the facility is available,  NNSA has developed a bridging strategy to fill the interim supply  gaps.", "Radiation-hardened microelectronics facility. Nuclear warheads,  such as a W78 replacement warhead, include electronics that must  function reliably in a range of operational environments. NNSA has a  facility at Sandia that produces custom, strategic radiation-hardened  microelectronics for nuclear weapons. In August 2018, NNSA officials  told us that this facility, known as Microsystems and Engineering  Sciences Applications, can remain viable until 2040\u2014but would need  additional investment.", "The W78 replacement program manager told us that the need for newly  manufactured components coupled with the scale of NNSA\u2019s  modernization activities means that a comprehensive coordination effort  will be necessary to ensure that the facilities and capabilities are ready to  provide components for the warhead by the end of the 2020s. Because  these activities are separately managed and supported outside the W78  replacement program, NNSA considers progress on them to represent a  critical external risk to the program.", "NNSA is taking or plans to take some action to mitigate this external risk  at the program and agency level. One step that the program plans to take  to address this risk is to draft formal agreements\u2014called interface  requirements agreements\u2014with other NNSA program offices that  oversee the deliverables and schedules for the design, production, and  test facilities that are needed for the program. These agreements  describe the work to be provided by these external programs, including  milestone dates for completing the work; funding; and any risks to cost,  schedule, or performance. The W78 program manager stated that they  are generally drafted toward the end of Phase 6.2 through Phase 6.2A  and largely finalized in Phase 6.3\u2014though small adjustments may be  made into Phase 6.4 (Production Engineering).", "At the agency level, in response to a direction in the 2018 NPR, NNSA  officials told us that the agency is also developing an agency-wide  integrated master schedule that is intended to align NNSA\u2019s enterprise- wide modernization schedule with milestone delivery dates for nuclear  weapons components. The W78 program manager and other NNSA  officials told us that the information they provide on the facilities and  capabilities needed, as well as milestone dates, will be integrated into this  schedule and used to help ensure that the facilities and capabilities are  ready to support the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NNSA and DOD for comment.
