Many agencies report that they have begun to use the new guidance in their certification and accreditation processes. The reported percentage of systems certified and accredited for operation as of the first half of 2004 was 63 percent for 24 major federal agencies. However, the picture is not uniform across the government, with 7 of the agencies reporting greater than 90 percent of their systems certified and accredited but 6 reporting fewer than half. GAO's analyses also highlighted instances in which agencies do not consistently report FISMA performance measurement data, as well as other factors that lessen the usefulness of these data, such as the limited assurance of data reliability and quality. All the agencies GAO surveyed reported that their certification and accreditation processes met criteria consistent with those identified in federal guidance, such as a current risk assessment and security control evaluation. However, our review of documentation for the certification and accreditation of 32 selected systems at four of these agencies showed that these criteria were not always met--results similar to those found by agency inspectors general. Further, three of these four agencies did not have routine quality review processes to determine whether such criteria are met--processes that could help agency accrediting officials receive consistent information on which to base their decisions. Several agencies cited obstacles in implementing their certification and accreditation processes, including resource and staffing limitations.

As currently described in its  Circular A-130, OMB requires federal agencies to ensure that a  management official authorizes in writing the use of each general support  system or major application based on implementation of its security plan  before beginning or significantly changing its processing. This  management approval, or accreditation, is the authorization of an IT  system to process, store, or transmit information that provides a form of  quality control and challenges managers and technical staff to find the best  fit for security given technical constraints, operational constraints, and  mission requirements. The accreditation decision is based on the  implementation of an agreed-upon set of management, operational, and  technical controls for a system, and is supported by a comprehensive  evaluation or certification of these security controls that provides the  necessary information for a management official to formally declare that a  system is approved to operate at an acceptable level of risk. OMB policy  also specifies the following:   Security staff should not make the accreditation decision.

According to  OMB, it also monitors the certification and accreditation of major systems  through the budget process with the possibility that funding could be  denied for those IT investments that do not meet security requirements,  such as not being fully certified and accredited prior to becoming  operational. In addition, in its fiscal year 2003 report to the Congress, OMB  outlined a plan of action to improve performance in IT security that  identifies specific steps it will pursue to assist agencies. One such step  concerns the President\u2019s Management Agenda Scorecard, where one  criterion that agencies must meet to \u201cget to green\u201d under the Expanding E-Government Scorecard for IT security is to attain certification and  accreditation for 90 percent of their operational IT systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FISMA-Required Standards and Guidance Are Important Considerations", "paragraphs": ["NIST has issued a number of information security standards and guidance  documents that contribute to the certification and accreditation process,  such as its guidance on conducting risk assessments and on the format and  content of security plans.

Among  other things, the interim guidance encouraged the use of NIST\u2019s Security  Self-Assessment Guide for Information Technology Systems for  conducting certification reviews, which uses an extensive questionnaire  containing specific control objectives and techniques against which an  unclassified system or group of interconnected systems can be tested and  measured."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responsible Agencies Provide Guidance for National Security Systems", "paragraphs": ["Because OMB\u2019s authorities and NIST guidance are not applicable to  national security systems, agencies responsible for these systems have also  issued certification and accreditation guidance. The processes and criteria  established by this guidance are similar to those required by NIST guidance  for non-national security systems, that is, they require risk assessments,  verification of security requirements in a security plan or other document,  testing of security controls, and formal authorization by an authorizing  official (or designated approving/accrediting authority, as referred to by  some agencies). Guidance issued by other agencies include the following:   DOD Directive 8500.1 on information assurance requires the heads of all  components to comply with established accreditation processes  required for all DOD information systems, and DOD Instruction Number  5200.40 creates the DOD Information Technology Security  Certification and Accreditation Process (DITSCAP) for both  unclassified and classified automated information systems, networks,  and sites in the department. Organized within four phases\u2014definition,  verification, validation, and post accreditation\u2014a key element of  DITSCAP is the development of an agreement among the program  manager, the designated approving authority, the certification authority,  and the user representative during the definition phase. This agreement  (the System Security Authorization Agreement) is used throughout the  entire DITSCAP to guide actions, document decisions, specify security  requirements, document certification tailoring and level of effort,  identify potential solutions, and maintain operational systems security.", "The National Information Assurance Certification and Accreditation  Process, issued by the DOD-chaired National Security  Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee  (now the Committee on National Security Systems), establishes  minimum national standards for certifying and accrediting national  security systems. A key element of this guidance is the agreement  among the program manager, designated approving authority  (accreditor), certification agent (certifier), and user representative, who  resolve critical schedule, budget, security, functionality, and  performance issues. Agreements are documented in a System Security  Authorization Agreement, which is used to guide and document the  results of the certification and accreditation.", "Director of Central Intelligence Directive 6/3, Protecting Sensitive  Compartmented Information Within Information Systems, and its  implementation manual provide policy and procedures for the security  and protection of systems that create, process, store, and transmit  intelligence information, as well as define and mandate the use of a risk  management process and a certification and accreditation process.  The certification process described by this guidance includes validation  that appropriate levels of concern for integrity and availability and an  appropriate confidentiality protection level have been selected from  tables and descriptions provided in the implementation manual, and that  required safeguards have been implemented as described in the system  security plan.

Our analysis also highlighted inconsistencies in the  way agencies report such certification and accreditation performance data.  For example, national security systems are included in some reported  agency totals, but not in others.

For example, 7 agencies  reported more than 90 percent of their systems were certified and  accredited for the first half of fiscal year 2004, including the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission, which reported 100 percent. In contrast,  6 agencies reported less than half of their systems were certified and  accredited, including the Department of Housing and Urban Development,  which reported none.

On the other hand, some showed  decreasing percentages, including Veterans Affairs (-27 percentage points)  and Agriculture (-14 percentage points).", "In responding to our survey, agencies cited several reasons why not all of  their systems were certified and accredited. These reasons included  systems\u2019 being decommissioned or retired; agency efforts\u2019 being focused  on the most critical systems, with the less critical systems\u2019 being scheduled  later; higher priority operational requirements and limited funding; and  legacy systems\u2019 being unable to support required technical controls.", "Our analysis of survey responses also highlighted instances in which  agencies report performance measurement data differently. For example,  some agencies, such as Energy, include both non-national security and  national security systems in their reported performance data, while others,  such as NASA, do not include their national security systems. As another  example, DOD includes systems with interim authorization to operate  among those systems reported as certified and accredited because,  according to DOD officials, interim authorizations still represent a  management approval to operate. In contrast, the National Science  Foundation does not report systems with interim authorization to operate  as certified and accredited. OMB instructions for fiscal year 2003 FISMA  reporting were not specific regarding whether national security systems  should be reflected in agency performance measurement data nor did they  address how to report systems with interim authorization to operate. OMB  representatives indicated that national security systems are to be reflected  in reporting performance measurement data and that only systems granted  full authorization to operate should be considered in reporting the number  of systems certified and accredited. Clarification of such issues in future  FISMA guidance would improve consistency and comparability of agency- reported FISMA information.", "In analyzing these and future results indicated by agency-reported  percentages of systems authorized after certification and accreditation, it is  also important to consider several factors that lessen the usefulness of  performance measurement data being reported by the agencies for FISMA.", "As first discussed in our March 2004 testimony, these factors include the  following:   Limited assurance of data reliability and quality. The FISMA  performance measures reported by the agencies are primarily based on  self-assessments and are not independently validated. OMB did not  require IGs to validate agency responses to the performance measures,  but did instruct them to assess the reliability of the data for the subset of  systems they evaluate as part of their independent evaluations.  Nonetheless, some IG evaluations did identify problems with data  reliability and quality that could affect agency performance data. For  example, for the performance measurement on the number of agency  systems authorized for processing after certification and accreditation,  six IGs indicated different results from those reported by their agencies,  for reasons such as out-of-date certifications and accreditations.  Further, as we discuss later in more detail, other IGs identified problems  with the quality of the certifications and accreditations, such as security  control reviews not being performed. OMB\u2019s requirement for IGs to  assess the reliability of such information as part of their FISMA  responsibilities could provide valuable information on the quality of  reported FISMA information and assist management and Congress in  their FISMA oversight. For example, for certifications and  accreditations for the subset of systems they review, the IGs could  determine whether the agencies met specific criteria, including a  current risk assessment and security plan, control testing, and  contingency planning and determine whether such information is  accurately reflected in the agencies\u2019 compilation of related performance  measures.", "Accuracy of agency system inventories. The total number of agency  systems is a key element in OMB\u2019s performance measures, in that  agency progress is indicated by the percentage of total systems that  meet specific information security requirements. Thus, inaccurate or  incomplete data on the total number of agency systems affects the  percentage of systems shown as meeting the requirements. FISMA  requires that each agency develop, maintain, and annually update an  inventory of major information systems operated by the agency or under  its control. However, according to their fiscal year 2003 FISMA reports,  only 13 of the 24 agencies reported that they had completed their system  inventories. Further, independent evaluations by IGs for 3 of these 13  agencies did not agree that system inventories were complete. Although  we recently reported that all 24 agencies now report they develop and  maintain the FISMA-required inventory of major information systems,  maintaining an accurate inventory will continue to be a key element of  agency performance measures and in ensuring that information security  programs cover all agency systems.", "Further refinement of performance measures. Refinement of FISMA  performance measurement data is needed to provide better information  on the status of agencies\u2019 information security efforts. For example,  OMB currently requires agencies to report performance data in  aggregate for the total number of agency systems, but does not require  information that could be used to better assess the quality of  certifications and accreditations performed, such as reporting systems  according to their risk or security category, which would help indicate  whether agencies are prioritizing their efforts according to risk and  focusing on their most important systems. All the agencies responding  to our survey indicated that they did prioritize their certification and  accreditation efforts to focus on their most important systems.  However, during our review of certifications and accreditations  processes at the four agencies we visited, we noted that system  prioritization was not always used to monitor overall activity. In fact, at  one agency, system priority was not indicated in its overall inventory of  systems, and one system identified by the agency as a national critical  asset for critical infrastructure protection purposes had not been  certified and accredited. The agency has since acted to certify and  accredit this system, recently reporting its full accreditation as of June  2004. OMB has also recognized the need for further information on  agencies\u2019 certification and accreditation processes. According to its  fiscal year 2003 report to the Congress, in fiscal year 2004 FISMA  guidance, OMB planned to further emphasize security performance  measurement, including evolving performance measures to move  beyond status reporting to also identify the quality of the work done,  such as determining both the number of systems certified and  accredited and the quality of certification and accreditation conducted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Processes at Selected Agencies Do Not Ensure Consistent or Adequate Information", "paragraphs": ["Although agencies responding to our survey indicated that their  certification and accreditation processes required that specific criteria  identified in federal guidance be met, our review of certification and  accreditation documentation for selected systems at four agencies, as well  as IG FISMA evaluations for fiscal year 2003, noted instances in which  agencies do not consistently meet such criteria as a current risk  assessment and security control evaluation. Further, three of the four  agencies we reviewed had no routine processes to ensure that such criteria  are met.

However, in one area\u2014contingency plan testing\u20144 agencies (17 percent)  reported that their processes did not require documentation that plans  were tested. Two of these agencies reported that contingency plan testing  was not required because either they thought it was inappropriate for new  systems or their security program did not require such testing.

For example, only 22 of the 32 systems showed results of control  testing and only 19 systems had contingency plans. In addition,  documentation for only 17 of the systems identified the actual residual risk  being accepted by the accrediting official. Table 3 summarizes results for  these and other criteria for the agencies.", "As we recently testified, results of IG FISMA independent evaluations have  also demonstrated deficiencies in agencies\u2019 certifications and  accreditations. Some of their fiscal year 2003 FISMA reports identified  instances in which certifications and accreditations were not current and  controls were not tested. Others also recommended improvements in  agency processes. For example, for the Office of Personnel Management,  the IG recommended that the agency develop a procedure to ensure that all  documented findings and corrective actions are reviewed by both the  certification and accreditation officials and included in the certification  statement, accreditation statement, and plan of action and milestones  report.", "At the four agencies we reviewed, only the IGs at Commerce and Energy  specifically addressed certification and accreditation as part of their fiscal  year 2003 FISMA reporting. The Commerce IG recognized that the  department was undergoing changes in implementing new certification and  accreditation guidance, but reported cases in which system certification  was granted without evidence of testing. The Energy IG reported findings  that included lack of security control reviews and management  authorizations to operate systems, as well as risk assessments that were  incomplete or outdated and system security plans that were missing critical  elements or did not cover changes to their IT environment.", "Lastly, CIO offices at the four agencies we reviewed monitored the status of  system certifications and accreditations agencywide, but only one\u2014 Commerce\u2014routinely assessed the quality of its efforts. Largely to  facilitate FISMA reporting to OMB, the agencies all had processes to  update the status of system certification and accreditation activities,  ranging from periodic data calls at Energy to EPA\u2019s use of its Automated  Security Self-Evaluation and Remediation Tracking tool to centrally track  Web-enabled plans of action and milestones reports. These processes do  not ensure the quality of the certifications and accreditations, such as  whether the criteria identified in guidance are met. Such a quality control  process could facilitate accrediting officials consistently receiving  sufficient information on which to base their decisions, yet only Commerce  had an agencywide process to routinely ensure quality. As described by a  Commerce IT security official, the department has a continuous,  comprehensive control review process that includes annual program and  system evaluations through both self-assessments by component program  managers and compliance reviews by IT security officials under the  Commerce CIO. Specifically with regard to certification and accreditation,  the process includes the use of a checklist on the content and quality of the  documentation. Further, as part of the compliance review process, in fiscal  year 2003, Commerce conducted reviews to ensure that all the  department\u2019s classified, mission-critical, and national-critical systems met  legal and departmental requirements. These reviews included checks for  compliance with certification and accreditation criteria, such as risk  assessments, contingency plans, certifier\u2019s statements, and accreditation  letters. According to the Commerce official, such reviews will continue to  be conducted on a sample basis with all systems reviewed at least once  over a 3-year review cycle. An official at Energy also identified a process to  independently verify and validate that department\u2019s certification and  accreditation packages, but explained that due to the large number of  systems, this process has been limited to reviews for its headquarters  systems. This official added that to help address this issue, they are  working with the IG\u2019s office to have it begin conducting random reviews of  certification and accreditation packages this fall."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges and Obstacles to Agency Processes", "paragraphs": ["Through our survey and interviews with agency staff, agencies noted  several overall challenges or obstacles to efforts to certify and accredit  their systems. Funding and staffing issues were most commonly indicated,  including those associated with implementing the new NIST guidance.", "According to OMB\u2019s March 2004 report to the Congress, funding for IT  security has increased from $2.7 billion in FY 2002 to $4.2 billion in FY  2003. Nevertheless, a total of 18 agencies identified funding as a challenge  to performing their certifications and accreditations. For example,  Commerce noted that certification and accreditation was an expensive  process and that in order to develop and implement its program, it had to  reprogram and reprioritize internal funds and absorb costs in existing  funding levels. In another case, the Department of Health and Human  Services stated that because of limited funding, higher emphasis is placed  on using funds to certify and accredit new systems as opposed to existing  systems. Energy also noted that funding was a challenge because security  costs were not integrated into the overall life-cycle costs for all of its  systems. Despite these and other concerns related to security cost funding,  most agencies did not know how much they spent on certification and  accreditation. For example, only 11 agencies could identify their actual or  estimated costs for fiscal year 2003, which totaled $75.5 million for these  agencies.", "Nineteen of the agencies we surveyed also reported that they had  encountered staffing challenges for their certification and accreditation  activities that essentially consisted of the need for full-time staff with the  appropriate backgrounds, specialized skills, and security clearances. In  addition, 13 agencies reported challenges in providing training to staff or  officials responsible for certifying or accrediting agency systems.", "In Special Publication 800-37, NIST acknowledges that the cost of  conducting certifications and accreditations on large numbers of  information systems with varying degrees of complexity is a critical issue  facing agencies today. NIST suggests part of the solution is promoting the  reuse and sharing of security control development, implementation, and  assessment-related information in the agency\u2019s agencywide information  security program, including  employment of standardized security controls and methods for   development of standardized assessment plans, methods and  procedures to be used in security certifications and accreditations;  adoption, specification, and promulgation of standardized policies,  procedures, and documentation for common security program areas  (e.g., rules of behavior, system administration, auditing, system  monitoring, vulnerability scanning, management of user accounts,  configuration management, incident response, contingency planning,  and system maintenance);  refinement of policies, procedures, and documentation on a system-by- system basis, as needed, by preparing amendments or adding system- specific appendixes;  adoption, publication, and distribution (preferably in an online  database) of agency-prescribed or -developed security implementation  guidance;  establishment of a protected central repository, preferably online, for all  certification and accreditation documentation, acquisition-related  information, risk and vulnerability assessments, compliance surveys,  security incident reporting and remediation results, external security  audits, and making these easily accessible by appropriate agency  personnel; and  procurement of agencywide licenses for automated tools such as  vulnerability scanners, online security monitoring tools, audit reduction  tools, and certification and accreditation support tools.", "As another means to help address the cost of certification and  accreditation, the NIST guideline also highlights the importance of  leveraging the results of previous assessments and audits conducted on an  agency\u2019s information system or the particular products comprising that  system. Potential sources identified include commercial product testing  and evaluation programs, privacy impact assessments, physical security  assessments, self-assessments, and internal and external audits. According  to the guideline, these assessments and audits can support the security  certification and accreditation process by helping to gauge the  preparedness of an information system for security certification and  accreditation by examining the status of key security controls in the system  and by potentially being reused as evidence, when appropriate, during the  security certification and accreditation process. Further, evidence from  other assessments and audits can help reduce the potential cost of security  certification and accreditation, as well as increase the overall confidence in  the final certification and accreditation results.", "Although the NIST guideline emphasizes leveraging the results of previous  assessments and audits, it is important that agencies note the difference  between the level of control testing envisioned for annual FISMA testing  and that performed for system certification and accreditation. FISMA  requires agencies to periodically test and evaluate the effectiveness of  information security policies, procedures, and practices for each system  with a frequency depending on risk, but no less than annually. In contrast,  current OMB policy requires agencies to reaccredit their systems (which  also includes control testing) at least every 3 years. In its fiscal year 2003  FISMA reporting guidance, OMB distinguished between these two  requirements, explaining that annual FISMA testing is not of the  complexity required for certification and accreditation of systems as  described in NIST guidance. Rather, the FISMA provision recognizes the  importance of maintaining a continuous process of assessing risk and  ensuring that security controls maintain risk at an acceptable level and  underscores the need to understand the security status of each system in  order to accurately maintain system-level plans of action and milestones  and report annually on the overall health of an agency\u2019s IT security  program.", "During our review, agencies also identified some actions that can help  address identified challenges and contribute to more efficient and effective  certification and accreditation processes. In particular, citing proactive  senior management support as critical to the success of its program,  Commerce identified several actions, including that it has   informed program mangers of their responsibilities and held them  accountable for the security of IT resources;  redefined system boundaries to better organize certification and  accreditation efforts and manage systems;   collaborated to solve common obstacles and to optimize available  internal departmental resources both in the central security program  office and in other bureaus to overcome skills gaps and staff shortages;   provided role-based training that tailors certification and accreditation  requirements and responsibilities to those with IT security roles; and   reviewed mission critical and national critical systems to ensure that  they are in compliance with the department\u2019s security policy and  guidance.", "Other identified actions included those by Transportation, which maintains  a dedicated, trained, experienced staff of contractors as part of its  centralized certification process and provides training to system owners  during the certification process. In addition, as mentioned previously, EPA  has developed a tool to annually evaluate the risk in computer systems and  to produce and centrally track Web-enabled plans of action and milestones  reports. EPA is offering this tool to other agencies, including hosting the  tool for them at its National Computer Center. Lastly, 21 of the 24 agencies  surveyed reported that they used automated tools as part of their  certification and accreditation process for a number of functions, including  managing the process and developing documentation, tracking corrective  actions, configuration management, vulnerability scanning, penetration  testing, and technical controls testing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Certification and accreditation has become a key measure in determining  the status of agencies\u2019 information security programs, and NIST and other  agencies have provided overall guidance to assist agencies in establishing  effective certification and accreditation.

Further, agency  certifications and accreditations do not always meet criteria identified in  federal guidance. Unless such criteria are met, agencies cannot ensure that  accrediting officials are receiving consistent information on which to base  their decisions, and the value of this process as a management control for  ensuring information system security is limited. In addition, unverified  agency-reported performance data may not accurately reflect the status of  an agency\u2019s efforts to implement this requirement. Consistent reporting of  performance measurement data by agencies on their certifications and  accreditations, as well as additional information on the quality of agency  processes provided through both management oversight and independent  evaluation, would provide increased assurance for the administration and  the Congress that critical federal systems are meeting FISMA requirements  and do not contain significant security weaknesses that could threaten  essential federal operations.
