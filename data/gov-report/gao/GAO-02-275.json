Three of these programs, whose  funding is authorized by WIA under Title I to provide services to adults,  dislocated workers, and youth, replace those previously funded under the  Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA). These three new WIA programs,  authorized at about $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2001, have performance  measures established under WIA that states and localities must track in  order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the programs. These  performance measures gauge program results in the areas of job  placement, employment retention, and earnings change, as well as skill  attainment and customer satisfaction. States are held accountable by the  U.S. Department of Labor for their performance in these areas. If they fail  to meet their expected performance levels, they may suffer financial  sanctions; if they meet or exceed their levels, they may be eligible to  receive additional funds, called incentive grants.

It is difficult to know  whether or not a job seeker should be counted in the measure for a  program, even if he or she is served by the program. For example, a  participant in the adult program who is already employed must be  included in the retention and wage gain measures but cannot be  counted in the entered employment measure. Yet, for the dislocated  worker program, the entered employment measure can include those  who may be employed when they enter the program.", "Knowing when to measure performance for participants. The  data for different performance measures can be collected in different  quarters of the program year. For example, for customer satisfaction,  data can be collected at two points in time, depending on how the  participant exited the program (see fig. 1). Data on entered  employment for participants in the adult program are collected in the  third quarter after exit; retention data are collected in the fifth quarter  after exit.  Data on earnings change and replacement are collected at  two points in time: pre-program earnings data can be collected at  registration, and post-program earnings data are collected in the fifth  quarter after exit. If a program participant does not appear in the UI  wage records, local staff can collect supplemental data to establish  employment for the participant, but this must be recorded within 30  days after the WIA participant is found missing from the wage records.  For entered employment, staff can collect supplemental data in the  fourth quarter after a participant leaves (or exits) the program, but for  retention, staff can collect it in the sixth quarter after exit.  Supplemental data cannot be used to measure earnings change and  replacement. Because the timing of data collection is complex and can  be confusing, one local area in Oregon developed a tool it calls the  \u201cbean counter\u201d to help local staff determine when to follow-up with  participants so their performance counts in the calculations (see fig. 2).", "Knowing how to calculate the measures. In order to calculate the  measures, states must account for a variety of factors. The type and  combination of these factors determine the calculations that will be  used. For example, in calculating some of the measures for the adult  program, states must consider (1) whether the job seeker is employed  at registration, (2) whether he or she is employed at both the first and  third quarters after exit, and (3) whether the data source used to  confirm employment was UI records or supplemental data. This  information in various combinations results in 14 different ways that  adult participants can be grouped in order to calculate the measures.", "In addition to noting the complexity of the measures, state and local  officials said that the new measures taxed their resources. States had to  develop procedures to collect data for the new customer satisfaction  measure in compliance with detailed guidance from Labor. The guidance  calls for states to conduct a telephone survey from a random sample large  enough to obtain 500 completed surveys from both participants and  employers. Because this guidance changed over time, states had to revise  their procedures accordingly. For example, a revision to the guidance  issued in October 2001 required states to maintain an up-to-date list of  participants\u2019 names and addresses from which to sample\u2014a requirement  that was originally voluntary.", "One indication of states\u2019 progress in implementing these measures may be  reflected in their ability to submit complete quarterly reports.

To obtain employment and  earnings information, states match information collected on individual  WIA participants against state UI wage records. To access UI data from  the state agency that oversees the UI database, some states had to  establish data-sharing agreements. In Mississippi, for example, the agency  responsible for overseeing WIA\u2014the Mississippi Development Authority  (MDA)\u2014had to make arrangements with the agency that oversees the UI  data\u2014the Mississippi Employment Security Commission\u2014to have them  match the wage records and provide the results to MDA.  In addition, some  states may be more rigorous in protecting the confidentiality of UI records  through privacy laws, which may add obstacles to collecting performance  data.

Consequently, program providers had  to enter into an agreement that established a protocol for collecting and  sharing the data\u2014one that developed safeguards to protect confidentiality.

One state official described  how local areas were carefully screening potential participants and  holding meetings to decide whether to register them. As a result,  individuals who are eligible for and may benefit from WIA-funded services  may not be receiving services that are tracked under WIA.", "Performance levels for the measures that track earnings change for adults  and earnings replacement for dislocated workers may be especially  problematic.  Several state officials reported that local staff were reluctant  to register already employed adults or dislocated workers.  Officials in one  state reported that some local areas had not yet registered any dislocated  workers. State and local officials explained that it would be hard to  increase the earnings of adults who are already employed or replace the  wages of dislocated workers, who are often laid off from high- paying, low- skilled jobs or from jobs that required skills that are now obsolete. In  addition, for dislocated workers, employers may provide severance pay or  workers might work overtime prior to a plant closure, increasing these  workers\u2019 earnings before they are dislocated. As a result, many dislocated  workers who come to the one-stop center have earned high wages just  prior to being dislocated, making it hard to replace\u2014let alone increase\u2014  their earnings. If high wages are earned before dislocation and lower  wages are earned after job placement through WIA, the wage change will  be negative, depressing the wage replacement level. As a result, a local  area may not meet its performance level for this measure, discouraging  service to those who may need it.", "A hypothetical example involving two workers dislocated at the same time  illustrates this point (see table 3). One worker is a sales clerk with limited  skills earning $25,000, the other a long-time factory worker with obsolete  skills earning $60,000. Both are laid off from work and go to their local  one-stop center seeking job placement assistance. The clerk is placed in a  new job as a receptionist paying $25,000. By calculating his wage  replacement from his salary as a clerk, the one-stop can claim a wage  replacement rate of 100 percent. The factory worker eventually gets a job  as a security guard earning $30,000, netting a wage replacement rate of 50  percent. As this example shows, a one-stop center can meet its  performance levels more easily by serving the clerk than by serving the  factory worker even though both job seekers may need the one-stop  system\u2019s resources to find a job or enhance their skills.", "Some states and Labor are making efforts to address this disincentive to  serve certain job seekers. Indiana instituted a policy allowing local areas  to adjust their dislocated worker wage replacement rate in light of the  significant dislocations they are facing. Texas uses a regression model to  establish local performance levels that adjust for differences in factors,  such as economic conditions and the characteristics of individuals served.  Without this policy, said a Texas official, WIA programs would have  registered fewer workers. Similarly, Michigan substantially reduced the  penalties to local areas for failing to meet performance levels and found  that the number of registered participants increased as a result of  instituting less threatening sanctions. WIA requires that states be allowed  to renegotiate their performance levels based on unanticipated  circumstances. Labor is currently developing criteria that states can use to  renegotiate their performance levels based on unanticipated  circumstances, such as changes in economic conditions due to plant  closings or shifts in unemployment for the current and future years.

While there are various reasons that performance data are not  comparable, one of the chief reasons is the lack of clear guidance for  collecting and reporting performance data on participants. Labor has  provided detailed written guidance to states on who should be registered  under WIA and when this registration should occur, but the guidance is  open to interpretation in some areas. The lack of a uniform  understanding of when registration occurs and thus who should be  counted toward the measures raises questions about both the accuracy  and comparability of states\u2019 performance data. For example, the guidance  tells states to register adults and dislocated workers who need significant  staff assistance designed to help with job seeking or acquiring  occupational skills, but the state can decide what constitutes significant  staff assistance. The guidance provides examples of when to register job  seekers, but it sometimes requires staff to make subtle and subjective  distinctions. For example, those who receive initial assessment of skill  levels and the need for supportive services are not to be registered; those  requiring comprehensive assessment or staff-assisted job search and  placement assistance, including career counseling, are to be registered. In  another example involving the classification of workshops, job seekers  who participate are to be registered in some cases, but not in others.", "Labor has allowed states and local areas flexibility in implementing the  registration policy, and we found that local areas differed on when they  registered WIA job seekers. In one local area we visited, the one-stop  center registers most job seekers who come into the center, even if staff  assistance is minimal. At this center, a general orientation is sufficient for  the job seeker to be registered under WIA. In contrast, another center in  the same state registers only those job seekers who require significant  staff assistance and are likely to benefit from intensive services. Similar  disparities occurred in other states we visited. Labor has said there is little  consistency across states in registering participants and has convened a  work group to develop additional guidance on registration, but as yet, the  issues remain unresolved.", "The lack of a definition for the credential measure is also leading to  performance data that are not accurate or comparable across states. Labor  allows the states and local areas to determine what constitutes a  credential and to develop a statewide list of approved credentials with  input from employers. Because states and, in many cases, local areas must  define what constitutes a credential, what is currently counted as a  credential differs within and across states. Some states may strictly define  credentials to include only diplomas from accredited institutions or use  only formal training completion criteria as defined by education partners.  Other states may expand their criteria to count a broad variety of  credentials, such as job readiness, on-the-job experience, and completion  of workshops. Labor officials note that states\u2019 performance levels for the  credential measure are negotiated to take state and local definitions into  account, and the measure is intended to help local employers gauge the  readiness and skill level of job seekers. Nevertheless, given the broad  range of definitions states and localities employ, the outcomes on the  credential measure may be of limited value, even within a single state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Using UI Wage Record Data Also May Affect the Accuracy and Comparability of Performance Data", "paragraphs": ["UI wage records are one of the best available data sources for tracking the  employment and earnings of individuals\u2014a significant improvement over  the less objective self-reporting methods of JTPA\u2014but the limitations of  the database pose challenges that need to be addressed. These challenges,  if unresolved, may hinder states\u2019 ability to meet their performance levels.  As we have reported in prior work, one such limitation is that UI wage  records, while covering about 94 percent of workers, exclude certain  employment categories, such as self-employed persons, most independent  contractors, military personnel, federal government workers, and postal  workers. States, therefore, must develop alternative methods to track WIA  participants who are employed in these uncovered occupations.  Pennsylvania, for example, developed a partnership with other states in its  region to share the cost of purchasing the rights to federal civil service and  military personnel data. And Florida has developed agreements with the  Department of Defense, the Office of Personnel Management, and the U.S.  Postal Service to access employment and wage information on an annual  basis. Our survey data indicate that 33 states are using additional or  supplemental data to compensate for uncovered occupations, with only 27  of those using the supplemental data to count towards their performance  levels. Thus, at least 23 states have not used additional data to help them  meet their performance levels.", "Another limitation is that state UI databases include only wage record  information on job seekers who get jobs within their state; they do not  track job seekers who find jobs in other states. States cannot readily  access UI wage records from other states to track outcomes under WIA,  making it difficult to track individuals who receive services in one state  but get a job in another. Over one-third of all of the states we surveyed  reported that an estimated 16 to 30 percent of cases are not being picked  up by their state\u2019s UI wage record system. To fill in these gaps, seven  states have agreements with other states\u2014often those that share a  common border\u2014to exchange UI information. Indiana, for example,  established an agreement with Illinois to trade data. If data are missing on  particular participants, Illinois sends the cases to Indiana to see if the  Indiana UI wage records have information on the job seeker. The value of  these agreements, however, may be limited because job seekers may find  work in a state that does not have an agreement with the one in which  they received services.", "Another way to obtain UI data on workers who are employed out of state  is through WRIS, a clearinghouse that makes UI wage records available to  states seeking employment and wage information on their WIA  participants. This information can provide outcome data on WIA  participants to help states meet their performance levels. While WRIS was  available for states to use by July 2001, only 7 out of the 50 states are  currently able and ready to participate, with 8 others in various stages of  completing the requirements for participation. Although many states have  shown an interest in a system such as WRIS, many are reluctant to  participate because Labor, while agreeing to cover all the costs of  operating WRIS for its first year, has not yet agreed to pay for subsequent  years. The estimated total cost of operating WRIS is $2 million annually,  but states have not been given a definitive answer about how much it  would cost them to participate after this first year if Labor does not  continue funding. Because of this uncertainty regarding future costs,  states are hesitant to commit to participation in WRIS. If not all states  participate, the value of WRIS will be diminished\u2014even for participating  states\u2014because no data will be available from nonparticipating states\u2019 UI  wage records."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Timely Data Limits Use of Performance Measures for Short-Term Program Management", "paragraphs": ["The lack of timely data, due to the time lag in obtaining UI wage records,  makes it difficult for state and local officials to use the performance  measures for short-term program management\u2014because, for the wage- related measures, current available data on the measures will reflect  performance from the previous program year. While UI wage records are  the best available data source for documenting employment, the data  collection and reporting process is slow and time-consuming. Data are  generally collected from employers only once every quarter, and  employers have 30 days after the quarter ends to report the data. In many  states, employers\u2014especially small businesses\u2014are allowed to submit  data in paper format, which then must be converted to electronic media.  After data entry, information must be checked for errors and corrected. All  of these steps take time. As a result, WIA program administrators are  unable to get a timely picture of program performance. For example, we  asked states in our survey how quickly job placement outcome data would  be available to them from UI wage records. On the basis of our survey, we  found that for 30 states, the earliest time period that job placement data  would be available is 6 months or more after an individual entered  employment, with 15 states reporting that it may take 9 months or longer.  Similarly, for the employment retention measure, over half of states report  that obtaining this information could take a year or longer. (See fig. 3.)", "The time delay in receiving UI wage record data makes it difficult for state  and local officials to use the performance measures to gauge the  effectiveness of their services. States report that not being able to get  performance results in the same program year is a problem: it makes it  difficult to manage programs and improve one-stop services. Labor reports  that the performance measures are not intended to be a management tool.  State and local officials, therefore, must develop alternative methods if  they want to assess the quality of their services so they can identify  problems and improve programs in a timely way. Labor has encouraged  these efforts, but, while some local areas are finding ways to collect data  to help them manage their programs, there is no cohesive effort at the  federal level to share strategies and promising approaches for the Adult  and Dislocated Worker Programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Existing Performance Measures Fail to Gauge Overall One- Stop Performance", "paragraphs": ["Although there are performance measures for the three WIA-funded  programs and most of the programs required to provide services in the  one-stop, no measures exist to assess how well the overall one-stop  systems are working. The success of the one-stop system as a whole is not  captured by the program measures of individual one-stop partners.  Furthermore, combining the performance measures from mandatory  programs does not provide a comprehensive picture of one-stop  performance. Even when measures appear the same, comparing them is  difficult because of differences in definitions and calculations. Beyond  failing to provide a complete evaluation of one-stop performance, state  officials reported that the separate reporting requirements of the partner  programs have hampered coordination within their one-stop systems.  While WIA did not establish any comprehensive measures to assess the  overall one-stop system, it required that Labor take the lead in developing  optional measures to help states assess progress toward their workforce  investment goals.  Labor has made limited progress on such performance  measures, and only a few states have developed their own overall  measures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Existing Performance Measures Fail to Capture Important One-Stop Features", "paragraphs": ["The existing performance measures for participating one-stop programs  fail to capture important one-stop features. First, it is difficult to get an  unduplicated count of job seekers using the one-stop. While an individual  may have multiple outcome measures for the services received through  each of the programs at a one-stop, there is no single outcome measure for  multiple services. In addition, separate reporting systems for each of the  programs make it difficult to disaggregate data and track an individual\u2019s  outcome for those receiving multiple services.", "Second, other important aspects of one-stop performance are not included  within the existing measures. Customer satisfaction measures used in  support of WIA-funded programs and the Employment Service fail to  measure how job seekers and employers believe they are being served by  the one-stop system as a whole. Instead, these measures show satisfaction  with the individual programs. Employer satisfaction is important under  WIA because WIA created a more private-sector driven system. Capturing  customer satisfaction of the system as a whole would reflect whether job  seekers are successful at attaining the services they need to get jobs and  would assess whether employers are satisfied with job applicants sent to  them from different one-stop programs.", "Finally, state and local officials expressed concern that a large portion of  one-stop participants are not included in performance measures. Many job  seekers use self-service and informational activities but they are not  tracked and counted in any program measures. While staff time and  resources are used to establish and maintain self-service resource rooms  and web sites, job seekers who use only these services will not be  included in any of the performance measures. Without any information on  individuals who use self-service, it will be difficult for Labor to show how  effectively one-stops are being used."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Measures Cannot Be Used to Measure the One-Stop System\u2019s Performance", "paragraphs": ["Performance measures for different programs often track similar  outcomes, as figure 4 shows. However, the measures cannot be combined  to obtain an overall view of one-stop performance. Although the same  terms are used in various performance measures, their definitions are not  identical. For example, while WIA older and younger youth programs  define youth as being between the ages of 14 and 21, the laws governing  Job Corps and HUD\u2019s Youthbuild define youth as being between the ages  of 16 and 24. Similarly, the definition of veterans is different for the  Employment Service and Veterans\u2019 Employment and Training Service  program. The differences in definitions mean that assessing the outcomes  for youth or veterans by combining the performance measures of  individual programs within the one-stop setting would be difficult.", "Besides variations in definitions, there are also variations in how measures  are calculated in different programs. For example, while the entered  employment rate for WIA\u2019s adult program is defined as the percentage of  workers who get a job by the end of the first quarter after exit, the entered  employment rate for the Employment Service is defined as the percentage  of workers who get a job or changed employers in the first or second  quarter after registration. As a result, performance data from these  separate programs cannot be combined to yield a single overall score to  assess various performance outcomes of the one-stop system. The Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) convened a work group representing  federal WIA partners to look at common definitions and measures across  programs, which may issue guidance to states and localities on WIA  performance measures and federal requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Separate Measures May Impede Coordination", "paragraphs": ["Beyond failing to provide an overall picture of one-stop performance, state  officials reported that separate performance measures impede the  cooperation of one-stop partners. As a result, even though WIA was  meant to establish a more coordinated workforce development system  through the use of one-stops, over one-third of states surveyed expressed  concern that individual program performance measures may impede this  process. Some states even believed that separate measures caused  competition among programs. They said that if staff did not understand  that a participant could be counted in more than one program, they might  not direct them to other one-stop programs. For example, one state  reported in its written comments to our survey that competition for  participants and duplication of services due to lack of coordination with  other programs would continue as long as each program is required to  meet its own performance and participation levels. Fourteen states  volunteered in their written comments to our survey that the federal  government should work to coordinate performance measures across  programs or develop systemwide measures. In addition, while states agree  that systemwide measures are needed, they caution against making any  additional measures mandatory, since states are still adapting to the  existing measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Progress on Developing Performance Measures for One-Stop Systems", "paragraphs": ["Although WIA did not establish one-stop measures, it does require that  Labor develop additional optional measures to assist states in assessing  progress toward their workforce investment goals, which Labor has  interpreted to include one-stop measures. Labor began developing  workforce development performance measures to capture overall one- stop use after one-stop systems were piloted. Since the passage of WIA,  Labor has continued its efforts to develop systemwide measures, but it has  made limited progress. Labor convened a working group in September  2001 to develop additional indicators of one-stop performance. Partner  representatives at this group included national workforce-related  organizations including the National Association of State Workforce  Agencies, National Governors\u2019 Association, National Association of  Counties, U.S. Conference of Mayors, and representatives of states and  regional boards. This group is working to develop a menu of indicators  that will help provide a comprehensive picture of WIA system activity.  Such measures may include capturing information on self-service  customers and the cost of services at the one-stop.These measures,  while optional, would help provide information on overall one-stop use  across the country if all states report on at least some of the measures.  Labor plans to have guidelines for these optional indicators in place for  use in program year 2002, which begins on July 1, 2002. In order for states  to be able to implement them for the coming program year, Labor will  need to provide final guidance well before July 2002.", "In addition to these national efforts, some states, on their own initiative,  have attempted to develop additional measures for one-stop systems, but  these efforts are not coordinated and do not allow for nationwide  assessment of the one-stop system. According to our survey, eight states  have created or are developing additional systemwide measures, but of  those, only three are reporting them to Labor. Pennsylvania, for example,  developed five measures specific to its one-stop system\u2019s performance.  These indicators, intended to measure the overall effectiveness of the one- stop system, include median cycle time to fill a job, and the percentage of  employers and individuals using services through the one-stop. Florida, on  the other hand, has developed \u201ctiers\u201d of measures that focus on the  outcome of their workforce development programs. In the first tier, state- generated systemwide indicators measure many employment and training  programs together. The second tier clusters similar types of programs and  captures measures relevant to particular groups (e.g., continued education  status of youth in youth programs). The third tier captures all the federally  mandated measurements, as well as measures for the other tiers, such as  caseloads for specific programs. In this way, Florida has attempted to  measure the system overall as well as outcomes for individual programs.  Measures developed by other states include the number of people using  the resource rooms at one-stops and the increase over time in the number  of unemployed people getting a job. Despite these states\u2019 efforts, the  absence of nationally established systemwide measures means that Labor  cannot ensure nationwide comparability."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["WIA represents a fundamental shift in the way federally funded  employment and training services are provided to job seekers and in the  way WIA programs measure and monitor success. Despite obstacles, in  just over a year states have made good progress in implementing the new  requirements under WIA\u2014developing new processes and designing new  systems. Labor, for its part, has been working to find ways to allow states  and localities greater flexibility to design their programs to meet local  needs and has been actively seeking opportunities for states to have input  into the process, particularly in the area of performance measurement. But  given the challenges states have faced in implementing the new  performance measurement system, more time is needed before the  measures can meaningfully gauge the success of the programs.", "This new performance measurement system under WIA is a high-stakes  game\u2014a state\u2019s future funding and, therefore, its ability to serve its  citizens may depend upon how well it performs compared to how well it is  expected to perform. It should be no surprise that states and localities are  designing their systems and processes in ways that will enhance their  ability to meet their performance levels. Because states see the current  performance levels as too high for the current economy, states and  localities may choose not to serve those job seekers who may be helped by  their services, but who may not help in achieving their negotiated  performance levels. Unless the performance levels can be adjusted to truly  reflect differences in economic conditions and the population served, local  areas will continue to have a disincentive to serve some job seekers that  could be helped.", "WIA\u2019s requirement to use UI data to track outcomes is a step in the right  direction\u2014it provides federal, state, and local government entities with an  objective means to evaluate program success. But it brings challenges that  need to be addressed, and states will need help to do so. Establishing the  means to routinely share data across state lines through WRIS and  developing ways to share promising approaches in the use of  supplemental data sources and in managing the assessment of short-term  program needs would go far in moderating these challenges. Without this  help and the cooperative efforts of states and localities toward this end,  developing a useful performance measurement system will take longer and  cost more.", "In general, WIA\u2019s performance measurement system captures some useful  information, but it may not capture all the right information. The measure  to track credentials has limited value because it lacks a standard definition  for what\u2019s being measured. For other measures, the lack of clear  definitions for whom to track limits their usefulness in drawing  conclusions about program success at both the state and national levels.  Without clear definitions and processes, the measures will not provide the  Congress with a true picture of how well the programs are performing.  Furthermore, WIA performance measures gauge only WIA-funded  services; yet there is widespread agreement that measures are needed to  gauge the effectiveness of the entire one-stop system. The system\u2019s narrow  focus on program outcomes for a limited number of participants misses a  key requirement of WIA to support the movement toward a coordinated  system. In fact, the measures may foster the opposite\u2014a siloed approach  that encourages competition among programs and limits their  cooperation. Without global one-stop measures, the Congress will not be  able to assess how well states and localities are doing in meeting WIA\u2019s  requirement to coordinate services.
