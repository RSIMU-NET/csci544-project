In 2001, DOD established the joint UAV Planning Task Force in the Office of the Secretary of Defense to promote a common vision for UAV-related efforts and to establish interoperability standards. To communicate its vision and promote UAV interoperability, the task force issued the 2002 UAV Roadmap. While the Roadmap provides some strategic guidance for the development of UAV technology, neither the Roadmap nor other documents represent a comprehensive strategic plan to ensure that the services and other DOD agencies focus development efforts on systems that complement each other, will perform the range of priority missions needed, and avoid duplication. Moreover, the Task Force has only advisory authority and, as such, cannot compel the services to adopt its suggestions. GAO's prior work supports the need for effective oversight of individual UAV programs at the departmental level. UAVs have suffered from requirements growth, risky acquisition strategies, and uncertain funding support within the services. Some programs have been terminated. Success has been achieved as a result of top-level intervention and innovative acquisition approaches. For example, in 2003, the Office of the Secretary of Defense had to intervene to keep the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle program viable. As UAV programs grow in the future, they will face challenges in the form of increased funding competition, greater demand for capabilities, and spectrum and airspace limitations. Moreover, UAVs are no longer an additional \"nice-to-have\" capability; they are becoming essential to the services' ability to conduct modern warfare. Meeting these challenges will require continued strong leadership, building on the UAV Roadmap and Planning Task Force as GAO has recommended."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the  major management issues that we identified in our current and prior work  on the research, development, and fielding of the latest generation of  unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) by the Department of Defense (DOD).

Generally, UAVs consist of the aerial vehicle; a flight control station;  information and retrieval or processing stations; and, sometimes, wheeled  land vehicles that carry launch and recovery platforms.", "UAVs have been used in a variety of forms and for a variety of missions for  many years. After the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 spy plane in 1960,  certain UAVs were developed to monitor Soviet and Chinese nuclear  testing. Israel used UAVs to locate Syrian radars and was able to destroy  the Syrian air defense system in Lebanon in 1982. The United States has  used UAVs in the Persian Gulf War, Bosnia, Operation Enduring Freedom,  and Operation Iraqi Freedom for intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance missions and to attack a vehicle carrying suspected  terrorists in Yemen in 2002. The United States is also considering using  UAVs to assist with border security for homeland security or homeland  defense.", "The current generation of UAVs has been under development for defense  applications since the 1980s. UAVs won considerable acceptance during  military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003, respectively.  They were used in these operations to observe, track, target, and in some  cases strike enemy forces. These and similar successes have heightened  interest in UAVs within DOD and the services. In fact, by 2010, DOD plans  to have at least 14 different UAVs in the force structure to perform a  variety of missions. Moreover, in the fiscal year 2001 National Defense  Authorization Act, Congress established the goal that one-third of the Air  Force\u2019s deep-strike capability be provided by UAVs by 2010.", "The overall management of UAV programs has gone full circle. In 1989 the  DOD Director of Defense Research and Engineering set up the UAV Joint  Project Office as a single DOD organization with management  responsibility for UAV programs. With the Navy as the Executive Agency,  within 4 years the Joint Project Office came under criticism for a lack of  progress. Replacing the office in 1993, DOD created the Defense Airborne  Reconnaissance Office as the primary management oversight and  coordination office for all departmentwide manned and unmanned  reconnaissance. In 1998, however, this office also came under criticism for  its management approach and slow progress in fielding UAVs. In that same  year, this office was dissolved and UAV program development and  acquisition management was given to the services, while the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications and  Intelligence was assigned to provide oversight for the Secretary of  Defense."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s New Report Calls for Improved Strategic Planning", "paragraphs": ["Our report being issued today (Force Structure: Improved Strategic  Planning Can Enhance DOD\u2019s Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Efforts, GAO- 04-342, Mar. 17, 2004) analyzes recent funding trends for UAVs and makes  recommendations to strengthen DOD\u2019s strategic planning and  management approach for UAVs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "UAV Funding Has Increased", "paragraphs": ["During the past 5 fiscal years, Congress provided funding for UAV  development and procurement that exceeds the amounts requested by  DOD, and to date the services have obligated about 99 percent of these  funds.

While high-level DOD strategic-planning  documents\u2014such as the National Military Strategy, the Joint Vision 2020,  and the Defense Planning Guidance\u2014provide some general  encouragement to pursue transformational technologies, including the  development of UAVs, these documents do not provide any specific  guidance on developing and integrating UAVs into the force structure.", "At the same time, while the Joint Requirements Oversight Council has  reviewed several UAVs and issued guidance for some systems, neither the  Joint Staff nor the council has issued any guidance that would establish a  strategic plan or overarching architecture for DOD\u2019s current and future  UAVs. In June 2003, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff created the  Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System to provide a top- down capability-based process. Under the system, five boards have been  chartered, each representing a major warfighting capability area as  follows: (1) command and control, (2) force application, (3) battle space  awareness, (4) force protection, and (5) focused logistics. Each board has  representatives from the services, the combatant commanders, and certain  major functions of the Under Secretary of Defense. Each board is tasked  with developing a list of capabilities needed to conduct joint operations in  its respective functional areas. The transformation of these capabilities is  expected, and the boards are likely to identify specific capabilities that can  be met by UAVs. Nonetheless, according to Joint Staff officials, these  initiatives will not result in an overarching architecture for UAVs.  However, the identification of capabilities that can be met by UAVs is  expected to help enhance the understanding of DOD\u2019s overall requirement  for UAV capabilities.", "Moreover, according to officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense,  the UAV Roadmap was not intended to provide an overarching  architecture for UAVs. The Roadmap does state that it is intended to assist  DOD decision makers in building a long-range strategy for UAV  development and acquisition in such future planning efforts as the  Quadrennial Defense Review. Nonetheless, the Roadmap represents a  start on a strategic plan because it incorporates some of the key  components of strategic planning, as shown below:  Long-term goals\u2014The Roadmap states its overall purpose and  what it hopes to encourage the services to attain. The Roadmap  refers to the Defense Planning Guidance\u2019s intent for UAVs as a  capability and indicates that the guidance encourages the rapid  advancement of this capability. At the same time, it does not  clearly state DOD\u2019s overall or long-term goals for its UAV efforts.  Similarly, while it states that it wants to provide the services with  clear direction, it does not clearly identify DOD\u2019s vision for its UAV  force structure through 2027.", "Approaches to obtain long-term goals\u2014The Roadmap\u2019s  \u201cApproach\u201d section provides a strategy for developing the  Roadmap and meeting its goal. This approach primarily deals with  identifying requirements and linking them to needed UAV payload  capabilities, such as sensors and associated communication links.  The approach then ties these requirements to forecasted trends in  developing technologies as a means to try to develop a realistic  assessment of the state of the technology in the future and the  extent to which this technology will be sufficient to meet identified  requirements. At the same time, however, the Roadmap does not  provide a clear description of a strategy for defining how to  develop and integrate UAVs into the future force structure. For  example, the Roadmap does not attempt to establish UAV  development or fielding priorities, nor does it identify the most  urgent mission-capability requirements. Moreover, without the  sufficient identification of priorities, the Roadmap cannot link  these priorities to current or developing UAV programs and  technology.", "Performance goals\u2014The Roadmap established 49 specific  performance goals for a variety of tasks. Some of these goals are  aimed at fielding transformational capabilities without specifying  the missions to be supported. Others are to establish joint  standards and control costs. Nonetheless, of the 49 goals, only 1  deals directly with developing and fielding a specific category of  UAV platform to meet a priority mission-capability requirement\u2014 the suppression of enemy air defenses or strike electronic attack.  The remaining goals, such as developing heavy-fuel aviation  engines suitable for UAVs, are predominantly associated with  developing UAV or related technologies as well as UAV-related  standards and policies to promote more efficient and effective joint  UAV operations. However, the Roadmap does not establish overall  UAV program goals.", "Performance indicators\u2014Some of the 49 goals have  performance indicators that could be used to evaluate progress,  while others do not. Furthermore, the Roadmap does not establish  indicators that readily assess how well the program will meet the  priority mission capabilities.", "As the services and defense agencies pursue separate UAV programs, they  risk developing systems with duplicate capabilities, potentially higher  operating costs, and increased interoperability challenges. The House  Appropriations Committee was concerned that without comprehensive  planning and review, there is no clear path toward developing a UAV force  structure. Thus, the committee directed that each service update or create  a UAV roadmap. These roadmaps were to address the services\u2019 plans for  the development of future UAVs and how current UAVs are being  employed. Officials from each of the services indicated that their UAV  roadmap was developed to primarily address their individual service\u2019s  requirements and operational concepts. However, in their views, such  guidance as the Joint Vision 2020, National Military Strategy, and Defense  Planning Guidance did not constitute strategic plans for UAVs to guide the  development of their individual service\u2019s UAV roadmap. These officials  further stated that the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s 2002 UAV  Roadmap provided some useful guidance, but was not used to guide the  development of the service\u2019s UAV roadmaps. Moreover, they did not view  the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Roadmap as either a DOD-wide  strategic plan or an overarching architecture for integrating UAVs into the  force structure.

In the report released to you today, we make two  recommendations to assist DOD to enhance its management control over  the UAV program. We recommend that DOD establish a strategic plan or  set of plans based on mission requirements to guide UAV development and  fielding. We also recommend that DOD designate the joint UAV Planning  Task Force or another appropriate organization to oversee the  implementation of a UAV strategic plan. In responding to our report, DOD  stated that it partially concurred with the first recommendation but  preferred to address UAV planning through the Joint Capabilities  Integration and Development System process. DOD disagreed with the  second recommendation saying that it did not need to provide an  organization within the department with more authority because it  believes that the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Logistics, and  Technology already has sufficient authority to achieve DOD\u2019s UAV goals.", "Our report states clearly that we continue to support both  recommendations.

At that time, congressional committees had expressed  concern about duplication in the services\u2019 UAV programs, which ran  counter to the committees\u2019 wishes that DOD acquire UAVs to meet  common service needs. In 1988, we noted that DOD was to provide, at  minimum, a UAV master plan that (1) harmonized service requirements,  (2) utilized commonality to the maximum extent possible, and (3) made  trade-offs between manned and unmanned vehicles in order to provide  future cost savings. After budget deliberations for fiscal year 1988,  Congress eliminated separate service accounts for individual UAV  programs and consolidated that funding into a single Defense Agencies  account. This in turn led to the formation of DOD\u2019s UAV Joint Projects  Office, which promoted joint UAV efforts that would prevent unnecessary  duplication. This effort was led by the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance  Office within the Office of the Secretary of Defense, which has since been  disbanded.", "Our analysis of DOD\u2019s 1988 UAV master plan identified a number of  weaknesses: (1) it did not eliminate duplication, (2) it continued to permit  the proliferation of single-service programs, (3) it did not adequately  consider cost savings potential from manned and unmanned aircraft trade- offs, and (4) it did not adequately emphasize the importance of common  payloads among different UAV platforms.", "In testimony presented in April 1997, we recognized the strong support  that Congress had provided for DOD\u2019s UAV acquisition efforts and how it  had encouraged the department to spur related cooperation between the  services. We noted that problems with UAV development continued and  were leading to cost, schedule, and performance deficiencies; continued  duplication of UAV capabilities; and even program cancellations in many  instances.

Our reviews over the last 27 years  have revealed several reasons why UAV efforts have not been successful,  including requirements that outstrip technology, overly ambitious  schedules, and difficulties integrating UAV components and UAV testing.  We have also found that UAV system acquisitions processes were not  protected from what is known as \u201crequirements creep.\u201d These  requirements changes increase development and procurement costs  significantly. For example:    The Aquila was started in 1979 with a straightforward mission to  provide small, propeller-driven UAVs to give group commanders real- time battlefield information about enemy forces beyond ground  observers\u2019 line of sight. Requirements creep increased complexity and  development and anticipated procurement costs significantly. For  example, in 1982 a requirement for night vision capability was added  which increased development costs due to the additional payloads and  air vehicles needed to meet the new requirement. During operational  tests, the Aquila successfully fulfilled all requirements in only 7 of 105  flights.", "When the Air Force\u2019s Global Hawk reconnaissance UAV was started in  1994, it was expected to have an average unit flyaway price of $10  million. Changes in the aircraft\u2019s range and endurance objectives  required the contractor to modify the wings and other structural parts,  and by 1999 its cost had increased by almost 50 percent. In our April  2000 report, we concluded that the cost of air vehicles to be produced  could increase still further, because the Air Force had not finalized its  design requirements. In 2002, the Global Hawk program adopted a  higher-risk strategy that calls for both a larger, more advanced aircraft  and an accelerated delivery schedule.", "In June 2003 we reported that the original requirements for the Air  Force\u2019s unmanned combat air vehicle (UCAV) program posed  significant, but manageable challenges to build an air vehicle that is  affordable throughout its life cycle, highly survivable, and lethal.  Subsequently, however, the Air Force added requirements\u2014adding a  mission and increasing flying range. This action widened the gap  between requirements and resources and increased the challenge for  the development program.", "Aside from the air vehicle, other ground and airborne systems are also  needed for the UAV to be complete. DOD\u2019s practice of buying systems  before successful completion of testing has repeatedly led to defective  systems that were terminated, redesigned, or retrofitted to achieve  satisfactory performance. Our reviews have shown that, before production  begins, DOD needs to test to ensure that all key parts of the UAV system  can work successfully together, and that it can be operated and  maintained affordably throughout its lifecycle.", "In March 1999, we examined the Medium Range UAV, which began in  1989 as a joint effort of the Navy and Air Force. The Air Force was to  design and build the sensor payload, including cameras, a videotape  recorder, and a communications data link that would send back the  imagery from the UAV. The Navy was to design and build the air  vehicle. Splitting and then integrating these development efforts  became problematic. The Air Force ran into major payload  development difficulties, which impacted payload development costs.  As a result of the difficulties, the payload program fell behind schedule,  developmental tests on a surrogate manned aircraft were  unsuccessful, and the payload was too big to fit in the space the Navy  had allotted inside the aircraft. In 1993, the program was terminated.", "In 1999, the Army began low-rate initial production of four Shadow  systems at the same time that it began the engineering and  manufacturing development phase. In February 2001, the Army sought  to revise its acquisition strategy to procure four additional Shadow  systems before conducting operational tests. We recommended in a  2000 report that the Army not buy these four additional systems until  after operational testing is completed. In our opinion, only operational  testing of the system in a realistic environment can show whether the  overall system would meet the Army\u2019s operational needs.

The Air Force had abandoned the Unmanned  Combat Air Vehicle initial low-risk approach to development, and  increased requirements and accelerated its program schedule shortly  before it was to shift to the product development stage. As previously  reported, it took intervention by the Office of the Secretary of Defense  to resolve requirements and funding challenges and maintain strong  oversight over the program. The Task Force also was instrumental in  getting the funding restored to the program, creating a joint effort  between the Air Force and Navy, and accelerating the Navy\u2019s version.

As UAV programs vie for  increased funding, they will have to compete against very large programs,  such as the F/A-22 and the Joint Strike Fighter. If the costs of acquisition  programs continue to exceed what has been set aside in the budget,  competition will intensify and funding could be jeopardized.", "Initially, UAVs were seen as complementary systems that augmented  capabilities the warfighter already had. They were, in a sense, \u201canother  pair of eyes.\u201d We are already seeing the evolution of UAVs into more  significant roles, for which they provide primary capability. For example,  the Global Hawk is being seen as replacing the U-2 reconnaissance  aircraft, and the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicle may eventually perform  electronic warfare missions that the EA-6 Prowler aircraft performs today.  UAVs are figuring prominently in plans to transform the military into a  more strategically responsive force. UAVs are expected to be an integral  part of this information-based force. For example, UAVs may serve as  relay nodes in the Future Combat System\u2019s command and control  network. As UAVs perform increasingly significant roles, their payloads  and designs will likely become more sophisticated.", "UAVs depend on the available space in the electromagnetic frequency  spectrum to send and receive signals. Such signals are essential to UAV  control, communications, and imagery. As the number of UAVs grows, the  systems will have to compete for more room on the spectrum. Spectrum  resources are scarce and facing increased demands from sources other  than UAVs. Because of the changing nature of warfighting, more and more  military systems are coming to depend on the spectrum to guide precision  weapons and obtain information superiority. Recently, because of  advances in commercial technology, a competition for scarce frequency  spectrum has developed between government and nongovernment users.", "Moreover, as the growing number of UAV systems become available for  military units and civilian agencies, such as the Department of Homeland  Security, their operation will also need to be integrated into the national  airspace system. Currently, the Federal Aviation Administration requires  detailed coordination and approval of UAV flights in the national airspace  system. The Federal Aviation Administration and DOD are working on  how to better integrate military UAVs within the national air space system.  In the future, UAVs are going to be used for homeland security, and their  acceptance into civil airspace may be difficult to accomplish until  significant work is accomplished in the areas  of reliability, regulation,  communications, and collision avoidance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Remarks", "paragraphs": ["Recent operations are convincing military commanders that UAVs are of  real value to the warfighter. That success on the battlefield is leading to  more and more demand for UAVs and innovative ways of using them,  creating pressures such as a greater need for interoperability of systems  and competition for limited resources like money, electromagnetic  frequency spectrum, and airspace. The UAVs that are successful today  survived an environment characterized by a number of canceled programs,  risky strategies, uncoordinated efforts, and uncertain funding. It took  additional measures for them to succeed, not the least of which was strong  management intervention. In recent years, DOD has taken positive steps to  better manage the development of UAVs by creating the joint UAV  Planning Task Force and the UAV Roadmap. The question is whether  these steps will be sufficient to make the most out of current and future  investments in UAVs. We believe that DOD should build on these good  steps so that it will be in a better position to provide stewardship over  these investments. Taking these steps will give Congress confidence that  its investments\u2019 in the technology will produce optimum capabilities  desired of UAVs.  -     -     -     -     -  Mr. Chairman, this concludes our prepared statement.
