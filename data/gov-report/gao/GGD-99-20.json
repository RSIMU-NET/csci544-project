Our report also listed responses from the 19 federal agencies that issued the regulations underlying the 125 company concerns.  In response to about one-quarter of the concerns, the agencies indicated that the companies\u2019 concerns were, at least in part, attributable to statutory requirements underlying their regulations.", "This report responds to your request that we examine the agencies\u2019 assertions that some of the 125 regulatory concerns were, at least in part, attributable to the underlying statutes.

The statutory basis for a regulation can vary in terms of its specificity, from (1) very broad grants of authority that state only the general intent of the legislation and leave agencies with a great deal of discretion as to how that intent should be implemented to (2) very specific requirements delineating exactly what regulatory agencies should do and how they should do it.  For example, the Agricultural Adjustment Act provides a broad grant of authority to the Secretary of Agriculture, stating only that agricultural marketing should be \u201corderly\u201d but providing little guidance regarding which crops should have marketing orders or how to apportion the market among growers.  On the other hand, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has concluded that it has no discretion in setting the average fuel economy standards (known as the \u201cCorporate Average Fuel Economy\u201d or \u201cCAFE\u201d standards) for light trucks.  DOT\u2019s 1998 appropriations act stated that \u201c(n)one of the funds in this Act shall be available to prepare, propose, or promulgate any regulations (prescribing CAFE standards for automobiles) . . . in any model year that differs from standards promulgated for such automobiles prior to the enactment of this section.\u201d  At the time this appropriations act was enacted, DOT was preparing the CAFE standard for model year 2000.

As more and more of Congress\u2019 legislative functions have been delegated to federal regulatory agencies, many have complained that Congress has effectively abdicated its constitutional role as the national legislature in allowing federal agencies so much latitude in implementing and interpreting congressional enactments . . . .\u201d \u201cBecause Congress is often unable to anticipate the numerous situations to which the laws it passes must apply, Executive Branch agencies sometimes develop regulatory schemes at odds with congressional expectations . . . . Rules can be surprisingly different from the expectations of Congress or the public.  Congressional review gives the public the opportunity to call the attention of politically accountable, elected officials to concerns about new agency rules.\u201d", "Similar concerns about agencies\u2019 regulatory actions have led Congress to establish analytical requirements that agencies must comply with during the rulemaking process.  For example, the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended, requires agencies to analyze the anticipated effects of rules they plan to propose on small entities unless they certify that the rules will not have a \u201csignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.\u201d  Title II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 requires federal agencies (other than independent regulatory agencies) to prepare written statements for certain rules.  Those written statements must, among other things, contain a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the anticipated costs and benefits of the rules.  Various executive orders have imposed similar analytical requirements on federal agencies. see Regulatory Reform: Major Rules Submitted for Congressional Review During the First 2 Years (GAO/GGD-98-102R, Apr. 24, 1998). \u201cignores the fact that the key decisions occur when Congress writes an Occupational Safety and Health Act or an amendment to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act or any other important regulatory law, usually with hundreds of pages of detailed specifications. . . . The way those statutes are written frequently precludes the agencies from even considering the most cost-effective approaches.\u201d", "Therefore, CED concluded that the traditional focus of regulatory reform should be shifted from regulatory agencies to Congress.  CED recommended, among other things, that each congressional committee be required, when writing a regulatory statute, to articulate the expected benefits and costs of the regulatory program in the report accompanying the legislation.  It also recommended that Congress eliminate provisions in existing statutes that prevent or limit regulatory agencies from considering costs or comparing expected benefits with costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Related Reports and Testimonies", "paragraphs": ["Several of our recent reports and testimonies have raised the issue of whether regulatory burden was based on the underlying statutes.  As noted previously, in our 1996 reports on which this review is based, the agencies responding to some of the companies\u2019 concerns said that the specific requirements that the businesses mentioned were statutorily driven.  We noted in our November 1996 report that we did not review the regulations and statutes that the agencies cited to determine whether the underlying statutes required the regulatory provisions that were of concern to the companies.  However, we said that if the statutes do not require those regulatory provisions, the agencies have a responsibility to address those concerns on their own and not shift the responsibility to Congress.  We also said that if Congress believes an agency\u2019s regulation is inconsistent with the intent of the underlying statute, Congress could amend the statute to reflect current congressional intent and, in effect, require the agency to amend its regulation.", "In three reviews of agencies\u2019 implementation of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, we reported that agencies believed the paperwork burden associated with their regulations had increased since the act was passed because of congressionally imposed requirements. As a result of such requirements, we said that some agencies believed that they were limited in the amount to which they can reduce their paperwork burden.  For example, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) said it could not reach the burden reduction goals established in the Paperwork Reduction Act under the current statutory framework and still carry out its mission.  We noted that we had not assessed the extent to which the paperwork burden agencies impose is directly a consequence of statutory requirements and, therefore, is out of the agencies\u2019 control.  However, we also noted that if agencies\u2019 paperwork requirements are truly statutorily mandated, those agencies may not be able to reduce their burden-hour estimates by the amounts envisioned in the 1995 act without changes in the legislation underlying those requirements.", "In our 1997 review of four agencies\u2019 efforts to eliminate or revise pages in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), we found that two of the four agencies had added more pages to the CFR than they deleted.  Agency officials said that statutory requirements imposed by Congress often drive CFR page additions, and they provided several examples of those statutory requirements.  However, we did not examine those statutes to determine the extent to which they required the CFR page additions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This review focuses on a subset of the 125 regulatory concerns that companies cited in our 1996 reports\u2014the concerns that federal agencies indicated were, at least in part, attributable to the statutes underlying the relevant regulatory provisions.  Our objectives were to determine, for each such concern, (1) the amount of discretion the underlying statutes gave the agencies in developing the regulatory requirements, (2) whether the regulatory requirements at issue were within the authority granted by the underlying statutes, and (3) whether the rulemaking agencies could have developed regulatory approaches that would have been less burdensome to the regulated entities while still meeting the underlying statutory requirements.", "Appendix I provides a detailed discussion of our scope and methodology. In brief, we identified the 27 company concerns that we focused on in this review by (1) subdividing some concerns in our December 1996 report to facilitate the analysis; and (2) eliminating some of the concerns that were too broad or that focused only on federal statutes, not agencies\u2019 regulatory requirements.  For example, in one concern company officials said that the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) was expensive and exposed the company to unforeseen liability, but the officials did not cite any EPA regulations in their concern. The 27 concerns were raised by officials from 10 of the 15 companies we visited during the preparation of our 1996 reports, 7 of whom asked that we use generic descriptors such as \u201cBank A\u201d or \u201ca paper company\u201d to identify them.  A total of 11 federal departments and agencies issued the regulations underlying the 27 company concerns at issue in the report.", "To address our first objective we reviewed the statutory provisions underlying each of the concerns and coded the level of discretion that we believed those provisions permitted the agencies in developing the specific regulatory requirements at issue in the concerns into one of three categories\u2014 \u201cno discretion,\u201d \u201csome discretion,\u201d or \u201cbroad discretion.\u201d  We coded statutory provisions as allowing rulemaking agencies \u201cno discretion\u201d if they delineated specific actions that regulated entities or the agencies themselves must take and did not allow the agencies to develop their own regulatory requirements.  We coded statutory provisions as allowing the agencies \u201csome discretion\u201d if they delineated certain requirements that had to be included in the regulations but gave the agencies at least some discretion regarding other requirements (e.g., the timing or frequency of a reporting requirement).  We coded statutory provisions as allowing the agencies \u201cbroad discretion\u201d if they contained few specific requirements or imposed few to no constraints on what the agencies had to include in their regulations.", "To address our second objective, we compared the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions for each concern and decided whether we believed the regulatory requirements at issue in the concerns were within the authority granted by the underlying statutes. We coded the regulatory provisions as being within the authority granted by the statutes if (1) the statutory provision gave the agency no discretion in how the regulations could be developed and the regulatory provision strictly adhered to the statutory requirements; or (2) the statutory provision gave the agency some or broad discretion, and the regulatory provision was consistent with the requirements or the limitations in the statute.", "To address our third objective we examined our answers to the previous objectives and decided whether we believed the rulemaking agencies could have developed regulatory approaches that would have been less burdensome to the regulated entities while still meeting the underlying statutory requirements.  If the underlying statutes gave an agency no rulemaking discretion and the agency adopted regulations that strictly adhered to the statutory requirements, we concluded that the agency could not have developed a less burdensome regulatory approach.  If the underlying statutes gave an agency some or broad rulemaking discretion, we were not able to determine if the agencies could have developed a less burdensome approach.  To do this we would have needed detailed information on how the agencies\u2019 regulations were being implemented and how alternative approaches would be perceived by the regulated entities in order to determine whether a less burdensome approach was available.  As is discussed in Appendices III and IV, that information was not readily available.", "Because this review is based on a subset of the company concerns and agency responses originally presented in our 1996 reports, the results of our analysis are not generalizable to other companies, other regulatory issues, or even to all of the original 125 regulatory concerns.  However, as we pointed out in our November 1996 report, the companies\u2019 comments were similar in many respects to comments made by companies in some of our previous reports and in the literature. Therefore, we believe that the companies\u2019 comments, the agencies\u2019 responses, and our analysis of the related regulations and statutes are not atypical and can provide some insights regarding the broader issues addressed in this report.", "This report reflects the views of selected companies and regulatory agencies gathered during our earlier effort but does not reflect the views of other individuals and organizations that may be affected by the regulations at issue (e.g., labor unions or potential beneficiaries).  We did not attempt to determine whether the companies\u2019 or the agencies\u2019 views were correct with regard to issues that were outside the scope of this review (e.g., whether any of the agencies\u2019 actions were, in fact, \u201cburdensome\u201d). Although we approached this review systematically, our conclusions are ultimately matters of judgement, not determinations that have a legally binding effect on the agencies issuing the rules or the regulated community.", "The report focuses primarily on the amount of discretion that the relevant statutes gave rulemaking agencies in developing the regulatory requirements at issue in the companies\u2019 concerns.  However, the report does not address the amount of discretion that the agencies had in writing regulations outside of the specific issues raised by the companies. Agencies may have broad discretion in how regulations can be developed within a general area, but little or no discretion with regard to particular issues within those areas.  Also, the report does not address enforcement issues.  As our 1996 reports indicated, agencies may have considerable discretion in carrying out their enforcement authority, and the use of that discretion can significantly affect the burden felt by regulated entities.  For example, several companies expressed concerns about rigid and inflexible regulations and about certain regulators\u2019 \u201cgotcha\u201d enforcement approach. In response to those concerns, the agencies sometimes indicated that they reduced penalties in response to good faith efforts to comply, were not \u201caggressively\u201d enforcing certain technical requirements, or were changing their enforcement approaches.", "We initially gathered the company concerns and agency responses between June 1994 and September 1996.  We conducted our work for this review between February and October 1998 in the Washington, D.C., headquarters offices of each of the 11 departments and agencies that issued the regulations in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. During the preparation of this report, the agencies responsible for the regulations related to the company concerns reviewed and commented on our observations regarding each applicable concern. The agencies often offered suggestions regarding how the statutes and regulations should be characterized in the report, and we incorporated those suggestions where appropriate.  The agencies ultimately concurred with our analysis in all 27 concerns.  At the end of our review we sent a draft of this report for comment to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  Executive Order 12866 states that OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) is \u201cthe repository of expertise concerning regulatory issues, including methodologies and procedures that affect more than one agency . . . .\u201d  OIRA is also responsible for reviewing significant regulations before their publication as proposed and final rules and for approving agencies\u2019 information collection requests under the Paperwork Reduction Act.

PBGC officials said the agency\u2019s insurance premiums are statutorily established in Section 4006 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).  We concluded that ERISA (codified at 29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) gave PBGC no discretion in setting the pension insurance rates at issue in this concern.  Under the statute, the $19.00 rate is the minimum amount businesses with single-employer plans must pay for basic benefits.", "Multiplex Company, Inc. officials also said that IRS-required \u201cnondiscrimination tests\u201d for 401(k) thrift savings plans were of questionable value after IRS lowered the amount of money that could be contributed to the plans, thereby making it less likely that higher income employees would dominate the plan.  IRS said that both the test, known as the actual deferral percentage test, and the limit on the amount that could be contributed to a 401(k) plan were required by statute.  We examined the relevant statutory provisions and concluded that IRS had no discretion in how the regulations could be developed.  The deferral percentage test and the deferral limit were both specifically established by statute.  A subsequently enacted statute that reduced the amount that could be contributed to 401(k) plans did not eliminate the requirement that companies perform this test.", "An official from Bank A said that a FRB regulation on the availability of funds and the collection of checks (Regulation CC) requires information that is time consuming for banks to develop.  Officials from FRB said that the Expedited Funds Availability Act requires depository institutions to provide written copies of their funds availability policies to their customers.  We examined the act and concluded that it gave the agency no discretion in how its regulations could be written.  The statute specifically requires depository institutions to provide their customers with preprinted slips describing their policies regarding the amount of time between when a deposit is made into a customer\u2019s account and when funds can be withdrawn from that deposit.", "A Metro Machine Corporation official said that EPA regulators establish unrealistic requirements that are not attainable with current treatment technology.  For example, the official said that federal water quality standards require that water the company discharges be made cleaner than rainwater.  In its response to this concern, EPA said that under the Clean Water Act, it could not consider available treatment technologies or the cost of treatment in the development of water quality criteria for a particular designated use.

These and other examples of statutory provisions that allowed some rulemaking discretion are discussed more fully in appendix III.", "An official from Bank A said that provisions of Regulation DD under the Truth in Savings Act requires the bank to disclose certain information to its customers in a single document.  The bank officials said that they had been disclosing this information in a variety of brochures, but had to revise their brochures to disclose this information in one document to comply with Regulation DD.  In response to this concern, officials at FRB said that the Truth in Savings Act required all depository institutions to disclose information about the rates paid and fees charged in a uniform manner. We concluded that the Truth in Savings Act gave FRB some discretion in how it could establish what became Regulation DD.  Although the act gave FRB no discretion regarding the disclosures that must be required in Regulation DD, the act gave FRB discretion to determine how these disclosures should be made to bank customers.", "Officials from the paper company said DOT regulations that required hazardous materials (\u201chazmat\u201d) training and testing cost the company $475,000 each year.  According to DOT, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Uniform Safety Act specifically required the issuance of regulations requiring employers to provide hazmat training to certain employees.  We examined the training requirements in the act and concluded that the act gave DOT no rulemaking discretion in some areas and some discretion in other areas.  For example, the act said the Secretary of Transportation \u201cshall prescribe by regulation requirements for training that a hazmat employer must give hazmat employees of the employer on the safe loading, unloading, handling, storing, and transporting of hazardous material.\u201d  The act also required the regulations to establish the date by which the training shall be completed and to require employers to certify that their hazmat employees have received training and been tested on at least one of nine specific areas of responsibility that are delineated in the statute.  However, the statute also said that DOT\u2019s regulations \u201cmay provide for different training for different classes or categories of hazardous material and hazmat employees.\u201d Because the statute gave DOT the flexibility to tailor its regulatory requirements for hazmat training to different classes of hazmat materials and employees, we concluded that DOT had some rulemaking discretion.", "Officials from the fish farm said that pesticide manufacturers were either not renewing the aquatic use of certain pesticides or were not seeking EPA approval of the products for use in aquaculture because of the expense associated with the testing requirements in EPA\u2019s reregistration program. EPA officials said that the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) requires EPA to certify that all pesticides meet current testing standards for safety.  We concluded that these FIFRA provisions gave EPA some discretion regarding the requirements that manufacturers must satisfy in the pesticide reregistration process.  Section 4 of FIFRA specifically states that the Administrator of EPA must reregister \u201ceach registered pesticide containing any active ingredient contained in any pesticide first registered before November 1, 1984,\u201d and it prescribes in detail the approach EPA is to use to reregister pesticides.  However, the statute gives the EPA administrator discretion in establishing the data requirements that would be needed to support the reregistration of the pesticides.  These requirements can have a direct impact on the expense incurred by manufacturers in the reregistration process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statutes Allowed Agencies Broad Rulemaking Discretion for Two Concerns", "paragraphs": ["We concluded that the statutory provisions underlying 2 of the 27 concerns gave the agencies broad discretion in how regulatory provisions could be developed.  As noted previously, we coded statutory provisions as allowing rulemaking agencies \u201cbroad discretion\u201d if the provisions contained few specific requirements or imposed few to no constraints on what had to be included in agencies\u2019 regulations.", "In the first of the two concerns, Bank A officials said EEOC\u2019s record retention standards were inconsistent with the way EEOC pursued cases. In response to the Bank\u2019s concern, EEOC officials said that its record retention requirements were tied to the filing periods in each of the civil rights statutes.  For example, EEOC officials said that because an employee could file a discrimination suit under the Equal Pay Act within either 2 or 3 years of the alleged discrimination, EEOC requires that related records be kept for 2 or 3 years.  EEOC officials also said that under all of the statutes, when a claim of discrimination is pending, the employer must keep all relevant personnel records until final disposition of the charge or action.  We concluded that the statutory provisions underlying EEOC\u2019s record retention standards gave EEOC broad discretion in developing the standards because those provisions (1) do not specify how long employers must retain records and (2) give EEOC broad authority to establish retention periods.  For example, the Equal Pay Act states that every employer must preserve records for such periods of time as the Administrator of EEOC \u201cshall prescribe by regulation or order as necessary or appropriate for the enforcement of the provisions of this chapter or the regulations or orders thereunder.\u201d  Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, requires every employer to make such reports from its personnel records \u201cas the Commission shall prescribe by regulation or order . . . .\u201d  Therefore, we concluded that EEOC had broad discretion in establishing record retention requirements.", "In the second of the two concerns, Bank B officials said that some banking regulations gave \u201cnonbanks\u201d (e.g., investment brokerage firms) an unfair competitive edge in the marketplace.  For example, the officials said that one regulation required banks (but not investment firms) to disclose the risks associated with certain investment products.  In their 1996 response to this concern, OCC officials said that the examples of competitive inequality cited by the bank officials \u201care due to the fact that banks and nonbanks operate under different statutory schemes.\u201d  During this review they explained that under these statutes, banks are subject to a different regulatory scheme than nonbanks because they are federally insured. Therefore, they said it is appropriate for banking agencies to adopt additional disclosure requirements that address the unique features of the banking industry.  In 1994, OCC and the other banking agencies issued an interagency policy statement at their own initiative requiring the disclosures that Bank B found burdensome under their general statutory authority to issue rules and regulations.  Because (1) the statutes give OCC and the other banking agencies authority to take whatever actions they believe are necessary to remedy or prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices (see 12 U.S.C. 1818), and (2) the disclosures required in the policy statement appear related to that end, we believe that OCC had broad discretion to issue the policy statement requiring the disclosures at issue in this concern.", "Appendix IV contains our detailed analysis of the statutory and regulatory provisions relating to both of the concerns for which we concluded the agencies had broad rulemaking discretion."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Regulatory Requirements Were Within Statutory Authority", "paragraphs": ["Our second objective was to determine whether the regulatory requirements at issue in each of the 27 company concerns were within the authority granted by the underlying statutes.  We concluded that the regulatory provisions related to all of the concerns were within the authority granted by those statutes.", "For the 13 concerns in which we concluded the underlying statutes gave the agencies no rulemaking discretion, the language in the agencies\u2019 regulations either mirrored the language in the statutes or was substantively consistent with the statutory requirement.  Therefore, we concluded that the regulations were within the authority granted by the statutes.  For example, in relation to a concern from Zaclon, Inc., regarding a permit application under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), we compared the relevant RCRA statutory provisions with EPA\u2019s regulations and found that the language in the regulations mirrored the language in the statute.  The RCRA provisions (codified at 42 U.S.C. 6925(a)) required the EPA Administrator to \u201cpromulgate regulations requiring each person owning or operating an existing facility or planning to construct a new facility for the treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste . . . to have a permit issued pursuant to this section.\u201d EPA\u2019s RCRA regulations (40 C.F.R. 270.1(c)) directly quote the statute\u2019s requirements that a permit is needed for the \u201ctreatment,\u2019 \u2018storage,\u2019 and \u2018disposal\u2019 of any \u2018hazardous waste\u2019\u201d and goes on to require companies to obtain such permits.  Because the regulatory provisions reflected the specific statutory requirements, we concluded that those provisions were within the authority granted by the statutes.", "We reached a similar conclusion with regard to a concern from Multiplex Company, Inc., involving what it referred to as IRS\u2019 \u201cnondiscrimination tests\u201d for companies\u2019 401(k) thrift savings plans.  We compared the nondiscrimination test provisions in the tax code with IRS\u2019 regulations and concluded that the regulations essentially mirror the statutory provisions and add some explanatory language.  The statute (codified at 26 U.S.C. 401(k)(3)(A)(ii)) specifically requires the test and establishes specific dollar amounts for deferral limits and detailed procedures that companies must follow.  For example, the statute says that the \u201cactual deferral percentage for the group of eligible highly compensated employees is not more than the actual deferral percentage of all other eligible employees multiplied by 1.25.\u201d  The related IRS regulations (26 C.F.R. 1.401(k)-1(b) and 1.402(g)-1) repeat these statutory requirements word for word.", "We concluded that the regulations underlying the 12 concerns for which the agencies had some rulemaking discretion were within the authority granted by the related statutes because they (1) contained the elements required by those statutes and/or (2) did not exceed the authority granted or limits imposed by those statutes.  For example, we concluded that the Expedited Funds Availability Act allowed FRB some discretion in developing the regulation (Regulation CC) that established the periods during which banks could hold funds before making them accessible to depositors.  Although the act gave FRB no discretion regarding the maximum number of days banks could hold particular types of deposits, it allowed FRB to establish hold periods that were less than those maximums or to standardize those time periods.  Regulation CC established hold periods that were consistent with the maximum periods specified in the statute.  Therefore, we concluded that the regulation was within the authority granted by the statute.", "For the two concerns in which we concluded that the underlying statutes gave the agencies broad rulemaking discretion, the statutes contained language that allowed agencies to develop the rules they believed were necessary to carry out their statutory missions.  We viewed regulations that agencies developed to carry out their statutory responsibilities as being within the authority of those statutes.  For example, we concluded that EEOC had broad discretion under the various civil rights statutes to impose record retention requirements.  Therefore, we also concluded that EEOC\u2019s practice of establishing requirements closely related to the filing periods of each statute was within the authority granted by those statutes.", "Appendixes II, III, and IV describe our analyses of the relevant regulations for all of the concerns that we categorized as allowing no discretion, some discretion, and broad discretion, respectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Less Burdensome Regulatory Approaches Were Not Available for About Half of the Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Our third objective was to determine whether the rulemaking agencies could have developed regulatory approaches that would have been less burdensome to the regulated entities while still meeting the underlying statutory requirements.  We concluded that in relation to 13 of the 27 concerns, the agencies could not have developed less burdensome regulatory approaches.  For the remaining 14 concerns, we could not determine whether less burdensome regulatory approaches were available to the agencies without substantial additional information about how the current approaches were being implemented or how alternative approaches would be perceived by regulated entities.", "We believe that an agency cannot develop regulatory requirements that are less burdensome to a regulated entity if (1) the statute underlying the regulation gives the agency no discretion regarding how regulatory provisions can be developed, and (2) the agency develops regulations that are consistent with (and sometimes mirror images of) the statutory requirements.  Because 13 of the 27 concerns met these criteria, we concluded that the agencies involved in the concerns could not have developed less burdensome regulatory provisions.  For example, in one of these concerns, officials from a paper company said that EPA regulations under title V of the Clean Air Act were problematic because they regulated extremely low levels of emissions.  We concluded that under title V, EPA had no discretion regarding the development of regulations on the emissions levels that trigger the permitting requirements because the statute specifically requires any \u201cmajor source\u201d of hazardous air pollutants to obtain a title V permit and defines a major source as any source that emits 10 tons or more a year of any hazardous air pollutant or 25 tons or more per year of a combination of pollutants.  EPA\u2019s regulations implementing title V are similar to the statutory language and specifically refer to the definition of \u201cmajor source\u201d in the United States Code. Therefore, we concluded that there was no less burdensome regulatory approach that the agency could have selected that would have met the requirements of the statute.  (See app. II for a discussion of all of these concerns.)", "For the remaining 14 concerns in which we concluded the underlying statutes gave the agencies some or broad discretion, we could not determine whether a less burdensome regulatory approach was available. To make such a determination in each of these cases, we would have had to do an in-depth review of how the current regulations were being implemented at each agency or how alternative approaches would be viewed by regulated entities.  For example, in one of the concerns, a Bank A official complained about the time and effort required to complete call reports that summarize bank operations.  We concluded that the various statutes that require or authorize the banking agencies to collect information through the call reports gave the agencies some discretion in drafting the relevant regulatory provisions.  However, we could not determine whether the banking agencies could have developed less burdensome requirements without conducting a detailed review of each of the nonstatutory data elements in the call reports and their consistency with the requirements in the statute.  This type of detailed analysis would have required significant time and resource commitments that were beyond the scope of this review.  (See app. III and IV for a discussion of all of these concerns.)", "For 2 of these 14 concerns, the agencies appeared to have discretion to develop alternative regulatory approaches that may have addressed an aspect of the companies\u2019 original concerns.  However, we also concluded that the regulated entities might not have viewed those alternatives as less burdensome than the approach that the agencies took.  For example, in one of the concerns a Bank A official said that Regulation CC required the development and maintenance of expensive and time-consuming information about the current availability of funds.  In response, FRB officials indicated that Regulation CC\u2019s requirements were based on the Expedited Funds Availability Act, which establishes different minimum hold periods for different types of deposits (e.g., deposits of local versus nonlocal checks).  They said that to ensure compliance with this act, banks must have a system for tracking those deposits.  We examined the act and concluded that it allowed FRB some discretion to establish hold periods for various types of deposits.  For example, the act said that the hold period for nonlocal checks could not be more than 5 days, but it allowed FRB to establish hold periods that were less than the maximum period. However, FRB\u2019s Regulation CC established a 5-day hold period for nonlocal checks.  To reduce Bank A\u2019s burden of having to track holds on different types of deposits, FRB could have established a standard hold period in Regulation CC for all types of deposits\u2014e.g., 1 day for all types of deposits\u2014that was still consistent with the statutory requirements. However, it is unclear whether banks would welcome a standard 1-day hold requirement because it would reduce the amount of time available to the banks to determine whether sufficient funds existed to cover all categories of checks.", "In the other concern, we concluded that EEOC\u2019s practice of establishing personnel record retention requirements related to the length of the filing periods of the particular civil rights statutes was within the broad rulemaking authorities granted by those statutes.  However, EEOC could also have used its discretion to establish uniform record retention requirements (e.g., 5 or 10 years) for all of the statutes instead of the variable periods for the different statutes.  Although this approach could have helped eliminate what the company viewed as an inconsistency between the requirements and the way EEOC pursues cases, it is not clear whether regulated entities would view a record retention requirement that is longer than the current requirement as being less burdensome."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our review focused on a limited set of issues.  It did not attempt to assess the amount of discretion that federal agencies had in enforcing the requirements at issue in the companies\u2019 concerns or whether those requirements were, in fact, burdensome.  The review focused on 27 regulatory concerns from 10 companies that the agencies issuing the regulations indicated were based on the underlying statutes.  Therefore, the results of our review cannot be viewed as being representative of all regulatory concerns, all regulations or statutes, or even all of the concerns that the companies mentioned during our initial 1996 study.  In fact, it is important to remember that for about three-fourths of the companies\u2019 original 125 concerns, the responding agencies did not indicate that the concerns were based on the statutory requirements underlying their regulations.", "On the other hand, although our review focused on 27 regulatory concerns that the agencies said were, at least in part, statutorily based, the companies in our 1996 study mentioned 6 other concerns that centered on the statutes themselves, not the regulations.  For example, officials from one company said that compliance with the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (not EPA\u2019s CERCLA regulations) was expensive and exposed the company to unforeseen liability.  These statute-directed concerns suggest that the companies understood the degree to which their problems were traceable to the statutes.  Also, the comments that the companies made during our 1996 study were similar in many respects to comments made by companies in some of our previous reports and in the literature.  Therefore, we believe that the companies\u2019 comments are not atypical, and our analysis of the regulations and statutes underlying those concerns can offer some insights into how regulatory concerns arise and how they can best be addressed.", "For about half of the concerns that we reviewed, we concluded that the statutory provisions underlying the regulations that companies perceived as problematic gave the agencies no discretion in how they could develop those regulations.  Some of the statutory provisions specifically delineated the actions regulated entities had to take and therefore limited rulemaking agencies\u2019 discretion regarding what their regulations could require.  As a result, the agencies often mirrored the language of the statutes in their regulations.  We therefore concluded that the agencies\u2019 regulations were within the authority granted by the underlying statutes and represented the least burdensome option permitted by those statutes.  Nevertheless, during our 1996 review the companies told us that the requirements for these 27 concerns were burdensome.", "The statutes underlying other company concerns gave the agencies some or broad discretion in developing associated regulatory provisions.  In these cases the agencies appeared to have developed regulations that were within the authorities permitted by or the limitations of the statutes. However, we could not determine whether the agencies could have developed less burdensome regulatory alternatives with regard to these concerns because to do so would have required detailed information about how the current requirements were being implemented and/or how alternative regulatory approaches would be perceived by regulated entities.  In two of these cases, we concluded that the agencies could have developed alternative regulatory requirements that may have addressed some aspects of the companies\u2019 concerns.

They contend that Congress should closely direct agencies\u2019 regulatory efforts through narrowly defined statutory requirements.  However, other observers believe that some statutory requirements may be to blame for certain types of regulatory burden.  In those cases in which Congress has specifically required certain actions or limited agencies\u2019 rulemaking discretion, the agencies are precluded from considering the most cost-effective approaches.", "Our review indicated that regardless of how much or how little rulemaking discretion is permitted in the underlying statutes, the associated regulations can still be regarded as burdensome by regulated entities.  For 13 of the 27 company concerns that we examined, Congress gave the regulatory agencies no discretion in how the relevant regulatory provisions could be developed.  Although the statutes specifically delineated the requirements that should be imposed, the companies considered those requirements to be burdensome.  In the statutes underlying the other 14 concerns, Congress gave the regulatory agencies some or broad rulemaking discretion.

Several of the executive and legislative branch regulatory reform efforts during the past 20 years have directed federal agencies to conduct cost-benefit or regulatory flexibility analyses for certain regulations to ensure that those rules impose as little burden as possible on the regulated public.  When the statutes directing or authorizing agencies to develop regulations give those agencies discretion as to the regulatory approach that they can take and the particular requirements that can be imposed, analytical requirements imposed on the agencies (e.g., cost-benefit analysis and regulatory flexibility analysis) can help ensure that they consider all available regulatory options and select the least burdensome option.", "However, when the statutes underlying those regulations give agencies no discretion in how their regulations can be developed, analytical requirements imposed on the agencies are unlikely to have much direct effect on the regulatory burden that those agencies impose.  Agencies cannot adopt regulatory alternatives that are outside the boundaries permitted in the underlying statutes.  If a statute underlying a regulation is the source of a company\u2019s regulatory concern, that concern can be addressed only by changes in the statute. Similarly, if Congress disapproves of a regulation pursuant to its authority under SBREFA because of requirements that are based on the underlying statute, sending the regulation back to the issuing agency for further consideration will not resolve the issue. If a statute established the conditions that Congress finds objectionable, only Congress can address the problem by changing that statute.", "Nevertheless, analytical requirements imposed on agencies can serve a useful purpose even when the underlying statutes give the agencies no rulemaking discretion.  For example, cost-benefit analysis can highlight the potential advantages of alternative regulatory approaches not permitted in the underlying statutes, perhaps leading to eventual changes in those statutes and thereby alleviating at least some of the burden felt by the regulated entities.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Ranking Minority Member of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law; the Director of OMB; the Secretaries of Health and Human Services, HUD, Department of Labor, DOT, and the Treasury; the Comptroller of the Currency; the Administrator of EPA; EEOC; FDIC; FRB; and PBGC.

Two of the eight concerns were very broad, asserting that \u201cfrequent changes to the tax code are costly\u201d and that doing business in multiple states was difficult because of differences in state laws.  The other six concerns involved particular federal statutes but did not focus on agencies\u2019 regulatory requirements.  For example, in one of the six concerns company officials said that compliance with the requirements in the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) was expensive and exposed the company to unforeseen liability.  However, the officials did not cite any particular Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations in their concern.  Another of the six concerns focused on the potential liability that officials from one company said its managers faced with regard to certain environmental standards.  In its response to that concern, EPA indicated that criminal penalties for the violation in question were established in a particular statute rather than in EPA\u2019s regulations.  We eliminated this concern from our review because EPA is not responsible for enforcing those provisions in criminal law, and the issues in the concern were not associated with EPA regulations.", "We eliminated another company\u2019s concern from this review because the agency that had issued the underlying regulations no longer contended that the concern was statutorily based.  In its 1996 response to a concern that one company described as EPA\u2019s \u201cantidegradation policy,\u201d EPA said that the company was actually referring to the agency\u2019s \u201cantibacksliding\u201d requirements that were statutorily mandated by the Clean Water Act. However, an EPA official told us during this review that (1) the company concern was, in fact, about antidegredation; and (2) the policy was adopted by the State of Ohio, not EPA, and was not based on federal environmental statutes.  We therefore eliminated this concern from our review.", "We subdivided 4 of the remaining 22 concerns into 9 separate concerns in order to facilitate our analysis.  For example, one such concern involved three separate provisions of Regulation DD, which was issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB) to implement provisions of the Truth in Savings Act.  By dividing this concern into three separate concerns, we were able to assess each of the provisions individually.  One of the other concerns that we subdivided focused on what one company viewed as a disparity in federal regulations requirements between banks and nonbanks (e.g., an investment brokerage firm) regarding (1) flood insurance and (2) public disclosure requirements. We subdivided this concern into two concerns to focus on the requirements for flood insurance and disclosure requirements separately.", "After eliminating some company concerns and separating others into multiple parts, what remained were 27 concerns about federal regulations that the agencies indicated were, at least in part, based on the underlying statutes.

For most of the concerns, either the company or the responding agency provided relevant statutory and/or regulatory citations. However, for other concerns we had only limited information and had to contact the relevant agencies for additional details.  For example, in one concern, Bank A said it was frustrating to spend the time and resources comply with so many bank reporting requirements but did not cite any specific relevant regulations or statutes.  In its response to this concern, FDIC said that some bank reporting requirements were mandated by statute, but it did not provide any examples of those requirements to support its statement.  During this review, we asked FDIC to identify the specific regulatory reporting requirements that it considered to be statutorily mandated and to provide the relevant statutory citations.", "We then reviewed the statutory provisions underlying each of the company concerns and coded the level of discretion that we believed those provisions permitted the agencies in developing the specific regulatory requirements at issue in the concerns into one of three categories\u2014 \u201cno discretion,\u201d \u201csome discretion,\u201d or \u201cbroad discretion.\u201d  We coded statutory provisions as permitting \u201cno discretion\u201d if they delineated specific actions that regulated entities or the agencies themselves must take and did not allow the agencies to develop the regulatory requirements at issue in the concern.

If a statutory provision required companies with 100 or more employees to provide recycling information to EPA on January 30 of each year delineating, for the previous calendar year and for each company work site, (1) the specific materials that were recycled, (2) the manner of recycling, and (3) the costs associated with their recycling efforts, we would have coded the provision as allowing EPA no rulemaking discretion.", "We coded statutory provisions as allowing rulemaking agencies \u201csome discretion\u201d if they delineated certain requirements that had to be included in the agencies\u2019 regulations but gave the agencies at least some discretion regarding other requirements.  For example, in the above illustration, if the statute gave EPA discretion regarding the timing or the frequency with which recycling information had to be provided by the companies, but EPA still had no discretion regarding the content of the reporting requirement, we would have coded the statutory provision as allowing some rulemaking discretion.", "We coded statutory provisions as allowing the rulemaking agencies \u201cbroad discretion\u201d if the provisions contained few specific requirements or imposed few to no constraints on what the agencies had to include in their regulations.  In the hypothetical recycling example, if the statutory provision only required EPA to periodically report to Congress on businesses\u2019 recycling efforts, we would have coded the provision as allowing EPA broad rulemaking discretion.

Therefore, neither the companies\u2019 concerns nor the results of our analysis are generalizable to other companies or to other regulatory issues.  The results of this analysis are not even generalizable to all of the original 125 regulatory concerns because this review focuses only on the subset of the concerns and related regulations that the agencies indicated were, at least in part, statutorily based.

Agencies may have broad discretion in how regulations can be developed within a general area, but little or no discretion with regard to particular issues within those areas.  Also, the report does not address enforcement issues.  As our 1996 reports indicated, agencies may have considerable discretion in carrying out their enforcement authority, and the use of that discretion can significantly affect the burden felt by regulated entities.  For example, several companies expressed concerns about rigid and inflexible regulations and about certain regulators\u2019 \u201cgotcha\u201d enforcement approach.

First, we developed a coding scheme for each objective to ensure consistency of analysis.

Also, because OCC\u2019s and the other banking agencies\u2019 statutory authority does not extend to nonbanks, the policy statement does not apply to those institutions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Whether Regulatory Provisions Are Within the Authority Granted by the Statute", "paragraphs": ["We believe that the interagency policy statement requiring certain types of disclosures for nondeposit investment products is within the broad rulemaking authority granted to OCC and the other banking agencies by the underlying statutes.  For example, the policy statement requires, among other things, that insured depository institutions disclose that certain products (1) are not insured by FDIC; (2) are not a \u201cdeposit or other obligation of, or guaranteed by, the depository institution;\u201d and (3) are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.  The policy statement also says that the disclosures should be provided to customers during any sales presentation and in advertisements and other promotional materials.  Because the underlying statutes give OCC and the other banking agencies the authority to take the actions that they believe are necessary to remedy or prevent unsafe and unsound banking practices, we believe the policy statement is within OCC\u2019s statutory authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Whether Less Burdensome Regulatory Approach Was Available", "paragraphs": ["We could not determine whether OCC and the other banking agencies could have developed disclosure requirements that would have been less burdensome to regulated entities while still accomplishing the underlying purpose of the statutes.  To do so we would have had to conduct a detailed review of each disclosure requirement and determine how important it was to consumers in understanding which products are insured and which are not.
