GSA also has published information on its Recovery Act program, such as agencywide plans for spending funds and lists of projects, but this information does not identify the nature of the work being conducted or describe the 263 projects GSA has selected for Recovery Act funding. Without this information, the program is less than fully transparent--a key GSA Recovery Act goal--because the public cannot readily discern what individual projects entail or are expected to achieve with Recovery Act funding. GSA's Recovery Act projects will enhance energy and water conservation performance in the 263 projects to varying degrees. GSA has begun collecting the data it would need to measure the likely extent of improvement. GSA set minimum performance criteria for its projects, which include reducing energy use by 30 percent. The criteria do not, however, include reducing the energy and environmental impacts of transportation through building location and site design, although this is part of the statutory definition of a HPGB. Under the Recovery Act, GSA is to use this definition when converting existing buildings. According to GSA, some managers are designing transportation-related improvements into their projects. However, because it is not part of GSA's criteria, other managers may not be systematically considering such improvements. According to GSA, the agency has begun to roll out a new centralized data system to collect and report on specific information for Recovery Act projects' green improvements and performance. GSA has identified risks to its Recovery Act program, such as the risk that Recovery Act reporting is inaccurate or incomplete, and risk mitigation strategies. In addition, GSA's approach to risk management is generally consistent with best practices we have developed. However, GSA relies on informal communication to identify project-level risks and has not taken steps to ensure the completion of project-level risk planning documents required by GSA. GAO found that the required documents, which are intended to help plan for project-level risks, had not been fully completed for 9 of the 12 projects reviewed. Unidentified risks to GSA's Recovery Act projects could potentially limit GSA's ability to achieve Recovery Act goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In January 2003, we designated federal real property as a high-risk area, in  part because of deteriorating facilities and unreliable real property data.  In addition, in 2007, we reported that addressing the needs of aging and  deteriorating federal facilities remains a problem for major real property- holding agencies, and that, according to recent estimates, tens of billions  of dollars will be needed to repair or restore these assets. The American  Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) provided the  General Services Administration (GSA) with $5.55 billion to invest in  federal buildings, create jobs, and promote economic recovery. Of this  $5.55 billion, over $1 billion is being used by GSA for new federal  buildings, courthouses, border stations, and land ports of entry.  Additionally, the Recovery Act provided that at least $4.5 billion be used  \u201cfor measures necessary to convert GSA facilities to high-performance  green buildings\u201d as defined by section 401 of the Energy Independence and  Security Act of 2007 (EISA). High-performance green buildings are  designed to achieve a number of environmental goals, including reducing  energy, water, and material resource use and the buildings\u2019 impact on the  environment and on building occupants, by means such as using recycled  or nontoxic products in the buildings.", "The federal government is the nation\u2019s single largest energy consumer, and  federal buildings accounted for about 35 percent of the government\u2019s total  energy use in fiscal year 2009. Converting federal facilities to high- performance green buildings could help reduce the federal government\u2019s  energy consumption and bring federal buildings more in line with federal  energy and water conservation requirements and goals. Over the last  several years, a number of laws and executive orders have established new  requirements and direction for improving the energy and water  conservation performance of federal facilities. For example, in December  2007, EISA established new requirements for reducing energy use at  federal buildings, reducing fossil fuel use for certain federal buildings, and  managing storm water runoff. GSA\u2019s Recovery Act funding, which is more  than three times greater than the agency\u2019s 2009 funding for new  construction and renovations, provides a unique opportunity for GSA to  address the deterioration of some of its aging buildings while also  improving their energy and water conservation performance. However, to  obligate this funding within the time frame required by the Recovery Act,  GSA will have to implement hundreds of projects across the country at an  accelerated pace.", "Given the magnitude of GSA\u2019s Recovery Act program and the associated  time frame, you asked us to review GSA\u2019s plans and efforts related to the  use of Recovery Act funds. This report provides information and analysis  on (1) the steps GSA has taken to implement the program and make its  Recovery Act projects transparent to the public, (2) the extent to which  GSA\u2019s Recovery Act projects are helping the agency convert buildings to  high-performance green buildings and address energy and water  conservation requirements and goals, and (3) the extent to which GSA has  taken steps to identify potential risks to its Recovery Act program and  developed strategies to mitigate those risks.", "To address these questions, we reviewed key documents describing GSA\u2019s  efforts to organize and implement the program, publicly available  information about GSA\u2019s Recovery Act program, the scope of GSA\u2019s  Recovery Act projects, and GSA\u2019s progress in obligating and spending  funds. We compared criteria GSA established for Recovery Act projects  with selected legislation and executive orders relevant to the energy and  water conservation performance of federal buildings. Also, we interviewed  GSA officials in headquarters and regional offices, including project  management staff for 12 full and partial building modernization projects  we selected as case studies using a judgmental sample. Because the  sample is judgmental, the information we obtained from those projects  cannot be generalized to all of GSA\u2019s Recovery Act projects. Among the  factors we considered in selecting the 12 projects was whether GSA had  identified them as being far enough along in the design process to have  information on their expected performance. In addition, we used the  projects\u2019 type, size, and geographic location as selection criteria. We  collected information from our 12 case studies on their expected energy  and water conservation performance. Finally, we reviewed GSA\u2019s efforts  to develop and implement a risk management plan, compared those efforts  with accepted risk management best practices, and compared the project  risk planning efforts from our 12 case studies with GSA policies and Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance on project-level risk planning.  See appendix I for a more complete description of our scope and  methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2009 through June 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Overall, for its Recovery Act program, GSA selected 263 projects in all   50 states, the District of Columbia, and 2 U.S. territories. As shown in  table 1, GSA\u2019s Recovery Act projects fall into the following four main  categories: (1) new construction, (2) full and partial building  modernizations, (3) limited scope projects, and (4) small projects.", "The following information describes the four main categories for GSA\u2019s  Recovery Act projects:    New construction: Projects associated with building entirely new  structures or significant extensions to existing structures, including the  construction of new federal buildings and courthouses, as well as border  stations and land ports of entry.", "Full and partial building modernizations: Projects associated with the  replacement or upgrade of multiple building systems and components  (such as windows, roofs, and plumbing, electrical, and mechanical  systems), which are intended to significantly increase the usable life of the  buildings. Full modernizations are comprehensive renovations that replace  or restore nearly all the major systems in a building. Partial  modernizations are more limited and address one or a few systems in the  building.", "Limited scope projects: Projects associated with a single building  system\u2014such as lighting or plumbing\u2014that could include upgrading  existing systems or installing energy and environmental improvements,  such as installing energy-generating photovoltaic panels on the roof of a  building.", "Small projects: Limited scope projects whose costs are below the  prospectus level.", "GSA officials told us that in selecting Recovery Act projects, they gave  priority to those projects that would help transform federal buildings into  high-performance green buildings and obligate funds quickly. Obligating  funds quickly was important because the Recovery Act requires GSA to  obligate $5 billion by September 30, 2010, and to obligate the full Recovery  Act funding amount, $5.55 billion, by September 30, 2011. To reflect these  priorities, GSA developed selection criteria for full and partial building  modernization projects, which are presented in table 2 in descending order  of weight.", "GSA scored projects in accordance with the relative priority it assigned to  each criterion and then ranked potential Recovery Act projects on the  basis of these results. GSA assigned the highest priority to the first three  criteria listed in table 2. The execution timing and minimizing execution  risk criteria are designed to identify projects that could be started quickly,  would create jobs as soon as possible, and would also have a low risk of  not being completed within the Recovery Act\u2019s deadlines. Recovery Act  funds must be spent no later than 5 years after the end of the fiscal year in  which the funds are required to be obligated. Typically, the funds for a  large construction project are obligated throughout the life of the project,  and the 5-year limitation on expenditures generally does not apply to funds  made available to GSA for acquisition and construction. Therefore, the  Recovery Act\u2019s establishment of deadlines for obligating and spending  funds differs from the typical time frames for GSA\u2019s construction projects.", "Many of the projects GSA selected for new construction and full and  partial building modernizations had previously received partial funding for  design or for early project phases. For example, 41 of the 63 new  construction and full and partial building modernization projects had  received funding from previous fiscal year appropriations. GSA officials  said that they used Recovery Act funding to quickly start or expand  construction on these projects, while also identifying ways to incorporate  energy savings or environmental improvements into their design.  Additionally, GSA funded cost escalation for some ongoing projects\u2014that  is, projects that needed additional funding to start or to complete  construction. For example, according to GSA officials, the renovation of  the Thurgood Marshall U.S. Courthouse in New York, a full building  modernization, needed Recovery Act funding to address an increase in  cost after bids from contractors came in higher than expected.", "According to GSA officials, the other five criteria listed in table 2 are those  GSA typically uses when selecting capital projects, such as improving  facility condition. In GSA\u2019s supplemental information to its financial  statements for fiscal year 2009, GSA reported an inventory of capital  repairs and alterations estimated to cost approximately $5.0 billion. The  buildings GSA selected for its Recovery Act program account for about  $3.7 billion of this estimate, but the Recovery Act funding will not fully  address the needs of each selected building, since reducing GSA\u2019s capital  repairs and alterations inventory was not the intent of the Recovery Act,  according to GSA officials. GSA officials also stated that they will use  Recovery Act funds for projects or elements of projects that are not among  the estimated capital improvement needs, such as projects to incorporate  high-performance green building features. While improving facility  condition was one of GSA\u2019s selection criteria, making facilities greener  and obligating funds quickly received higher priority. GSA officials  estimated that Recovery Act projects will reduce the agency\u2019s total capital  repairs and alterations estimate by $1.5 to $2.0 billion.", "According to the Web site, www.recovery.gov (Recovery.gov), the  Recovery Act has three immediate goals: (1) create new jobs and save  existing ones, (2) spur economic activity and invest in long-term growth,  and (3) foster \u201cunprecedented\u201d levels of accountability and transparency  in government spending. In addition, GSA\u2019s Recovery Act program plan  states that GSA will maintain an unprecedented level of openness and  transparency in operations. GSA has published information on its  Recovery Act program on both its own Recovery Act Web site and  Recovery.gov. The information includes the following documents:    The Agencywide Recovery Plan details GSA\u2019s broad Recovery Act goals  for the entire agency, GSA programs funded by the Recovery Act,  contracting operations, and agency accountability efforts.

The Executive  Steering Committee has developed a nationwide program strategy and  priorities for the program. Figure 1 illustrates the organization of the PMO.  A program management recovery executive heads the PMO and is  supported by zone and regional recovery executives, who are responsible  for monitoring and reviewing the performance of Recovery Act projects  and managing risks at the regional level. In addition, subject matter  experts support the regional teams in delivering projects, and two  contractors are responsible for project tracking and for reporting and  communication. The PMO uses data from projects to look for trends in  cost and schedule performance for the program.", "As shown in figure 2, GSA has grouped its 11 regions into three Recovery  Act zones. GSA officials stated that the objectives of the zone structure  are to create and foster the sharing of ideas and resources and to provide  project oversight. Also, the zone structure provides a link between the  project leadership and the PMO. According to GSA officials, the PMO\u2019s  efforts and success have also contributed to improvements in GSA\u2019s other  operations. For example, GSA is reorganizing PBS\u2019s internal structure to  create more national coherence by having all 11 regions work together, as  under the Recovery Act zone structure, rather than independently.  Furthermore, GSA is realigning its Office of Design and Construction to  directly coordinate with the PMO, which will allow the two offices to  w the two offices to  share ideas.  share ideas.", "The PMO established interim milestones to help GSA achieve the two  Recovery Act obligation deadlines.

Table 5 shows the four interim milestones that the  PMO set and the cumulative amount that GSA obligated by each of the  milestones. As of April 30, 2010, GSA had obligated just over $4.0 billion.  According to GSA officials, GSA remains on track to achieve its overall  Recovery Act obligation deadlines.", "According to GSA\u2019s Agencywide Recovery Plan, GSA\u2019s goal is to award 99  percent of Recovery Act dollars through competitive awards. GSA has  identified approximately 1 percent of Recovery Act funds that may be  awarded through other-than-fully-competitive means. To help achieve  this goal, GSA plans to add Recovery Act projects to existing,  competitively awarded contracts when they are within the scope of work,  award ceiling, and terms of the agreement. In March 2010, the GSA Office  of Inspector General (OIG) reported that GSA incorrectly executed the  construction portion of the contract to which a Recovery Act project was  added\u2014a federal courthouse in Austin, Texas\u2014 and concluded that the  award was not competitive. PBS disagreed with the OIG\u2019s findings. GSA  has awarded additional work to this project using Recovery Act funding  and considered it to be competitively awarded because it considers the  initial contract to have been competitively awarded.", "GSA\u2019s $5.55 billion in Recovery Act funding, which must be obligated over  2 fiscal years, is over three times the agency\u2019s 2009 funding for new  construction and renovations. To address this increase in its workload,  GSA determined that it would need to add over 200 full-time-equivalent  personnel, including contracting officers. Additionally, GSA officials said  they have transferred experienced personnel from other work to Recovery  Act projects. GSA is also hiring temporary federal personnel and  contractors, both to address the increased workload and to fill the gaps  created by transferring experienced staff to Recovery Act work. As of  April 23, 2010, GSA had hired 96 full-time-equivalent personnel and 38  contractors, and it plans to hire an estimated 68 additional personnel by  the end of fiscal year 2010.", "The Recovery Act requires recipients to report data on jobs funded each  calendar quarter.

To promote accountability and  transparency on the use of Recovery Act funds, the Recovery  Accountability and Transparency Board worked with Federal Inspectors  General to establish a multiphased approach for reviewing agencies\u2019  oversight of recipients\u2019 Recovery Act data. The first phase, conducted  before the start of the first recipient reporting cycle, provided a snapshot  of agencies\u2019 data review processes.

However, we have reported on problems with data  reported by recipients of Recovery Act funds administered by federal  agencies generally, though not by GSA specifically. For example, in  November 2009, we reported that although the job data reported by  recipients provided some insight into their use of Recovery Act funding, a  range of significant reporting and quality issues needed to be addressed.  In December 2009, OMB issued guidance to further improve the quality of  the data that Recovery Act recipients submit. Furthermore, in March  2010, we reported that while progress was achieved in addressing some  data quality and reporting issues identified in the first round of recipient  reporting, data errors, reporting inconsistencies, and decisions made by  some recipients not to use the new job reporting guidance for the second  round compromised data quality and the ability to aggregate the data.

Additionally, full and partial building modernizations are listed together,  without information on which project falls under which category, thereby  making it difficult to distinguish between the two types. This distinction is  important because a full building modernization, which is a complete  renovation of an entire building, would be expected to incorporate more  green features than a partial building modernization. Moreover, without  this distinction, the public lacks context for evaluating GSA\u2019s efforts to  convert existing federal facilities to high-performance green buildings, as  provided in the Recovery Act.", "OMB reviewed GSA\u2019s project plan, and on March 31, 2009, GSA submitted  the plan, with the list of selected projects, to the Senate and House  Committees on Appropriations as required by the Recovery Act.

GSA officials said they made these  adjustments, in part, to take advantage of cost savings that they realized  when bids came in lower than expected, partly because of current  economic conditions. These adjustments led to changes in the amounts  of funds allocated for certain project categories, primarily affecting small  projects, as shown in table 6.", "While the revisions to GSA\u2019s project plan to date track the changes in  project cost estimates, they do not fully explain the addition or removal of  projects, nor do they address the lack of information on project scope.

The MPC are to be incorporated into  the project designs and cover the areas of energy, water, indoor  environmental quality, materials, and building design. The following are  examples of the MPC that are expected to be incorporated in GSA\u2019s  Recovery Act projects:  install advanced meters that measure the building\u2019s consumption of  electricity, natural gas, steam, and other sources of energy;    use high-efficiency water fixtures to help reduce water consumption;    use occupancy sensors on lighting to help conserve energy in areas of the  building that are unoccupied; and    salvage, recycle, or reuse at least 50 percent of construction and  demolition waste generated on a project.", "Each Recovery Act project is required to meet all MPC that are applicable  to its scope of work, unless it receives a waiver from the Regional  Recovery Executive and the PMO. Meeting the MPC for reducing water  consumption by 20 percent could be waived for projects that do not  include significant plumbing system upgrades, for example. As we have  noted previously, federal energy and water conservation requirements and  goals differ for different building categories. Therefore, GSA has  established two sets of MPC, one for new construction and full building  modernization projects and a second, less stringent set for partial building  modernizations and limited scope projects. (App. II provides more detailed  information on the two sets of MPC.)", "We found that both sets of MPC generally align with most of the elements  of a high-performance green building, as established by EISA, and with key  federal energy and water conservation requirements and goals (see tables  3 and 4). However, the MPC do not address one statutory high- performance green building element\u2014to reduce the environmental and  energy impacts of transportation through building location and site design.  For example, a project could address this element by installing the  infrastructure necessary for alternative fuel vehicles or giving priority  parking to carpool and van-share participants. According to GSA officials,  they did not include this element in the MPC because the MPC are based  on the Guiding Principles for Federal Leadership in High Performance  and Sustainable Buildings, which does not specifically address  transportation. GSA officials noted that a number of the GSA Recovery Act  projects are making transportation-related improvements as part of their  efforts to obtain a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design  (LEED) Silver rating. However, because the MPC do not require such  improvements, project managers may not be systematically determining  whether transportation-related improvements can be included in projects,  as they are for energy and water conservation improvements, thereby  missing opportunities to incorporate that high-performance green building  element. Furthermore, because GSA has not given transportation-related  improvements the MPC designation, GSA will not be collecting data on  those improvements that are being done as part of Recovery Act projects.", "We also found that the MPC are expected to contribute toward meeting  the federal conservation requirements and goals to reduce energy and  water intensity, although they do not explicitly address these objectives.  The MPC do not mention the specific percentages and dates set out in law  and executive order for reducing energy and water intensity. GSA officials  said that this is because the objectives apply to GSA\u2019s building inventory  as a whole, rather than to individual buildings. Nevertheless, the officials  stated that they expect Recovery Act projects to contribute significantly  toward meeting the agency\u2019s inventorywide federal requirements and goals  for both energy and water. According to the officials, new construction  and full building modernization projects should exceed these requirements  and goals because they must meet other, more stringent, MPC for energy  and water conservation. For example, they explained, the MPC require  new construction and full modernization projects to exceed ASHRAE  Standard 90.1-2007 by 30 percent, which is a higher energy conservation  standard than the federal requirement to decrease energy intensity by 3  percent per year. GSA officials said they expect partial building  modernizations and limited scope projects to make a more modest  contribution toward meeting these requirements due to their reduced  scope."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Recovery Act Projects Are Likely to Vary Greatly in the Extent of Their Energy and Water Conservation Improvements", "paragraphs": ["According to GSA officials, all buildings receiving Recovery Act funds are  expected to move toward becoming high-performance green buildings.  The officials stated they have not developed an exact number of projects  that could result in a high-performance green building because the  definition from EISA is too broad and is a relative measure. For example,  two projects that reduce water consumption by 1 percent and 10 percent,  respectively, both meet the high-performance green buildings element of  reducing water usage. In addition, GSA officials said that the high- performance green building criteria in EISA can sometime be at odds.  Applying high-performance green building criteria by increasing the  amount of space for tenants in an effort to improve worker productivity,  for example, can actually result in an increase in the building\u2019s energy use  as opposed to a decrease. Consequently, GSA officials said that they  developed the MPC in an attempt to provide a better structure for gauging  the expected energy and water conservation performance of Recovery Act  projects.", "Furthermore, the buildings are likely to vary greatly in the extent of their  energy and water conservation improvements because of a variety of  factors. Some Recovery Act projects, for example, are broad in scope and  are being used to modernize multiple building systems\u2014such as electrical;  water; and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems (HVAC)\u2014 while others are modernizing relatively few systems or a specific  component of a building. Additionally, existing infrastructure may affect  the extent of energy and environmental improvements for certain  buildings. For example, it will likely be more difficult to make certain  green improvements to historic federal buildings because of the need to  preserve features of the buildings, such as historic windows or ornate wall  coverings. Finally, some projects were designed prior to the Recovery Act  and may only have included a small number of green improvements. To  include more green improvements at this juncture may mean that the  projects would have to undergo significant redesign. Finally, the number  of green improvements employed for a project may also be affected  because of unanticipated problems discovered during the modernization.  The discovery of asbestos on a project, for example, may result in the need  to shift project funds originally slated for green improvements to asbestos  abatement. In general, according to GSA officials, the new construction  and full modernization projects are expected to significantly improve their  energy and water conservation performance and exceed some federal  energy and water conservation requirements and goals, especially those  related to energy and water reduction. Conversely, GSA officials expect  smaller projects to have less significant green improvements and to  address only those federal energy and water conservation requirements  and goals that fall within their scope of work. For example, a project  primarily involving plumbing upgrades might only address the federal  water conservation goal concerning reductions in water intensity.", "The 12 GSA Recovery Act projects (8 full and 4 partial modernizations) we  examined differed significantly in their planned green improvements.  (App. III provides more detailed information on the 12 projects we  examined.) For 3 of the projects, GSA is either implementing or planning  to implement a broad array of green improvements that will touch on  multiple systems throughout the buildings. These full building  modernizations will principally focus on replacing older, less efficient  mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems with newer, high-efficiency  systems. While these projects had already been receiving agency funding  for some time, Recovery Act funding, according to some project managers,  has enabled them to add features that will enhance buildings\u2019 energy and  water conservation performance. Many of these features were not  originally planned. Examples of full building modernization projects that  are expected to result in extensive improvements include the following:    Edith Green-Wendell Wyatt Federal Building in Portland, Oregon. GSA  plans to transform the deteriorating 30-year-old federal building into a  high-performance green building by replacing the building\u2019s electrical,  plumbing, and HVAC systems. GSA also plans to upgrade the building\u2019s life  safety, mechanical, elevator, and security systems as well as install  photovoltaic panels and rain harvesting features on the building\u2019s roof.  The project management staff said that Recovery Act funding gave them  the opportunity to vacate the entire building during the renovation, rather  than proceeding two floors at a time, a key decision that allowed them to  expand the scope of the project and add significant green improvements to  the building. GSA is exploring the option of adding wire mesh or a  perforated metal screen up the side of the building to shade the facade  from the sun, thus helping to reduce the amount of energy needed for  cooling the building.", "Mary Switzer Building in Washington, D.C. GSA is also planning  extensive green improvements for the Switzer building. The project  includes new HVAC, plumbing, and emergency power systems;  replacement of aged plumbing; asbestos abatement; and restoration work  performed on the building\u2019s historic windows. According to project  management staff, the Recovery Act allowed them to accelerate the  modernization of the building by 1 year. It also allowed them to exceed  some of the MPC issued by GSA, including an estimated 55 percent  reduction in water use\u2014above the 20 percent called for in the MPC for  water use. In addition, the project estimates that it will address 30 percent  of its hot water demand using solar hot water equipment. GSA also  expects that approximately 70 to 75 percent of all the materials from the  demolition phases of the project will be recycled.", "In five of the full building modernization projects we examined, GSA is  planning to implement green improvements that are less extensive but that  still address major systems or building components. These projects will  generally focus on upgrades to current building components, but some  building systems will also be replaced. Two projects contain historical  elements that will have to be addressed as well. Several of the project  managers stated that many of the green improvements slated for their  projects would not have been funded without the Recovery Act. Examples  of these projects include the following:    John W. Peck Federal Building in Cincinnati, Ohio. The modernization  of the 44-year-old John W. Peck Federal Building in Cincinnati, Ohio,  includes extensive exterior upgrades, such as installing insulated, dual- glass windows to decrease the heating and cooling loads for the entire  building. GSA estimates the improved windows alone will reduce energy  consumption for heating and cooling by about 24 percent compared with  the industry standard. The project also includes extensive interior work  that will save energy\u2014for example, new lighting fixtures and controls. The  lighting improvements are expected to reduce energy consumption for  lighting by about 50 percent, according to the project manager. This  reduction would be significant since lighting consumes about 30 percent  of the building\u2019s energy.", "Birch Bayh U.S. Courthouse in Indianapolis, Indiana. The project  involves numerous system upgrades while preserving the historical  character of the 1905 courthouse. For example, the project will upgrade  the courthouse\u2019s HVAC system, where most of the air handling units and  associated controls and equipment will be replaced. This change will allow  the building managers to keep a more constant temperature and humidity  in the historic courtrooms, while conserving energy in other areas of the  building when they are not in use. Another green improvement will be the  installation of a vegetative roof and a 10,000 gallon rainwater collection  system. The system will allow the building to meet the federal requirement  for storm water control, according to the project manager, and reduce  indoor potable water use by using the collected rainwater for toilets. The  project manager anticipates a 20 to 30 percent reduction in indoor potable  water use.", "Finally, four partial modernization projects we examined plan to  implement relatively few green improvements. The focus of each project  was primarily to improve the efficiency of individual building components,  as opposed to replacing or upgrading an entire building system. In general,  project managers stated that these projects would have been slow to  receive funding or would probably not have received funding at all if had it  not been for the Recovery Act. Examples of these projects include the  following:    Denver Federal Center in Lakewood, Colorado. The Lakewood project  will upgrade an approximately 70-year-old utility system that provides  both water and sewer services to the center. According to the project  manager, the current system leaks profusely. Since 2001, there have been  90 water line breaks exceeding $1 million in repair costs. GSA officials  further stated that although the project is not specifically building-related,  it is an important project to GSA and its tenants because the federal center  houses approximately 6,000 federal employees from 30 agencies. Failure  of this system could force the center to close, with associated lost wages  of about $1.5 million per day, according to the GSA manager for the  project.   26 Federal Plaza in New York City. The project will address severe water  damage to the plaza\u2019s underground parking garage caused by leaks in the  plaza. The project\u2019s green improvements include photovoltaic lighting and  security cameras that will work with lower-intensity lighting, a new chiller,  and lighting controls on several floors of the building.", "Table 7 shows details of the 12 GSA Recovery Act projects we examined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA Does Not Have Sufficient Data to Measure Progress but Is Taking Steps to Improve Data Collection", "paragraphs": ["In adhering to the MPC that include both high-performance green building  and energy and water conservation requirements and goals, GSA\u2019s  Recovery Act projects are making the buildings greener and addressing  the requirements and goals. However, GSA cannot measure the extent of  progress because it does not have sufficient data on improvements  resulting from the projects. In October 2009, GSA began collecting energy  and performance information on Recovery Act projects through a \u201cdata  call\u201d that asked project managers to categorize the status of each of a  project\u2019s MPC as either \u201cnot started,\u201d \u201cin progress,\u201d \u201ccomplete,\u201d \u201cnot  applicable,\u201d or \u201cwaiver.\u201d However, GSA officials said their guidance was  not detailed enough to clearly define the response categories, thereby  making it difficult for project managers to determine when each status  should be selected. In December 2009, GSA reported that the data  collected through this effort were, in some instances, incomplete and  unreliable. GSA concluded that it needed to revise future data calls to  gather more specific information on how projects would address their  MPCs and to facilitate the tracking and reporting of the data. Furthermore,  the data were limited to about 28 percent of the Recovery Act projects  because those were the only projects that had progressed far enough to  have such data. Several of the project managers from the 12 Recovery Act  projects we examined reported problems in responding to the data call.  For example, two project managers stated that they initially  misinterpreted the appropriate response category for their projects and  consequently inadvertently completed the incorrect MPC checklist.  However, these mistakes were corrected in subsequent updates to the  MPC checklists for the projects.", "To obtain more complete and reliable data, GSA is rolling out a new  centralized system for collecting data on Recovery Act projects\u2019 energy  and water conservation performance. GSA officials told us the goals of the  system are to (1) collect information on the MPC for each project and to  aggregate that information, thereby allowing GSA to know the extent to  which projects are collectively addressing MPC; (2) provide subject matter  experts with a means of reviewing projects\u2019 progress in achieving the MPC  and suggesting changes as appropriate; and (3) generate customized  reports upon request. GSA officials said the agency began using the system  in April 2010 and expects it to be available online to all project managers  soon.", "According to GSA officials, the new system will include more detailed  information on each project\u2019s MPC, such as the types of green  improvements that will be installed, as well as supporting documentation  that demonstrates exactly how the MPC will be accomplished. Moreover,  the system will include supporting documentation for cases in which a  project was scheduled to meet a MPC, like using renewable energy, but  was unable to do so. Supporting documentation could include such things  as projections, calculations, milestones, constraints, and associated cost- benefit analyses. GSA officials cautioned, however, that energy and  environmental performance is difficult to project accurately and can be  affected by a number of variables beyond GSA\u2019s control, such as tenants\u2019  behavior and changes in a tenant agency\u2019s mission. For example, GSA\u2019s  estimate of energy savings for a building could be based on a tenant\u2019s  expected 13-hour workday, while the tenant\u2019s actual workday might be  longer. Similarly, an agency may need to hire additional staff in order to  respond to an emergency, which would unexpectedly increase energy use.  According to the GSA officials, a design-phase estimate that falls within  about 20 percent of actual performance would be considered \u201cpretty  good.\u201d GSA officials stated that the system will be used to track the  progress of Recovery Act projects until their completion.", "According to GSA officials, they have nearly finished developing guidance  for project staff who will use the system. GSA has also begun to train staff,  starting with those with new construction or full and partial building  modernization projects that are far enough along in the design process to  have information on how they will achieve the MPC. To date, six project  managers have been trained in using the system, according to GSA  officials. GSA plans to use a separate training module for managers of  limited-scope projects because less information is required for them than  for new construction and full and partial building modernization projects.  GSA officials have not estimated when all project managers would be  trained. However, these officials said they expect to have preliminary or  high-level data in the system for all projects by the end of July 2010."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GSA Identifies Risks to Its Program and Risk Mitigation Strategies, but Some Project-Level Risk Plans Are Not Complete", "paragraphs": ["GSA has identified risks to its Recovery Act program and risk mitigation  strategies. GSA\u2019s approach to risk management is generally consistent  with best practices we have developed. GSA focuses on broad risks that  could affect GSA\u2019s ability to address objectives for the agency as a whole,  such as ensuring program goals are achieved and fraud, waste, and abuse  are minimized; stimulating the economy; and improving the environmental  performance of federal buildings. Broadly defined, risk management is a  strategic process for helping policymakers make decisions about assessing  risk and typically involves appraising and evaluating risks to a program or  project and selecting mitigation strategies. In April 2009, GSA developed a  plan to guide risk management efforts for agencywide risks to its Recovery  Act program and developed an initial inventory of those risks. In March  2010, PMO developed a Recovery Risk Mitigation Plan specific to PBS.  This plan identified 48 risks to PBS\u2019s program, 14 of which were  considered key risks, shown in table 8.", "This plan also contains assessments of the likelihood and potential impact  of the key risks, identifies mitigation strategies, and establishes  mechanisms for monitoring the risks and mitigation actions. The key risks  are associated with areas such as financial tracking and reporting,  acquisitions, and project management. For example, as indicated in table  8, GSA identified a risk that Recovery Act funds could be used for  unauthorized purposes, limiting GSA\u2019s ability to meet Recovery Act  accountability goals. To mitigate this risk, GSA identified various internal  processes, including national and regional approval of a project\u2019s scope,  multiple levels of review of project expenditures, and a process for  reviewing contractor invoices to ensure services are valid and authorized.  Agency officials told us that internal auditors, as part of GSA\u2019s existing  internal audit program, will test the mitigation actions put in place for the  14 key risks. In addition, they plan to assess and update the key risks on a  monthly basis.", "We assessed GSA\u2019s risk management approach against best practices that  we developed in the areas of strategic planning, risk assessment,  evaluation and selection of alternatives for addressing risks, and  implementation and monitoring of risk-mitigation strategies (see table 9).", "We found that GSA\u2019s approach generally reflected the best practices in all  four areas noted in table 9. In the area of strategic planning, GSA clearly  identifies Recovery Act goals and objectives as well as GSA program goals  when considering potential risks to the program, such as stimulating the  economy by spending Recovery Act funds quickly and improving the  environmental performance of federal facilities. In addition, in the area of  assessing risks, GSA established a process for documenting its assessment  of risks that allows for updates and results in a qualitative assessment of  the likelihood and potential impact of the risks on its Recovery Act goals  and strategic objectives. Also, for monitoring the implementation of risk  responses, GSA officials said the risk management team holds monthly  meetings with senior officials to review key risks, identify any new risks,  and ensure that proper controls are in place. However, there were areas  where GSA could improve its risk management efforts. For example, in the  area of evaluating and selecting alternatives for addressing risks, GSA had  limited information in its plan and other risk management documents  about its process for evaluating and selecting alternative mitigation  strategies. GSA officials said that many of the mitigation strategies were  put in place before the formal risk assessment was completed as part of  GSA\u2019s planning to implement the program and during ongoing discussions  about risks facing the program. Therefore, a full analysis of potential risk  mitigation alternatives was not completed.", "During our review of 12 Recovery Act case study projects, project  management staff told us about some of the key project-level risks that  could affect the success of the projects. Staff at 5 of the 12 case study  projects we examined cited risks associated with the accelerated timelines  imposed by the Recovery Act. Project management staff with whom we  spoke at one case study said the tight timeline imposed by the Recovery  Act was the most serious risk to their project. They said the project faces a  challenge to complete all of the work necessary to achieve its  environmental and energy goals, including completing a study of the  building to identify potential energy-reducing upgrades, working through  the study recommendations for upgrading the building with all of the  stakeholders on the project, and completing the additional design work  related to the selected upgrades. This study must be completed at an  accelerated pace to enable the additional work to be awarded and the  associated funding to be obligated within the Recovery Act\u2019s time frames.  In addition, 8 of the 12 case study project staff with whom we spoke said  that they faced the more typical project risks associated with uncertainty  about aspects of a building that is slated to receive upgrades, such as the  degree of contamination with hazardous material, the absence of building  system and structural drawings, or questions about the drawings\u2019  accuracy. For example, project management staff for one project said that  they had concerns about the accuracy of the as-built drawings\u2014the plans  that detail the construction of the building and other work performed on  the building. These staff noted that if the building needs more structural  work than originally planned, the project\u2019s cost could increase and less  funding might be available for green improvements to the building.", "Although GSA has developed a systematic process for identifying and  planning for risks for its Recovery Act program, GSA officials said that to  address project-level risks, such as those we have previously discussed,  they rely on informal communication between headquarters and project  management staff in the regions. Specifically, regional staff discuss  project-level risks or challenges during weekly telephone calls with the  PMO. In addition, GSA officials said they track whether projects are on  budget and on schedule so they can identify when projects are  encountering problems. GSA officials said that because so many projects  are being implemented, it would be difficult for GSA to systematically  assess and respond to individual project risks at the PMO level. In  addition, because of the accelerated pace necessary to implement the  program within Recovery Act deadlines and the additional responsibilities  for regional staff associated with Recovery Act funding, such as new  reporting requirements, GSA officials said they were reluctant to add new  risk management reporting requirements for project management staff.", "GSA officials said they rely on project management staff in the regions to  manage project risks and complete risk planning documents that are  required by GSA\u2019s Project Management Guide for the Public Buildings  Service. The guide, issued by the PBS Office of the Chief Architect, is  GSA\u2019s road map for project management and details what project  management staff should do to manage risks at the project level. The guide  discusses two planning documents for projects, the Comprehensive  Project Plan (CPP) and the Project Definition Rating Index (PDRI), both of  which GSA project management staff identified as related to risk planning.  The guide says the CPP ensures efficient and effective project delivery by  articulating project goals and implementation strategies and should be  updated throughout a project to evaluate the success of the plan to date  and to adapt it to changing circumstances. In addition, the guide says the  PDRI provides an objective evaluation of the project at various stages of  its development and its benefits include a more refined definition of the  scope of a project and an assessment of risk. Instructions for filling out the  PDRI say the tool should be updated during the development of the  project, from the preliminary stages to the start of construction. Finally,  OMB\u2019s Capital Programming Guide cites the need for developing and  documenting a systematic plan to address project risk and calls for risk  planning to continue throughout the life of the project.", "In September 2009, GSA\u2019s OIG found that the PMO was not requiring full  CPPs for Recovery Act projects and raised concerns about the adequacy of  risk planning at the project level. During our review, we found that 9 of  our 12 case study projects had not fully completed the required risk  planning documents. For example, for 1 project we visited, the CPP had  not been updated since before Recovery Act funding was received and did  not list Recovery Act funding in the section detailing project funding  sources. For 1 project we visited, staff said that although they did not  complete a PDRI, they continually work to identify potential risks and  develop risk mitigation strategies as needed. Some of the project  management staff with whom we spoke for our 12 case studies said they  have regular meetings with regional management about their projects to  discuss potential risks or challenges facing the project. Staff from 1 project  that had not completed GSA\u2019s risk planning documents said they had  completed other documents that were similar. Finally, some project staff  told us that they considered the PDRI a requirement for projects that go  through GSA\u2019s normal project approval process, but that GSA\u2019s Recovery  Act-funded projects were unique and they did not think it was required.  GSA officials said that the PDRI is typically completed during the approval  process for prospectus-level projects, but that Recovery Act projects did  not go through this process to get funding. However, GSA officials from  the PMO said that a CPP was required for all full and partial  modernizations, adding that Recovery Act projects should complete the  risk planning documents called for in the guide. In addition, project  management staff in the regions said that Recovery Act projects are being  implemented at an accelerated pace and that this presents challenges to  the agency. Finally, as we have previously mentioned, OMB\u2019s Capital  Programming Guide calls for risk planning at the project level. OMB\u2019s  guide calls for project managers to develop and document a systematic  approach to risk planning that continuously identifies, assesses, responds  to, and monitors project-level risks, adding that risk management is an  integral part of project management. It is important for GSA to ensure that  risk planning at the project-level meets the agency\u2019s standards, as laid out  in GSA\u2019s guide or other guidance, such as OMB\u2019s Capital Programming  Guide. GSA\u2019s reliance on informal communication channels for overseeing  project-level risks, without ensuring that project-level risks are being  identified and planned for, could result in some vulnerabilities going  unidentified and increase the potential for risks to negatively affect GSA\u2019s  program as projects move from preliminary stages to construction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Recovery Act has provided GSA with an unprecedented opportunity  to repair or restore aging, deteriorating federal buildings and, in so doing,  to enhance their energy and environmental performance.
