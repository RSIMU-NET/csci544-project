The agency\u2019s national office in Washington, D.C., provides policy direction and guidance on the loan making and servicing aspects of the programs, and reviews and approves certain loans. Many of the loan making and servicing functions are performed by RD mission area staff who are physically located in field offices throughout the country.", "RBS operates the following loan programs: the business and industry (B&I) program, the intermediary relending program (IRP), and the rural economic development (RED) program. The following is a general description of each program.", "B&I loans. A B&I loan can be either a direct government-funded loan or a loan made by another lender on which RBS guarantees repayment in the event of a loss. These loans are made to finance almost any business project that creates or retains jobs in rural areas and to finance projects in all segments of the economy, such as mining, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail sales. There are only a few activities for which B&I loans cannot be used, such as funding gambling facilities, race tracks, and golf courses. Additionally, RBS\u2019 regulations, which, according to the agency\u2019s officials, are being revised, provide that direct B&I loans cannot be used for constructing hotels and motels, and tourism and recreational facilities. However, guaranteed B&I loans can be used for those purposes. The interest rate on a direct loan is based on the prime rate that was in effect in the quarter of a year prior to the quarter in which the loan is made. The interest rate on a guaranteed loan is the rate agreed to by the lender making the loan and the borrower. According to RBS officials, this rate is generally the lender\u2019s prime rate\u2014the rate a lender charges its best customers\u2014plus 1 to 1.5 additional percentage points.", "IRP loans. IRP loans are direct government-funded loans made for relending, mostly to nonprofit community development organizations, and, to a lesser extent, to other borrowers, such as for-profit and nonprofit cooperatives. Specifically, the IRP loan funds are deposited into a revolving fund that an RBS borrower\u2014an intermediary\u2014has established. The intermediary relends the money to its borrowers\u2014which may be individuals, public or private organizations, or any other legal entity\u2014for financing business or community development projects in rural areas. IRP loan funds are not allowed for certain purposes, including funding gambling facilities, race tracks, and golf courses. RBS\u2019 approval is required for the intermediary\u2019s relending of the IRP loan funds. RBS charges its borrowers a 1-percent interest rate on IRP loans. The interest rate on a loan from the revolving fund is the rate agreed to by the intermediary and its borrower. RBS does not specify what this rate should be.", "RED loans. RED loans are also direct loans made for relending. The loans are made only to borrowers that have outstanding electricity or telecommunications loans from USDA\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and to former RUS borrowers that repaid their electricity loans early at a discount. Unlike IRP loans, a RED loan, when approved, is targeted to a specific project. The RED loan funds are deposited into a fund that the RUS borrower has established. The RUS borrower relends the money to other borrowers, which may be any public or private organization or other legal entity, for an economic development and job creation project. These projects include new business creation, existing business expansion, community improvements, and infrastructure development. RED loan funds cannot be used for certain purposes, including the RUS borrowers\u2019 electricity or telecommunications operations or a community\u2019s television system or facility, unless tied to an educational or medical project.

Administrative expenses receive separate appropriations; they are treated on a cash basis and reported separately in the budget.

It defines the subsidy cost of loan guarantees as the present value of cash flows from estimated payments by the government (for defaults and delinquencies, interest rate subsidies, and other payments) minus estimated payments to the government (for loan origination and other fees, penalties, and recoveries). Permanent, indefinite appropriations are available should the appropriated subsidy cost be less than the estimates in a later fiscal year.", "Before credit reform, credit programs\u2014like other programs\u2014were reported in the budget on a cash basis. As a result, it was difficult to make appropriate cost comparisons between direct loan and loan guarantee programs and between credit and noncredit programs. Credit programs had different economic effects than most budget outlays, such as the purchase of goods and services, income transfers, and grants. In the case of direct loans, for example, the fact that the loan recipient was obligated to repay the government over time meant that the budgetary impact of a direct loan disbursement could be much less than other budget transactions of the same dollar amount. This lower budgetary impact also created a bias in favor of loan guarantees over direct loans. Loan guarantees appeared to be free, while direct loans appeared to be expensive because the budget did not recognize that at least some of the loan guarantees would default and that some of the direct loans would be repaid.", "The Credit Reform Act changed this treatment for direct loans and loan guarantees made on or after October 1, 1991."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From USDA", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on USDA\u2019s letter dated November 9, 1998."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. The final report was revised to reflect USDA\u2019s comment. 2. USDA\u2019s comment on the number and total dollar value of guaranteed B&I loans approved in fiscal year 1993 overlooks 94 loans valued at $87,401,900, which were approved under an emergency supplemental appropriation authorization. These additional loans are contained in the automated obligation records that we obtained from the Finance Office of USDA\u2019s Rural Development (RD) mission area and were reported in a USDA appropriation request as having been approved in fiscal 1993. We have added a note to table 1 stating that the fiscal year 1993 information includes loans made under this emergency appropriation provision. 3. Our report is based on the automated obligation records that the RD mission area\u2019s Finance Office provided us for each fiscal year. These automated records show that RBS obligated $421.6 million of guaranteed B&I loans for fiscal year 1995. However, USDA commented that it obligated $2 million more, for a total of $423.6 million. We rechecked the automated records that we had been provided and did not identify additional obligations totaling $2 million. Subsequently, officials in the Finance Office said that the fiscal year 1995 automated record that we were provided did not include adjustments that had been made to the agency\u2019s master loan file, which increased the total obligations by approximately $2 million. We have adjusted the financial statistics on the guaranteed B&I loans to include these additional obligations. 4. We agree and have adjusted the financial statistics accordingly. Reports from the RD mission area\u2019s Finance Office show that 19 loans with a total value of $6,825,000 had been obligated in the first half of fiscal year 1998. The draft reviewed by USDA included four additional loans valued at $1,680,000 that had been approved but not obligated in the first half of fiscal year 1998. 5. We agree and have adjusted the subsidy cost amount and other appropriate statistics. The draft reviewed by USDA had the subsidy costs that USDA reported in its annual appropriation requests, including $2.6 million for fiscal year 1996. 6. USDA states that, as more loans are made, the delinquency rate decreases, implying that the most recent loans are more financially secure. Our view is that there has simply been less time for delinquencies to occur on loans made most recently, and the delinquency rate for these loans may well increase as time passes. 7. USDA states that only a small portion of loans made in recent years has resulted in losses. It is reasonable to expect a low level of losses on recently made loans. (See comment 6.) 8.

We used these data sources to compile information on the outstanding principal in each program and the portion of outstanding principal that was owed by delinquent borrowers at the end of fiscal year 1993 through the first half of fiscal 1998 and the losses that RBS has incurred during these years.
