Further, the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 requires DHS to conduct such a review every 4 years. GAO reported in 2011 on DHS's first QHSR and recommended DHS provide sufficient time for stakeholder consultations and examine how risk information could be used to prioritize mission efforts. DHS issued its second QHSR in 2014.", "GAO was asked to assess the QHSR. This report addresses the extent to which DHS (1) examined and used risk information to inform the QHSR and its implementation, (2) aligned its budget and performance measures to QHSR mission goals, and (3) collaborated with stakeholders to develop the QHSR. GAO analyzed relevant statutes and QHSR documentation; conducted a nongeneralizable survey of DHS-identified federal and nonfederal QHSR stakeholders, receiving responses from 93 of the 182 QHSR stakeholders it contacted; and interviewed officials from DHS, federal, and nonfederal entities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assessed risk for the second Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) and considered threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences; however, DHS did not document how its various analyses were synthesized to generate results, thus limiting the reproducibility and defensibility of the results. Without sufficient documentation, the QHSR risk results cannot easily be validated or the assumptions tested, hindering DHS's ability to improve future assessments. In addition, the QHSR describes homeland security hazards, but does not rank those hazards or provide prioritized strategies to address them. Comparing and prioritizing risks helps identify where risk mitigation is most needed and helps justify cost-effective risk management options. Without determining prioritized risk outcomes, DHS is missing an opportunity to more efficiently mitigate risk or identify the resources required for addressing different levels and types of risks.", "The President's fiscal years 2015 and 2016 budget requests for DHS were generally presented in alignment with the QHSR. However, DHS has faced challenges accounting for its spending by mission, which it is taking actions to address, such as developing a new common appropriation structure to better link the department's funding request to the execution of its missions. DHS also developed performance measures for all of the QHSR mission areas.", "DHS expanded its stakeholder outreach efforts, but 43 of 61 stakeholders who provided narrative responses to one question in GAO's survey stated that collaboration with stakeholders could be improved. For example, one respondent reported that stakeholders were asked to react to information provided by DHS rather than assist in formulating the QHSR approach and execution. DHS officials reported being limited by staff, time, and other constraints, and thus directed stakeholders to provide feedback via various web-based forums. Although the online forums allowed DHS to reach 2,000 representatives during its 2014 QHSR development process, DHS's QHSR After Action Report noted that the tools were used to validate study findings instead of informing them. Without fostering interactive communication, DHS may miss opportunities to incorporate stakeholder perspectives from the entire homeland security enterprise and thereby may not have fully informed the QHSR effort."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that for future QHSRs DHS improve its risk assessment documentation, prioritize risks, and ensure stakeholder meetings are interactive.

Given the wide range of threats  facing the nation and the multitude of governmental and non- governmental stakeholders involved in preventing and responding to  these threats, it is vital that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  comprehensively examine the homeland security strategy of the nation  and make changes and recommendations as necessary. The  Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007  (9/11 Commission Act) requires that beginning in fiscal year 2009 and  every 4 years thereafter, DHS conduct a review that provides a  comprehensive examination of the homeland security strategy of the  United States. According to the 9/11 Commission Act, the review is to  delineate and update, as appropriate, the national homeland security  strategy, outline and prioritize critical homeland security missions, and  assess the organizational alignment of DHS with the homeland security  strategy and missions. The Act further requires that DHS conduct the  quadrennial review in consultation with stakeholders, such as heads of  federal agencies; key officials of the department; state, local, and tribal  governments; private sector representatives; and academics and other  policy experts.", "DHS issued its first Quadrennial Homeland Security Review (QHSR) in  February 2010, which we evaluated in two reports. We reported in  September 2011 that DHS outlined a strategic framework to guide the  homeland security efforts of the department and its partners, including  federal, state, local, and tribal government agencies; the private sector;  and non-governmental organizations. We found that time frames  provided for stakeholder consultations and outreach to nonfederal  stakeholders could be improved and that DHS did not use risk information  to inform QHSR implementation. We recommended that in future reviews,  DHS provide sufficient time for stakeholder consultations, explore options  for consulting with nonfederal stakeholders, and examine how risk  information could be considered in prioritizing QHSR implementation  mechanisms. DHS concurred with the recommendations and has taken  some actions toward addressing them, but has not fully implemented the  recommendations, as discussed later in this report. In December 2010,  we issued a report on the extent to which the QHSR addressed the 9/11  Commission Act\u2019s required reporting elements. We reported that of the  nine QHSR reporting elements, DHS addressed three and did not fully  address six. Elements DHS addressed included a description of  homeland security threats and an explanation of underlying assumptions  for the QHSR report. Elements not fully addressed included a prioritized  list of homeland security missions and discussions of cooperation  between the federal government and state, local, and tribal governments.  We made no recommendations in the December 2010 report.", "In June 2014, DHS issued its second QHSR, which described changes in  the overall security environment and refined DHS\u2019s five homeland  security missions.

This report addresses the following  questions:  (1)  To what extent has DHS examined and used risk information to  inform the QHSR and its implementation?  (2)  To what extent has DHS aligned its budget and performance  measures with the mission goals in the QHSR?  (3)  To what extent did DHS collaborate with stakeholders during the  2014 QHSR process?", "This report also examines whether the QHSR and DHS Strategic Plan  addressed the reporting elements specified for the QHSR in the 9/11  Commission Act, which we describe in appendix I.", "To determine the extent to which DHS has examined and used risk  information to inform the QHSR and its implementation, we analyzed  DHS documentation on its risk analysis process and results, such as  DHS\u2019s Current Strategic Environment and Future Strategic Environment  reports and classified risk characterization results. We also interviewed  current and former DHS Office of Strategy, Plans, Analysis, and Risk  (SPAR) officials responsible for developing the QHSR risk analyses.

Further, we reviewed Congressional Research Service reports  on DHS\u2019s appropriations from fiscal year 2015 and 2016. We also  interviewed DHS officials from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer,  SPAR, and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Coast  Guard (USCG), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), National Protection and  Programs Directorate (NPPD), and Transportation Security Administration  (TSA). We selected these components based on their share of the overall  DHS fiscal year 2015 budget, breadth of homeland security  responsibilities, and other factors. Views from these components are not  generalizable to all DHS components. We interviewed component officials  to determine the extent to which they used DHS guidance in developing  their annual budget requests and the extent to which such guidance  reflects the QHSR missions and goals. With respect to performance  measures, we reviewed DHS\u2019s Annual Performance Plans from fiscal  years 2013-2015 and 2014-2016, reviewed our prior work on key  attributes of successful performance measures and the GPRA  Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA). We also interviewed DHS officials  from SPAR and the office of Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E)  and from CBP, USCG, FEMA, ICE, NPPD, and TSA components in order  to determine the extent to which DHS developed performance measures  that aligned with mission goals.

The  stakeholders were identified by DHS and included representatives from  federal departments and agencies; state, local, and tribal organizations;  and DHS components, directorates and offices. DHS identified these  stakeholders based on 2014 QHSR participation. We asked open-ended  questions regarding the QHSR stakeholder consultation process,  including ways in which DHS elicited stakeholder input, how revisions to  timeframes may have impacted stakeholder responsibilities, any  challenges in collaborating with DHS and suggestions for improving future  QHSRs. Of the 93 individual stakeholders who responded to our survey,  75 respondents provided narrative comments. We analyzed these  comments to determine common benefits and challenges they identified  regarding DHS consultations during the QHSR. The comments received  from these respondents are not generalizable to the entire group of  stakeholders, but the feedback provided insights into stakeholder  perspectives on how QHSR stakeholder consultations were conducted  and how they could be improved.

To make this determination, three GAO  analysts independently compared the QHSR and Strategic Plan to each  of the nine reporting elements to determine whether each element was  addressed, not fully addressed, or not addressed. In cases when the  analysts disagreed, they reviewed and discussed their independent  assessments to reach concurrence.

In addition, officials from 5 of  the 6 components reported not using any of the stand-alone QHSR risk  products in their own risk assessment or strategic planning efforts.  Component officials reported that the QHSR risk results were highly  generalized and encompassed essentially all of DHS\u2019s missions\u2014in other  words, they did not offer priorities or a sense of relative risks. Component  officials added that since the QHSR results were not specific or granular,  they generally relied on their own analyses when making strategic,  operational, or resource planning decisions. For example, FEMA officials  agreed with the QHSR insights that climate change and natural disasters  were a serious threat to homeland security; however, officials said they  have been monitoring these issues through FEMA\u2019s multi-year Strategic  Foresight Initiative. Further, officials provided several reasons why they  do not use or are unable to use the stand-alone risk products. For  example, officials from one component questioned the quality of the  threat information and said they would like to see a more specific ranking  of threats, while officials from another component said the results were  too broad. Finally, officials from 3 of the 6 components were unaware of  the stand-alone risk documents.", "DHS officials stated that the QHSR presented a list of key homeland  security areas and explained that they chose not to rank or prioritize  within those areas because of concerns on the part of senior leadership,  among other issues. For instance, former DHS officials who led the  development of the HSSEA said that there were some hazards that stood  out as high risk across multiple consequence categories, but reported  DHS did not rank the risks because they were unable to develop criteria  for risk tiers (such as what would be high risk, medium risk, or low risk, for  example). Further, officials were concerned that risk-ranked priorities  might imply the need to make resource changes to particular areas, when  risk is just one of many inputs for decision-making.", "Former DHS officials who managed the QHSR risk assessment also said  that conducting a DHS-wide risk characterization was a challenge on  many levels. It required substantial dedicated resources and consensus  on what the analysis would describe (e.g., which scenarios and models  should be used). The officials added that there are not enough resources  at DHS to put sufficient effort into an enterprise-wide risk assessment that  includes prioritization of risk outcomes. Further, the officials  acknowledged that risk communication\u2014including communicating the  process for and implications of prioritized risk-rankings\u2014is a challenge.  Officials said that integrating risk-informed decision-making throughout  the department will require continued growth of DHS\u2019s risk analysis  community. The National Academies 2010 review of DHS\u2019s approach to  risk management echoed these statements in their recommendations to  DHS, which included building a strong risk culture at DHS and  incorporating robust social science capabilities into risk analyses and risk  management practices.", "DHS officials said that they used the HSSEA results and QHSR to  broadly inform department-level strategic planning. For example, officials  said the System Mapping Initiative helped inform the development of the  Southern Border and Approaches Campaign Plan and Strategy.  Officials added that the risk results helped inform the selection of strategic  priorities in the DHS Strategic Priorities Framework and were  incorporated into the annual budget guidance DHS provides to  components. Because the Strategic Priorities Framework and annual  budget guidance are considered internal deliberative work products, we  were unable to review the complete documents in order to determine the  extent to which the HSSEA and QHSR risk results were included.  However, officials from ICE reported that the Strategic Priorities  Framework was useful for understanding DHS\u2019s position on where to  accept risk.", "The 2013 risk management supplement to the NIPP states that  comparing and prioritizing the risks faced by different entities helps  identify where risk mitigation is most needed and determines and helps  justify the selection of the most cost-effective risk management options.  This risk prioritization supports resource allocation decisions, guides  investments in these programs, and highlights the measures that offer the  greatest return on investment. According to the NIPP, the risk  prioritization process involves aggregating, combining, and analyzing risk  assessment results to determine which assets, systems, networks,  sectors, or combinations of these face the highest risk so that risk  management priorities can be established. It also provides the basis for  understanding potential risk-mitigation benefits that are used to inform  planning and resource decisions. The QHSR risk assessment describes a  wide range of homeland security challenges and is a valuable step toward  using risk information to prioritize and select risk management activities.  While the QHSR makes use of risk information, it provides limited  information to support resource allocation or risk-based strategic  planning, such as a relative risk ranking of the department\u2019s strategic  priorities. Without determining and communicating prioritized risk analysis  outcomes, DHS is missing an opportunity to more efficiently implement  programs, strategies, and policies to mitigate risk and is limited in its  ability to identify the resources required for addressing different levels and  types of risks."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Budget Request and Performance Measures Align with QHSR Mission Goals", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Budget Request Aligns with the QHSR, and DHS is Taking Actions to Account for its Spending by Mission Area", "paragraphs": ["The Department\u2019s annual budget request was generally presented in  alignment with the QHSR mission areas, but DHS has faced challenges  accounting for its spending by mission, which it is taking actions to  address.

The Budget in Brief does, however, highlight select programs and  activities that fall within each of the department\u2019s QHSR mission areas.  For example, the fiscal year 2016 Budget in Brief provided that within  QHSR mission area 1\u2014Preventing Terrorism and Enhancing Security\u2014 the department requested $3.7 billion for TSA screening operations, $101  million for radiological and nuclear detection equipment acquisition, and  $94.5 million for Infrastructure Security Compliance funding to secure  high risk chemical facilities, among other requests. The fiscal year 2016  Budget in Brief provided similar examples within each DHS mission area,  as well as examples of requests for other departmental initiatives.", "In general, DHS receives its funding through the enactment of an annual  appropriations act. Historically, DHS\u2019s annual appropriations have  generally been organized into five titles, within which over 70 individual  appropriation accounts and over 100 programs, projects, and activities  (PPAs) are funded. The PPAs within DHS\u2019s appropriation are generally  not organized by mission-based programs, and according to DHS officials  do not afford transparency or an easy understanding of how federal funds  are being used. To provide increased visibility, comparability, and  information on which to base resource allocation decisions, the report of  the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives  accompanying the Department\u2019s fiscal year 2015 appropriations bill  directed DHS to develop a common appropriation structure (CAS) for  implementation in the fiscal year 2017 budget cycle. According DHS\u2019s  fiscal year 2017 Budget in Brief, the President\u2019s budget for the  Department was submitted under a CAS that will improve DHS\u2019s  planning, programming, budgeting, and execution processes through a  common framework consolidating its over 70 appropriations accounts into  four standard appropriations and will better align programs to the DHS  strategic missions and goals.", "Officials from the Office of the Chief Financial Officer (OCFO) explained  some of the potential benefits they hope to achieve through the CAS. For  example, OCFO officials explained that while under the current system  DHS is able to report broadly\u2014such as on the amount spent on border  security\u2014it cannot report on specific obligations and expenditures within  that category because the funding spans multiple agencies with different  accounting systems. However, the CAS (in conjunction with another  ongoing project called the Accounting Classification Structure), is  intended in part to help DHS better bridge its budget requests with  execution of the QHSR strategy. Specifically, officials said their top level  of accounting will reflect the life cycle of funds, while the second level will  be standardized to newly defined mission programs. Officials said this  change will make it easier to understand and compare what is currently  captured by 100-plus PPAs that do not have a direct link to the QHSR  missions and goals. DHS currently tracks this information to some extent,  but in what they referred to as a shadow system that is not sustainable  over the long term.", "Although DHS expects the CAS to improve accountability of funds and  better align its PPA structure to focus on mission programs, DHS has  reported that migrating over 70 appropriations accounts to four basic  appropriation fund types will entail changes to the department\u2019s PPA  structure and that DHS has already faced challenges upgrading and  integrating the many varied DHS financial systems, as well as maintaining  oversight over the funding.

Yet, this  recommendation was not implemented and the timeliness issue persisted  in the 2014 QHSR, based on what QHSR stakeholders told us. In a  survey we conducted of QHSR stakeholders, we asked whether DHS  provided a clear overview of the timeframes and stakeholder  responsibilities during each of the four phases of development.  Stakeholders varied in their responses from about fourteen percent  reporting that they did not receive a clear overview of the timeframes and  responsibilities in phase 1 to 34 percent in phase 4 of the QHSR process.

Time management is  necessary for program components and entities to keep the overall  program on track and produce a final product. According to SPAR  officials, the time constraints for the 2014 QHSR were related to a  combination of factors such as a communication delay associated with  the government shutdown and the change in DHS leadership in 2013,  delays in the report vetting process, and inadequate planning in the early  stages of the review. For example, the delay in the release of the terms  of reference document led to delays in other areas such as the  establishment of study groups and ultimately delayed the efforts to  conduct outreach to stakeholders.

Elements DHS addressed in those documents  included a description of homeland security threats, discussions of the  status of cooperation among federal agencies and between the federal  government and state, local, and tribal governments, an explanation of  underlying assumptions for the QHSR report, and other matters  considered important. Elements not fully addressed included a prioritized  list of homeland security missions, a description of the budget plan  required to execute the full range of missions, and an assessment of the  alignment of DHS with the QHSR missions.", "DHS officials agreed with our overall assessment, but asserted that the  specifications for some of the elements we found as not fully addressed  were reported through other relevant documents. For example, according  to DHS officials, the specification for identifying a budget plan was met  through the FY2015-2019 Future Years Homeland Security Program  report, published on August 11, 2014. DHS also stated that alignment of  human resources systems was addressed in DHS\u2019s FY2015-2019 Human  Capital Strategic Plan. For the purposes of evaluating whether DHS  addressed the QHSR reporting elements, we limited our review to the  QHSR report and DHS\u2019s Strategic Plan, which references the QHSR  report and further articulates homeland security missions, goals and  strategies. We did not review any additional documents that DHS had  published pertaining to issues identified for inclusion in the QHSR report,  like the budget or human resources-related matters. Therefore, we did not  evaluate whether DHS addressed the reporting requirements through  means outside of these two documents.", "The statute establishing the QHSR provides that each such review \u201cshall  be a comprehensive examination of the homeland security strategy of the  Nation, including recommendations regarding the long-term strategy and  priorities of the Nation for homeland security and guidance on the  programs, assets, capabilities, budget, policies, and authorities of the  Department.\u201d The statute further requires that DHS submit to Congress a  report regarding the QHSR, and identifies specific elements the report is  to include. Our review of the QHSR report and the Strategic Plan  concluded that while DHS had addressed five of the elements mandated  for inclusion, it did not fully address four of the elements. Consequently,  to the extent Congress anticipated the submission of a single  comprehensive QHSR report that fully addressed each of the nine  elements specified in the 9/11 Commission Act, rather than multiple DHS  products that may collectively address each element, the report submitted  to Congress on June 18, 2014, falls short. In addition, DHS issued the  QHSR report after December 31, 2013, the date contemplated in the 9/11  Commission Act for DHS to report on the results of the quadrennial  review conducted in 2013. According to DHS officials, DHS released the  QHSR report after this date because leadership changes, specifically the  appointment of a new Homeland Security Secretary in October 2013,  occurred prior to the completion of the 2014 QHSR and thus extended the  report\u2019s review time frames."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine the extent to which the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) has examined and used risk information to inform the Quadrennial  Homeland Security Review and its implementation, we analyzed DHS  documentation on its risk analysis process and results for the Homeland  Security Strategic Environment Assessment (HSSEA)\u2014the risk analysis  conducted for the QHSR. We reviewed DHS\u2019s Current and Future  Strategic environment reports, the Systems Mapping Initiative report, the  Homeland Security National Risk Characterization (HSNRC), and  classified HSSEA results. We also reviewed the 2012 and 2013  Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community,  prepared by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI),  which DHS reported relying on when assessing threat information for the  HSSEA. In addition to the HSSEA reports themselves, we analyzed all  available supporting documentation provided by DHS on the development  of these reports, including briefings, videos, meeting summaries, and  descriptions of HSSEA processes and results. We evaluated the  sufficiency of this documentation and the overall completeness of the  HSSEA risk assessment using the standards set forth in the 2013  National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) and its Supplemental Tool  on Executing a Critical Infrastructure Risk Management Approach. The  NIPP states that in order to be complete, a risk assessment must  consider threat, vulnerabilities, and consequences; must be sufficiently  documented; must be reproducible; and must be defensible. In order to  be sufficiently documented, the methodology and the assessment must  clearly document what information is used and how it is synthesized to  generate a risk estimate. Any assumptions, weighting factors, and  subjective judgments need to be transparent to the user of the  methodology, its audience, and others who are expected to use the  results. The types of decisions that the risk assessment is designed to  support and the timeframe of the assessment (e.g., current conditions  versus future operations) should be given. We also looked to a 2010  review by the National Academies of Science on DHS\u2019s Risk  Management Approach, as well as our previous work evaluating DHS\u2019s  approach to risk assessment, in order to ensure that we used a consistent  approach to evaluating DHS\u2019s assessment efforts. To supplement and  clarify DHS\u2019s written documentation on the HSSEA, we interviewed  current and former DHS officials from the Office of Strategy, Plans,  Analysis, and Risk (SPAR) who were responsible for developing the  QHSR risk analyses. We asked officials to discuss the HSSEA process  and how results were translated into the QHSR, including the extent to  which uncertainty in the risk estimates was incorporated into the final  results and communicated to users of the results\u2014a NIPP aspect of a  defensible risk assessment. Further, we evaluated DHS\u2019s use of risk  information in the QHSR to risk management guidance in the NIPP and  DHS\u2019s Risk Management Fundamentals, as well as our prior work on key  characteristics for risk assessment and management. Last, we met with  the authors of a December 2015 paper published in Homeland Security  Affairs on a comparative ranking of homeland security hazards in order to  discuss current challenges and developments in the field of homeland  security risk analysis.", "To determine the extent to which DHS has aligned its budget and  performance measures with the mission goals in the QHSR, we analyzed  DHS documents related to the 2014 QHSR and the fiscal years 2014- 2018 Strategic Plan, including: DHS Budget in Brief documents from 2015  through 2017 to determine DHS\u2019s budget priorities since issuance of the  first QHSR; fiscal years 2012 through 2015 Future Years Homeland  Security Program (FYHSP) reports; excerpts from DHS\u2019s fiscal years  2017-2021 and 2018-2022 resource planning guidance to determine the  extent to which budget guidance reflects the DHS missions and goals;  and DHS reports on its progress implementing a new common  appropriations structure. Further, we reviewed Congressional Research  Services reports on DHS\u2019s appropriations from fiscal year 2015 and 2016.  We also interviewed DHS officials from the Office of the Chief Financial  Officer, Office of Strategy, Plans, Analysis, and Risk (SPAR), and from  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Coast Guard (USCG),  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement (ICE), National Protection and Programs  Directorate (NPPD), and Transportation Security Administration (TSA).  We selected these components based on their share of the overall DHS  fiscal year 2015 budget, breadth of homeland security responsibilities,  and other factors. Views from these components are not generalizable to  all DHS components. We interviewed component officials to determine  the extent to which they used DHS guidance in developing their annual  budget requests and the extent to which such guidance reflects the  QHSR missions and goals. With respect to performance measures we  reviewed DHS\u2019s Annual Performance Plans from fiscal years 2013-2015  and 2014-2016, reviewed our prior work on key attributes of successful  performance measures, reviewed the GPRA Modernization Act of 2010  (GPRAMA), and interviewed DHS officials from SPAR and the office of  Program Analysis and Evaluation (PA&E) and from CBP, USCG, FEMA,  ICE, NPPD, and TSA components in order to determine the extent to  which DHS developed performance measures that aligned with mission  goals. We compared DHS\u2019s process for monitoring and measuring  performance to internal control standards and our prior work on best  practices for implementation of strategies and initiatives.", "To determine the extent to which DHS consulted with stakeholders in  developing the QHSR, we distributed a web-based survey to 222 QHSR  stakeholders identified by DHS based on 2014 QHSR participation. The  stakeholders included representatives from 9 federal departments and  agencies; 12 DHS components, directorates and offices; about 20 state,  local, tribal, private and academic organizations. The stakeholders DHS  identified did not include those who participated solely online and, as a  result, we did not include these individuals within the scope of our review.  We conducted 5 pretests with respondents from DHS, other federal  agencies, and related think tanks to verify that (1) the questions were  clear and unambiguous, (2) terminology was used correctly, (3) the  questionnaire did not place an undue burden on respondents, (4) the  information could feasibly be obtained, and (5) the survey was  comprehensive and unbiased. We made changes to the content and  format of the questionnaire after the pretests based on the feedback we  received. Before we administered the survey, we revised the  questionnaire to reflect comments from an independent reviewer within  GAO.", "We identified 40 respondents that either had an undeliverable email  address, were no longer employed with the federal government and/or did  not participate in the 2014 QHSR. We removed these stakeholders from  our final distribution list, resulting in about 180 possible respondents out  of the original 222 that were identified by DHS. Questionnaires were  completed by 93 individual stakeholders overall, resulting in a response  rate of fifty-one percent.", "Since the survey is not based on a sample, it does not have sampling  errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may  introduce errors, commonly referred to as non-sampling errors. For  example, difficulties in interpreting a particular question, sources of  information available to respondents, or entering data into a database or  analyzing them can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results.  We took steps in developing the questionnaire, collecting the data, and  analyzing them to minimize such non-sampling error. For example, social  science survey specialists designed the questionnaire in collaboration  with GAO staff with subject matter expertise. Then, we pre tested the  draft questionnaire to ensure that the questions were relevant, clearly  stated, and easy to understand. When we analyzed the data, an  independent analyst checked all computer programs. Since this was a  web-based survey, respondents entered their answers directly into the  electronic questionnaire, eliminating the need to key data into a database  and thereby minimizing error.", "We also asked open-ended questions regarding the QHSR stakeholder  consultation process, including ways in which DHS elicited stakeholder  input, how revisions to timeframes may have impacted stakeholder  responsibilities, any challenges in collaborating with DHS and  suggestions for improving future QHSRs. Of the 93 individual  stakeholders that responded to our survey, 74 respondents provided  narrative comments. We analyzed these comments to determine common  benefits and challenges they identified regarding DHS consultations  during the QHSR. The comments received from these respondents are  not generalizable to the entire group of stakeholders, but the feedback  provided insights into stakeholder perspectives on how QHSR  stakeholder consultations were conducted and how they could be  improved. We compared DHS\u2019s stakeholder outreach efforts to project  management standards.", "To assess the extent to which the 2014 QHSR and fiscal years 2014- 2018 Strategic Plan reports addressed reporting elements listed in the  9/11 Commission Act, we determined the extent to which each element  was addressed in the reports. To accomplish this determination, three  GAO analysts independently compared the QHSR and strategic plan to  each of the nine reporting elements to determine whether each element  was addressed, not fully addressed, or not addressed. In cases when the  analysts disagreed, they reviewed and discussed their independent  assessments to reach concurrence. We considered an element  addressed if all portions of it were included in either the QHSR or  strategic plan, not fully addressed if one or more but not all portions of the  element were included, and not addressed if neither the QHSR nor the  strategic plan addressed any part of the element. In addition, we  interviewed DHS officials involved in the quadrennial review to determine  DHS\u2019s position on how the 9/11 Commission Act reporting requirements  were implemented.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2015 to April 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
