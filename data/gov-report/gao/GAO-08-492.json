In response, the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 mandated the creation of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE), which is described as an approach for the sharing of terrorism-related information. A presidentially appointed Program Manager oversees ISE development with assistance from the Information Sharing Council (ISC), a forum for 16 information sharing officials from federal agencies and departments. GAO was asked to report on (1) what actions have been taken to guide the design and implementation of the ISE and (2) what efforts have been made to report on progress in implementing the ISE. To perform this work, GAO reviewed related laws, directives, guidance, and ISE planning and reporting documents and interviewed officials from the Program Manager's office and key agencies who serve on the ISC."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["To guide ISE design and implementation, the Program Manager has issued an implementation plan, completed a number of tasks therein, and included other information sharing initiatives in the ISE, but the plan does not include some important elements to implement the ISE. The plan provides an initial structure and approach for ISE design and implementation. For example, the plan includes steps toward protecting information privacy and describes a two-phased approach for implementing the ISE by June 2009 consisting of 89 action items. Completed activities include, among others, development of proposed common terrorism information sharing standards. In addition, other federal, state, and local initiatives to enhance information sharing across the government are being incorporated in the ISE. These initiatives include partnering with state and local area fusion centers--created primarily to improve information sharing within a state or local area--to develop a national network of these centers. Nevertheless, Office of the Program Manager officials said that the 89 action items do not address all the activities that must be completed to implement the ISE. Work remains, including defining and communicating the ISE's scope, such as determining all terrorism-related information that should be part of the ISE, and communicating that information to stakeholders involved in the development of the ISE. In addition, the desired results to be achieved by the ISE, that is, how information sharing is to be improved, the specific milestones, and the individual projects--or initiatives--to achieve these results have not yet been determined. Defining the scope of a program, desired results, milestones, and projects are essential in providing a road map to effectively implement a program. Without such a road map, the Program Manager and stakeholders risk not being able to effectively manage implementation of the ISE. To report on progress in implementing the ISE, the Program Manager issued an annual report in September 2007, which highlighted individual accomplishments and included several annual performance goals, and has since begun to develop performance measures, but neither effort provides for an assessment of overall progress in ISE implementation and of how much work remains. Some individual accomplishments contributing to the ISE occurred under the implementation plan; others, prior to and separate from ISE creation efforts. In keeping with federal guidance, GAO's work, and the work of others in strategic planning, performance measurement, and program management, the implementation plan contained six strategic goals and the annual report four performance goals for 2008. Also, the Program Manager has begun to develop some performance measures, but they focus on counting activities accomplished rather than results achieved. For example, the measures include the number of ISE organizations with a procedure in place for suspicious activity reports, but not how the reports are used and what difference they are making in sharing to help prevent terrorist attacks. GAO acknowledges that creating such measures is difficult, particularly since the program is still being designed, but until these measures are refined, future attempts to measure and report on progress will be hampered."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Following the terrorist attacks of 2001, the Congress and the Executive  Branch took numerous actions aimed explicitly at establishing a range of  new security measures to strengthen the nation\u2019s ability to identify, detect,  and deter terrorism-related activities and protect national assets and  infrastructure from attack. One theme common to nearly all these efforts  was the need to share current information on terrorism-related matters  with a variety of critical stakeholders across all levels of government, the  private sector, and foreign countries. Recognizing the need to facilitate  this sharing, the Intelligence Reform Act directed the President to create  the Information Sharing Environment (ISE). As amended by the 9/11  Commission Act, the Intelligence Reform Act defines the ISE as \u201can  approach that facilitates the sharing of terrorism and homeland security  information, which may include any method determined necessary and  appropriate.\u201d In implementing this approach the Program Manager\u2014 appointed by the President and responsible for planning for, overseeing,  and managing this new approach\u2014 envisions an ISE that will be  comprised of policies, procedures, and technologies that link people,  systems, and information among all critical stakeholders.", "In coordinating implementation of the ISE, the Program Manager depends  on other federal departments and agencies. In particular, the Information  Sharing Council (ISC)\u2014comprised of senior representatives from 16  federal departments and agencies, some of who possess and acquire  terrorism-related information\u2014was established in accordance with the  Intelligence Reform Act to assist the President and the Program Manager  with their ISE responsibilities. The ISC is to advise in developing policies,  procedures and guidelines, roles, and standards. In providing such  assistance, the ISC, which is chaired by the Program Manager, is  responsible for activities such as working to ensure coordination among  federal departments and agencies participating in the ISE to establish,  implement, and maintain the ISE. In addition to the ISC member  departments and agencies, the Program Manager must involve and  consider the needs of other stakeholders, to include additional federal  departments and agencies; state, local, and tribal entities; the private  sector; and foreign partners and allies. It is critical that all of these  stakeholders participate in development of the ISE because they both  possess and require terrorism-related information in the performance of  their missions. Coordinating with this large number of stakeholders\u2014each  with its own individual agency\u2019s interests, business processes, and  technical capabilities\u2014adds to the complexity of creating the ISE.", "Our work since 2001 indicates that the federal government has improved  the sharing of terrorism-related information but has struggled in the  process. In January 2005, we designated information sharing for homeland  security a high-risk function because the government had continued to  face formidable challenges in analyzing and disseminating key terrorism- related information in a timely, accurate, and useful manner. We reported,  at the time, that in the absence of comprehensive information-sharing  plans, many aspects of homeland security information sharing remained  ineffective and fragmented. We noted, as well, that information is a crucial  tool in fighting terrorism and that its timely dissemination is absolutely  critical to maintaining the security of our nation.", "In March 2006, our report on information-sharing issues stated that more  than 4 years after September 11, the nation still lacked the  governmentwide policies and processes called for in law to provide a  framework for guiding and integrating a myriad of ongoing efforts to share  terrorism-related information critical to protecting our homeland. In that  report, we recommended that the Director of National Intelligence, among  other things, assess progress in implementing the ISE and identify barriers  to achieving ISE deadlines included in an interim implementation plan.  The Program Manager is in the process of implementing these  recommendations, and this report provides an update on their status. We  also suggested in that report and subsequently in a November 2006 report,  that the ISE effort was among the areas that needed additional  congressional oversight.", "You requested that we provide observations on the ISE and how it is being  implemented. This report answers the following two questions:    What actions have been taken to guide the design and implementation of  the ISE?", "What efforts have been made to report on progress in implementing the  ISE?", "To answer these questions, we identified and reviewed key statutes setting  out requirements for the Information Sharing Environment, including the  Intelligence Reform Act and the 9/11 Commission Act. We further  considered the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, related  guidance issued by OMB, and our prior work on results oriented  government, program management, and federal coordination and  collaboration. We also reviewed literature on program management  principles, such as the Project Management Institute\u2019s The Standard for  Program Management and Carnegie Mellon\u2019s Capability Maturity Model  Integration (CMMI\u00ae). Based on our review of these laws, guidance, and  literature, we identified standard practices in program and project  management for defining, designing, and executing programs. These  practices focus on several critical aspects of program management,  strategic planning, and performance measurement.", "The scope of our review was limited to those ISE activities performed  since the Information Sharing Environment Implementation Plan  (implementation plan) was issued in November 2006 through March 1,  2008. Applying these identified standard practices in program  management, we reviewed key ISE planning and reporting documents\u2014 the November 2006 implementation plan and the September 2007 Annual  Report to The Congress on the Information Sharing Environment  (annual report)\u2014as well as other ISE-related strategic planning and  performance measurement documents and activities. We further  interviewed officials at the Office of the Program Manager for the  Information Sharing Environment (PM-ISE) and examined planning and  reporting documents housed at the office to determine the extent to which  actions listed in the implementation plan for the first phase of ISE  implementation were complete as of March 1, 2008. We also interviewed  officials from five key federal agencies\u2014the departments of Defense,  Homeland Security, Justice, and State as well as the Office of the Director  of National Intelligence\u2014who serve on the ISE\u2019s Information Sharing  Council. These federal agencies were chosen because they were identified  by the PM-ISE as key participants expected to support the ISE since they  collect defense, homeland security, law enforcement, foreign affairs, and  intelligence information deemed critical for homeland security. We  conducted this performance audit from February 2007 through June 2008,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The Act required the President to,  among other things, appoint a Program Manager to plan for, oversee  implementation of, and manage the ISE, and established an ISC to assist  the President and Program Manager in these duties. In addition, the Act  required the President, with the assistance of the Program Manager, to  submit to Congress a report containing an implementation plan for the ISE  no later than 1 year after the date of enactment (enacted December 17,  2004) and specified 11 elements to be included in the plan.

The Act also required annual performance management  reports, beginning not later than 2 years after enactment, on the state of  the ISE and of information sharing across the federal government.", "On December 16, 2005, the President issued a memorandum to implement  measures consistent with establishing and supporting the ISE. The  memorandum sets forth five information sharing guidelines: (a) defining  common standards for how information is acquired, accessed, shared, and  used within the ISE; (b) developing a common framework for sharing  information between and among executive departments and agencies;  state, local, and tribal governments; law enforcement agencies; and the  private sector; (c) standardizing the procedures for sensitive but  unclassified information; (d) facilitating the sharing of information  between executive departments and agencies and foreign governments;  and (e) protecting the information privacy rights and other legal rights of  Americans. The memorandum also directs the heads of executive  departments and agencies to actively work to promote a culture of  information sharing within their respective agencies and that ongoing  information-sharing efforts be leveraged in the development of the ISE.", "In October 2007, the President issued a National Strategy for Information  Sharing.

Pursuant to the Act, the Program Manager, in consultation  with the head of any affected department or agency, has governmentwide  authority over the sharing of terrorism-related information within the  scope of the ISE and is required to plan for, oversee implementation of,  and manage the ISE. For example, the Program Manager, in consultation  with the ISC and consistent with the direction and policies issued by the  President, the Director of National Intelligence, and the Director of the  Office of Management and Budget, is to issue governmentwide  procedures, guidelines, instructions, and functional standards, as  appropriate, for the management, development, and proper operation of  the ISE. In fulfilling this responsibility, the Program Manager must, among  other things, take into account the varying missions and security  requirements of agencies participating in the ISE and ensure the  protection of privacy and civil liberties. The implementation plan further  described areas of responsibility in broad terms for the Program Manager.  The plan states, for example, that the Program Manager is to \u201cact as the  central agent to improve terrorism-related information sharing among ISE  participants by working with them to remove barriers, facilitate change,  and ensure that ISE implementation proceeds efficiently and effectively.\u201d  In interpreting these responsibilities, the Program Manager has exercised  discretion by focusing on, for example, facilitating information sharing  across the five ISE communities. To support the development of the ISE,  as of June 2008 the Program Manager has a staff of about 11 government  staff and 31 contractors organized into three divisions\u2014technology, policy  and planning, and business process.", "Interagency support and advice to the Program Manager on the  development of the ISE is provided through the ISC.

The ISC is an advisory body, which among other things, is  expected to    advise the President and the Program Manager on development of policies,  procedures, guidelines, roles, and standards necessary to establish,  implement, and maintain the ISE;   work to ensure coordination among the federal agencies participating in  the establishment, implementation, and maintenance of the ISE; and identify and recommend solutions to gaps between existing technologies,  programs, and systems used by federal agencies for sharing information  and the parameters of the proposed information-sharing environment.", "The ISC and Program Manager are supported by various task and working  groups. For example, the Foreign Government Information Sharing  Working Group, with coordination and assistance from the PM-ISE, helped  develop a checklist of issues to be taken into account in negotiating  international agreements. Similarly, an Alerts and Notifications Working  Group was established to assist the PM-ISE and ISC members in their  efforts to identify the alerts and notifications to be available to federal and  non-federal ISE participants.", "Another area of roles and responsibilities for the ISE lies with individual  federal agencies (including those that belong to the ISC and those that do  not), state and local governments, and private sector entities. In  accordance with the Intelligence Reform Act, as amended, any federal  department or agency using or possessing intelligence or terrorism-related  information, operating a system in the ISE, or otherwise participating or  expecting to participate in the ISE must fully comply with information- sharing policies, procedures, guidelines, rules and standards established  pursuant to the ISE. The departments and agencies must further ensure  the provision of adequate resources for systems and activities supporting  operation of and participation in the ISE, ensure full department or agency  cooperation in the development of the ISE to implement governmentwide  information sharing, and submit, as requested, any reports on the  implementation of ISE requirements within the department or agency.  State and local governments also play a role in the ISE through, for  example, their law enforcement efforts to prevent crimes. As such, these  governments are coordinated with and participate in implementing the  ISE. Private sector organizations may share terrorism-related information  on a voluntary basis through existing or newly developed ISE mechanisms  as well. For example, the ISE leverages existing national plans such as the  National Infrastructure Protection Plan, which established mechanisms for  public and private sector organizations to share critical infrastructure  information on 17 critical infrastructure sectors, such as banking and  finance, energy, chemical, and transportation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Initial Steps to Define a Structure and Approach to Implement the ISE Have Been Taken, but Work Remains to Define What the ISE Is to Include, to Design How It Will Operate, and to Outline Measurable Steps and Time Frames to Achieve Implementation and Desired Results", "paragraphs": ["To guide the design and implementation of the ISE, the Program Manager  has issued an implementation plan, completed a number of tasks  contained in it, and other independent and ongoing information-sharing  initiatives have been integrated into the ISE, but the plan does not include  some important elements needed to implement the ISE.

We reported in March 2006 that federal agencies use  numerous sensitive but unclassified designations that govern how this  information must be handled, protected, and controlled and that the  confusion caused by these multiple designations creates information- sharing challenges. Therefore, we recommended the issuance of a policy  that consolidates sensitive but unclassified designations where possible  and addresses their consistent application across agencies. Consistent  with our recommendation, in May 2008 the Administration established  controlled unclassified information (CUI) as the single categorical  designation throughout the executive branch and established a  corresponding CUI framework for designating, marking, safeguarding, and  disseminating information designated as CUI.

Fundamentally, the Program Manager and stakeholders are still trying to  fully define the scope and design of the ISE, and a more complete set of  activities needed to achieve it than those that were included in the  implementation plan, including, for example    all of the terrorism-related information that should be a part of the ISE;    what types of terrorism-related information ISE participants have and  where such information resides;   how the information can be put into a \u201cshared space\u201d so that a cross- sector of users can easily access and study information from different  agencies;   how this access can be provided while still protecting sensitive  information and privacy interests;   what information systems and networks will be integrated as part of the  ISE and how; and   methods for motivating agencies to invest in the ISE, be held accountable  for ensuring that all relevant information is made available to ISE  stakeholders, and identifying and implementing the specific projects  needed to ensure the ISE runs effectively.", "Further, the plan notes that the Intelligence Reform Act requires that the  ISE ensure direct and continuous online electronic access to information  and presents several action items intended to identify approaches for  sharing information, including the use of technologies. However, the plan  does not lay out a set of action items with related milestones for  identifying, among other things, needed resources such as all the  information to be made available as part of the ISE, the source of the  information, and what limitations exist in making this counter-terrorism  information available. In accordance with standard practices for program  management, these are all elements critical for conveying the scope of  what the ISE is to include, garnering an understanding among  stakeholders of needs to be met as part of implementing the ISE, and  identifying restrictions in stakeholder abilities to do so.", "We recognize that defining all of these elements is a complex undertaking,  especially because of the numerous ISE stakeholders that need to  coordinate and the many existing and often stovepiped or independent  methods stakeholders use for meeting their information needs that often  were not developed with sharing in mind. Nevertheless, further defining  and communicating key elements of the ISE, such as the scope and  expected results, along with a road map for meeting needs in accordance  with standard practices for program management will help, among other  things, communicate the breadth and limitations of the ISE as a program  and further describe how the ISE is to operate.", "Second, the plan does not communicate the scope, or parameters, of  stakeholder roles and responsibilities in such a way that stakeholders can  understand what they will be held accountable for in implementing and  operating the ISE. For example, the plan identifies the Program Manager\u2019s  role as responsible for information sharing across the government,  overseeing the implementation of and managing the ISE, and working  together with the ISC, but does not articulate aspects of how the Program  Manager has interpreted this role in contrast to that of other stakeholders.  For instance, the officials at the Office of the Program Manager noted:     The Program Manager\u2019s office works on developing or improving existing  business processes that affect information sharing among two or more of  the five ISE communities, but does not focus on processes that are  internal to ISE members unless they directly impact the wider ISE.  Agencies, therefore, are to define ISE related business processes and other  requirements internal to their organizations along with how the  information will be used and drive their own analytical efforts.", "The Program Manager\u2019s role focuses on determining if a policy, business  process, legal or technical issue is preventing the sharing of information  between two or more communities and on helping to resolve these types  of issues rather than issues that impact sharing within a community, such  as homeland security.", "This information on the parameters of the Program Manager\u2019s role and  responsibilities was not transparently communicated in the plan but is  critical for stakeholders, the Congress, and other policy makers to clearly  understand, provide for accountability, and ensure the ISE is effectively  implemented. Without clearly understanding their roles and  responsibilities, stakeholders may not adequately prepare for and provide  each other the information and services needed to prevent terrorist  attacks. According to officials at the Office of the PM-ISE, departments  and agencies, not the Program Manager alone, are responsible for defining  the ISE\u2019s scope and expected end state. Accordingly, in November 2007  they held a first-time off-site with ISC members to focus on ISE priorities,  clarify responsibilities, and emphasize the importance of everyone\u2019s active  participation and leadership. Moreover, the meeting was held to rectify  any misperceptions and reinforce that all ISE stakeholders are to define  the ISE. However, according to officials at the Office of the Program  Manager, problems in department and agency participation make it  difficult for the ISC to function as an advisory body for ISE  implementation. Among other things, officials noted that departments and  agencies do not always provide representatives with the authority to speak  on behalf of the agency and inconsistent attendance by ISC  representatives has been an issue.", "Since issuance of the plan, on October 31, 2007, the National Strategy for  Information Sharing was issued, in part, further communicating the  scope of the ISE and stakeholder roles. The strategy reaffirmed that  stakeholders at all levels of government, the private sector, and foreign  allies play a role in the ISE. The strategy also outlined some  responsibilities for ISE stakeholders at the state, local, and tribal  government levels. In addition, the strategy further defined the role of the  Program Manager as also assisting in the development of ISE standards  and practices. However, the strategy did not further clarify the parameters  of the Program Manager\u2019s role and what is within the scope of his  responsibilities in \u201cmanaging\u201d the ISE and improving information sharing  versus other ISE stakeholders.", "Third, the Program Manager and stakeholders are still in the process of  defining the programmatic results to be achieved by the ISE as well as the  associated milestones and projects needed, as standard practices in  program management suggest for effective program planning and  performance measurement. Existing federal guidance as well as our work  and the work of others indicates that programs should have overarching  strategic goals that state the program\u2019s aim or purpose, that define how it  will be carried out over a period of time, are outcome oriented, and that  are expressed so that progress in achieving the goals can be tracked and  measured. Moreover, these longer-term strategic goals should be  supported by interim performance goals (e.g., annual performance goals)  that are also measurable, define the results to be achieved within specified  time frames, and provide for a way to track annual and overall progress  (e.g., through measures and metrics). The implementation plan, as an early  step in planning for the ISE, identifies six strategic ISE goals to be  achieved. These goals include, for instance, to the maximum extent  possible, the ISE is to function in a decentralized, distributed, and  coordinated manner. However, the plan does not define what this goal  means, set up interim or annual goals and associated time sensitive  milestones to be built upon to achieve the overall goal, or define how  agencies will measure and ensure progress in meeting this goal in the  interim or overall. Instead, the plan notes that performance measures will  be developed at a later date. Moreover, the plan does not present the  projects and the sequence in which they need to be implemented to  achieve this strategic goal in the near term or in the future, or the specific  resources needed and stakeholder responsibilities. Therefore, work  remains in developing the road map for achieving this strategic goal. Since  the plan\u2019s issuance, officials in the office of the Program Manager and  stakeholders have developed several performance measures and, as of  March 2008, were in the process of further refining them. Yet, our review  of a draft of these performance measures showed that they continue to  focus on counting activities accomplished rather than results achieved and  do not yet outline the sequence of projects needed to implement the ISE  and measurably report on progress in doing so.", "Further, the plan identifies seven priority areas to be addressed in  implementing the ISE. These include, for example, sharing with partners  outside the federal government, promoting a culture of information  sharing, and establishing ISE operational capabilities. But like the strategic  goals, the priority areas represent general tasks and themes to be  addressed as part of the ISE and do not define expected results in a  measurable form, along with supporting performance goals, measures, and  deadlines for achieving the programmatic results. Without these elements,  ISE stakeholders may not understand the interim or final ISE they are to  achieve, assess progress towards implementing the ISE, or hold  stakeholders accountable for their contributions in ensuring that the ISE  succeeds.", "Fourth, although required by the Intelligence Reform Act, the  implementation plan did not provide a budget estimate that identified the  incremental costs associated with designing, testing, integrating,  deploying, and operating the ISE but indicated that steps to develop a  budget estimate would be taken in the future. In part, this is because the  ISE was in such an early stage of development that it would be difficult for  agencies to know what to cost out for an estimate. Developing a budget  estimate, however, is a commonly used tool for effective program  management. While the Program Manager has been working with agencies  and the Office of Management and Budget to determine the cost of  implementing the ISE, officials at the Office of the Program Manager  stated that the total cost of the ISE has not yet been accounted for and  that attaining an overall estimate may not be achievable. This is because it  is difficult for agencies to isolate and separate out what actions they are  undertaking solely to implement the ISE versus ongoing operations. We  recognize that attaining an accurate and reliable cost estimate for the ISE  is a difficult undertaking, complicated further by the fact that stakeholders  are still defining the scope of the ISE, results to be attained, and the  projects to support it. However, without information on how much the ISE  will cost, Congress and stakeholders will be unable to determine whether  the expenses associated with the ISE are worth the results attained and in  some cases unable to determine what has been accomplished given the  expended resources. Toward addressing this cost issue, the PM-ISE, in  collaboration with OMB, has since issued program guidance intended to  assist in estimating and tracking ISE costs in ISE priority areas, such as  suspicious activity reporting, developing ISE shared space, and alerts,  warnings, and notifications.", "Finally, while the implementation plan states that Phase 1 will conclude  with the development of a detailed plan for implementation, including  goals, measures, and targets, a revised plan will not be issued. Instead,  officials at the Office of the Program Manager indicated that they consider  the implementation plan to be a living document with initiatives identified  at the outset of development being refined as needed based on experience.  Officials at the Office of the Program Manager acknowledged that the 89  action items contained in the plan do not address all of the activities that  must be completed to implement the ISE. This is because at the time the  plan was produced, agreement on how the ISE is to function and what it is  to include had not been reached among the stakeholders. Work toward  reaching these agreements remains ongoing. Therefore, program officials  stated that an assessment of the ISE\u2019s progress based on the action items  identified in the plan alone would not give a true sense of progress toward  a fully functioning and executed ISE. Accordingly, the PM-ISE intends to  adjust the plan, beginning with refinements in the next annual report. For  example, according to officials at the Office of the Program Manager, to  avoid delaying progress, the office plans to revise and update certain  implementation plan actions in the course of developing the June 2008  Annual Report. In addition, officials at the Office of the Program Manager  stated that based on their experience in Phase 1, they are deleting action  items that are no longer valid and updating others to reflect the ISE\u2019s  current approach for implementation.", "Making midcourse corrections to further determine and articulate the end  design of the ISE, or at least more accurately specify what is to be  achieved in the near term and at various milestones thereafter, is in  accordance with standard practices in program and project management.  However, given the ISE\u2019s many stakeholders and the work that remains to  be done in defining the scope of the ISE, the desired results to be  achieved, and the supporting projects and milestones, it is important that  the revisions, in accordance with standard practices for program  management, provide for an effective road map to implement the ISE and  measure achieved progress in implementing the ISE and in improving  information sharing. Without such a road map, the Program Manager and  stakeholders risk not being able to effectively manage and implement the  ISE."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An ISE Enterprise Architecture Framework Has Been Developed, but Its Usefulness May Be Limited without Further Defining ISE Results", "paragraphs": ["Subsequent to the implementation plan, in August 2007, the Program  Manager issued the ISE Enterprise Architecture Framework Version 1.0  (ISE EAF), a planning document and tool intended to further inform ISE  implementation efforts, but its usefulness in guiding the ISE to meet  terrorism-related information-sharing needs may be hindered by the lack  of defined programmatic results to be achieved. As reported by the  Program Manager, the ISE EAF is to help improve information-sharing  practices, reduce barriers to sharing, and institutionalize sharing by  providing a new construct, or framework, for planning, installing, and  operating nationwide information resources within the ISE. Such  resources may include, for example, business processes and information  technologies. Further, as noted in the EAF, it is to be used to guide the  implementation of the ISE, accounting for current capabilities and setting  the direction and steps towards the envisioned or To-Be capabilities.  Because the ISE is composed of many organizations, the ISE EAF can be  looked at as a collection of independent stakeholder enterprise  architectures that were initially designed to support individual missions,  but are now being leveraged to facilitate terrorism-related information  sharing among these organizations. In doing so, the ISE EAF is to assist in  identifying the relationships needed to facilitate terrorism information  sharing among these organizations and is to serve as a tool for  understanding what, where, and for what purpose current capabilities and  resources, such as information technology systems, may exist.", "Enterprise architectures generally use strategic planning elements to align  potential system solutions with program needs. While the ISE EAF is  intended to augment organizations\u2019 enterprise architectures for the  purpose of sharing terrorism-related information, work remains to  determine the ISE\u2019s desired program outcomes or specific results to be  achieved, potentially limiting the effectiveness of the ISE EAF in guiding  the ISE to meet terrorism-related information sharing needs. Unlike  agency enterprise architectures, the ISE EAF does not seek to identify, for  example, business processes and information flows at an operational level,  the level at which organizations determine how specific investments in  technologies will be used to support business needs and provide needed  information. Instead, the ISE EAF relies on the prerogative of individual  departments and agencies to define operational processes and information  flows as part of their enterprise architectures. Officials at the Office of the  Program Manager noted that OMB and the ISC agencies were very specific  about the level of detail the ISE EAF was to take, noting that the ISE EAF  helps inform, but not direct, how departments and agencies do their work  at the operational level\u2014individually or together. However, without  further defining outcomes to be achieved and identifying how individual  agencies are to work together to meet ISE information-sharing needs at  the level where work is done, the ISE EAF may be limited in its usefulness  for improving the sharing of terrorism-related information."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "The Program Manager Has Issued the First Annual Report and Is Developing Initial Performance Measures, but Neither Can Yet Be Used to Determine How Much Progress Has Been Made and What Remains", "paragraphs": ["To describe progress in implementing the ISE to date, the Program  Manager issued an annual report\u2014in response to the Intelligence Reform  Act\u2019s requirement for a yearly performance management report\u2014in  September 2007 that highlighted individual accomplishments and included  annual performance goals and has since developed some performance  measures, but neither effort shows how much measurable progress has  been made toward implementing the ISE and how much remains to be  done.

In accordance with our work and  federal guidance on strategic planning and performance measurement, the  newly developed measures represent an effort to more concretely and  quantitatively assess progress in implementing the ISE and improving  information sharing. The performance measures include, for example, the  number of ISE organizations with a procedure in place for acquiring and  processing reports on suspicious activities potentially related to terrorism,  but not how the reports are used and what difference they are making in  sharing to help prevent terrorist attacks.

While efforts to date may represent the  groundwork needed to facilitate terrorism-related information sharing in  the future, over 3 years after passage of the Intelligence Reform Act, the  ISE is still without a clear definition of the specific results to be achieved  as part of the ISE or the projects, stakeholder contributions, and other  means needed to achieve these results. The Program Manager, together  with the ISE stakeholders, have followed standard practices in program  and project management for defining, designing, and executing programs  by identifying action items and strategic goals to be achieved in the  implementation plan. However, work remains in, among other things,  defining and communicating the scope and desired results to be achieve  by the ISE, specific milestones to achieve the results, and the individual  projects and execution sequence needed to achieve these results and  implement the ISE. Until this work is complete, further efforts may result  in independent contributions to improving information sharing rather than  an ISE with improved and coordinated sharing of terrorism-related  information among stakeholders, a critical need exposed by the terrorist  attacks of September 11. Given that the ISE requires extensive buy-in from  stakeholders and the Program Manager is relying on stakeholders to  provide technology and other resources to make the ISE work, it is critical  to develop a road map for implementing the ISE and improving  information sharing that communicates the scope and specific results to  be achieved by the ISE, the key milestones and individual projects needed  to implement the ISE, needed resources, and stakeholder responsibilities.

We agree that the ISE is a governmentwide transformational  effort, that it is not a traditional \u201cprogram,\u201d and that it involves an  evolutionary process. In fact, our report states that the ISE is not bounded  by a single federal agency or component and that it is a broad-based  coordination and collaboration effort among various stakeholders. While  we agree that the ISE is not a traditional \u201cprogram,\u201d in that it is not  operated and funded by a single department or agency, it is an activity that  does receive government funding and can be reviewed using program and  project management principles. As such, we based our evaluation of the  ISE on a broad set of program and project management criteria, including  the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, related guidance  issued by OMB, and our prior work on results-oriented government,  program management, and federal coordination and collaboration.  Further, while we recognize that approaches to implementing the ISE and  improving information sharing may evolve over time as technologies and  needs change, calling the ISE an evolutionary process does not exempt it  from following the practices outlined in our report. Following these  practices will help ensure that reports of progress by the Program  Manager on behalf of the ISE at large are based on measures of results  achieved toward implementing the ISE\u2014that is measured based on what  the ISE is to be, include, and accomplish in, for example, 3 years\u2014rather  than ad-hoc claims of progress.", "With regard to efforts for assessing the ISE\u2019s progress, the Program  Manager noted that in the 2007 annual report he introduced a performance  management approach and his office has since established a performance  baseline\u2014in the fall of 2007\u2014 and measured agencies\u2019 progress against  this baseline through an assessment performed in the spring of 2008. Our  report acknowledges these efforts. However, our review of the  performance measures developed in support of the performance  management approach shows that these measures: (1) focus on counting  activities accomplished rather than results achieved to show the extent of  ISE implementation and attaining the ISE\u2019s strategic goals and (2) are not  presented in a way that explains how the measures represent milestones  toward attaining the strategic goals identified in the implementation plan  or intended outcomes. In his comments, the Program Manager further  noted that the June 2008 annual report, which was not released by the  time we issued this report, would provide more current data on  performance measurement. However, our review of a draft of the  measures to be incorporated in the 2008 report showed that they continue  to focus on counting activities accomplished rather than results achieved.  Unless the 2008 report corrects these shortfalls and establishes a  performance management mechanism whereby short-term annual goals  serve as steps for assessing the ISE\u2019s progress towards achieving longer- term strategic goals, it and future reports on progress will fail to provide  the Congress and other policy makers the meaningful information needed  to understand what progress has been made in attaining the defined  strategic results for the ISE and improving information sharing.", "Finally, the Program Manager said that although the report mentions that  one of the challenges of the ISE is interagency attention and priority to ISE  initiatives, the report does not make any recommendations in this regard.  We agree that interagency collaboration in the ISE is a challenge and  individual departments and agencies, not the Program Manager alone,  have responsibilities in implementing the ISE. However, to effectively hold  these agencies accountable for ISE progress, existing issues identified in  our report\u2014such as defining the outcomes to be achieved and defining  clear roles and responsibilities\u2014must first be addressed. Given the ISE\u2019s  many stakeholders and recognizing the Program Manager\u2019s key leadership  role for managing the ISE, we maintain that these issues must be  addressed by the Program Manager, with full participation of relevant  stakeholders (e.g., agencies and departments on the ISC).
