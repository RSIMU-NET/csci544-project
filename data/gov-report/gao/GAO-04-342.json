These successes have heightened interest in UAVs within the Department of Defense (DOD) and the services. GAO was asked to (1) determine how much funding DOD requested, was appropriated, and was obligated for major UAV development efforts during fiscal years 1999-2003 and (2) assess whether DOD's approach to planning for UAVs provides reasonable assurance that its investment in UAVs will facilitate their integration into the force structure."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During the past 5 fiscal years, Congress provided more funding for UAV development and procurement than requested by DOD, and to date the services have obligated most of these funds. To promote rapid employment of UAVs, Congress has provided nearly $2.7 billion for UAV development and procurement compared with the $2.3 billion requested by DOD. Because Congress has appropriated more funds than requested, the services are able to acquire systems at a greater rate than planned. For example, in fiscal year 2003, the Air Force requested $23 million to buy 7 Predator UAVs, but Congress provided over $131 million--enough to buy 29 Predators. DOD's approach to planning for developing and fielding UAVs does not provide reasonable assurance that its investment in UAVs will facilitate their integration into the force structure efficiently, although DOD has taken positive steps to improve the UAV program's management. In 2001 DOD established a joint Planning Task Force in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. To communicate its vision and promote commonality of UAV systems, in 2002, the Task Force published the UAV Roadmap, which describes current programs, identifies potential missions, and provides guidance on emerging technologies. While the Roadmap identifies guidance and priority goals for UAV development, neither it nor other key documents represent a comprehensive strategic plan to ensure that the services and DOD agencies develop systems that complement each other, perform all required missions, and avoid duplication. Moreover, the Task Force serves in an advisory capacity to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, but has little authority to enforce program direction. Service officials indicated that their service-specific planning documents were developed to meet their own needs and operational concepts without considering those of other services. Without a strategic plan and an oversight body with sufficient authority to enforce program direction, DOD risks fielding a poorly integrated UAV force structure, which could increase costs and the risk of future interoperability problems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The current generation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been  under development for defense applications since the 1980s.

These and similar  successes have heightened interest in UAVs within the Department of  Defense (DOD) and the services. In fact, by 2010, DOD plans to have at  least 14 different UAVs in the force structure to perform a variety of  missions.", "Given the evolution of UAVs to an operational status, you asked us to  review DOD\u2019s overall planning effort to establish, maintain, and operate  UAVs. As agreed with your office, we (1) analyzed the extent to which  DOD requested, was appropriated and was obligated funds for major UAV  development efforts during fiscal years 1999-2003 and (2) assessed  whether DOD\u2019s approach to planning for UAVs provides reasonable  assurance that its investment in UAVs will facilitate their integration into  the force structure.", "To address these objectives, we obtained and analyzed DOD  documentation from fiscal year 1999 to fiscal year 2003 for UAV-related  procurement and research, development, test, and evaluation funding. We  obtained and examined key departmentwide strategic documents\u2014 including the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s 2002 UAV Roadmap\u2014to  identify the level of DOD\u2019s strategic planning for UAVs across the  department.

Generally, UAVs consist of the aerial vehicle, a flight control station,  information and retrieval or processing stations, and sometimes wheeled  land vehicles that carry launch and recovery platforms."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Evolution of UAV Development and Use", "paragraphs": ["UAVs have been used in a variety of forms and for a variety of missions for  many years. After the Soviet Union shot down a U-2 spy plane in 1960,  certain UAVs were developed to monitor Soviet and Chinese nuclear  testing. Israel used UAVs to locate Syrian radars and was able to destroy  the Syrian air defense system in Lebanon in 1982. The United States has  used UAVs in the Persian Gulf War, Bosnia, Operation Enduring Freedom,  and Operation Iraqi Freedom for intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance missions and to attack a vehicle carrying suspected  terrorists in Yemen in 2002. The United States is also considering using  UAVs to assist with border security for homeland security or homeland  defense.", "Battlefield commanders\u2019 need for real time intelligence has been a key  reason for the renewed interest in UAVs. According to the Congressional  Research Service, UAVs are relatively lightweight and often difficult to  detect. Additional advantages include longer operational presence, greater  operations and/or procurement cost-effectiveness, and no risk of loss of  life of U.S. service members.", "DOD operates three UAV types\u2014small, tactical, and medium altitude  endurance\u2014in its force structure. The Air Force has operated the MQ-1  Predator since 1996 in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance  missions, using a variety of sensors and satellite data links to relay  information, and in an offensive combat role using Hellfire missiles. The  Air Force also operates a small UAV called Desert Hawk, a 5-pound aerial  surveillance system used by security personnel to improve situational  awareness for force protection. The Army, Navy, and Marine Corps have at  various times operated the RQ-2 Pioneer since 1986.   Only operated by the  Marine Corps today, the Pioneer provides targeting, intelligence, and  surveillance. The Marine Corps also operates a small UAV called Dragon  Eye for over-the-hill reconnaissance.  This small, 4.5-pound UAV is  currently in full-rate production.  Originally envisioned to be a joint  Army/Navy/Marine Corps program, the RQ-5 Hunter was cancelled in 1996  after low-rate initial production.  The Army currently operates the residual  Hunters for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. The Army also  has selected the RQ-7 Shadow to provide intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance at the brigade level, and full-rate production was approved  in 2002. Another system, the Raven, a small, 4-pound UAV is being  purchased commercially off the shelf by both the Army for regular unit  support and the Air Force for special operations.  Numerous other UAVs  of various sizes remain in development. These include the RQ-4 Global  Hawk, a nearly 27,000-pound, jet-powered UAV with a wing span of over  116 feet used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance over an  area of up to 40,000 square nautical miles per day; the RQ-8 Fire Scout, a  vertical takeoff and landing UAV weighing nearly 2,700 pounds; and the  Neptune, weighing under 100 pounds with a wingspan of 7 feet and  optimized for sea-based operations.", "In addition, congressional action in recent years has been directed toward  promoting an increase in the number and type of missions on which UAVs  can be used. For example, section 220 of the Department of Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 specifies that it shall be a goal of  the armed forces that one-third of the aircraft in the operational deep  strike aircraft fleet be unmanned by 2010. Moreover, in section 1034 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2004, Congress  mandated a DOD report of the potential for UAVs to be used for a variety  of homeland security and counter drug missions. Finally, the fiscal year  2004 Defense Appropriations Conference Report directs that DOD  prepare a second report by April 2004 detailing UAV requirements that are  common to each of the uniformed services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO Review of UAV Development", "paragraphs": ["Most of our prior work has focused on the development, testing, and  evaluation of unmanned aerial vehicles. As recently as September 2000, we  reported that DOD was deciding to procure certain UAV systems before  adequate testing had been completed. We found that buying systems  before successfully completing their testing had led repeatedly to  defective systems that were later terminated or required costly retrofits or  redesigns to achieve satisfactory performance. Conversely, when DOD  focused UAV acquisition on mature technologies that proved the military  utility of a given vehicle, the department had an informed knowledge base  upon which to base a decision. For example, even though the Predator  UAV was based on the existing Gnat 750 UAV, the department required  Predator\u2019s performance to be validated. As a result, Predator moved  quickly to full-rate production and, at the time of our current review, had  performed a variety of operational missions successfully.", "Through our prior work, we have also periodically raised the question of  the potential for duplication of efforts among the services and the  effectiveness of overarching strategy documents and management  approaches to avoid duplication and other problems. For example, in June  2003 we reported that the Air Force and Navy, which previously were  independently developing unmanned combat aerial vehicles, had agreed to  jointly develop a new system for offensive combat missions that met both  of their needs. However, we also pointed out that while one program is  more efficient than two, the participation of two services would increase  the challenges of sustaining funding and managing requirements. Similarly,  as early as 1988, we raised concerns about a variety of management  challenges related to UAV development. At that time, various  congressional committees had expressed concern about duplication in the  services\u2019 UAV programs and stressed the need to acquire UAVs that could  meet the requirements of more than one service, as the Air Force and Navy  have recently agreed to try. In response to congressional direction, DOD  developed a UAV master plan, which we reviewed at that time. We  identified a number of weaknesses in the 1988 master plan, including that  it (1) did not eliminate duplication, (2) continued to permit the  proliferation of single-service programs, (3) did not adequately consider  cost savings potential from manned and unmanned aircraft trade-offs, and  (4) did not adequately emphasize the importance of common payloads  among different UAV platforms. DOD generally concurred with that report  and noted that it would take until 1990 to reconcile service requirements  for acquiring a common family of UAVs.", "Since our 1988 report, the overall management of defense UAV programs  has gone full circle. In 1989 the DOD Director of Defense Research and  Engineering set up the UAV Joint Project Office as a single DOD  organization with management responsibility for UAV programs. With the  Navy as the Executive Agency, within 4 years the Joint Project Office  came under criticism for a lack of progress. Replacing the office in 1993,  the Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office was created as the primary  management oversight and coordination office for all departmentwide  manned and unmanned reconnaissance. In 1998, however, this office also  came under criticism for its management approach and slow progress in  fielding UAVs. In that same year, this office was dissolved and UAV  program development and acquisition management were given to the  services, while the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,  Communications and Intelligence was assigned to provide oversight for  the Secretary of Defense."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Congressional Funding for UAVs Has Met or Exceeded DOD\u2019s Requests", "paragraphs": ["Overall, Congress has provided funding for UAV development and  procurement that exceeds the amounts requested by DOD during the past  5 fiscal years, and the services to date have obligated about 99 percent of  these funds.

This approach primarily deals with identifying  requirements and linking them to needed UAV payload capabilities,  such as sensors and associated communication links. The approach  then ties these requirements to forecasted trends in developing  technologies as a means to try to develop a realistic assessment of the  state of the technology in the future and the extent to which this  technology will be sufficient to meet identified requirements. At the  same time, however, the Roadmap does not provide a clear description  of a strategy for defining how to develop and integrate UAVs into the  future force structure.

The Roadmap addresses, in part, key elements of  performance measurement, as shown in the following:    Performance Goals\u2014The Roadmap established 49 specific  performance goals to accomplish a variety of tasks. Some of these  goals are aimed at fielding transformational capabilities without  specifying what missions will be supported by the new capabilities.

Funding data were obtained  from various sources. We obtained the funding levels that DOD requested  for UAV programs from the justification books used to support DOD\u2019s  budget requests and the DOD Comptroller\u2019s Congressional Funding  tracking database. We also obtained the funding levels appropriated to  service UAV programs by analyzing the services\u2019 Appropriation Status by  Fiscal Year Program and Subaccounts reports. Additionally, we analyzed  these reports to determine the extent to which these appropriated funds  were obligated within their allowed program years. We did not conduct a  comprehensive audit to reconcile the differences in appropriated and  obligated funds.", "To assess whether DOD\u2019s approach to developing and employing UAVs  ensures that UAVs will be efficiently integrated into the force structure, we  reviewed key departmentwide strategic documents, such as the Defense  Planning Guidance, to identify the level of DOD\u2019s strategic planning for  UAVs and its impact on service planning. We discussed the level of  strategic planning for UAVs with key DOD and service officials from  organizations with key roles in DOD\u2019s g development, such as the Office of  the Secretary of Defense\u2019s Joint UAV Planning Task Force; the Office of  the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control,  Communications and Intelligence; the Joint Requirements Oversight  Council; and U.S. Joint Forces Command. We reviewed each service\u2019s  current UAV roadmap and held discussions with officials from service  activities involved in planning and developing their UAV force structure  roadmaps. We also reviewed in detail the Office of the Secretary of  Defense\u2019s Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Roadmap 2002-2027, and assessed  the extent to which it establishes an overall DOD management framework  for developing and employing UAVs departmentwide. We used the  principles embodied in the Government Performance and Results Act of  1993 as criteria for assessing the UAV Roadmap.", "We performed our work from June 2003 to February 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Fred Harrison, Lawrence E.
