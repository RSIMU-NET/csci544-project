A key reauthorization issue facing the Congress is how these  terminal modification projects will be funded. In 2001, the Congress  allowed FAA to use AIP funds to help pay for some new security projects;  however, this use of AIP funds affected the amount of funding that was  available for some development projects. Specifically, in fiscal year 2002,  FAA used $561 million in AIP grant funds for security projects, or about 17  percent of the $3.3 billion available. The use of AIP grant funds for new  security projects in fiscal year 2002 reduced the funding available for other  airport development projects, such as projects to bring airports up to FAA\u2019s  design standards and reconstruction projects. The use of AIP grant funds  for security also caused FAA to defer three letter-of-intent payments  totaling $28 million to three airports until fiscal year 2003 or later."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "$12 Billion a Year, Mostly from Bonds and Federal Sources", "paragraphs": ["From 1999 through 2001, the 3,364 airports that make up the national  airport system received an average of about $12 billion per year for planned  capital development.

We also reported that large- and medium-hub airports were able to  fund about 80 percent of their development and are able to fund the same  amount today. See figure 6.", "The primary reason why smaller airports can fund more of their planned  capital development today than they could in 1998 is that AIR-21 increased  both the total amount of funding for AIP grants and the proportion of AIP  funding that went to smaller airports. Specifically, AIR-21 increased the  funding for two AIP funds that primarily or exclusively benefit smaller  airports\u2014the state apportionment fund and the small airport fund\u2014and it  created general aviation entitlement grants, which also benefit smaller  airports.  As a result of these changes, smaller airports received almost 63  percent of the $2.4 billion in AIP grant funds that airports received each  year, on average, from 1999 through 2001. Large- and medium-hub airports  can also fund more of their planned development today than they could in  1998 primarily because they are able to issue more bonds and to charge a  higher passenger facility fee."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Options Are Available to Address Difference between Funding and Planned Development", "paragraphs": ["Options are available to increase airport funding or to make better use of  the existing funding. These options, some of which were authorized or  implemented as part of AIR-21, include increasing the AIP grant funding for  smaller airports, increasing passenger facility charges, creating a separate  fund for new security projects, and using innovative financing approaches.", "The various options would benefit different types of airports to varying  degrees. It is also important to note that even though the airlines may be  experiencing financial problems, most large airports have very solid credit  ratings and could, if necessary, issue more debt without facing exorbitant  interest rates.", "To help address the difference between funding and planned development,  AIR-21 provided that up to $150,000 a year in AIP grant funds be made  available to all general aviation airports for up to 3 years for airfield capital  projects, such as runways, taxiways, and airfield construction and  maintenance projects. On February 11, 2003, we reported that since the  program\u2019s inception in fiscal year 2001, general aviation airports have  received about $325 million, which they have used primarily to help build  runways, purchase navigational aids, and maintain pavements and airfield  lighting.  Most of the state aviation officials and general aviation airport  managers we surveyed said the grants were useful in meeting their needs,  and some suggested that the $150,000 grant limit be increased so that  general aviation airports could undertake larger projects. However, a  number of state officials cautioned that an increase in the general aviation  entitlement grant could cause a decrease in the state apportionment fund  that states use to address their aviation priorities.", "Another option would be to increase or eliminate the cap on passenger  facility charges. This option would primarily benefit larger airports,  because passenger facility charges are a function of the volume of  passenger traffic. However, under AIP, large- and medium-hub airports that  collect passenger facility charges must forfeit a certain percentage of their  AIP formula funds. These forfeited funds are subsequently divided between  the small airport fund, which is to receive 87.5 percent, and the  discretionary fund, which is to receive 12.5 percent. Thus, smaller airports  would benefit indirectly from any increase in passenger facility charges. In  our 1999 report on passenger facility charges, we estimated that a small  increase in these charges would have a modest effect on passenger traffic.  At that time, we estimated that each $1 increase would reduce passenger  levels by about 0.5 to 1.8 percent, with a midrange estimate of 0.85 percent.  Since AIR-21 raised the cap on passenger facility charges from $3.00 to  $4.50, the full effect of the increase has not been realized because only 17 of  the 31 large-hub airports (55 percent) and 11 of the 37 medium-hub airports  (30 percent) have increased their rates to $4.50. Additionally, 3 large-hub  airports and 6 medium-hub airports do not charge a passenger facility fee.  The reluctance to raise passenger facility charges is likely the result of  several factors, including the views of airlines, which are opposed to any  increase in passenger facility charges because such an increase would raise  passenger costs and reduce passenger traffic. Nonetheless, if all airports  were to increase passenger facility charges to the current ceiling,  additional revenue could be generated.", "Recently, the head of the Transportation Security Administration suggested  setting up a separate fund for security projects. Such a fund might be  comparable to AIP, which receives revenue from various aviation-related  taxes through the Airport and Airway Trust Fund. Having a separate fund  would be consistent with the recent separation of aviation safety and  security responsibilities.", "FAA has introduced other mechanisms to make better use of existing  funding sources, the most successful of which has been letters of intent, a  tool that has effectively leveraged private sources of funding. As noted,  letters of intent represents a nonbinding commitment from FAA to provide  multiyear funding to an airport beyond the current AIP authorization  period. Thus, the letter allows the airport to proceed with a project without  waiting for a future AIP grant because the airport and investors know that  allowable costs are likely to be reimbursed. A letter of intent may also  enable an airport to receive a more favorable interest rate on bonds that are  sold to refinance a project because the federal government has indicated its  support for the project. FAA has issued 64 letters of intent with a total  commitment of about $3 billion; large- and medium-hub airports account  for the majority of the total.", "Other approaches to making better use of existing funding resources were  authorized under AIR-21. Specifically, the act authorized FAA to continue  its innovative finance demonstration program, which is designed to test the  ability of innovative financing approaches to make more efficient use of  AIP funding. Under this program, FAA enabled airports to leverage  additional funds or lower development costs by (1) permitting flexible local  matching on some projects, (2) purchasing commercial bond insurance, (3)  paying interest costs on debt, and (4) paying principal and interest debt  service on terminal development costs incurred before the enactment of  AIR-21. FAA has provided about $31 million for smaller airports to test  these innovative uses of AIP funding. According to FAA officials, the results  of the program have been mixed. The most popular option for airports has  been flexible matching, which has resulted in several creative loan  arrangements.", "In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, the aviation industry and the national  economy are still struggling to recover their health. Analysts nonetheless  expect the demand for air travel to rebound, and the nation\u2019s aviation  system must be ready to accommodate the projected growth safely and  securely. As the Congress moves forward with reauthorizing FAA, it will  have to decide on several key issues, including how it wants to consider the  airports\u2019 estimate of $15 billion a year for planned capital development over  the next 5 years, how terminal modification projects will be funded, and  what priorities it wants to set, both for development and security.  Sustaining recent funding levels would allow the majority of planned  airport capital development to move forward, but it would not cover all of  the airports\u2019 estimated costs, and it would not address the costly terminal  modifications needed to accommodate explosives detection systems.  Options such as additional AIP grant funds, increases in passenger facility  charges, or the creation of a separate fund for new security projects could  make more funding available for airport improvements. However, the  growing competition for federal budget dollars and concerns about the  impact of higher charges on airline ticket sales may limit the practicality of  these options."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To determine how much planned development would cost over the next 5  years, we obtained planned development data from FAA and ACI.
