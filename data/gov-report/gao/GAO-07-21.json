Although plan sponsors often pay for record-keeping fees, participants bear them in a growing number of plans. The information on fees that 401(k) plan sponsors are required by law to disclose is limited and does not provide for an easy comparison among investment options. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) requires that plan sponsors provide participants with certain disclosure documents, but these documents are not required to contain information on fees borne by individual participants. Additional fee disclosures are required for certain--but not all--plans in which participants direct their investments. These disclosures are provided to participants in a piecemeal fashion and do not provide a simple way for participants to compare plan investment options and their fees. Labor has authority under ERISA to oversee 401(k) plan fees and certain types of business arrangements that could affect fees, but lacks the information it needs to provide effective oversight. Labor collects information on fees from plan sponsors, investigates participants' complaints or referrals from other agencies on questionable 401(k) plan practices, and conducts outreach to educate plan sponsors about their responsibilities. However, the information reported to Labor does not include all fees charged to 401(k) plans and therefore has limited use for effective oversight and for identifying undisclosed business arrangements among service providers.

Participation in 401(k) plans rose from fewer than 8 million participants in  the mid-1980s to about 47 million participants in 2005, and assets in these  plans increased by more than twenty fold during the same period, from  less than $100 billion to more than $2 trillion.

Even a small fee deducted  from a worker\u2019s assets today could represent a large amount of money  years later had it remained in the account to be reinvested. Concerns have  been raised that employers sponsoring the plans and plan participants may  not be aware of all of the fees being charged to them or whether  companies providing services to the plan have undisclosed business  arrangements with other service providers that could negatively affect  participants. In light of the potential effects of fees on plan participants\u2019  retirement savings, the Ranking Member of the House Committee on  Education and the Workforce asked GAO to examine  the types of fees associated with 401(k) plans and who pays these  fees, how information on fees is disclosed to plan participants, and how the Department of Labor (Labor) oversees plan fees and  certain types of business arrangements.", "To identify the fees associated with 401(k) plans and how they are charged  to plan sponsors and plan participants, we interviewed officials from  Labor, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal  Reserve Board (FRB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),  and the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  (OCC); met with service providers and other industry professionals; and  collected information about the range of fees and how they are charged to  plan sponsors and participants. We also reviewed several industry surveys  of 401(k) sponsors. To examine how well fees are disclosed to  participants, we identified the legal and regulatory disclosure  requirements; met with 401(k) plan practitioners; and reviewed sample  disclosure documents. To examine Labor\u2019s role in overseeing plan fees  and any undisclosed business arrangements among service providers, we  reviewed Labor\u2019s and other agencies\u2019 legal and regulatory authority and  Labor\u2019s procedures for assuring that plans are meeting overall legal  requirements, including the reporting of information on the form plan  sponsors are required to submit to Labor, Form 5500.

Private sector pension plans are classified  either as defined benefit or as defined contribution plans. Defined benefit  plans promise to provide, generally, a fixed level of monthly retirement  income that is based on salary, years of service, and age at retirement  regardless of how the plan\u2019s investments perform. In contrast, benefits  from defined contribution plans are based on the contributions to and the  performance of the investments in individual accounts, which may  fluctuate in value. Examples of defined contribution plans include 401(k)  plans, employee stock ownership plans, and profit-sharing plans.", "Over the past two decades, there has been a noticeable shift by employers  away from defined benefit plans to defined contribution plans. The most  dominant and fastest growing defined contribution plans are 401(k) plans,  which allow workers to choose to contribute a portion of their pre-tax  compensation to the plan under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue  Code. The use of 401(k) plans accelerated in the 1980s after the Treasury  issued a ruling clarifying a new section of the tax code that allowed  employers and employees to make pre-tax contributions, up to certain  limits, to employees\u2019 individual accounts.", "According to the most recent data from Labor, most 401(k) plans are  participant-directed, meaning that a participant makes investment  decisions about his or her own retirement plan contributions. About   87 percent of all 401(k) plans\u2014covering 92 percent of all 401(k) plan  participants and 91 percent of all 401(k) plan assets\u2014generally allow  participants to choose how much to invest, within federal limits, and to  select from a menu of diversified investment options selected by the  employer sponsoring the plan, such as an assortment of mutual funds that  include a mix of stocks, bonds, or money market investments.", "Equity funds accounted for nearly half of the 401(k) plan assets at the  close of 2005. Equity funds are investment options that invest primarily in  stocks, such as mutual funds, bank collective funds, life insurance  separate accounts, and certain pooled investment products (see fig. 1).  Other plan assets were invested in company stock; stable value funds,  including guaranteed investment contracts; balanced funds; bond funds;  and money funds.", "As participants accrue earnings on their investments, they also pay a  number of fees, including expenses, commissions, or other charges  associated with operating a 401(k) plan. Over the course of the employee\u2019s  career, fees may significantly decrease retirement savings. For example, a  1-percentage point difference in fees can significantly reduce the amount  of money saved for retirement. Assume an employee of 45 years of age  with 20 years until retirement changes employers and leaves $20,000 in a  401(k) account until retirement. If the average annual net return is   6.5 percent\u2014a 7 percent investment return minus a 0.5 percent charge   for fees\u2014the $20,000 will grow to about $70,500 at retirement. However, if  fees are instead 1.5 percent annually, the average net return is reduced to  5.5 percent, and the $20,000 will grow to only about $58,400. The  additional 1 percent annual charge for fees would reduce the account  balance at retirement by about 17 percent.", "Fees are charged by the various outside companies that the plan  sponsor\u2014often the employer offering the 401(k) plan\u2014hires to provide a  number of services necessary to operate the plan. Services can include  investment management (i.e., selecting and managing the securities  included in a mutual fund); consulting and providing financial advice   (i.e., selecting vendors for investment options or other services); record  keeping (i.e., tracking individual account contributions); custodial or  trustee services for plan assets (i.e., holding the plan assets in a bank); and  telephone or Web-based customer services for participants. As shown in  figures 2 and 3, generally there are two ways to provide services:  \u201cbundled\u201d (the sponsor hires one company that provides the full range of  services directly or through subcontracts) and \u201cunbundled\u201d (the sponsor  uses a combination of service providers).", "Labor\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) oversees  401(k) plans\u2014including the fees associated with running the plans\u2014 because they are considered employee benefit plans under ERISA.  Enacted before 401(k) plans came into wide use, ERISA establishes the  responsibilities of employee benefit plan decision makers and the  requirements for disclosing and reporting plan fees. Typically, the plan  sponsor is a fiduciary. A plan fiduciary includes a person who has  discretionary control or authority over the management or administration  of the plan, including the plan\u2019s assets. ERISA requires that plan sponsors  responsible for managing employee benefit plans carry out their  responsibilities prudently and do so solely in the interest of the plan\u2019s  participants and beneficiaries.", "The law also provides Labor with oversight authority of pension plans.  However, the specific investment products commonly contained in  pension plans\u2014such as company stock, mutual funds, collective  investment funds, and group annuity contracts\u2014fall under the authority of  the applicable securities, banking, or insurance regulators.", "The SEC, among other responsibilities, regulates registered  securities including company stock and mutual funds under  securities law.", "The federal agencies charged with oversight of banks\u2014primarily  FRB, OCC, and FDIC\u2014regulate bank investment products, such as  collective investment funds.", "State agencies generally regulate insurance products, such as  variable annuity contracts.

These fees are charged regardless of  whether the mutual fund or other investment product, such as collective  investment funds or group annuity contracts, is part of a 401(k) plan or  purchased by individual investors in the retail market. As such, the fees  are usually different for each investment option available to participants in  a 401(k) plan.", "Investment fees account for the majority of 401(k) plan fees regardless of  plan size.

Institutional mutual  funds resemble funds available in the retail market, but are typically only  available to 401(k) plans with assets above a certain threshold, such as   $1 million. Similarly, indexed funds have lower management fees than  actively managed funds. These funds closely track a market performance  indicator, such as the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500, which largely eliminates  expenditures associated with research, investment selection, and buying  and selling.", "Plan record-keeping fees, which cover individual account maintenance for  plan participants, generally constitute the second-largest portion of plan  fees. Unlike investment fees, plan record-keeping fees apply to the entire  401(k) plan rather than the individual investment options. Plan record- keeping fees are usually charged by the service provider to set up and  maintain the 401(k) plan. These fees cover a variety of activities such as  enrolling plan participants, processing participant fund selections,  preparing and mailing account statements, and other related  administration activities.", "A 2005 industry survey of service providers estimated that plan record- keeping fees constituted 12 percent of total plan fees for plans with   25 participants.

As shown in table 1, a 2005 industry survey  of 401(k) plan sponsors found that plan participants paid investment fees  in almost 62 percent of plans with 5,000 members or fewer. This  arrangement was even more common in plans with over 5,000 members  where participants bear investment fees in about 71 percent of all plans.  For both size plans, plan sponsors and participants shared investment fees  in about 10 percent to 12 percent of plans. Another industry survey of plan  sponsors with 1,000 employees or more also found that plan participants  paid investment fees in the majority of plans in 2005.", "Participants generally pay investment fees indirectly. The investment  returns that participants receive reflect their share of the fund\u2019s assets  after investment fees and other expenses have been subtracted.  Investment fees are reported as a percentage of the fund\u2019s overall assets,  also known as the expense ratio.", "The 2005 survey of plan sponsors also found that participants bear a plan\u2019s  record-keeping fees in about 50 percent of plans with 5,000 participants or  more. Plan sponsors paid record-keeping fees in about 35 percent of these  plans and share fees with participants in about 15 percent. The opposite is  true for plans with fewer than 5,000 participants, where plan sponsors paid  record-keeping fees in 58 percent of cases. However, many of the industry  professionals whom we spoke with said plan participants bear a greater  portion of these fees than they did in the past. According to these  professionals, record-keeping fees have shifted to participants because  companies changed the way they charge record-keeping fees and many  plan sponsors wanted to reduce their share of plan fees. Originally, record- keeping fees were explicit fees billed to the plan sponsor. When the use of  mutual funds in 401(k) plans started to grow, some funds were marketed  to sponsors as having no record-keeping fees. In these cases, record  keepers were compensated out of the investment funds\u2019 operating  expenses for their services, such as maintaining individual account  records for its retail investors and consolidating participant requests to  buy or sell shares. Some sponsors may have been unaware that record- keeping fees were taken out of participant assets. Others were aware that  the fees were passed on to participants.", "Record-keeping fees may be charged as a percentage of assets, or based  on the number of transactions or the number of participants in the plan.  Some industry professionals told us that fees charged as a percentage of  assets may not reflect actual costs to the service provider since the fees  grow regardless of the level of service provided. The professionals said  service providers may charge record-keeping fees to participants as a flat  fee and as an asset-based fee in plans with low assets. An asset-based fee  would not generate enough revenue to cover record-keeping fees in these  plans, so a flat fee is added. As plan assets grow, the revenue generated by  asset-based fees eventually covers plan record-keeping fees, and the flat  fee may be dropped.

For example, to piece together certain fees associated with  a plan\u2019s investment options, a participant often must collect multiple  prospectuses or fund profiles. Furthermore, because ERISA does not  require that these documents be provided automatically to all participants,  some participants may need to request them but may not know to do so.  According to industry professionals, some participants may be able to  make comparisons across investment options by piecing together the fees  that they pay, but doing so requires an awareness of fees that most  participants do not have.

In some  cases, differences in fees across products can be explained by their  investment focus or other features. For example, mutual funds with shares  in international stock generally charge higher fees than mutual funds with  shares in domestic stock because international funds generally incur  additional investment management costs. Higher costs can also arise if an  investment option has additional features. For example, a provider may  charge an additional fee to include certain benefit features, such as  providing the participant with an option to convert a 401(k) account  balance into a retirement annuity.

Officials stated that they conduct few  investigations based solely on the 401(k) fee information provided on  Form 5500 but may review the fees charged to the plan as a part of  investigations into other problems, such as not depositing participants\u2019  contributions into their accounts in a timely manner. In addition, Labor  may audit the Form 5500 to ensure that appropriate fees are disclosed.", "Labor officials told us that it is difficult to discern whether a fee is  reasonable or not on its face, and therefore, investigators rarely initiate an  investigation into a fee\u2019s reasonableness. Plan fees can vary widely based  on the types of services offered, and a \u201cboutique\u201d plan may have high fees  but offer many services that a plan sponsor has determined are in the  interest of the plan\u2019s participants. In the rare instance that a fee appears  egregious, Labor will generally enlist the services of a \u201cfee expert\u201d to make  that determination, because according to one official, Labor is unable to  do so itself. A fee expert will conduct a benchmarking study or request  estimates from other service providers to get a sense of the market rate for  certain services.", "Labor\u2019s most recent in-depth review of fees identified some plans with  high fees but determined that they were not unreasonable or in violation  of ERISA. Labor last undertook a comprehensive review of 401(k) fees in  1997, in response to media, industry, and government concern that  participants were potentially being charged excessive fees. According to a  Labor official, 50 401(k) plans were investigated to analyze plans\u2019  compliance with certain ERISA requirements related to fees, such as  ensuring that fees charged to the plan are reasonable. The plans were  selected based on various factors including anecdotal evidence of high  fees and a listing in an industry journal of plans that had recently  contracted with service providers. Labor found that the plan sponsors had  complied with these ERISA requirements. In some cases, Labor did  determine that participants were paying high fees. It referred these  cases\u2014which included insurance products and international equity  funds\u2014to a fee expert from academia for further analysis to determine if  the fees were unreasonably high. The expert determined that the fees were  high, but not unreasonable. Labor uncovered some violations unrelated to  fees and notified the plans of needed corrective actions.", "In fiscal year 2006, seven of Labor\u2019s regional offices had ongoing  enforcement projects related to fees, but none were exclusive to 401(k)  plans. We spoke with four offices about their specific projects, the reasons  for their initiation, and their findings to date.

For example, plan  sponsors are not required to report mutual fund investment fees to Labor,  even though they receive this information for each of the mutual funds  they offer in the 401(k) plan in the form of a prospectus. In addition to  disclosing this information to sponsors of 401(k) plans, mutual fund  companies are required to file this information with the SEC, which  regulates mutual funds. While prospectuses are provided to SEC on a  fund-by-fund basis, neither SEC nor Labor have readily available  information to be able to link individual fund information to the various  401(k) plans to which the funds may be offered as investment options.  Furthermore, prospectuses provide fees as an expense ratio, which is  deducted from plan assets when investment returns are calculated, and as  such are not explicitly stated. Without information on all of the fees  charged directly or indirectly to 401(k) plans, Labor is limited in its ability  to identify fees that may be questionable.", "Industry experts told us that additional information could be reported on  the Form 5500 to give Labor a more precise idea of the cost of  administering a defined contribution plan and 401(k) plan fees. The ERISA  Advisory Council Working Group reported that the Form 5500, as  currently structured, does not reflect the way that the defined contribution  plan fee structure works, because only those fees that are billed explicitly  and are paid from plan assets are deemed reportable. Many of the fees are  associated with the individual investment options in the 401(k) plan, such  as a mutual fund; they are deducted from investment returns and not  reported to plan sponsors or on the Form 5500. The Advisory Council  concluded that Form 5500s filed by defined contribution plans are of little  use to policy makers, government enforcement personnel, plan sponsors,  and participants in terms of understanding the cost of a plan. The Advisory  Council recommended that Labor modify the Form 5500 and the  accompanying schedules so that all fees incurred either directly or  indirectly by these plans can be reported or estimated.

Problems may  occur when pension consultants or other companies providing services to  a plan also receive compensation from other service providers. Without  disclosing these arrangements, service providers may be steering plan  sponsors toward investment products or services that may not be in the  best interest of participants. In addition, plan sponsors, being unaware, are  often unable to report information about these arrangements to Labor on  Form 5500 Schedule C.", "SEC recently identified certain undisclosed arrangements in the business  practices of pension consultants that the agency referred to as conflicts of  interest. Plan sponsors pay pension consultants to give them advice on  matters such as selecting investment options for the plan and monitoring  their performance and selecting other service providers, such as  custodians, administrators, and broker-dealers. The SEC released a report  in May 2005 that raised questions about whether some pension consultants  are fully disclosing potential conflicts of interest that may affect the  objectivity of the advice. For example, the report revealed that more than  half of the pension consultants examined had compensation arrangements  with brokers who sell mutual funds. The report highlighted concerns that  these arrangements may provide incentives for pension consultants to  recommend certain mutual funds to a 401(k) plan sponsor and create  conflicts of interest that are not adequately disclosed to plan sponsors.  Plan sponsors may not be aware of these arrangements and thus could  select mutual funds recommended by the pension consultant over lower- cost alternatives. As a result, participants may have more limited  investment options and may pay higher fees for these options than they  otherwise would.", "In addition, specific fees that are considered to be \u201chidden\u201d may mask the  existence of a conflict of interest. Hidden fees are usually related to  business arrangements where one service provider to a 401(k) plan pays a  third-party provider for services, such as record keeping, but does not  disclose this compensation to the plan sponsor. For example, a mutual  fund normally provides record-keeping services for its retail investors, i.e.,  those who invest outside of a 401(k) plan. The same mutual fund, when  associated with a plan, might compensate the plan\u2019s record keeper for  performing the services that it would otherwise perform, such as  maintaining individual participants\u2019 account records and consolidating  their requests to buy or sell shares.", "The problem with hidden fees is not how much is being paid to the service  provider, but with knowing what entity is receiving the compensation and  whether or not the compensation fairly represents the value of the service  being rendered. Labor\u2019s position is that plan sponsors must know about  these fees in order to fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities. However, if the  plan sponsors do not know that a third party is receiving these fees, they  cannot monitor them, evaluate the worthiness of the compensation in view  of services rendered, and take action as needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Has New Initiatives to Improve Information on Fees", "paragraphs": ["Labor officials told us about three initiatives currently underway to  improve the disclosure of fee information by plan sponsors to participants  and to avoid conflicts of interest. For one initiative, Labor is considering  the development of a proposed rule regarding the fee information required  to be furnished to participants under its section 404(c) regulation.  According to Labor officials, they are attempting to define the critical  information on fees that plan sponsors should disclose to participants and  the best way to do so. They are deliberating on what fee information  should be provided to participants and in what format to enable  participants to easily compare the fees across the plan\u2019s various  investment options.", "The second initiative proposes changes to the Form 5500 Schedule A and  instructions to improve the disclosure of insurance fees and commissions  and identify insurers who fail to supply information to plan sponsors.  According to a 2004 ERISA Advisory Council Report, many employers  have difficulty obtaining timely Schedule A information from insurers.  Labor proposes to add a checkbox to the form to permit plan sponsors to  identify situations in which the insurance company has failed to provide  Schedule A information. The form would also have space to indicate the  type of information that was not provided. Because plan sponsors must  submit a separate Schedule A for each insurance contract, Labor would be  able to identify which insurance companies are failing to satisfy their  disclosure obligations under ERISA and its regulations.", "The second initiative also proposes changes requiring plan sponsors to  report additional information on fees on Schedule C of Form 5500.  Consistent with recommendations made by the ERISA Advisory Council  Working Groups and GAO, Labor issued a proposed rule on July 21, 2006,  to revise the Schedule C and accompanying instructions to clarify that the  plan sponsor must report any direct and indirect compensation (i.e.,  money or anything else of value) it pays to a service provider during the  plan year. Also, a new section would be added requiring that the source  and nature of compensation in excess of $1,000 received from parties  other than the plan or the plan sponsor, such as record-keepers, be  disclosed for certain key service providers, including, among others,  investment managers, consultants, brokers, and trustees as well as all  other fiduciaries. Labor officials told us that the revision aims to improve  the information plan sponsors receive from service providers. The officials  acknowledge, however, that this requirement may be difficult for plan  sponsors to fulfill without an explicit requirement in ERISA for service  providers to give plan sponsors information on the fees they pay to other  providers.", "The third initiative involves amending Labor\u2019s regulations under section  408(b)(2) of ERISA to define the information plan sponsors need in  deciding whether to select or retain a service provider. According to  Labor, plan sponsors need information to assess the reasonableness of the  fees being paid by the plan for services rendered and to assess potential  conflicts of interest that might affect the objectivity with which the service  provider provides its services to the plan. The proposed change to the  regulation is intended to make clear what plan sponsors need to know  and, accordingly, what service providers need to provide to plan sponsors.", "In addition to these three initiatives, Labor has a model fee disclosure  worksheet available on its Web site. The worksheet was developed to help  plan sponsors analyze and compare fees during their negotiations with  service providers. Labor worked with several industry groups to develop  this worksheet as a result of the problems it identified during its 1997  investigations on 401(k) fees.

Without  such changes, Labor will continue to lack comprehensive information on  all fees being charged directly or indirectly to 401(k) plans. In addition,  some conflicts of interest that affect the fees that participants pay may  continue to go unnoticed because service providers are not required to  inform plan sponsors of the compensation they receive from other service  providers.
