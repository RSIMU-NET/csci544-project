DOE's project management order requires that lessons learned be captured throughout a project to, among other things, benefit future endeavors. NNSA officials said that, because the order does not require a root cause analysis of cost increases, NNSA decides on a case-by-case basis whether to conduct one. Unlike a root cause analysis, the cost drivers NNSA identified provided few details about why the drivers existed, such as DOE's reasons for approving the MOX facility's cost and schedule estimates before the design was complete. Without a root cause analysis, it is uncertain whether NNSA will be able to accurately identify underlying causes of the increases to identify and implement corrective measures and identify lessons learned to apply to other projects.", "After determining that the performance of the contractors for the MOX facility and WSB contributed to cost increases, NNSA took steps to hold the contractors accountable by withholding fees specified under the contracts. In particular, as of November 2013, NNSA withheld $45.1 million or close to one-third of the MOX contractor's fees, including fees tied to meeting the MOX project's cost and schedule estimates. In addition, NNSA withheld $7.7 million or about 40 percent of the WSB contractor's fees tied to various performance measures for the WSB, such as completing construction milestones.", "NNSA's most recent estimates for the Plutonium Disposition program did not fully reflect all the characteristics of reliable cost estimates (e.g., credible) and schedule estimates (e.g., well-constructed) as established by best practices for cost- and schedule-estimating, placing the program at risk of further cost increases. For example: (1) NNSA's draft April 2013 life-cycle cost estimate of $24.2 billion for the overall program was not credible because NNSA did not conduct an independent cost estimate to provide an unbiased test of whether the estimate was reasonable. (2) Because the MOX contractor's September 2012 proposal for increasing the cost of the MOX facility did not include a formal analysis to examine the effects of changing assumptions, it was minimally credible.

According to NNSA and MOX contractor  officials, after the contractor completed designs for critical system  components, such as the gloveboxes used in the facility for handling  plutonium and related infrastructure, equipment suppliers submitted  higher bids than the contractor anticipated.

In  particular, the project lost staff to other nuclear industry projects,  including projects in neighboring states, resulting in a nearly complete  turnover of construction management personnel over a period of  several years and the need to provide training to replacement  personnel. NNSA identified this driver in its budget request for fiscal  year 2012. Specifically, the budget request stated that over 15 percent  of the project\u2019s engineering and technical personnel had left for other  nuclear industry jobs in the previous year with pay increases of at  least 25 percent.

NNSA officials said that they decide  on a case-by-case basis whether to conduct a root cause analysis.

Similarly, a root cause analysis would address  why one of the drivers of the cost increase for the WSB identified by  NNSA was design errors, omissions, and inconsistencies, given that a  review prior to approval of the project\u2019s cost and schedule estimate  found that most of the design was ready for construction.", "The extent to which NNSA and its contractors shared responsibility for  cost drivers, such as the greater-than-anticipated number of safety  systems needed in the MOX facility to meet NRC requirements.  According to NNSA officials, the department hired the MOX contractor  because it considered the contractor to be well-qualified to engineer  and estimate all of the safety systems for the facility, taking into  account NRC requirements. However, the record for DOE\u2019s approval  of the cost and schedule estimate for the facility shows that DOE was  aware of complexities in adapting MOX technology to comply with  NRC requirements.

NNSA did not pay $36.5 million or over half of the  $65.6 million in incentive fees that the MOX contractor could earn  from fiscal year 2008, when construction began, through fiscal year  2013. Of the $29.1 million in incentive fees paid to the contractor,  $21.6 million remains provisional, meaning that NNSA can require  that the fees be paid back as a result of the project not being  completed within cost. The amount not paid represented the  contractor\u2019s entire incentive fees for fiscal years 2011 through 2013.  Specifically, under the terms of the MOX contract, NNSA can withhold  quarterly payments of incentive fees if an increase in the projected  cost to complete the MOX facility exceeds $200 million. NNSA began  withholding incentive fees for the first quarter of fiscal year 2011  when, for the first time, the increase in the projected cost to complete  the facility exceeded this threshold. NNSA memos for subsequent  quarters in fiscal year 2011 noted that the project\u2019s cost and schedule  metrics continued to worsen, reducing the likelihood of resumption of  payments. In a July 2011 letter to the contractor explaining its  rationale for not resuming payments, NNSA stated that it was  sensitive to the potential impacts of the \u201cnuclear renaissance\u201d\u2014the  contractor\u2019s term for the resurgence of U.S. nuclear engineering and  manufacturing capability after being dormant for more than 20 years,  which the contractor stated limited the availability of qualified suppliers  and subcontractors and led to staff turnover and higher-than- anticipated costs to install equipment. However, NNSA stated that  such impacts would not necessarily overcome other evidence  showing that the contractor was not meeting the overarching goal of  the incentive fees, which is that the facility be completed within cost.", "Award fees. NNSA withheld $8.6 million or about a quarter of the  $32.6 million in award fees that the MOX contractor could earn from  fiscal year 2008 through fiscal year 2012. The amount withheld  included about half of the fees the contractor was eligible to earn in  fiscal year 2012. NNSA\u2019s award fee evaluation for fiscal year 2012  cited various factors, such as poor construction planning; less than  optimal coordination of work; and overly conservative specifications  for installation of fire doors, resulting in delays and unnecessary costs.  In contrast, NNSA paid $24.0 million in award fees for performance in  other areas, such as maintaining a high level of worker safety\u2014an  area in which the contractor has consistently performed well,  according to NNSA\u2019s award fee evaluations.", "Milestone fees. NNSA did not withhold any milestone fees and instead  paid milestone fees of $30.8 million for tasks with deadlines ranging  from February 2009 to March 2014. Examples of tasks for which  NNSA paid milestone fees (some of which the MOX contractor  completed early) included completing the roof, installing the first  glovebox, constructing a technical support building, and completing a  start-up plan for the facility. According to the NNSA officials, although  NNSA did not withhold milestone fees, NNSA stopped paying any of  the $30.2 million in remaining milestones fees as part of an  understanding with the contractor to renegotiate the amount of and  conditions for earning milestone fees.", "Fixed fees. According to the contracting officer, NNSA did not  withhold any of the $15.7 million in fixed fees\u2014the total amount of  fixed fees for construction-related work under the MOX contract.

For example, the analysis stated that the  contractor did not require the subcontractor to add crews or take other  steps to correct delays until almost 2 years after the federal project  director began expressing concerns about the delays. In accordance with  this assessment, NNSA withheld $7.7 million or about 40 percent of the  $18.9 million in performance incentive fees that the WSB contractor could  earn from fiscal year 2009, when construction began, through fiscal year  2012, for the portion of fees allocated to construction of the WSB under  the management and operation contract for the Savannah River Site.  Most of the fees withheld were for the contractor\u2019s performance in fiscal  years 2011 and 2012 (see table 2). In particular, NNSA withheld $3.3  million of the $6.9 million in fees the contractor could earn in fiscal year  2011 and $3.9 million of the $4.0 million in fees the contractor could earn  in fiscal year 2012. The fees withheld were tied to various performance  measures, which DOE acquisition regulations require be established prior  to the start of each evaluation period.

Shortly  after NNSA made its fee determination, however, the contractor notified  NNSA that the project was further behind schedule than previously  represented and that cost factors not included in the contractor\u2019s system  for tracking and reporting on cost and schedule performance would result  in a cost overrun. The contracting officer\u2019s letter stated that NNSA would  have reduced the contractor\u2019s fee if it had known the extent of delays and  cost overruns when it made its fee determination, and NNSA required the  contractor to repay $4 million.

Similarly, the contractors\u2019 cost and schedule estimates for the  MOX facility and WSB did not meet all best practices compiled in GAO\u2019s  guides for preparing high-quality, reliable cost and schedule estimates.

In written  comments, reproduced in appendix V, NNSA stated that the agency and  DOE generally agreed with our recommendations. In particular, NNSA  concurred with four of our six recommendations and partially concurred  with the other two. NNSA described actions it planned to take to  implement the recommendations with which it concurred and time frames  for taking these actions. NNSA also provided technical comments, which  we incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "We are pleased that NNSA concurred with our recommendation to  conduct an analysis of the root causes of the cost increases for the MOX  facility and WSB and stated that it is planning to conduct such an  analysis, which was not mentioned during the course of our review.  NNSA also concurred with our recommendation to revise and update the  Plutonium Disposition program\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate and stated that it  would do so after a decision was made on the path forward for the  program. The path forward could involve the use of alternative strategies  to dispose of surplus weapons-grade plutonium.", "NNSA also concurred with our recommendation to ensure that the MOX  contractor revises its proposal for increasing the cost of the MOX facility  to meet all best practices for a high-quality, reliable cost estimate. In its  comment letter, NNSA stated that it is working with the contractor to  ensure that the cost estimating processes and procedures are updated  such that the best practices are met.", "In addition, NNSA concurred with our recommendation to ensure that the  approved cost increase for the WSB is based on a schedule that the  contractor has revised to meet all best practices for a high-quality, reliable  schedule estimate. In its comment letter, NNSA stated that it has revised  the schedule since we reviewed it and that it now reflects all activities  needed to complete construction. We did not review the update to the  WSB contractor\u2019s schedule to confirm that it captured all activities to  complete construction, which is one of the best practices associated with  the characteristics of a high-quality schedule. Moreover, as detailed in  appendix IV, the schedule we reviewed only partially or minimally met 7 of  the other 9 best practices. To fully implement our recommendation, NNSA  would need to ensure that the contractor has revised its schedule to meet  all best practices for a high-quality, reliable schedule estimate. In its  comment letter, NNSA stated that during the next project review, which is  expected to occur by December 31, 2014, NNSA will review the schedule  against best practices.", "NNSA partially concurred with our fifth recommendation that DOE require  a root cause analysis of all projects that experience cost increases or  schedule delays exceeding a certain threshold established by the  department. In its comment letter, NNSA stated that DOE program offices  currently perform tailored root cause analyses as part of the baseline  change proposal process outlined in the department\u2019s project  management order for increasing a project\u2019s cost and schedule  estimates. NNSA stated that, as a result, the department does not believe  that an update to the project management order is required. NNSA further  stated that the department will review the lessons learned from NNSA's  root cause analyses for the MOX and WSB projects to see what best  practices may be of benefit to other projects. However, as we stated in  the report, DOE\u2019s project management order does not include a  requirement for a root cause analysis of projects experiencing significant  cost increases or schedule delays, and NNSA officials said that they  decide on a case-by-case basis whether to conduct a root cause analysis.  Moreover, the order does not define what a root cause analysis is, how or  when a root cause analysis should be conducted, or what is meant by a  tailored analysis. In addition, NNSA\u2019s written comments did not provide  information on the conditions that would trigger a root cause analysis.  Leaving root cause analyses to an informal and undefined process within  DOE program offices could result in such analyses not being conducted,  not being conducted consistently, or not accurately identifying underlying  causes of cost increases in order to identify and implement corrective  measures and apply lessons learned to other DOE projects. We continue  to believe that a root cause analysis should be conducted for all projects  that experience cost increases or schedule delays above a threshold  established by the department. We note that our recommendation is  consistent with a requirement in the Weapon Systems Acquisition Reform  Act of 2009; under the act, the Department of Defense must perform a  root cause analysis of a cost increase that exceeds a certain threshold.", "NNSA partially concurred with our final recommendation that DOE require  life-cycle cost estimates covering the full cost of programs that include  both construction projects and other efforts and activities not related to  construction. In its comment letter, NNSA stated that the department\u2019s  project management order requires a comprehensive life-cycle cost  analysis as part of the alternative selection process and that no further  update to the order is required to address this recommendation. The  intent of our recommendation goes beyond that of preparing a life-cycle  cost estimate at the stage of selecting an alternative for a new capital  asset project. Instead, the recommendation applies to departmental  programs that include capital asset projects to meet the overall program  need. As we stated in the report, NNSA did not follow all key steps for  developing high-quality cost estimates in developing its draft April 2013  life-cycle cost estimate for the Plutonium Disposition program, which  currently includes the MOX facility and WSB capital asset projects, in part  because it did not have a requirement to develop it. NNSA\u2019s response to  our recommendation suggests that the life-cycle cost estimates for the  MOX and WSB projects that were required to be prepared years ago,  when the projects were selected from among other alternatives, are the  only life-cycle cost estimates needed to manage the Plutonium  Disposition program. Furthermore, NNSA\u2019s response contradicts the fact  that it concurred with our recommendation to revise and update the life- cycle cost estimate for the overall Plutonium Disposition program in  accordance with cost estimating best practices. We continue to believe  that our recommendation that the department require life-cycle cost  estimates covering the full cost of programs that include construction  projects should be implemented.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 7 days from the  report date.

To assess cost drivers in further detail, we reviewed the MOX  contractor\u2019s September 2012 proposal for increasing the project\u2019s cost,  which discussed drivers from the contractor\u2019s perspective. We also  reviewed DOE\u2019s December 2012 document approving an increase in the  estimated cost of the WSB and a delay in the start of operations, which  summarized cost drivers and their impact on the project\u2019s cost and  schedule. We visited the Savannah River Site to observe construction  progress for both projects and interviewed NNSA and contractor officials  responsible for managing the projects. We also interviewed officials from  the NNSA Office of Fissile Materials Disposition, the NNSA Office of  Acquisition and Project Management, and the DOE Office of Acquisition  and Project Management. Separately, to understand how, if at all, cost  drivers for the MOX facility were related to Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC) regulation and licensing of the construction and  operation of the facility, we reviewed NRC construction inspection reports  and related documents, and we interviewed NRC officials responsible for  overseeing the facility\u2019s construction. In order to understand the  components of cost growth for the MOX facility, which represented most  of the Plutonium Disposition program\u2019s construction cost increase, we  also analyzed the MOX contractor\u2019s earned value management (EVM)  system that the contractor used to track and report on cost and schedule  performance, including data from the EVM system on cumulative cost and  schedule variance trends from July 2011 through April 2012 and the  contractor\u2019s variance report for April 2012.", "To determine the extent to which NNSA analyzed underlying causes of  the cost increases, we reviewed documents providing context for cost  drivers. The documents we reviewed included NNSA Office of Acquisition  and Project Management project review reports and monthly status  reports; DOE Office of Acquisition and Project Management monthly  status reports; DOE documents related to approval of the previous cost  and schedule estimates for the MOX facility and WSB in April 2007 and  December 2008, respectively; and documents related to specific cost  drivers identified by NNSA, such as the MOX contractor\u2019s October 2006  report on construction markets and DOE reports related to its suspension  of the WSB contractor\u2019s system for tracking and reporting cost and  schedule performance in November 2012. We also interviewed NNSA  officials to determine the extent to which they had conducted or planned  any analyses to identify underlying causes of cost increases for the  Plutonium Disposition program\u2019s construction projects.", "To determine steps NNSA took to hold contractors accountable for their  role in the cost increases for the Plutonium Disposition program\u2019s  construction projects, we reviewed the contracts for the MOX facility and  WSB, fees specified under the contracts, and NNSA\u2019s fee evaluations  and other documentation supporting its fee determinations. We also  interviewed NNSA contracting officers who were responsible for  administering the MOX and WSB contracts regarding the terms of the  contracts, fees specified under the contracts, and actions NNSA took or  planned to take to hold contractors accountable for their role in the cost  increases. We obtained NNSA data on fees it paid to and withheld from  the contractors, and we assessed the reliability of the data by checking  for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness; comparing the data with  other sources of information, such as NNSA\u2019s fee determinations; and  interviewing NNSA contracting officers who had knowledge of the data.  We determined that NNSA\u2019s data on fees were sufficiently reliable for  reporting on the fees paid to and withheld from the contractors.", "To assess the extent to which NNSA\u2019s most recent estimates of the  Plutonium Disposition program\u2019s life-cycle cost and of the cost and  schedule for completing the program\u2019s construction projects met best  practices we have compiled in guides identifying the characteristics of  high-quality, reliable cost and schedule estimates, we tailored our  methodology to the differing stages of NNSA\u2019s development and approval  of each estimate:", "NNSA\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate for the Plutonium Disposition  program.

In  particular, we assessed the process NNSA used to develop the  estimate against the 12 key steps described in the GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide that should result in a high-quality,  reliable cost estimate. To provide information on NNSA\u2019s process,  NNSA officials responsible for developing the estimate filled out a  data collection instrument we developed. The data collection  instrument summarized each of the 12 key steps and provided space  for NNSA officials to describe actions they had taken to meet the  criteria for each step. To review the information provided by NNSA,  we checked NNSA\u2019s April 2013 estimate for obvious errors in  accuracy and completeness and compared it with previous versions of  the life-cycle cost estimate provided by NNSA. In addition, we  interviewed NNSA officials to determine what requirements, if any,  they followed for developing the estimate, their purpose for developing  it, and their plans for presenting it for management approval.

We compared data presented in various tables of the  proposal for consistency and reviewed additional documents,  including the technical baseline providing a detailed description of the  MOX facility.
