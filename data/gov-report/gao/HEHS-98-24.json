Between 1990 and 1996, national surveys estimated that 192 of the more than 5,000 not-for-profit hospitals in the United States converted to for-profit status. In 1996 alone, more than 60 not-for-profit hospitals converted to for-profit status. Not-for-profit hospitals have traditionally provided charitable community services, including uncompensated care for the uninsured and underinsured. In exchange for providing these community benefits, most not-for-profit hospitals have received financial benefits, such as exemption from federal, state, and local taxes and access to tax-exempt bond financing. In general, not-for-profit hospitals are viewed as charitable assets that belong to the community. Consistent with this perception, the proceeds from hospital conversions are generally directed to not-for-profit foundations or other charitable entities. Concerns have been raised about the potential loss of community benefits resulting from conversions as well as charitable entities\u2019 use of conversion proceeds for nonhealth-related activities. Issues have also been raised regarding public disclosure, including the extent of community involvement in the conversion transactions.", "In response to these concerns, you asked that we review the process that some not-for-profit hospitals have used in converting to for-profit status. Specifically, we determined for selected conversions (1) the method used to value assets; (2) the process used to solicit interest and obtain bids; (3) some of the terms negotiated as part of the sales agreement, including provisions for continued charity care; (4) the extent of community involvement in the process; and (5) how the proceeds from some of the sales were used to fulfill charitable missions. We also determined the role state and federal governments play in regulating and monitoring hospital conversions.", "To identify recent conversions, we obtained a list of not-for-profit hospital conversions that occurred after 1990 from three major investor-owned corporations: Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, Quorum Health Group, and Tenet Healthcare Corporation. We selected six states and 14 sites in order to include the following: asset sales and joint venture transactions; states and sites with multiple conversions, conversions involving multiple investor-owned companies, or both; and transactions in which the proceeds were directed to foundations (see table 1). As part of our site visits, we interviewed hospital officials, attorneys who represented the not-for-profit hospitals, not-for-profit hospital board members, foundation presidents and board members, outside consultants hired to advise the not-for-profit hospitals, and attorneys in the state attorneys general offices. We also held discussions with officials of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Department of the Treasury, Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Department of Justice; health care associations; interest groups; and investor-owned companies. In addition, for some of the conversions, we obtained and reviewed documents related to the transaction.", "Further, for some of the conversions, we were not provided documentary evidence to support information we received through discussions with officials involved in or knowledgeable about the transactions. For example, although we requested purchase or partnership agreements, valuation estimates, and support for the amount of proceeds that resulted from the conversion, in most cases, neither the not-for-profit nor the for-profit parties involved in the conversion would provide a copy of their complete contractual agreement or documents to support valuation estimates or proceeds. Officials said that they could not provide documentation because of confidentiality agreements. However, we did obtain other documentation, including selected segments of contractual agreements to support terms negotiated, as well as other forms of documentation on purchase price for most of the transactions we reviewed.", "In our review of the conversion process, we also determined what processes were used to value hospitals\u2019 assets and derive a final selling price. We did not determine whether the hospitals were sold at fair market value. (See app. I for a detailed description of our objectives, scope, and methodology.) Our work was performed between October 1996 and November 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, except where noted above."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A not-for-profit hospital conversion is a transaction that results in the shift of all or a substantial portion of the assets of a not-for-profit hospital to for-profit use. Most hospital conversions have been structured as asset sales; however, recently some hospitals have, for example, entered into joint venture arrangements. In an asset sale, a not-for-profit hospital sells its physical assets, name, and accounts to a for-profit purchaser in exchange for cash, stock, notes, or other property. In a joint venture, a not-for-profit hospital contributes its assets to a for-profit partnership in exchange for cash and an ownership interest in the new venture. For example, in an 80/20 joint venture, the not-for-profit entity receives cash equal to 80 percent of the value of the hospital\u2019s assets and a 20-percent ownership interest in the for-profit venture. Other methods of conversion include lease arrangements and corporate restructurings. Federal and most state laws require that proceeds from the sale of charitable assets continue to be used for charitable purposes. These proceeds are generally directed to a not-for-profit foundation or other charitable entity.", "Market and institutional factors, such as the growth of managed care and the need for capital, are often cited as primary reasons for conversions. To be successful in a managed care environment, not-for-profit hospitals must be in a competitive position. This position can be achieved by building networks that guarantee patient flow and increase bargaining power with managed care plans and physician groups. Access to capital is particularly important in a managed care environment, in which substantial investments may be necessary for information systems, network development, and expanding market share.", "Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, Tenet Healthcare Corporation, and Quorum Health Group are major players in the hospital acquisition market. Columbia/HCA is one of the largest health care services companies in the United States. As of February 1996, Columbia operated 343 hospitals, 135 outpatient surgery centers, 200 home health agencies, and extensive outpatient and ancillary services in 38 states, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. Columbia reported 50 not-for-profit hospital acquisitions, joint ventures, and lease arrangements between 1994 and 1996. Until recently, Tenet, a nationwide provider of health care services, owned and operated 76 general hospitals and related businesses in 13 states. On January 30, 1997, Tenet acquired OrNda HealthCorp, one of the nation\u2019s largest investor-owned hospital management companies, with 49 hospitals in 15 states. Through this transaction, Tenet now owns, leases, or operates 130 hospitals in 22 states. Tenet reported nine not-for-profit hospital acquisitions and one joint venture since 1990. Quorum owns and operates acute-care hospitals and local and regional health care systems in 43 states and the District of Columbia. As of June 1996, Quorum owned 14 acute-care hospitals and had management contracts with 253 hospitals and consulting contracts with another 161 hospitals. Quorum reported 12 not-for-profit hospital acquisitions and leases since 1990."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Standard Methods Were Consistently Used to Value Hospitals\u2019 Assets, but Other Key Elements of the Conversion Process Varied", "paragraphs": ["The hospitals we reviewed followed the same basic process in converting from not-for-profit to for-profit status: They valued the hospital\u2019s assets; sought out a buyer or partner, generally through a competitive process; and negotiated the terms of the final agreement. The methods used to determine the hospitals\u2019 value were commonly used approaches, according to industry experts. A key component considered in estimating the value of the hospitals we reviewed was their most recent earnings. The valuation estimate is a benchmark that hospital officials can use in considering bids from potential buyers or partners. The IRS and others suggest that hospitals solicit competing bids through a request for proposals (RFP) in order to increase the likelihood that fair market value is realized. While few hospitals followed such a formal competitive bidding process, officials at most hospitals said that they received multiple bids and accepted the highest bid offered. Once a bid is accepted, the terms of the purchase or partnership agreement are negotiated and formally agreed to by both parties. Participants in the conversion transactions we reviewed told us that items negotiated included the final purchase price and continued charity care and hospital services.", "During the conversion process, the communities that the not-for-profit hospitals served generally were not informed about or involved in the various phases of the transaction. However, the not-for-profit hospitals\u2019 boards of directors, who viewed themselves as representatives of the community, reported having responsibility for managing the conversion process and having a fiduciary duty to ensure that the conversion was in the best interests of the organization. The for-profit hospital boards of directors, which usually included former not-for-profit board members, generally monitor and oversee compliance with the purchase agreement."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Three Standard Approaches Were Primarily Used to Value Hospitals", "paragraphs": ["The IRS and valuation consultants cite the income, market, and cost approaches as generally accepted methods for valuing hospital assets (see table 2). One or more of these approaches were used to arrive at a minimum dollar value. This estimated value of a hospital is not intended to represent its fair market value. Instead, in many cases, it represents a benchmark for the not-for-profit hospital to use in negotiating a purchase price. The income and market approaches, which were the approaches most commonly used in the transactions we reviewed, multiply a hospital\u2019s adjusted earnings by a variable\u2014or multiple\u2014to calculate the hospital\u2019s value. The multiple depends on the weight given to certain tangible and intangible factors, which can include a hospital\u2019s debt and competitive position. For example, lower multiples reflect hospitals that are considered a greater financial risk. Multiples that ranged from 5 to 10 were applied by investment bankers to value six of the not-for-profit hospitals we reviewed. In recent years, investment bankers have commonly applied a multiple of six to value independent not-for-profit hospitals. Experts and representatives from organizations who are knowledgeable about hospital finance, such as the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC), suggest that not-for-profit multiples be carefully monitored to ensure that the not-for-profit hospitals are valued appropriately.", "Each of the 14 hospitals we reviewed had obtained either an independent valuation (or conducted its own valuation of the hospital) or a fairness opinion, which is a documented analysis and confirmation by a reviewer that the valuation process resulted in a fair estimate from a financial point of view. In obtaining their valuation, 13 hospitals hired outside consultants, whereas 1 relied on in-house expertise. The one hospital that relied on in-house expertise for valuation, Lloyd Noland, hired experts to render a fairness opinion. Five hospitals\u2014Arlington, Goodlark Regional Medical Center, Good Samaritan Health System, Tulane, and St. Francis\u2014obtained both a valuation analysis and a fairness opinion from an outside consultant. For the conversions we reviewed, officials with Columbia/HCA, Quorum, and Tenet told us that they did not retain the same consultants that the not-for-profit hospitals did for valuation purposes. However, a Quorum official reported using Valuation Counselors Group, the consultant retained by the Carolinas Hospital System, for asset allocation purposes related to that hospital following completion of the deal. In addition, all three for-profit companies reported using some of the same consultants for business transactions and services unrelated to the conversions in our review. (Table 3 lists the hospitals that hired consultants by the type of service rendered.)", "Eight hospitals disclosed the valuation estimates they received; however, only four provided documentation to support the information. Mary Black and Retreat reported in their IRS revenue rulings that they received valuation estimates of $56 million and $14 million, respectively. Carolinas\u2019 valuation report provided an estimated range of $55 million to $60 million, and Good Samaritan\u2019s valuation report estimated the hospital\u2019s value at $140 million to $160 million.

The process used to solicit offers varied among the hospitals. According to the IRS, sellers can more accurately determine the fair market value of their hospitals by soliciting competitive bids through an RFP, which opens bidding to the public. Of the 14 hospitals in our review, 4 used an RFP process; 9 said that they considered several not-for-profit and for-profit entities as potential buyers/partners before focusing on one or more from which to solicit a bid(s); and 1, Jacksonville, only considered one buyer, Quorum, which was selected because of its previous experience\u2014an 8-year management contract with Jacksonville Hospital. Of the 14 hospitals, 7 received more than one bid.", "Although most of the hospitals we reviewed received multiple bids, not all reported accepting the highest offer. Some officials told us that the bid amount is only one of several factors considered by the not-for-profit hospitals in selecting a buyer or partner. The Retreat Hospital, for example, accepted a bid from Columbia/HCA that was $3 million lower than the highest bid it received because the higher bidder did not appear to bring any complementary strengths, such as access to third-party payer contracts and economies of scale in operations, to counter Retreat\u2019s weaknesses. Hilton Head accepted a lower bid from Tenet because of the for-profit\u2019s financial stability, access to tertiary care, philosophy regarding patient care and employees, and other health care relationships. Hospital officials told us that, in addition to bids, they also considered such factors as the bidding entity\u2019s managed care network, presence in the community, corporate culture, reputation for providing quality care, and access to capital, which was reported to be a major factor in the not-for-profit hospitals\u2019 decision to accept an offer from a for-profit company."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hospital Officials Agreed on a Negotiated Purchase Price", "paragraphs": ["Officials from many of the hospitals in our review said that their negotiations with purchasers resulted in a mutually agreed upon purchase price. Officials of some of the hospitals we reviewed stated that they negotiated a purchase price for their hospitals that allowed them to pay off their debts and direct money to communities for charitable purposes. According to hospital officials and for-profit purchasers, purchase prices for the hospitals we reviewed ranged from about $16 million to $212 million; most were less than $100 million. (See table 6 for hospitals\u2019 purchase prices.) The Tulane University and Hilton Head joint ventures resulted in the not-for-profit entities\u2019 receiving a percentage of the purchase price in addition to their respective shares of the joint venture. Officials associated with the Arlington joint venture stated that a purchase price was not negotiated because Columbia/HCA contributed three hospitals to the transaction in lieu of cash. Only two of the three purchasers, Quorum and Tenet, provided purchase price information. Purchase prices for the remaining Columbia/HCA transactions were provided by hospital officials. In commenting on a draft of this report, two reviewers raised concerns about conclusions that might be drawn from comparing valuation estimates and purchase prices.

All except two of the hospitals (Baptist Memorial and Retreat) negotiated such contract provisions with their buyers/partners. The types of provisions the 12 hospitals negotiated as part of their purchase agreements included continuing a certain level and duration of charity care and hospital services; retaining employees and certain management positions; and retaining the option to buy back the hospital if the purchaser decided to sell, close, or substantially change the focus of the hospital. Many of the negotiated provisions had time limits\u2014some, a minimum of 3 years; others had no time periods attached. We were provided documentary evidence of the negotiated terms of the agreements for ten of the hospitals.

Therefore, the board might choose to make cost-cutting decisions that, for example, reduce service levels and charity care in the community. Some states are beginning to address the potential for noncompliance by granting third-party oversight and enforcement authority over negotiated terms of not-for-profit conversion transactions to state attorneys general and health insurance commissioners. For example, a Nebraska statute provides that if the Department of Health receives information and can verify that the new for-profit is not fulfilling its commitments to the community, it can revoke the for-profit\u2019s license."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Communities Were Generally Not Informed About Conversions", "paragraphs": ["Federal and state laws in most states generally have not required that the community be informed about the conversions through mechanisms such as public hearings and disclosure of transaction documents.

However, the community at large was often unaware of the pending sale and uninformed of the sale price or the structure of the transaction. Nine of the 14 hospitals we reviewed did not involve the public through hearings and open forums before the conversion. While they did not seek community approval of the conversion or the partnership decision, five of the hospitals we reviewed informed the public of the conversion through public meetings and community forums.

Revenue rulings are often used as precedents to ensure uniform handling of a tax issue. Of the 14 not-for-profit hospital conversions we reviewed, at least four hospitals (Retreat, Mercy Baptist, Mary Black, and St. Francis) received private letter rulings from the IRS. According to Division officials, the conversion of not-for-profit hospitals does not appear to pose pressing or widespread tax-related issues that require special attention. The IRS has attempted to position itself to react quickly to any unexpected activities and believes it maintains sufficient information to pinpoint areas warranting attention. Moreover, IRS officials told us that states are generally in the best position to act on hospital conversions that are problematic, unless it appears that federal law has been violated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Joint Venture Arrangements Raise Tax and Conflict-of-Interest Questions", "paragraphs": ["Joint ventures between not-for-profit hospitals and for-profit entities can raise questions about whether the not-for-profit will retain its tax-exempt status and whether income distributed to the not-for-profit partner will be subject to tax. Because of the shared ownership structure in a not-for-profit and for-profit joint venture, the opportunity exists for charitable assets to be used for private benefit. The IRS\u2019 position is that, to maintain its tax-exempt status, a not-for-profit\u2019s participation in a joint venture must advance the not-for-profit\u2019s charitable purposes and not result in more than incidental private benefit. According to IRS officials, if the not-for-profit does not exercise control over the day-to-day activities of the joint venture, it cannot ensure that the assets contributed by the not-for-profit will not be used for the private benefit of the for-profit organization. If these assets benefit the for-profit organization, the tax-exempt status of the not-for-profit partner may be revoked. According to IRS officials, if the majority of the not-for-profit organization\u2019s efforts are directed toward exempt activities, the organization will generally retain exempt status. In such a case, however, the income earned by the not-for-profit organization from the joint venture may be subject to income tax under unrelated business income tax rules. At the time of our review, the IRS had not published a position or issued guidance on joint venture arrangements. IRS and the Department of the Treasury are drafting a revenue ruling to provide guidance on the treatment of joint venture transactions under the federal tax rules. The IRS expects to issue this ruling by the end of 1997. This ruling may significantly affect the tax-exempt status of and income earned by the not-for-profit organization participating in the joint venture.", "Another issue surrounding joint ventures involves the potential for conflict of interest when the same people serve on both the not-for-profit foundation board and the for-profit hospital board after a conversion. The potential for conflict of interest is particularly apparent in joint venture arrangements because the foundation board members have a stake in maintaining the for-profit\u2019s interests. For all three joint ventures we reviewed, the charitable foundation board members also participated on the for-profit joint venture board. However, foundation officials stated that the foundations had not awarded any grants in support of the new for-profit hospitals, which is one example of maintaining the for-profit\u2019s interest.", "Joint operating agreements (JOA) raise similar private benefit and conflict-of-interest issues. In a JOA, two or more hospitals or health care entities operate jointly but retain their separate boards, ownership status, and ownership of assets. The profits and losses from JOA activities, however, are shared. Most JOAs have been among not-for-profit entities. However, a JOA can also occur between a not-for-profit hospital and a for-profit entity, an arrangement that is similar to a joint venture. None of the rulings on JOAs has yet involved for-profit participants. Recently, however, a hospital in Jacksonville, Fla., and Columbia/HCA entered into a JOA. The full implementation of the agreement is awaiting an IRS private letter ruling on the tax effects of the operating agreement.

For example, in 1995 FTC alleged that the proposed acquisition by Columbia/HCA of John Randolph Medical Center, one of the conversions we reviewed, would endanger competition for psychiatric hospital care because it would bring under common ownership John Randolph\u2019s psychiatric unit and a competing Columbia/HCA psychiatric hospital in nearby Petersburg, Va.
