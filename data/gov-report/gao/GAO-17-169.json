Personal care services are key components of long-term, in-home care, providing assistance with basic activities, such as bathing, dressing, and toileting, to millions of individuals seeking to retain their independence and to age in place. However, these services are also at high risk for improper payments, including fraud.", "Given the expected increase in the demand for and spending on personal care services and risk of improper payments, GAO was asked to examine available data on personal care services and CMS's use of the data.

For example, MBES data show that total fee-for-service spending on these services was at least $15 billion in 2015\u2014up $2.3 billion from 2012.", "However, the usefulness of the data collected from these two systems for CMS oversight is limited because of data gaps and errors. To provide effective oversight, including decision making, external reporting, and monitoring program operations, CMS needs timely, relevant and reliable data on personal care services rendered and the amount paid.

The most recent data available at the time of GAO's audit were for 2012 and only included data for 35 states. Further, 15 percent of claims lacked provider identification numbers, over 400 different procedure codes were used to identify the services, and the quantity and time periods varied widely. Without good data, CMS is unable to effectively monitor who is providing personal care services or the type, amount, and dates of services. CMS may also face challenges determining whether beneficiaries were eligible for services and assessing the reasonableness of the amount of services claimed.", "MBES data were not always accurate or complete. From 2012 through 2015, GAO found that 17 percent of expenditure lines were not reported correctly. Nearly two-thirds of these errors were due to states not separately identifying personal care services expenditures, as required by CMS. Inaccurate and incomplete reporting limits CMS's ability to ensure federal matching funds are provided consistent with states' approved programs.", "CMS is developing a new Medicaid claims system to replace MSIS and recently established a new office to support CMS's use of Medicaid data for program management and monitoring. However, CMS has not issued guidance related to reporting of personal care services that addresses the gaps GAO identified, or developed plans to use the data for oversight purposes.

Medicaid  spending on long-term care services and supports is significant,  representing more than one-quarter of Medicaid spending annually.   Historically, Medicaid spending for long-term care has been largely for  services provided in institutional settings, such as nursing homes. In  recent years, this trend has changed, and the majority of federal and state  spending has shifted towards home- and community-based services  (HCBS)\u2014that is, services and assistance provided to beneficiaries in their  homes or other settings integrated with their communities. Personal care  services are a significant component of HCBS. Personal care services  provide assistance to beneficiaries of all ages who have limited ability to  care for themselves because of physical, developmental, or intellectual  disabilities. Personal care services assist beneficiaries with activities of  daily living such as bathing, dressing, and toileting. Such assistance can  enable disabled and aged beneficiaries to remain in their homes, maintain  their independence, and participate in community life to the fullest extent  possible.", "The federal cost of Medicaid long-term care spending is expected to  increase from $75 billion in 2015 to $111 billion in 2026.  The demand for  personal care services is expected to increase as result of the aging of  the nation\u2019s population and increased opportunities for the aged and  disabled to live in their homes instead of institutions. The increased  Medicaid spending on HCBS may also increase the risk of Medicaid  making improper payments for personal care services.  In 2014, the most  recent data available, an estimated 6 percent of all payments for personal  care services were improper, and the projected dollar amount of payment  errors was over $2 billion, the third-highest of all Medicaid services.   Despite the expected increase in spending and the risk of improper  payments for personal care services, the extent to which CMS data  systems specifically identify information about personal care services is  not well understood.", "Under broad federal requirements, states administer their individual  Medicaid programs under the oversight of the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS). For example, states determine which optional  services to cover, set payments rates that different providers will receive  for various covered services, and pay providers for claims submitted for  services rendered. The provision of most HCBS, including personal care  services, is an optional Medicaid benefit that states may provide, and  every state has at least one program to provide HCBS, including personal  care services. Federal law allows states to establish and provide personal  care services under several different statutory authorities; as a result,  states may have several different programs that provide personal care  services. CMS has an important responsibility to ensure states report  Medicaid expenditures correctly, identify payments at risk for improper  payments to target resources, and provide technical assistance and  support to states to ensure they have data and oversight tools to identify  questionable payments and reduce improper payments, including and  fraud and abuse.", "In light of the expected increase in demand for personal care services,  the vulnerability of Medicaid beneficiaries receiving these services, the  variety of state programs, and the high rate of improper payments, you  asked about the federal data that CMS collects on Medicaid personal  care services and CMS\u2019s use of these data to oversee state programs.  This report: describes the CMS systems that collect data on Medicaid personal  care services and what the data reveal about the provision of and  spending on these services; and examines the extent to which data CMS collects from these systems  can be used to monitor the provision of and spending on personal  care services by state Medicaid programs.", "To describe the CMS systems that collect data on Medicaid personal care  services and what the data reveal about the provision of and spending on  these services, we reviewed and analyzed the most recently available  data from two CMS data systems. These systems collect (1) detailed  records on the services rendered to Medicaid beneficiaries, and (2)  states\u2019 aggregate Medicaid expenditures by broad categories of service.  For the system that collects information on services rendered, referred to  as the Medicaid Statistical Information System, we analyzed data for  calendar year 2012\u2014the latest available data at the time of our review\u2014 for the 35 states that had finalized 2012 data.  We examined all records  of Medicaid services that were either associated with a known personal  care services procedure code or were categorized as personal care  services in a record\u2019s more generic \u201ctype of service\u201d field. We analyzed  these data across various categories, such as eligibility groups (i.e.,  children ages 0-18, adults ages 19-64, aged individuals ages 65 and  older, and disabled individuals of all ages) and delivery model (i.e., fee- for-service or managed care).  For the system that collects states\u2019  Medicaid expenditures, referred to as the Medicaid Budget and  Expenditure System (MBES), we analyzed data for all 50 states and  Washington, D.C., for calendar years 2012 through 2015, a time period  that allowed for examining trends. We examined each of the expenditure  reporting lines for which personal care services were separately reported.  We also reviewed relevant guidance and documentation, including laws,  regulations, and CMS data forms and data dictionaries; obtained reports  issued by CMS, the HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG), and other  researchers related to the information CMS collects about Medicaid  HCBS and personal care services; and we interviewed CMS officials and  other experts familiar with the data systems. On the basis of these steps,  we determined that data reported by states were sufficiently reliable for  purposes of reporting summary-level information on personal care  services, such aggregate state-reported spending on personal care  services.

We report on  these errors and limitations, and their implications in objective 2 of this  report.", "To examine the extent to which data CMS collects from these systems  can be used to monitor the provision of and spending on personal care  services, we interviewed CMS officials about the data they use to monitor  states\u2019 Medicaid personal care services programs, including the data  systems we examined for the first objective. We also interviewed CMS  officials about how they assess the completeness and accuracy of the  data. We assessed the reliability of the data by screening for missing  data, outliers, and obvious errors, and compared reported information  with information from CMS regarding the different types of programs  under which the states provide personal care services. In addition, we  reviewed the relevant standards for internal control in the federal  government.

States review and  process fee-for-service claims and pay providers based on state- established payment rates for the services provided. Under a managed  care delivery model, states pay managed care organizations a set  amount per beneficiary; providers render services to beneficiaries and  then submit claims to the managed care organization to receive payment.  Managed care plans are required to report to the states information on  services utilized by Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in their plans\u2014 information typically referred to as encounter data.

Under Medicaid  requirements governing the provision of services, states generally must  provide institutional care to Medicaid beneficiaries, while HCBS coverage  is generally an optional service. Medicaid spending on long-term services  and supports provided in home and community settings has increased  dramatically over time\u2014to about $80 billion in 2014\u2014while the share of  spending for care in institutions has declined, and HCBS spending now  exceeds long-term care spending for individuals in institutions (see fig.  1).

Personal care attendants may be employed by a provider agency  or self-employed. In some cases, they are friends or family members of  the beneficiary and, under certain types of Medicaid PCS programs, can  be spouses, parents, or other legally responsible relatives. Under what is  known as an agency-directed model, a provider agency employs multiple  attendants. The provider agency hires, fires, pays, and trains the  attendant to provide personal care services to Medicaid beneficiaries.  Under a participant-directed model, beneficiaries or their representatives  have the authority to manage personal care services by selecting, hiring,  firing, and training attendants themselves and have a greater say in the  personal care services the beneficiary receives. Overall, the number of  personal care attendants employed is projected to increase by 26 percent  from 2014 to 2024.", "As we recently reported, states have considerable flexibility to establish  Medicaid personal care services programs under different provisions of  federal law that authorize different types of programs.

According to numerous HHS OIG  reviews and CMS\u2019s annual review of Medicaid improper payments, the  provision of Medicaid personal care services is at high risk for improper  payments. For example:  In 2012, the OIG issued a report synthesizing results from 23  individual reviews of states\u2019 programs conducted over a 6-year  timeframe between 2006 and 2012.

The HHS OIG concluded that existing controls and  safeguards intended to prevent improper payments in the Medicaid  program and to ensure patient safety and quality of care were often  ineffective. Problems the HHS OIG found included: lack of details on  personal care services claims, including missing dates for when  services were provided and lack of information identifying the provider  of services; lack of evidence that services were rendered; and lack of  prepayment controls to prevent payments for home-based personal  care services when a beneficiary is in an institution. The HHS OIG  also noted that federal and state Medicaid investigations have found  an increasing volume of fraud involving personal care attendants. Of  particular concern were personal care services provided under the  Participant-Directed Option, where the beneficiary has direct  responsibility over the care they receive and a budget to pay personal  care attendants. These findings highlight the need to have better  information about the identity of the individuals providing personal  care services.", "CMS reported for 2014 that Medicaid personal care services  accounted for an estimated $2.2 billion in improper fee-for-service  payments and had the third-highest improper payment rate of the  major categories of service, estimated at 6.3 percent.

States are required by federal law to develop and operate their  own claims-processing and information-retrieval systems and submit data  to CMS, through MSIS, that includes information on the specific services  provided, the beneficiaries receiving these services, and the providers  delivering these services.  Federal law requires states to submit data  that are consistent with the standardized MSIS format and data elements  as a condition of receiving federal reimbursement for mechanized claims  processing systems. CMS has established specific reporting guidance for  some of these data elements but not for others. MSIS was designed to  provide CMS with a detailed, national database of Medicaid program data  to support a broad range of program management functions, including  health care research and evaluation by CMS and other researchers,  program utilization and spending forecasting, and analyses of policy  alternatives.", "The information CMS collects through MSIS from states is not timely.  Data are typically not available for analysis and reporting by CMS or  others for several years after services are provided. This happens for two  reasons. First, although states have 6 weeks following the completion of a  quarter to report their claims data, their reporting can be delayed as a  result of providers and managed care plans not submitting data in a  timely manner, according to the CMS contractor responsible for compiling  data files of Medicaid claims and encounters. For example, providers may  submit claims for fee-for-service payments to the state late and providers  may need to resubmit claims to make adjustments or corrections before  they can be paid by the state. Second, the contractor analyzes the MSIS  data submitted by the states and compiles annual person-level claims  files that are in an accessible format. The contractor also conducts  quality-control checks and corrects data errors and consolidates multiple  records that may exist for one claim. This process, for one year of data,  can take several years and, as a result, when information from claims and  encounters becomes available for use by CMS for purposes of program  management and oversight, it can be several years old.", "Information CMS collects from states through MSIS is also incomplete in  two ways. First, specific data on beneficiaries\u2019 personal care services  were not included in the calendar year 2012 MSIS data for 16 states.  Nevertheless, these 16 states received federal matching funds for the  $4.2 billion in total fee-for-service payments for personal care services  that year\u2014about 33 percent of total expenditures for personal care  services reported by all states (see figure 9).", "Second, even for the 35 states for which 2012 MSIS claims and  encounter data were available, certain data elements collected by CMS  were incomplete. For example, for the records we analyzed, 20 percent  included no payment information, 15 percent included no provider  identification number to identify the provider of service, and 34 percent  did not identify the quantity of services provided (see figure 10).", "Incomplete data limit CMS\u2019s ability to track spending changes and  corroborate spending with reported expenditures because they lack  important information on a significant amount of Medicaid payments for  personal care services. For example, among the 2012 claims for personal  care services under a fee-for-service delivery model, claims without a  provider identification number accounted for about $4.9 billion in total  payments. Similarly, payments for fee-for-service claims with missing  information on the quantity of personal care services provided totaled  about $5.1 billion.", "Even when key information was included in claims and encounter data, it  was often inconsistent, which limits the effectiveness of the data to  identify questionable claims and encounters. For purposes of oversight, a  complete record (claims or encounters) should include data for each visit  with a provider or caregiver, with specified dates of service, and it should  use a clearly specified unit of service (e.g., 15 minutes) along with a  standard definition of the type of service provided. These data allow CMS  and states to analyze claims to identify potential fraud and abuse. The  following examples illustrate inconsistencies in the data from the 35  states:", "States used hundreds of different procedure codes for personal care  services. Procedure codes on submitted claims and encounters were  inconsistent in three ways: the number of codes used by states; the  use of both national and state-specific codes; and the varying  definitions of different codes across states. More than 400 unique  procedure codes were used by the 35 states. CMS does not require  that states use standard procedure codes for personal care services;  instead, states have the discretion to use state-based procedure  codes of their own choosing or national procedure codes. As a result,  the procedure codes used for similar services can differ from state to  state, limiting CMS\u2019s ability to use this data as a tool to compare and  track changes in the use of specific personal care services provided to  beneficiaries because CMS cannot easily compare similar procedures  by comparing service procedure codes.", "States used widely varying units of service associated with numerous  procedure codes. As a result of the numerous procedure codes used  by states, the units of service for personal care services varied widely.  Depending on the code used, units of service can be in 15-, 30-, or  60-minute increments, or as per diem codes. The absence of  information about the unit of service in the millions of records for  personal care services, combined with states\u2019 use of hundreds of  different codes, makes it difficult to efficiently assess the extent that  services provided are reasonable. Claims and encounter records  generally include the procedure code, but do not identify the unit of  service associated with the code. Claims for multiple units of service  may be reasonable if the unit represents a 15-minute increment.  However, if the unit of service represents an hour the number of units  billed may not be reasonable. For example, for a beneficiary requiring  2 hours of personal care services, a claim containing 8 units in a  single day is reasonable if the unit of service is 15 minutes but would  not be reasonable if the unit of service is an hour. Without consistent  procedure codes with defined units of service, the utilization and  expenditure analyses done by CMS and others with the data are  difficult to complete, including assessing the reasonableness of the  amount of services claimed and identifying potentially inappropriate  claims. In general, we found that claims for 2012 represented large  quantities of services. Among claims with valid quantity of service  data\u2014that is, where the claim identified a procedure code and the  number of units provided\u2014quantities reported ranged from 1 unit to  more than 27,000 units, with an average quantity of 15 units. For the  most commonly used procedure, which represents 15 minutes of  service by a personal care attendant, the average quantity would  translate into nearly 4 hours of personal care services billed as a  single claim. For seven states, 100 percent of cases were missing  information on the quantity of services delivered.", "State-reported dates of service were overly broad. In the 35 states  whose claims we could review, some claims for personal care  services had dates of services (i.e., start and end dates) that spanned  multiple days, weeks, and in some cases months. For 12 of the 35  states, 95 percent of their claims were billed for a single day of  service. However, in other states, a number of claims were billed over  longer time periods. For example, for 10 of the states, 5 percent of  claims covered a period of at least 1 month, and 9 states submitted  claims that covered 100 or more days. When states report dates of  service that are imprecise, it is difficult to determine the specific date  for which services were provided and identify whether services were  claimed during a period when the beneficiary is not eligible to receive  personal care services\u2014for example, when hospitalized for acute  care services.", "Others have also found the poor quality of personal care services data  submitted to CMS to be a long-standing problem. Based on numerous  reviews of states\u2019 personal care services programs, the HHS OIG  determined that the limited or missing information on personal care  service providers, dates of service, and quantity of services were an  impediment to effective program integrity and oversight.  The HHS OIG  found that the data could not be used to accurately identify overlapping  claims because it was common for providers to submit one claim for  multiple instances of personal care services provided over days, weeks,  or months. The HHS OIG also found that with overlapping dates it is  difficult to identify instances when beneficiaries were receiving  institutional services and therefore were ineligible for home-based  personal care services. Further, the HHS OIG found that claims for  personal care services did not include unique identifiers for personal care  attendants and that cases of fraud often involved impossible or  improbable volumes of service or service patterns, for example, claims for  more than 24 hours in a day or claims for services in multiple beneficiary  homes during the same day. The HHS OIG concluded that, if the  availability and quality of personal care data were improved, investigators  could analyze the data to identify and follow up on aberrancies and  questionable billing patterns. Based on its findings, the OIG  recommended that CMS takes steps to reduce variation in how states are  documenting claims for personal care services, among other  recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Budget and Expenditure System Data Collected by CMS Are Not Always Accurate or Complete", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid personal care services expenditure data collected from states  by CMS and contained in the MBES are not always accurate or complete,  according to our analysis of states\u2019 reported expenditures for calendar  years 2012 through 2015. CMS requires states to report expenditures for  personal care services on specific lines on the CMS-64. The required  reporting lines correspond with the specific types of programs under  which states have received authority to cover personal care services, and  can affect the federal matching payment amounts states receive when  seeking federal reimbursement. For example, a 6 percent increase in  federal matching is available for services provided through the  Community First Choice program. For personal care services provided  under the State Plan PSC program, CMS requires states to report their  expenditures on one of two lines of the CMS-64.  For personal care  services provided under the three other programs\u2014HCBS Waiver, State  Plan HCBS, and Community First Choice\u2014CMS requires states to report  their expenditures for personal care services separately from other types  of services provided under each program. CMS requires these states to  submit expenditure amounts for specific service types on what CMS  refers to as feeder forms\u2014that is, expenditure lines on the CMS-64 that  feed into the total HCBS spending amount under a state\u2019s HCBS Waiver  program. The MBES system automatically generates the state\u2019s total  HCBS Waiver program spending by combining the expenditures reported  for each of the various specific services.", "We found that not all states are reporting their personal care services  expenditures accurately, and as result, personal care services  expenditures may be underreported or reported in an incorrect category.  We compared personal care services expenditures from all states\u2019 CMS- 64 reports for calendar years 2012 through 2015 with each state\u2019s  approved programs during this time period and found that about 17  percent of personal care services expenditure lines were not reported  correctly. As illustrated in figure 11, nearly two-thirds of the reporting  errors were a result of states not separately identifying and reporting  personal care services expenditures using the correct reporting lines, as  required by CMS. Without separate reporting of personal care  expenditures as required, CMS is unable to monitor how spending  changes over time across the different program types and have an  accurate estimate of the magnitude of potential improper payments for  personal care services. The other types of errors involved states  erroneously reporting expenditures that did not correspond with approved  programs. As a result, CMS is not able to efficiently and effectively  identify and prevent states from receiving federal matching funds  inappropriately, in part, because it does not have accurate fee-for-service  claims data that track payments by personal care program type that is  linked with expenditures reported for purpose of federal reimbursement.", "These errors demonstrate that CMS is not effectively ensuring its  reporting requirements for personal care expenditures are met. By not  ensuring that states are accurately reporting expenditures for personal  care services, CMS is unable to accurately identify total expenditures for  personal care services, expenditures by program, and changes over time.  According to CMS, expenditures that states report through MBES are  subject to a variance analysis, which identifies significant changes in  reported expenditures from year to year. However, CMS\u2019s variance  analysis did not identify any of the reporting errors that we found. CMS  officials told us that they will continue to review states\u2019 quarterly  expenditure reports for significant variances and follow up on such  variances."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS is Taking Steps to Improve Data Collected from States, but Has Not Yet Fully Addressed Completeness, Consistency, and Accuracy of Personal Care Services Data", "paragraphs": ["CMS has two ongoing actions intended to improve Medicaid claims data  collected from states. First, CMS is developing an enhanced Medicaid  claims data system\u2014called the Transformed-Medicaid Statistical  Information System (T-MSIS)\u2014that will replace MSIS. Enhancements  being made under T-MSIS include requiring states to report more timely  data, additional claims information, and improved CMS checks on the  quality of data submitted. Specifically, states will be required to do the  following, according to CMS:  report data more frequently than they are now required (monthly  rather than quarterly),  submit a new data file reporting information on the providers of  services, including provider identification numbers, and  identify for each claim which expenditure line on the CMS-64  corresponds with the type of service covered by the claim.", "CMS is also improving the quality of data reported by states by subjecting  states\u2019 submitted data to thousands of electronic checks to identify  obvious errors.", "Despite the promise of T-MSIS, implementation has faced delays and is  not yet complete. Implementation of T-MSIS by all states has been  delayed for several years. The original date for nationwide  implementation was January 2014; however, according to CMS officials,  as of July 2016, 10 states were submitting T-MSIS data to CMS, but not  all of the required data were submitted. The agency expects that all  states will be submitting T-MSIS claims data by the end of calendar year  2016. However, reaching this goal depends on the remaining states\u2019  timeliness in completing the work needed to successfully transmit the T- MSIS data. It could be a number of years before all states are submitting  complete T-MSIS data that include all required data elements, according  to officials.", "Once all states are reporting T-MSIS claims data, including personal care  services claims, key data limitations we identified associated with MSIS  claims may not be fully addressed. This is because under T-MSIS, CMS  has not taken steps to improve the completeness and consistency of  personal care services claims data. For example, CMS has not issued  guidance to establish: a uniform set of procedure codes to be used by all states to more  consistently document type and quantity of personal care services  rendered;  state reporting requirements for provider identification numbers for  personal care attendants. appropriate time periods covered by individual claims\u2014that is, the  maximum number of days that a personal care attendant may include  in a single claim.", "In addition, planned improvements in T-MSIS to identify the  corresponding expenditure line on the CMS-64 may not be realized. CMS  has stated a goal that T-MSIS would identify, for each claim paid in a fee- for-service delivery system, the expenditure line on the CMS-64 that  corresponds with the type of service covered by the claim. This goal  would allow better accounting for the claims paid and the services for  which the claims were made. Further, this linking of the claims with the  associated expenditure line could facilitate more accurate state reporting  of expenditures on the CMS-64 and allow CMS to effectively reconcile  each state\u2019s payments for personal care services with their reported  expenditures. However, CMS\u2019s plans to have states link their T-MSIS  claims with CMS-64 expenditure lines will be effective only for one  personal care services program. For three other programs, T-MSIS  claims are not required to be associated with a specific service type.  Rather, the claims are identified simply as an HCBS service under one of  the three programs. Without this information, T-MSIS claims for personal  care services cannot be cross-walked with CMS-64 data on the  expenditures for those services.", "CMS\u2019s second ongoing action to improve Medicaid claims data collected  from the states is the establishment of a new Division of Business and  Data Analysis. This division is intended to help the agency ensure the  quality of T-MSIS data. According to CMS officials, MSIS claims data  have generally not been used for program monitoring and oversight,  because issues with data timeliness, completeness, and consistency  have limited their usefulness for these purposes. Development of T-MSIS  is intended to address data issues and the establishment of the new  division is intended to facilitate the use of state-collected data by CMS.  According to CMS officials, the new division is intended to: work with states to help ensure the completeness and consistency of  claims data as states transition to T-MSIS,  improve the quality of the data by analyzing the data for anomalies  and errors that can be corrected, build the agency\u2019s capacity to use the data for program monitoring,  oversight, and reporting, and provide data analysis support for different CMS program offices,  including the offices that oversee states\u2019 personal care services  programs.", "According to CMS, the improved data will be used by CMS for program  monitoring, policy implementation, improving beneficiary health care, and  lowering costs. CMS efforts in building the agency\u2019s data analysis  capacity are underway but in the early stages. Improving the quality of the  data is a continuous process that depends on identifying specific data  needed for oversight functions. According to CMS officials responsible for  implementing T-MSIS, while T-MSIS has the capability for improving the  quality of data submitted by states, policies and guidance are needed  regarding how CMS will use it. CMS recognizes it has an important  responsibility to support Medicaid agencies and leverage program data to  protect the Medicaid program from fraud, waste, and abuse in part by  improving the quality and consistency of Medicaid data reported to CMS  and improving the analysis of this data to identify potential risks.   However, as of September 2016, neither the division nor the CMS offices  responsible for managing different personal care services programs has  identified or developed plans for analyzing and using personal care  services data for program management and oversight, such as analytical  tools and standard reports. Doing so could facilitate necessary changes  to improve the quality of the data, clarify T-MSIS reporting requirements,  facilitate the integration of claims and expenditure data, and increase the  usefulness of claims data for oversight.", "Federal agencies should collect data that are reasonably free from error  and bias, and represent what they purport to represent.
