Few federal agencies have data collection as their sole or primary mission, but OMB in its annual report identifies agencies as conducting statistical activities when they devote $500,000 or more of their annual budgets to such activities. If this criterion is used for definition, the agencies in the federal statistical system could change from year to year, although the list is quite stable over time. For fiscal year 1995, 72 agencies met or exceeded the $500,000 budget level. Although the majority of these agencies produce statistical information on a particular subject as a byproduct of their administrative, regulatory, or operating responsibilities, several agencies have the production of statistical information as their principal mission.", "Some federal statistics are used by persons with varying information needs; such statistics are frequently called general-purpose statistics. Other statistics are special purpose in character and deal with one subject matter (e.g., education or transportation); they focus on a particular function of government and are primarily designed to aid program administrators and policymakers. The bulk of these other statistics relate to specific federal programs and are essentially a byproduct of the agencies\u2019 administration or monitoring of these activities.", "The four agencies whose conformance with the selected NAS guidelines we evaluated are major, well-recognized multipurpose agencies of the federal statistical system. Census tabulates and publishes a wide variety of data about the people and the economy of the nation. These data include the Decennial Census of Population and Housing, the economic and agricultural censuses, and data on U.S. merchandise trade. BLS collects, processes, analyzes, and disseminates data on employment, unemployment, characteristics of employment and employees, and prices and consumer expenditures.", "BEA is a research-oriented statistical agency that prepares, develops, interprets, and publishes the U.S. economic accounts. BEA integrates large volumes of monthly, quarterly, and annual economic data\u2014ranging from construction spending to retail sales\u2014produced by other government agencies and trade sources to produce a complete and consistent picture of the national economy and its international and regional dimensions.", "NCHS specializes in health statistics, including vital statistics from marriage, birth, and death certificates. It collects, analyzes, disseminates, and carries out research on the U.S. population\u2019s health status, lifestyles, and exposure to unhealthful influences.", "Although Census, BLS, BEA, and NCHS are responsible for a large portion of the statistics produced by the federal government, they are only 4 of the 72 agencies that constitute the federal statistical system. For example, NCHS is not the only agency that collects health statistics. Within the Department of Health and Human Services, 13 agencies collect health statistics. The largest of these are the National Institutes of Health and NCHS\u2019 parent organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. OMB\u2019s Statistical Policy Branch is responsible for coordinating the activities of the 72 statistical agencies by reviewing agency budget requests, issuing statistical standards, facilitating interagency working groups, and reviewing agency information requests. Appendix I lists by department the names of the 72 agencies in the federal statistical system that are expected to spend at least $500,000 on statistical activities in fiscal year 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Importance of Statistics Issued by Census, BEA, BLS, and NCHS", "paragraphs": ["Since the earliest days of the United States, statistics have been collected and used to describe various facets of the national economy and population. The Constitution, notably, mandates a decennial census to count the population. Government policy and private decisions depend on the availability of accurate and timely information. In addition, federal, state, and local governments rely on statistical information to administer programs under their jurisdictions. Census, BEA, BLS, and NCHS are responsible for many of the statistics used by policymakers and those who administer federal programs.", "The statistical activities of these four agencies influence policymakers in their formulation of national policies. For example, statistics are fundamental to the federal government\u2019s efforts to allocate its annual budget. Federal income tax brackets and some benefit payments, for instance, are adjusted to mitigate the effects of inflation. Statistics are also an important part of many presidential messages and reports. For example, the annual Economic Report of the President contains extensive statistical appendixes, and many of the policies and programs discussed in the report are based on a statistical foundation provided by the four agencies discussed in this report. In addition, Census\u2019 Decennial Census of Population and Housing is the basis on which representation in Congress is apportioned among the states.", "The uses of federal statistics extend beyond the government. Decennial census data are used widely by businesses and the media to examine social trends. Much of the news on the business and financial pages of the daily press comes from the release of statistics by BEA, BLS, and Census. Business analysts regularly use statistics of economic conditions when planning investments and operations in their own businesses. Labor organizations and management use statistics on earnings, hours, employment, and prices in their collective bargaining negotiations. BLS\u2019 consumer price index (CPI), which measures the change in the prices of a uniform \u201cmarket basket\u201d of goods and services, is widely used as the measure for \u201cescalator clauses\u201d in contracts. In employment contracts, for example, such a clause might tie increases in wages and pensions to the CPI to keep employee or retiree earnings in line with inflation.", "The administration and Congress use statistics produced by these four agencies as a basis for measuring the results of government programs. Some data series are built directly into the administration of programs such as BLS\u2019 inflation and Census\u2019 poverty indexes. For example, if the CPI overstated inflation by as little as 0.2 percentage points annually from 1995 through 1999, an estimated $19.1 billion would be added to the deficit over that 5-year period, according to OMB estimates. In addition, current defense industry contracts amounting to $90 billion include a purchases and sales component that is adjusted by BLS\u2019 producer price index. And BEA, BLS, and Census produce local area unemployment, income, and poverty statistics that are important components of formula programs that allocate billions of dollars of federal funds to state and local governments.", "The statistics that NCHS produces and disseminates offer many indicators of the health of the nation\u2019s population. From a public policy perspective, NCHS data are critical in the government\u2019s monitoring of cost and delivery of health care. The use of these data in research also helps to bring about improvements in the prevention or treatment of diseases. Because data are usually published from each NCHS information system separately, the wide range of NCHS\u2019 data is sometimes not apparent. NCHS\u2019 data systems are used to obtain information from individuals, health care providers, and vital records, such as birth, death, and marriage certificates; the data systems are useful in studying public health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Budget Resources Devoted to Statistical Activities", "paragraphs": ["According to OMB, the 72 agencies that had budgets of $500,000 or more for statistical activities requested an estimated total of $2.6 billion in direct funding for statistical activities in fiscal year 1995.

CNSTAT is composed of professionals in the statistical field who have no direct relationship with the federal government. Since its founding, CNSTAT has concentrated on reviewing federal statistics on a selective basis. It also prepares reports on special studies that are intended to improve the effectiveness of the federal statistical system. Considering the diversity of the agencies that make up the federal statistical system, it is difficult to devise standards against which to measure the agencies\u2019 performance. However, CNSTAT developed guidelines that it believes are essential for the efficient operation of federal agencies that conduct statistical activities.", "NAS issued a CNSTAT report in 1992 entitled Principles and Practices for a Federal Statistical Agency. CNSTAT prepared this report partially in response to requests for advice from congressional and executive officials proposing the creation of new statistical agencies, such as a Bureau of Environmental Statistics and a Bureau of Transportation Statistics. These officials were interested in CNSTAT\u2019s views on what constitutes an effective federal statistical agency. CNSTAT also prepared the report because it was concerned that federal statistical agencies might sometimes not meet what it considered acceptable professional standards.", "In the NAS report, CNSTAT outlined guidelines that it believes should be followed by federal statistical agencies. According to NAS, the guidelines contain principles and practices that are statements of \u201cbest practices,\u201d rather than legal requirements or scientific rules. The guidelines, however, were intended to be consistent with current laws and statistical theory and practice.", "In the report, CNSTAT discussed the following three principles it found to be essential for the effective operation of a federal statistical agency.

These guidelines are intended as specific applications of the three broad principles. According to these guidelines, a federal statistical agency needs \u2022 a clearly defined and well-accepted mission, \u2022 cooperation with data users by soliciting their views on data quality, \u2022 established procedures for the fair treatment of data providers, \u2022 openness about the data provided to users, \u2022 coordination with other statistical agencies, \u2022 a wide dissemination of data, \u2022 a strong measure of independence, \u2022 commitment to quality and professional standards, \u2022 an active research program, \u2022 professional advancement of staff, and \u2022 caution in conducting nonstatistical activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We undertook this review at the request of the former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the former Chairman of its former Subcommittee on Regulation and Government Information. To evaluate the four agencies\u2019 performance, we compared their activities to the seven NAS guidelines for the effective operation of a federal statistical agency that we regarded as the most susceptible to objective assessment. We did not include the other four NAS guidelines that are of a more subjective nature. The original request for this review specified evaluating Census, BLS, and NCHS. With the agreement of the requesters, we added BEA to the review because of its key responsibilities for providing economic data. The requesters also asked us to provide information on OMB\u2019s role in coordinating and overseeing the statistical activities of those agencies that constitute the federal statistical system.", "Our first objective was to determine to what extent the four statistical agencies followed the seven NAS guidelines that we used for comparison. Specifically, we examined whether the four agencies (1) had clearly defined and well-accepted missions, (2) cooperated with data users, (3) had established procedures for the fair treatment of data providers, (4) were open about the data provided to users, (5) widely disseminated the data, (6) coordinated with other statistical agencies, and (7) had a strong measure of independence. To understand the context for these guidelines, we interviewed CNSTAT officials to document the procedures they used in preparing and issuing the guidelines. We also interviewed executive branch officials and other knowledgeable experts about the NAS guidelines; reviewed relevant literature, such as other NAS publications and reports about the federal statistical system; and compared the NAS guidelines to comparable international guidelines for statistical agencies.", "To determine agency compliance with the selected NAS guidelines, we interviewed officials from each of the four agencies and OMB and asked them to provide documents to demonstrate their compliance. These documents included information on missions, activities, and resource history; legal basis for agency organization and operations; data dissemination; cooperation with data users; and coordination/contacts with other governmental organizations and professional societies. In general, our criterion for compliance with a guideline was whether agencies had such documentation. We relied upon interviews and other sources of data to ensure that we adequately understood the context of this documentation. The agencies also provided us with background briefing books, descriptions of statistical programs and publications, agency orders and operational procedures, budget documents, and other documentation. We attended meetings of selected agency advisory committees and boards, meetings with independent groups, and agency-sponsored user conferences. We also met with key agency officials to discuss their programs and policies in the context of the selected guidelines. For example, to determine if the agencies had clearly defined and well-accepted missions, we discussed with agency officials the process by which the mission statements were developed (i.e., through planning conferences or other means) and compared the mission statements to authorizing legislation and agency activities to carry out their statistical missions.", "Our second objective was to provide information on OMB\u2019s role in coordinating and overseeing the statistical activities of those agencies that constitute the federal statistical system. To do so, we reviewed the requirements contained in the Paperwork Reduction Act for OMB\u2019s responsibilities to coordinate the federal statistical system. We also reviewed published studies on organization and coordination of the federal statistical system. In agreement with the requesters, we predominantly focused on OMB\u2019s role in coordinating federal statistical agencies\u2019 budgets and did not address the other aspects of OMB\u2019s role, such as assessing the quality of statistical data, statistical standards, and paperwork reduction. We reviewed OMB\u2019s annual reports on statistical activities of the U.S. government and the four agencies\u2019 budget submissions for fiscal years 1983 to 1995.

BEA said that our report underscores the efforts statistical agencies have made to operate effectively and to maintain user confidence in the data they produce. BEA also noted that it agrees in principle with the NAS guidelines and the way we applied them to the statistical agencies. BEA expressed its appreciation for our portrayal of how it handled the integrity issues involving previous GDP estimates. BEA also cited two issues that it believed needed to be clarified in the report. First, BEA thought that we portrayed the statistical agencies as passive participants in efforts to enhance data sharing among themselves. This was not our intention, and we have revised the report on page 27 to acknowledge an interagency task force that was formed to develop proposals for enhanced data sharing. The second issue raised by BEA involved our discussion of its efforts to get input from data users. BEA felt we should have mentioned its Mid-Decade Strategic Review and Plan, which is intended to maintain and review the performance of BEA\u2019s economic accounts. According to BEA, this review includes seeking user input on how the accounts can be improved. We have revised the report on page 21 to include a discussion of the mid-decade review and plan.", "On June 7, 1995, we met with the Chief Statistician and a senior economist in OMB\u2019s Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The officials generally agreed with our evaluation of the four agencies\u2019 adherence to the selected NAS guidelines. However, the officials said that our report appeared to indicate that coordination among the statistical agencies is limited to their data-sharing arrangements. The officials noted that the agencies coordinate in many ways, including through working groups on statistical standards, survey design, and data collection. We did not intend to convey the impression that agency coordination is limited to data sharing, and we have revised the report on page 27 to clarify the extent of coordination among statistical agencies.", "The OMB officials also said that the draft did not adequately reflect the full extent of the coordination activities performed by OMB\u2019s Statistical Policy Branch. We have revised the report on pages 43 to 45 to reflect the description of the Branch\u2019s budget coordination function, which includes working with the major statistical agencies and the OMB program examiners assigned to them to coordinate the statistical budgets of these agencies. The officials also said that the draft did not adequately describe the Branch\u2019s role in the coordination of federal statistical policy. We agree that the Branch plays an important role in the coordination of federal statistical policy, but our report focused on its budget coordination function. However, we have revised the report on pages 17, 18, and 43 to clarify that the Branch has other responsibilities in addition to budget coordination.

First, although the agencies coordinated to some extent with other statistical agencies, their coordination was limited by data provider confidentiality statutes, and initiatives to modify the limitations through legislative change have not yet succeeded. Second, the agencies themselves were generally politically independent, but we have reported on one instance when a statistical agency\u2014BEA\u2014had not been successful in conveying this independence to data users, judging by allegations of political interference in their work. In a March 1993 report GAO noted that a collection of articles that appeared in the press from October 1991 through November 1992 alleged that BEA had manipulated its first quarter gross domestic product estimates for political purposes.

However, according to published studies of OMB\u2019s coordination role, including those by CRS, the Office of Technology Assessment, and NAS, the Branch does not do the detailed, systemwide budget reviews required by the act. These reviews are to enable OMB to determine if the budgetary resources available for statistical programs are being directed where they are most needed.", "The Branch\u2019s current role in coordinating federal statistical agency budgets consists of reviewing budget submissions from the major statistical agencies and coordinating with OMB Resource Management Offices responsible for individual agency accounts to promote compliance with the administration\u2019s funding priorities for statistical agencies. The Branch also reviews some other budget requests on an ad hoc basis determined by the importance of the statistical product being funded. For example, the Branch reviews budget requests relevant to data feeding into National Income and Product Accounts estimates.", "The Branch also compiles agency budget requests for an annual report to Congress on funding for statistical activities. However, this report is basically a compilation of the budgets for the statistical agencies approved by Congress and the current budget requests that the administration sent to Congress for statistical activities. The report is not the product of a systematic review of statistical activities. Since the Branch was established in 1981, it has delivered the report several months after the individual statistical agencies have submitted their budgets to OMB and then to Congress. According to OMB officials, the delay is attributable to delays in getting necessary data from agencies whose statistical functions are incorporated in other programs. The officials note that such data are readily available for the approximately 10 agencies that are the major components of the federal statistical system. Thus, congressional committee deliberations have already begun or even, as in fiscal year 1995, have ended before Congress has received the report. Therefore, Congress has not had a current, comprehensive picture of all resources the administration has requested for statistical activities during budget deliberations. As a result, Congress is handicapped in its ability to direct funding where it is most needed, particularly with respect to funding for agencies that are not among the major statistical agencies.", "As noted earlier, for a staff of five, the Statistical Policy Branch has broad responsibilities. Consequently, according to Branch officials, the Statistical Policy Branch is sometimes required to adjust its priorities on the basis of such factors as the imposition of new administration initiatives or a general shortage of staff.", "Statistical Policy Branch officials told us that resources for federal statistical activities could be allocated more effectively if a strengthened process were instituted for reviewing statistical agency budgets. The officials said that they would like OMB to reinstate its crosscutting review of statistical agency budget requests to help the administration make any necessary reallocation of resources within the federal statistical system. Until 1978, such a review appeared when the president\u2019s budget was submitted to Congress. As the federal government continues to face budget constraints, it is likely that there will be an increasing need to reallocate the limited funding available for statistical activities. In a speech at a recent symposium sponsored by BEA, the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board called for a reallocation of funding for statistical activities.He noted that as a policymaker, he recognized the importance of accurate statistics on the economy. He went on to state that reallocating funding resources could help close some of the gaps in economic statistics, particularly gaps in statistics on the increasingly important service sector.", "OMB is currently settling into a major reorganization, OMB 2000, that is partly designed to encourage crosscutting reviews of federal programs. It remains to be seen whether OMB 2000 or other actions will result in the Statistical Policy Branch leading a crosscutting review that would coordinate the analysis of statistical agency budget requests. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 reauthorizes (1) OMB review of statistical agencies\u2019 budget proposals to ensure that the proposals are consistent with long-range plans and (2) the development of an annual report to Congress summarizing and analyzing statistical activities. However, the act does not necessarily provide additional staff to OMB to perform these responsibilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The federal statistical system is a collection of agencies with interrelated responsibilities for meeting the nation\u2019s statistical needs. For the federal statistical agencies to work effectively, it is important that they closely coordinate their activities. The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 assigned OMB the responsibility for, among other things, coordinating the federal statistical system. The act specifically directed OMB to review statistical agencies\u2019 budget submissions to ensure that the proposals are consistent with systemwide priorities.", "OMB\u2019s Statistical Policy Branch currently reviews the major statistical agencies\u2019 budget submissions. It also prepares a summary of individual agencies\u2019 statistical budgets as submitted in the president\u2019s budget to Congress. Since the Branch was established in 1981, the report has been issued after Congress has already started to determine the agencies\u2019 budgets. To adequately coordinate the systemwide activities of federal statistical agencies, OIRA would also need to closely review budget submissions of the smaller statistical agencies before they are sent to Congress. Such reviews could identify such inefficiencies as duplication of effort and help to ensure that the limited federal funds for statistical activities are spent as effectively as possible.", "OMB\u2019s current reorganization is intended to improve its ability to review federal programs.
