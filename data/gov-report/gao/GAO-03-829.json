Taxol was developed through a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) between NIH and the Bristol-Meyers Squibb Company (BMS) and by 2001 had become the best-selling cancer drug in history.

GAO reviewed relevant materials and statutes governing technology transfer, reviewed the patent history of Taxol, interviewed NIH and BMS officials, and reviewed data on NIH's financial investment and drug pricing policies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 1991 HIH-BMS CRADA was one of the first CRADAs to result in a major breakthrough drug. NIH's partnership with BMS provided the company with the research results that enabled Taxol to be commercialized quickly and made available as a treatment for cancer patients. Prior to the CRADA and during the first 2 years of the agreement, NIH conducted most of the clinical trials associated with the drug. The results of these trials were critical for BMS to secure FDA's approval in 1992 to market Taxol for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. As agreed in the CRADA, BMS supplied the drug to NIH researchers to overcome previous shortages. The additional supplies from BMS allowed NIH to increase the number of patients enrolled in NIH clinical trials for this drug from 500 patients by 1989 to nearly 29,000 patients over the course of the CRADA. NIH made substantial investments in the research related to Taxol, but its financial benefits from the collaboration with BMS have not been great in comparison to BMS's revenue from the drug. NIH estimates that it spent $183 million on all Taxol-related research from 1977 through the end of the CRADA's term in 1997. For one portion of its spending, NIH estimates that it spent $96 million to conduct clinical trials supporting the CRADA; this was offset by a $16 million payment from BMS. In addition, BMS supplied Taxol to NIH, the value of which GAO estimates to be $92 million. NIH spent an additional $301 million on Taxol-related research from 1998 through 2002, some of which was for cancer research, making NIH's total Taxol-related spending $484 million through 2002. BMS's sales of Taxol totaled over $9 billion from 1993 through 2002. BMS agreed to pay NIH royalties at a rate equal to 0.5 percent of worldwide sales of Taxol as part of a 1996 agreement to license three NIH Taxol-related inventions developed during the CRADA. Royalty payments to NIH have totaled $35 million. The federal government has been a major payer for Taxol, primarily through Medicare. For example, Medicare payments for Taxol totaled $687 million from 1994 through 1999. Several factors affected NIH's exercise of its broad authority in negotiating its Taxol-related technology transfer activities. First, NIH did not have a patent on Taxol and thus could not grant an exclusive patent license to a CRADA partner. Second, in NIH's evaluation, it was limited by a shortage of available, qualified alternative partners. Finally, the negotiation of royalties for NIH's Taxol-related inventions was affected by multiple considerations, including the priorities that both NIH and BMS assigned to different factors in the setting of royalties. These factors include the stage of development, the potential market value of the license, and the contribution to public health of making the product available. In commenting on a draft of this report, NIH provided additional information about its expenditures and the contributions of BMS, which GAO incorporated, and also discussed its evaluation of whether BMS's pricing of Taxol was reasonable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The transfer of technology resulting from federally funded research to the  private sector is intended to bring pharmaceuticals to the marketplace  much sooner and more efficiently than would have been possible for a  federal agency acting alone.

NIH uses mechanisms such as cooperative research and  development agreements (CRADA) with industry partners and the  licensing of patented inventions arising from research it funds to provide  incentives for businesses to develop pharmaceuticals. However, the  financial success of certain drugs that have benefited from government- funded research has raised concerns about whether the federal  government is getting a fair return on its investment in the research  leading to these products.", "An example of pharmaceutical technology transfer is Taxol (paclitaxel),  which by 2001 had become the best-selling cancer drug in history. Taxol  was commercialized by the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS).  Through a collaboration with NIH, BMS benefited from substantial  investments in research conducted or funded by NIH. In this instance, the  NIH research examined the safety and effectiveness of this naturally  occurring compound for the treatment of cancer and resulted in  techniques for administering the drug. NIH transferred its research results  and discoveries to BMS for its use in seeking approval from the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) to market the drug.", "You asked us to examine the legal and financial issues involved in  technology transfer as illustrated by the case of the research,  development, and commercialization of Taxol.

(2) What was NIH\u2019s financial investment in Taxol-related research, and  what were the financial outcomes of the technology transfer process  related to Taxol? (3) What factors influenced how NIH exercised its  authority in Taxol-related technology transfer activities?", "To address these questions, we reviewed published and unpublished  documents describing NIH and BMS\u2019s partnership and their efforts to  research and develop Taxol. Using the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office\u2019s  database, we reviewed the patent history of Taxol. We reviewed the  primary Taxol-related CRADA between NIH and BMS, which was signed in  1991. We also reviewed an additional Taxol-related CRADA and the license  agreement between NIH and BMS. We interviewed the principal  investigators associated with those CRADAs to understand the research  involved. To assess NIH\u2019s investments and financial outcomes resulting  from Taxol-related research, we obtained and reviewed data from NIH\u2019s  National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Financial Management (OFM),  and BMS\u2019s Annual Reports. We also reviewed Medicare drug purchase  data from the Medicare part-B Extract Summary System and pricing data  from the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). We interviewed officials from  BMS and from NIH\u2019s OFM, Office of Technology Transfer (OTT), and NCI  about spending estimates and the use of royalty payments. To assess the  factors that influence how NIH exercises its legal authority, we reviewed  the relevant statutes and regulations pertaining to the technology transfer  process and interviewed pertinent officials involved in the process at NIH  and BMS. We also interviewed officials from one of NIH\u2019s key partners in  paclitaxel-related research, Florida State University (FSU), where much of  the early research on a semisynthetic method of producing paclitaxel was  performed. The scope of our report was restricted to NIH\u2019s investment in  paclitaxel, and we did not evaluate the effectiveness of commercializing  Taxol in comparison to other drugs. For this reason, we consider the  implications of the development of Taxol as a case study, not necessarily  as representative of the way NIH performs technology transfer activities.

The groundwork for the public-private partnership  that fostered the success of Taxol was laid in 1980. Prior to that time, the  government generally retained title to any inventions created under federal  research grants and contracts. This situation became a source of  dissatisfaction because of a general belief that the results of government- owned research were not being made widely available for the public\u2019s  benefit. For example, there were concerns that biomedical and other  technological advances resulting from federally funded research at  universities were not leading to new products because the universities had  little incentive to seek uses for inventions to which the government held  title. In 1980, the Congress passed two landmark pieces of legislation\u2014the  Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980 and the Bayh-Dole  Act\u2014with the intent of promoting economic development, enhancing U.S.  competitiveness, and benefiting the public by encouraging the  commercialization of technologies developed with federal funding.", "Although the acts have common objectives, the Stevenson-Wydler Act  focuses on inventions owned by the federal government, while the Bayh- Dole Act focuses on inventions created under federal contracts, grants,  and cooperative research and development agreements. Under the  Stevenson-Wydler Act, inventions owned by the government remain the  property of the agencies that produce them. However, the act as amended  sets out guidelines and priorities that encourage commercialization of  these inventions through the licensing of technology to U.S. business. In  1986 the Federal Technology Transfer Act amended the Stevenson-Wydler  Act and enhanced the authority of federal agencies in this area,  authorizing them to enter into CRADAs with nonfederal partners to  conduct research.", "The Bayh-Dole Act authorizes federal agencies to execute license  agreements with commercial entities to promote the development of  federally owned inventions, and to collect royalties for such licenses. The  act also gives small businesses, universities, and other nonprofit  organizations the right to retain title to and profit from the inventions  arising from their federally funded research, provided they adhere to  certain requirements. In 1983, a presidential memorandum extended this  patent policy to large businesses. The act also contains several provisions  to protect the public\u2019s interest in commercializing federally funded  inventions, such as a requirement that a contractor or grantee that retains  title to a federally funded invention file for patent protection and attempt  commercialization. In return, the government retains the right to use the  inventions without paying royalties. In general, most biomedical  inventions are not a final end product; therefore the government rights  would not extend to a final product."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NIH\u2019s Role in Technology Transfer", "paragraphs": ["NIH, with a budget of over $23 billion in fiscal year 2002, is the principal  federal agency that conducts and funds biomedical research, including  research on drugs. Within NIH, OTT is responsible for licensing the  inventions of NIH employees to the private sector for development to  benefit the public health. OTT oversees patent prosecution, negotiates and  monitors licensing agreements, and provides oversight and central policy  review of CRADAs. NIH\u2019s stated goals with regard to the technology  transfer process are, in order of priority, to foster scientific discoveries, to  facilitate the rapid transfer of discoveries to the bedside, to make resulting  products accessible to patients, and to earn income. NIH has broad  authority under the statutes described above to negotiate agreements with  outside partners in pursuit of its technology transfer goals.", "NIH scientists and laboratories, scientists and laboratories in academia or  other research institutions that receive public funding, and industry  researchers are often all involved in the development of pharmaceuticals.", "Usually, government and academic scientists conduct basic research on  the biology of a disease and identify compounds, methods, and chemical  reactions and pathways that may be of value in treating disease. They also  conduct preclinical and clinical testing of drugs (phase 1 and 2 trials).  Industry conducts more extensive clinical trials (phase 3 trials) and  markets the drugs, although there is some overlap in these roles. NIH\u2019s  overall mission and authority, as well as the requirements of the Federal  Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, suggest that NIH cannot sponsor a drug  through FDA\u2019s new drug application (NDA) process. This act requires  those who submit NDAs to FDA to provide \u201ca full description of the  methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture,  processing, and packing, of such drug.\u201d While NIH conducts its own  research and funds biomedical research at other institutions, it does not  have a manufacturing, processing, or packing facility.", "NIH can, however, license inventions directly to pharmaceutical firms  without the necessity of working through a CRADA. For example, NIH  officials told us that of the 16 drugs and vaccines currently approved by  FDA that contain an NIH technology, only 3 involved a CRADA. To attract  private-sector partners, NIH publicizes the availability of technologies that  it seeks to license directly. NIH officials told us that it has entered into  CRADAs with private-sector partners in at least two other cases that were  similar to paclitaxel\u2014naturally occurring substances for which shortages  had limited NIH\u2019s ability to conduct research.", "The Public Health Service (PHS) created a model CRADA because the  Federal Technology Transfer Act of 1986 provided few specifics about the  CRADA process. In general, the model CRADA sets forth the policies of  NIH and other PHS agencies on various aspects of cooperative research  and intellectual property licensing that derive from the Federal  Technology Transfer Act. The model CRADA has been updated several  times over the years. The 1991 CRADA between NIH and BMS referred to a  March 27, 1989, version of the model CRADA. The 1989 model CRADA  stated that NIH would be willing to grant exclusive licenses to its CRADA  collaborators. The 1989 model CRADA also contained a provision known  as the \u201creasonable price clause.\u201d It stated that PHS has \u201ca concern that  there be a reasonable relationship between the pricing of a licensed  product, the public investment in that product, and the health and safety  needs of the public. Accordingly, exclusive commercialization licenses  granted for  intellectual property rights may require that this  relationship be supported by reasonable evidence.\u201d NIH dropped the  reasonable pricing clause in 1995, and the current version of the model  CRADA no longer has any stipulation regarding the pricing of products  that are developed under the CRADA.", "Under federal law and NIH policy, royalty income from license agreements  is shared between the inventors and the institute or center within NIH in  which the technology was developed. NIH uses the royalties for multiple  purposes that contribute to the technology transfer program and the  research of its laboratories. Specifically, the royalty payments can be used  to (1) reward employees of the laboratory, (2) further scientific exchange  among the laboratories of the agency, (3) educate and train employees of  the agency or laboratory, (4) support other activities that increase the  potential for transfer of the technology of the laboratories of the agency,  (5) pay expenses incidental to the administration and licensing of  intellectual property by the agency or laboratory, and (6) support scientific  research and development consistent with the research and development  missions and objectives of the laboratory.", "Federal laws also generally prohibit agencies from disclosing information  that concerns or relates to trade secrets, processes, operations, statistical  information, and related information. Therefore the federal technology  transfer process that NIH engages in with the private sector is not entirely  transparent to the general public, nor are the details of the negotiations  and agreements that NIH makes with industry partners publicly known.  However, information may be disclosed to those who have oversight  authority over the agencies that generate such information, such as the  Congress and its oversight bodies.

However, the 1991 CRADA did not require that reasonable evidence be  presented to show that this would occur. In its comments on a draft of  this report, NIH stated it gathered other evidence to reach its conclusion  that the price of Taxol was reasonable. NIH also entered into a CRADA  with another company to develop a product that could provide  competition for Taxol (see CRADA 148 in app. II).

Medicare payments for Taxol totaled $687 million from  1994 through 1999, the last full year of marketing exclusivity for Taxol.  Medicare payments for Taxol were $202 million in 1999, accounting for  more than one-fifth of Taxol\u2019s total domestic sales. Medicare\u2019s payments  reflect, in part, the price it pays for Taxol. Compared to other federal  programs, Medicare pays relatively more for Taxol than it does for other  widely used cancer drugs. To assess the pricing of Taxol, we reviewed the  price Medicare pays for Taxol and other cancer drugs compared to the  prices paid by federal programs that directly procure these drugs. We  found that in the fourth quarter of 2002, Medicare paid 6.6 times the price  these other federal programs paid for Taxol, while it paid an average of 3.0  times the price these other federal programs paid for other widely used  cancer drugs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Affected NIH\u2019s Exercise of Its Broad Authority in Technology Transfer Activities Related to the Development of Taxol", "paragraphs": ["Although NIH has broad authority under applicable statutes to negotiate  CRADAs and license agreements with outside partners, several factors  affected its exercise of that authority in the technology transfer activities  related to the development of Taxol. Such negotiations involve a weighing  of NIH\u2019s goals and priorities with those of a potential partner, recognizing  that tradeoffs may be necessary to reach an agreement. In the case of  Taxol, NIH\u2019s ability to exercise its authority was limited because it did not  have a patent on paclitaxel and because its evaluation found that there  was a shortage of available, qualified alternative CRADA partners. With  regard to the license negotiations on the inventions resulting from the  CRADA, the setting of royalties was affected by the criteria that both NIH  and BMS used to help guide royalty negotiations. BMS officials told us that  NIH\u2019s inventions did not contribute to BMS\u2019s successful marketing of  Taxol."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "NIH\u2019s Negotiating Position for the CRADA Was Potentially Affected by Its Lack of a Patent on Paclitaxel and by the Shortage of Qualified Alternative Partners", "paragraphs": ["One factor affecting NIH\u2019s CRADA negotiating position is its ability to  offer a potential partner exclusive marketing rights to an invention. In its  paclitaxel negotiations, NIH\u2019s position was affected by the fact that it did  not have a patent on paclitaxel. As NIH acknowledged in the 1991  CRADA, because of this NIH was unable to grant any potential partner an  exclusive patent license to market paclitaxel. NIH was able to offer  potential partners access to the findings of the research it conducted prior  to the CRADA and to its research during the term of the CRADA.", "Another factor affecting the leverage that NIH has in negotiating a CRADA  is the availability of other qualified applicants. If NIH were to be  dissatisfied with the CRADA negotiations with an applicant, it  theoretically could turn to another applicant and begin new negotiations,  accepting the inherent delays. It also could seek multiple CRADA partners,  recognizing that multiple partners may grant less favorable terms than one  receiving an exclusive agreement. In the case of paclitaxel, it was  advantageous for NIH to enter into a CRADA with an industry partner  qualified to bring paclitaxel to the marketplace and to provide an adequate  supply of paclitaxel for its work. NIH received four applications from  potential CRADA partners. Using nine criteria to rank applications,  including that an applicant have experience with both natural products  and other drug development and be able to supply adequate amounts of  the drug as needed for future clinical trials (see app. I), NIH reviewers  scored the BMS application substantially higher than all of the others.  While some concerns were raised about the BMS application, greater  concerns were raised about other applications. For example, the applicant  that received the second-highest score was cited as having no experience  in the United States involving natural products and no experience in  developing pharmaceutical agents in the United States and as providing  incomplete responses, especially on how it would make Taxol available  and how much it could supply annually."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "License Negotiations under the CRADA Resulted in Royalty Payments to NIH", "paragraphs": ["Applicable law does not restrict the royalty rate NIH can negotiate in a  license agreement, although NIH\u2019s model CRADA at the time of the Taxol  negotiations suggested that a ceiling be set at 5 to 8 percent. This  specification has since been removed, and the current model CRADA sets  no ceiling. By law, NIH is required to offer its CRADA partners the option  to choose an exclusive license for any inventions that arise from the  CRADA work. NIH is not prohibited from specifying in the CRADA what  the royalty rate will be, rather than waiting until a subsequent license  agreement is negotiated.", "When NIH and BMS entered into the license agreement 5 years after the  1991 CRADA took effect, how the parties viewed the benefits of an  agreement likely affected the royalty rate negotiations. NIH officials  indicated that they generally take eight factors into account in negotiating  royalty rates. These include the stage of product development, the type of  product, the market value of the product, the uniqueness of the materials,  the scope of the patent coverage, the market timing, NIH\u2019s contribution to  the product, and the public health benefit. An NIH OTT official reported  that the ultimate determination of a royalty rate is not the result of a neat  formula but is based on a balancing of these factors, with the public health  benefit receiving the highest consideration. In contrast, BMS officials told  us that the company considers three factors when negotiating royalty  rates: scientific risk, coverage, and exclusivity. In the case of Taxol, a BMS  official reported that the company determined it had high scientific risk  (i.e., it did not know if the inventions would be successful), narrow  coverage (i.e., the license was for very specific ways of treating a tumor),  and a lack of exclusivity (i.e., the treatment regimens BMS licensed would  not prevent other firms from marketing generic paclitaxel after BMS\u2019s  period of marketing exclusivity expired), all making the inventions less  valuable.", "In general, NIH\u2019s leverage in negotiating royalty rates is affected by the  amount of competition for a license. In 2000, NIH\u2019s director of OTT  testified that the vast majority of NIH inventions require active marketing  and more often than not only one firm is generally interested in licensing  any particular type of technology. In fiscal year 2000, there were 45  requests for exclusive licenses, and only 2 technologies had two  applications for licenses each. For nonexclusive license requests, there  were 253 requests, and only 31 had more than one application. NIH\u2019s  director of OTT reported that, at that time, OTT had approximately 2,000  technologies available for licensing, 30 percent of which had been  available for more than 5 years. In the case of Taxol, it is not clear whether  other companies would have been interested in the inventions developed  out of the CRADA, as BMS had exclusive rights to market paclitaxel at that  time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["From the perspectives of NIH and BMS, the 1991 CRADA is an example of  a successful collaboration between the public and private sectors in  pharmaceutical technology transfer. Early studies supported by NIH on  the clinical effectiveness of Taxol and made available to BMS under the  CRADA were critical to BMS\u2019s success in rapidly commercializing its  brand-name drug Taxol for the treatment of cancer. The additional  supplies of the scarce paclitaxel provided by BMS to NIH under the  CRADA were critical for the expansion of NIH\u2019s research.", "NIH\u2019s goals in the technology transfer process emphasize public health  benefits over financial considerations. In the case of Taxol, the benefit to  public health was clearly demonstrated, as there were few treatments for  women with ovarian or breast cancer when Taxol came on the market.  However the financial return to NIH was more limited. NIH made a  substantial investment in the development of Taxol. In return, NIH  received royalty payments of about $35 million from its license agreement  with BMS, and received paclitaxel and financial support from BMS for the  CRADA research. We noted that the federal government has spent over  half a billion dollars in payments to health care providers for Taxol under  the Medicare program. In light of the significant federal investment,  questions remain regarding the extent to which NIH used its broad  authority in its negotiations with BMS on the royalty payments and the  price of the drug to obtain the best value for the government."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency and Bristol- Myers Squibb Company Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NIH and BMS for their review.

NIH acknowledged that the 1991  CRADA did not require that evidence be presented to assure that Taxol  was reasonably priced; however, NIH states that its analysis of other  information led it to conclude that Taxol was fairly priced. In response, we  have incorporated the new information from NIH into the report as  appropriate. However, we were not able to evaluate the basis for NIH\u2019s  judgment that Taxol was fairly priced.

BMS also  expressed two concerns about our analysis of the price of Taxol to  Medicare relative to other cancer drugs. First, BMS suggested that our  analysis may include payments to physicians for administering the drugs in  addition to the procurement price of the drugs. However, our analysis  considered only the prices for drug procurement and did not include  payments for physician services. Second, BMS suggested that our findings  may change if our analysis excluded generic drugs and was restricted to  brand name drugs. However, only 2 of the 12 comparison drugs in our  analysis are generic drugs and our findings do not change if they are  excluded.
