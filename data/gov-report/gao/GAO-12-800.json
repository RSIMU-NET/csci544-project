In 2011, the DNI reported that over 4.8 million federal government and contractor employees held or were eligible for a clearance. To safeguard classified data and manage costs, agencies need an effective process to determine whether civilian positions require a clearance. GAO was asked to examine the extent to which the executive branch has established policies and procedures for agencies to use when (1) first determining if federal civilian positions require a security clearance and (2) reviewing and revising or validating existing federal civilian position security clearance requirements. GAO reviewed executive orders and the Code of Federal Regulations and met with officials from ODNI and OPM because of their Directors\u0092 assigned roles as Security and Suitability executive agents, as well as DHS and DOD based on the volume of clearances they process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Director of National Intelligence (DNI), as Security Executive Agent, has not provided agencies clearly defined policy and procedures to consistently determine if a position requires a security clearance. Executive Order 13467 assigns DNI responsibility for, among other things, developing uniform and consistent policies to determine eligibility for access to classified information, and gives the DNI authority to issue guidance to agency heads to ensure uniformity in processes relating to those determinations. In the absence of this guidance, agencies are using an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) tool that OPM designed to determine the sensitivity and risk levels of civilian positions which, in turn, inform the type of investigation needed. OPM audits, however, found inconsistency in these position designations, and some agencies described problems in implementing OPM\u0092s tool. In an April 2012 audit, OPM reviewed the sensitivity levels of 39 positions in an agency within the Department of Defense (DOD) and reached different conclusions than the agency for 26 of them. Problems exist, in part, because OPM and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) did not collaborate on the development of the position designation tool, and because their roles for suitability\u0097consideration of character and conduct for federal employment\u0097and security clearance reform are still evolving. Without guidance from the DNI, and without collaboration between the DNI and OPM in future revisions to the tool, executive branch agencies will continue to risk making security clearance determinations that are inconsistent or at improper levels.", "The DNI also has not established guidance to require agencies to review and revise or validate existing federal civilian position designations. Executive Order 12968 says each agency shall request or grant clearance determinations, subject to certain exceptions, based on a demonstrated need for access, and keep to a minimum the number of employees that it determines are eligible for access to classified information. The order also states that access to classified information shall be terminated when an employee no longer has a need for access, and prohibits agencies from requesting or approving eligibility in excess of actual requirements for access. During this review of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and DOD components, GAO found that agency officials were aware of the need to keep the number of security clearances to a minimum, but were not always required to conduct periodic reviews and validations of the security clearance needs of existing positions. Overdesignating positions results in significant cost implications, given that the fiscal year 2012 base price for a top secret clearance investigation conducted by OPM is $4,005, while the base price of a secret clearance is $260. Conversely, underdesignating positions could lead to security risks. GAO found that the agencies follow varying practices because the DNI has not established guidance that requires executive branch agencies to review and revise or validate position designations on a recurring basis. Without such a requirement, executive branch agencies may be hiring and budgeting for initial and periodic security clearance investigations using position descriptions and security clearance requirements that no longer reflect national security needs. Further, since reviews are not done consistently, DHS and DOD and other executive branch agencies cannot have assurances that they are keeping the number of positions that require security clearances to a minimum."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the DNI issue clearly defined policy for agencies to follow when determining if federal civilian positions require a security clearance, and that the DNI and Director of OPM collaborate to revise the existing position designation tool.

Within DHS, selected components included the U.S. Coast  Guard, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the  Transportation Security Administration. Within DOD, selected  components included the headquarters-level elements of the  Departments of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Washington  Headquarters Services, which provides human capital support for several  nonservice DOD agencies and activities. For our first objective, to  examine the extent to which the executive branch has established  policies and procedures for agencies to use when first determining  whether federal civilian positions require a security clearance, we  interviewed key officials from the above-mentioned federal departments  and selected components, as well as OPM and ODNI. In addition, we  reviewed relevant Executive Orders including 10450, 12968, and 13467,  Joint Reform Team reports, and part 732 of Title 5 of the Code of  Federal Regulations. We also obtained and analyzed personnel security  clearance policies within DHS, DOD, and the selected components within  these departments.

For our second objective, to examine the  extent to which the executive branch has policies and procedures for  agencies to review and revise or validate existing federal civilian position  security clearance requirements, we held meetings with knowledgeable  officials from DHS, DOD, OPM, and ODNI. In addition, we reviewed part  732 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Part 732 establishes three sensitivity  levels\u2014special-sensitive, critical-sensitive, and noncritical-sensitive\u2014 which are described in figure 1. According to OPM, positions that an  agency designates as special-sensitive and critical-sensitive require a  background investigation that typically results in a top secret clearance.  Noncritical-sensitive positions typically require an investigation that  supports a secret or confidential clearance. OPM also defines non- sensitive positions that do not have a national security element, but still  require a designation of risk for suitability purposes.

For example, the Department of Justice  checks suitability to ensure that applicants for jobs with the Drug  Enforcement Agency have never used illegal drugs. In addition, Health  and Human Services checks the suitability of applicants for jobs working  with children. Similarly, the Intelligence Community requires polygraph  evaluations, among other things, to determine suitability for most  intelligence positions.

In most agencies outside the Intelligence  Community, OPM conducts the background investigations for both  suitability and security clearance purposes. The tool does not directly  determine whether a position requires a clearance, but rather helps  determine the sensitivity level of the position. The determination to grant a  clearance is based on whether a position requires access to classified  information or other relevant factors, and, if access is required, the  responsible official will designate the position to require a clearance.", "OPM developed the position designation system and automated tool for  multiple reasons. First, OPM determined through a 2007 initiative that  its existing regulations and guidance for position designation were  complex and difficult to apply, resulting in inconsistent designations. As a  result of a recommendation from the initiative, OPM created a simplified  position designation process in 2008. Additionally, OPM officials noted  that the tool is to support the goals of the security and suitability reform  efforts, which require proper designation of national security and  suitability positions.", "OPM first introduced the automated tool in November 2008, and issued  an update of the tool in 2010. In August 2010, OPM issued guidance      (1) recommending all agencies that request OPM background  investigations use the tool and (2) requiring agencies to use the tool for all  positions in the competitive service, positions in the excepted service  where the incumbent can be noncompetitively converted to the  competitive service, and career appointments in the Senior Executive  Service. Both DHS and DOD components use the tool. A DHS instruction  requires personnel to designate all DHS positions by using OPM\u2019s  position sensitivity designation guidance, which is the basis of the tool. In addition, DOD issued guidance in September 2011 requiring its  personnel to use OPM\u2019s tool to determine the proper position sensitivity  designation for new or vacant positions, including the establishment and  reclassification of positions. ODNI officials told us that they believe OPM\u2019s  tool is useful for determining a position\u2019s sensitivity level. However,  despite the DNI\u2019s responsibility for policy related to ensuring uniformity in  the security clearance process, ODNI officials noted that the DNI did not  have input into recent revisions of OPM\u2019s position designation tool.", "DHS Management Instruction 121-01-007, Department of Homeland Security Personnel  Suitability and Security Program (June 2009). the DNI as Executive Agents are still evolving, although Executive Order  13467 defines responsibilities for each Executive Agent. Accordingly, we  found that the Director of OPM and the DNI have not fully collaborated in  executing their respective roles in the process for determining position  designations. For example, OPM has had long-standing responsibility for  establishing standards with respect to suitability for most federal  government positions. Accordingly, the sections of the tool to be used for  evaluating a position\u2019s suitability risk level are significantly more detailed  than the sections designed to aid in designating the national security  sensitivity level of the position. While most of OPM\u2019s position designation  system, which is the basis of the tool, is devoted to suitability issues, only  two pages are devoted to national security issues, despite the reference  to national security in its title. Moreover, OPM did not seek to collaborate  with the DNI when updating the tool in 2010. Similarly, in 2010, OPM  initiated revisions to the part of the Code of Federal Regulations that   According to OPM and ODNI  pertain to national security positions.officials, the revision is expected to clarify the standards for designating  whether federal positions are national security sensitive, which will help  agencies more accurately assess the sensitivity of a position. The  sensitivity level includes consideration of whether a position is eligible for  access to classified information and the level of access. Further, the  revision is currently expected to update the definition of national security  positions to include positions that could have a material impact on  national security, but might not clearly fall within the current definition in  part 732 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations. For example, such  positions include those with duties that involve the protection of borders,  ports, and critical infrastructure, as well as those with responsibilities  related to public safety, law enforcement, and the protection of  government information systems.", "During our review, human capital and security officials from DHS and  DOD and the selected components affirmed that they were using the  existing tool to determine the sensitivity level required by a position.  However, in the absence of clearly defined policy from the DNI and the  lack of collaborative input into the tool\u2019s design, officials explained that  they sometimes had difficulty in using the tool to designate the sensitivity  level of national security positions.", "OPM regularly conducts audits of its executive branch customer agency  personnel security and suitability programs, which include a review of  position designation to assess the agencies\u2019 alignment with OPM\u2019s  position designation guidance. In the audit reports we obtained, OPM  found examples of inconsistency between agency position designation  and OPM guidance, both before and after the implementation of OPM\u2019s  tool. For instance, prior to the implementation of the tool, in a 2006 audit  of an executive branch agency, OPM found that its sensitivity  designations differed from the agency\u2019s designation in 13 of 23 positions.  Specifically, OPM concluded that 11 positions were underdesignated,       1 position was overdesignated, and 1 position was adjusted. More  recently, after the implementation of the tool, in an April 2012 audit of a  DOD agency, OPM assessed the sensitivity levels of 39 positions, and  OPM\u2019s designations differed from the agency\u2019s designations in 26 of  those positions. In the April 2012 report, the DOD agency agreed with  OPM\u2019s recommendations related to position designation, and the audit  report confirmed that the agency had submitted evidence of corrective  action in response to the position designation recommendations. OPM  provided us with the results of 10 audits that it had conducted between  2005 and 2012, and 9 of those audit reports reflected inconsistencies  between OPM position designation guidance and determinations of  position sensitivity conducted by the agency. OPM officials noted,  however, that they do not have the authority to direct agencies to make  different designations because Executive Order 10450 provides agency  heads with the ultimate responsibility for designating which positions are  sensitive positions.", "As of May 2012, the Naval Audit Service is currently finalizing its own  internal audit on its top secret requirements determination process for  civilian positions. While the results were not complete at the time of our  review, officials explained to us that they began this audit to validate their  top secret requirements and ensure that they have effective internal  controls over their designation process.", "DHS and DOD officials expressed varying opinions regarding the tool. For  instance, some of the officials we met raised concerns regarding the  guidance provided through the tool and expressed that they had difficulty  implementing it. Specifically, officials from DHS\u2019s U.S. Immigration and  Customs Enforcement stated that the use of the tool occasionally resulted  in inconsistency, such as over- or underdesignating a position, and  expressed a need for additional clear, easily interpreted guidance on  designating national security positions. DOD officials stated that they  have had difficulty implementing the tool because it focuses more on  suitability than security, and the national security aspects of DOD\u2019s  positions are of more concern to them than the suitability aspects.  Further, an official from DOD\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness stated that the tool and DOD policy do not  always align and that the tool does not cover the requirements for some  DOD positions. For example, DOD\u2019s implementing guidance on using the  tool states that terms differ between DOD\u2019s personnel security policy and  the tool, and the tool might suggest different position sensitivity levels  than DOD policy requires. Also, officials from the Air Force Personnel  Security Office told us that they had challenges using the tool to classify  civilian positions, including difficulty in linking the tool with Air Force  practices for position designation. Moreover, an Air Force official stated a  concern that the definition for national security positions is broadly written  and could be considered to include all federal positions. Further,  individuals responsible for making position designation determinations  can easily reach different conclusions. For instance, officials from DHS\u2019s  U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement stated that the tool is not  necessarily intuitive and users of the tool need to understand its nuances  in order to avoid overdesignating a position. Conversely, officials from the  U.S. Coast Guard stated that they found the tool to be intuitive, and that it  helps to ensure consistency in designation. Finally, officials from the  Transportation Security Administration noted that the tool is user friendly  and provides consistency for managers.", "Recently, we have seen indications that the Executive Agents are working  to align their respective processes.

When a position is  overdesignated, additional resources are unnecessarily spent conducting  the investigation and adjudication of a background investigation that  exceeds agency requirements. As stated earlier in this report, the  investigative workload for a top secret clearance is about 20-times greater  than that of a secret clearance because it must be periodically  reinvestigated twice as often as secret clearance investigations (every 5  years versus every 10 years) and requires 10 times as many investigative  staff hours. The fiscal year 2012 base price for a top secret clearance  investigation conducted by OPM is $4,005 and the periodic  reinvestigation is $2,711, while the base price of an investigation for a  secret clearance is $260. Further, the base price of a Moderate Risk  Background Investigation\u2014most commonly used by DHS, according to  officials\u2014is $752. However, we did not find policies in which position  designation reviews were linked to the position holders\u2019 periodic  reinvestigations. In contrast, underdesignating a position carries security  risks, such as the potential release of classified information or the  placement of a person in a position for which they have not been properly  cleared.", "Agencies employ varying practices because the DNI has not established  a requirement that executive branch agencies consistently review and  revise or validate existing position designations on a recurring basis.  Such a recurring basis could include reviewing position designations  during the periodic reinvestigation process. Without a requirement to  consistently review, revise, or validate existing security clearance position  designations, executive branch agencies\u2014such as DHS and DOD\u2014may  be hiring and budgeting for both initial and periodic security clearance  investigations using position descriptions and security clearance  requirements that no longer reflect national security needs.

The DNI has a lead  or collaborative role in our recommendations, and ODNI concurred with  all three. First, ODNI concurred with our recommendation that the DNI, in  coordination with the Director of OPM and other executive branch  agencies as appropriate, issue clearly defined policy and procedures for  federal agencies to follow when determining if federal civilian positions  require a security clearance. ODNI agreed that executive branch  agencies require simplified and uniform policy guidance to assist in  determining appropriate sensitivity designations, and cited steps it is  taking in coordination with OPM, DOD, and OMB. Specifically, ODNI  acknowledged its work with OMB and OPM to jointly issue revisions to  part 732 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations by the end of 2012.   Second, ODNI concurred with our recommendation that, once the policy  and procedures are issued, the DNI coordinate with the Director of OPM  to revise the position designation tool to reflect that guidance. ODNI  stated that it plans to work with OPM and other executive branch  agencies through the Security Executive Agent Advisory Committee to  develop a position designation tool that provides detailed descriptions of  the types of positions where the occupant could bring about a material  adverse impact to national security due to the duties and responsibilities  of the position. ODNI stated its belief that a tool that provides agencies  with detailed descriptions of this type will bring about greater uniformity  across the government in agency position designations. Third, ODNI  concurred with our recommendation that the DNI, in coordination with the  Director of OPM and other executive branch agencies as appropriate,  issue guidance to require executive branch agencies to periodically  review and revise or validate the designation of all federal civilian  positions. ODNI agreed with our assessment that the duties and  responsibilities of federal positions may be subject to change, and stated  that it plans to work with OPM and other executive branch agencies  through the Security Executive Agent Advisory Committee to ensure that  position designation policies and procedures include a provision for  periodic reviews.", "While ODNI recognized that the emphasis of this report is on civilian  positions that require access to classified information, it wished to  emphasize that the DNI\u2019s role as Security Executive Agent under  Executive Order 13467 applies to all sensitive positions, and that  positions that require access to classified information are a subset of all  sensitive positions.

OPM concurred with our second  recommendation, which is addressed more directly to OPM, that its  Director collaborate with the DNI in their respective roles as executive  agents to revise the position designation tool to reflect updated federal  position designation guidance. OPM stated that it committed to doing so  in a February 2010 strategic framework document which was executed by  officials within OMB, OPM, DOD, and ODNI. OPM also acknowledged  that any revisions to the tool need to await final action with respect to  proposed position designation regulations, which is consistent with our  recommendation. In addition, OPM summarized executive orders that  describe its authority. OPM also supported our third recommendation that  the DNI, in coordination with the Director of OPM and other executive  branch agencies as appropriate, issue guidance to require executive  branch agencies to periodically review and revise or validate the  designation of all federal civilian positions. OPM stated that it would be  pleased to work with the DNI on guidance concerning periodic reviews of  existing designations.", "While ODNI concurred with our first recommendation\u2014that the DNI, in  coordination with the Director of OPM and other executive branch  agencies as appropriate, issue clearly defined policy and procedures for  federal agencies to follow when determining whether federal civilian  positions require a security clearance\u2014OPM stated that it is not clear to  OPM that it has a significant role in prescribing the policy and procedures  for federal agencies to follow when determining if a federal civilian  position requires a security clearance. The basis for OPM\u2019s statement is  Executive Order 12968 (as amended by Executive Order 13467), which  gives agency heads the ultimate responsibility to grant or deny security  clearances, subject to investigative standards and adjudicative guidelines  prescribed by the DNI. In this report, we acknowledge that authority to  grant or deny a security clearance resides with agency heads under  Executive Order 12968. However, as we also state in our report,  Executive Order 13467 provides the DNI the authority to issue guidelines  and instructions to the heads of agencies to ensure appropriate  uniformity, centralization, efficiency, effectiveness, and timeliness in  processes relating to determinations by agencies of eligibility for access  to classified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. Further,  as we state in our report, this Executive Order established a Suitability  and Security Clearance Performance Accountability Council to be the  government-wide governance structure responsible for driving  implementation and overseeing security and suitability reform efforts. This  order appointed the DNI as the Security Executive Agent and the Director  of OPM as the Suitability Executive Agent, and calls for investigations of  suitability and security to be aligned using consistent standards, to the  extent practicable. Therefore, we continue to believe that additional  guidance from the Security Executive Agent\u2014the DNI\u2014would help align  processes across multiple executive branch agencies, and note that  ODNI agreed with this assessment. Further, we included OPM in our  recommendation as a consulting agency in its role as the Suitability  Executive Agent and because, according to OPM, it is the investigative  service provider for much of the executive branch. Finally, we  recommended that the DNI work with other agencies as necessary in an  acknowledgement of the joint nature of reform effort and its oversight  structure through the Performance Accountability Council.", "OPM\u2019s response to this report discussed other points for consideration,  which are summarized below.", "Relationship between the existing position designation tool and security  clearances: OPM stated in its comments that one of the premises upon  which this report is based is not accurate. Specifically, OPM asserted that  we repeatedly posited that agencies must perform the national security  designation in order to know whether the occupant will require a security  clearance when, in fact, whether the occupant of a particular position will  need access to classified information or eligibility for such access (i.e. a  security clearance) is one of the factors that help determine whether a  position is sensitive. Accordingly, OPM wrote that there is no basis for  GAO to conclude that OPM\u2019s position designation tool affects how  agencies determine whether the occupant of a position requires access to  classified information or eligibility for such access. We state in our report  that to assist with position designation, the Director of OPM has  developed a process that includes a position designation system and  corresponding tool. We continue by stating that the tool does not directly  determine whether a position requires a clearance, but rather helps  determine the sensitivity of the position, which informs the type of  investigation needed. We believe that these statements are consistent  with OPM\u2019s explanations and, therefore, do not believe that one of the  premises upon which this report is based is inaccurate. However, we  have reviewed and made revisions to other statements in our final report  to ensure consistency with this point.", "Additional need for guidance to support the position designation tool:  OPM noted that it provided us with copies of audits that OPM had  performed on agencies that employ competitive service civilian personnel,  where it observed inconsistencies in agency application of the tool. In its  comments, OPM cited several reasons why this might happen. We  believe this is consistent with our findings that OPM found examples of  inconsistency between agency position designation and OPM guidance,  and also that officials from executive branch departments expressed  varying opinions to us regarding the tool. In response to other discussion  in our report about the tool, OPM stated that its proposed revision to part  732 of Title 5 of the Code of Federal Regulations was intended to  establish a basis for more detailed guidance.

However, often the security clearance\u2014either at the secret or top secret  level\u2014does not become effective until an individual needs to work with  classified information. At that point, the individual would sign a  nondisclosure agreement and receive a briefing in order for the clearance  to become effective.
