The law, as amended, established  a three-tier structure of committees to advise the President on overall U.S.  trade policy, general policy areas, and technical aspects of trade  agreements. Among other things, the law requires the President to consult  with these committees on a continuing and timely basis. Four agencies, led  by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, currently administer the  committee system. Legislation recently passed by Congress granted the  President trade promotion authority to negotiate trade agreements\u2014 previously known as \u201cfast track\u201d negotiating authority\u2014and renewed  lapsed portions of the advisory committee system\u2019s mandate. However,  committee members and executive branch officials participating in the  system have voiced concerns about the current system\u2019s operation and  readiness to support trade policy.", "In light of these concerns, as well as the launch of a major round of trade  talks at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and accelerating negotiations  for regional free trade, you asked us to examine the role, structure, and  operations of the trade advisory committee system to ensure that it is still  poised to meet the objectives set by Congress. In this report, we examine  (1) the system\u2019s value to U.S. trade policy, (2) participants\u2019 level of  satisfaction with specific aspects of the consultation process as well as  aspects that participants said could be improved, (3) the degree to which  the system matches the current U.S. economy and supports U.S. trade  policy needs, and (4) the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative\u2019s (USTR)  and the other agencies\u2019 management of the system.", "To address these issues, we surveyed 720 of the 735 committee members  about their experiences in the system; conducted 168 interviews with  every type of participant in the committee process, including selected  committee chairs, members, U.S. negotiators involved in key trade  initiatives, other executive branch officials, nongovernmental interest  groups, and trade experts; and analyzed data and documents relevant to  committee mandates, procedures, activities, membership, economic size,  and trade flows.

Congress established the trade  advisory committee system in Section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974 as a  way to institutionalize domestic input into such U.S. trade negotiations  from interested parties outside the federal government. This system was  considered necessary because of complaints from some in the business  community about their limited and ad hoc role in previous negotiations.  The 1974 law created a system of committees through which such advice,  along with advice from labor and consumer groups, was to be sought.", "In practice, USTR has primary responsibility within the executive branch  for developing U.S. trade policy, and the President has delegated to USTR  the role of leading the trade advisory committee process. Additional  players in developing U.S. trade policy include other executive branch  agencies, particularly the departments of Commerce and Agriculture; the  private sector, including business and nonbusiness groups; and state and  local governments. USTR also maintains close consultation with Congress.  The advisory committee system is one of several ways that USTR obtains  input from the private sector (see fig. 1). In fact, Section 135 of the Trade  Act also requires USTR to provide an opportunity to private organizations  or groups outside the advisory committee system to present their views on  trade issues.", "The system, created in 1974, was originally intended to provide private  sector input to global trade negotiations occurring at that time (the Tokyo  Round). Since then, the original legislation has been amended to expand  the scope of topics on which the President is required to seek information  and advice from \u201cnegotiating objectives and bargaining positions before  entering into a trade agreement\u201d to the \u201coperation of any trade agreement,  once entered into,\u201d and on other matters regarding administration of U.S.  trade policy. The legislation has also been amended to include additional  interests within the advisory committee structure, such as those  represented by the services sector and state and local governments. Finally,  the amended legislation requires the executive branch to inform the  committees of \u201csignificant departures\u201d from their advice.", "The trade advisory committees are subject to the requirements of the  Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), with limited exceptions  pertaining to holding public meetings and public availability of documents.  One of FACA\u2019s requirements is that advisory committees be fairly balanced  in terms of points of view represented and the functions the committees  perform. FACA covers most federal advisory committees and includes a  number of administrative requirements, such as requiring rechartering of  committees if they are to continue for more than 2 years.", "The structure of the trade advisory committee system consists of three  tiers, with the top tier directed by law to provide \u201coverall policy advice,\u201d the  second tier to provide \u201cgeneral policy advice,\u201d and the third tier to provide  \u201ctechnical advice and information.\u201d However, Section 135 of the Trade Act  does not establish any formal relationship among these tiers, nor does it  authorize the first tier to exercise any control over the other two. USTR,  working jointly with the other relevant executive departments, has the  discretion to create, change, and terminate committees in the second and  third tiers.", "The system comprises about 735 advisers spread across 34 committees,  with the bulk of the advisers and committees in the third, technical tier.  This tier consists of 17 industry sector advisory committees (ISACs), 4  industry functional advisory committees (IFACs), a committee of ISAC and  IFAC chairpersons, and 5 agricultural technical advisory committees  (ATACs). The second tier currently consists of five policy advisory  committees. The first tier consists of just one committee, the Advisory  Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations (ACTPN), whose members  are appointed by the President. Figure 2 illustrates the committee  structure.", "The advisory committees are administered by USTR, which assumes a  leadership role, along with the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and  Labor. USTR is responsible for administering ACTPN and three of the tier-2  Policy Advisory Committees, and shares responsibility with the other  agencies for administering the rest of the committees. The Department of  Commerce co-administers the majority of these committees\u2014the ISACs,  IFACs, and the Committee of Chairs. The Department of Agriculture  (Agriculture) coadministers six others\u2014the ATACs and the tier-2  Agricultural Policy Advisory Committee. The Department of Labor (Labor)  is responsible for coadministering a tier-2 Policy Advisory Committee.

The formal nature of advisory meetings helps ensure that  representatives of the private sector and other groups have regular access  to officials engaged in U.S. trade policy. Further, the system provides  government officials with a body of private sector experts with whom they  can develop an ongoing dialogue. Since USTR\u2019s administrative procedures  for the advisory committees require advisers to obtain security clearances  before participating, the committees offer an environment conducive to  discussing sensitive negotiating information.", "Many participants said the advisory committee system serves an important  role in U.S. trade policy. A former USTR official and current committee  member termed the advisory committee system \u201cone of the great strengths  of U.S. trade policy.\u201d Among the comments made by negotiators whom we  interviewed and members responding to our survey were that the formal  advisory committee system is often preferable to more ad hoc means of  obtaining input because it is institutionalized and seeks to be  representative. Moreover, they said, the system provides assurance to  Congress that domestic interests with a stake in trade matters have a voice  when trade policy is formulated and will support the final agreements. It  thus helps make the executive branch accountable to Congress and,  ultimately, to the American public. According to multiple responses, the  system strengthens the U.S. bargaining position by bringing to bear on-the- ground perspective and information from the private sector that the U.S.  government lacks; establishing a clear set of U.S. priorities and fuller  appreciation of various American interests; and enabling the United States  to present a unified front when it faces foreign nations at the negotiating  table. Without the system, some participants commented, U.S. negotiators  would be operating in a vacuum and businesses would be unable to  effectively resolve with foreign governments issues that only the U.S.  government can pursue. The bottom line, negotiators and members agree,  is that when it works properly, the system results in better trade  agreements. Not only does it help the United States achieve commercial  benefits, it can help keep the trading system vital and responsive to actual  needs.", "Agency officials also cited the system\u2019s value and contributions to U.S.  trade policy. According to USTR, the advisory committee process was  extremely successful during negotiations (1) on China\u2019s accession to the  WTO; (2) multilateral agreements on information technology, financial  services, and basic telecommunications; (3) the Uruguay Round of  negotiations that led to establishment of the WTO; (4) as well as regional  initiatives such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Summit  of the Americas, and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. Of the  27 USTR trade negotiators whom we interviewed, 18 indicated that they  had obtained useful advice from the system, as did most of the 12  Commerce officials we interviewed. They cited numerous specific  situations where advisory committee input had been helpful to  negotiations. For example, an Assistant U.S. Trade Representative  indicated that the advisory committees are playing a vital role in identifying  market-opening priorities for the more than 140 nations currently involved  in WTO negotiations. A Department of Commerce official described a  committee as instrumental in helping monitor implementation of China\u2019s  accession commitments to the WTO. A USDA negotiator said a committee  was helpful in setting the tone regarding the language on tariff reductions  in the comprehensive U.S. agriculture proposal to the WTO. A USTR  negotiator reported that a committee helped develop a position on defining  \u201cinternational standards\u201d in the WTO\u2019s Technical Barriers to Trade  Agreement and helped gain the international community\u2019s support for the  U.S. proposal, expediting acceptance of U.S. goods in foreign markets.", "Committee members also value the advisory committee system and devote  considerable resources to participating in it on a voluntary basis. Just over  one-half of committee members live outside of Washington, D.C., and pay  their own travel expenses to attend committee meetings. Further, when  the Department of Commerce renewed the charter for the ISACs and IFACs  in March 2002, more than 80 percent of those members continued.  Members whom we surveyed highlighted numerous benefits of committee  membership, including access to USTR and other agency officials, insights  into other members\u2019 views, and face-to-face dialogue with all members.  Parties outside the system, such as U.S. subsidiaries of foreign-owned  businesses and nongovernmental organizations (NGO), have sought  representation on the committees, arguing that they should not be  excluded from such an influential system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Executive Branch Consults with Advisory Committees through Formal and Informal Channels", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of committee documents found ample evidence that USTR  and other executive branch agencies are consulting committees on a wide  range of trade initiatives at formal committee meetings. For example,  agendas for the committee meetings during the 3 years leading up to the 4th  WTO Ministerial, held in Doha, Qatar, in November 2001, listed the  ministerial 60 times. Twenty of the advisory committees discussed U.S.  preparations for the ministerial. Also, during fiscal years 1999 through  2001, different elements of the Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement  were listed as items on more than 190 meeting agendas, at meetings of  almost every committee.", "Such scheduled advisory committee meetings, usually held in Washington,  D.C., are the formal channels for the executive branch to consult with the  private sector advisory committees. In fiscal year 2001 there were  approximately 110 formal meetings across the committee system. The  number of meetings varied considerably by committee. The meetings  generally lasted 3 to 5 hours. According to our analysis, about 80 percent of  the meetings for fiscal years 1999 to 2001 were closed to the public.  Negotiators and other trade officials attend portions of the meetings, each  in turn briefing, discussing, and consulting with the committee. The private  sector committee chair and the managing agency\u2019s designated federal  official (DFO) generally schedule meetings and select the agenda topics,  although occasionally negotiators seek out specific committees to consult  on a particular topic. Consultation during meetings is oral, but some  committees send their positions in writing to USTR and the corresponding  secretary or head of the agency. Many committee chairmen said their  committees seek to provide consensus advice, which may include  dissenting opinions. For the first- and second-tier committees, only  classified transcripts were kept until recently. For the third-tier  committees, DFOs prepare classified minutes of closed meetings for  internal committee use only, as well as unclassified public summaries.", "In addition to formal meetings, USTR, Commerce, USDA, and others  informally request advice from committee members through faxes, E-mails,  ad hoc meetings, and teleconferences when they need a rapid response.  However, committee members consulted at ad hoc meetings or through  other means may provide advice only as personal opinions because, in  keeping with FACA rules, formal committee advice generally can only be  provided through formal committee meetings. In some cases, this informal  advice is solicited by a request from a negotiator to the coordinating offices  at USTR and other agencies, which then transmit the request to all advisers.  In other cases, direct contact between negotiators and selected committee  members occurs. Regardless of how contact is initiated, members typically  provide advice directly to the relevant official and no central record is kept.", "Nevertheless, our review of existing agency records indicates that such  informal consultation is active. In fiscal year 2001, USTR scheduled at least  nine ad hoc meetings, mostly teleconferences or in-person meetings, to  which trade advisers were invited an average of 2 to 3 days in advance.  During this same period, USTR and Commerce faxed or E-mailed  approximately 63 requests for advice, usually addressed to the entire  advisory system membership or all of the industry sector and functional  committees; according to our analysis of available data, the advisers had an  average of 7.5 days to respond.

The areas with the lowest levels of satisfaction (very or generally satisfied)  were the executive branch\u2019s response to committee advice (39 percent),  the use of technology to facilitate meetings (39 percent), and the time it  takes to appoint new committee members (16 percent), which had by far  the lowest level of satisfaction.", "Despite reporting general satisfaction with many aspects of the system,  more than a quarter of survey respondents felt that the system has not  realized its potential contribution to U.S. trade policy (see app. IV, question  23). Many members responding to our survey supported actions to improve  committee operations. Through our survey, member interviews, and  document analysis, we identified several problems with the (1) timeliness,  (2) quality, and (3) accountability of consultations between the executive  branch and the committees. These problems have, at times, limited  member input into and influence over trade policy. Some of these problems  were particularly acute for specific issues or committees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consultations Are Not Always Timely because They Occur after Decisions Are Made", "paragraphs": ["The timeliness of consultations was a concern to many advisers, who  stated that consultations sometimes occur too late to affect policy.

Several members  reported that, in the past 5 years, the tendency has been for negotiators to  come to committee meetings and say, \u201cHere is the agreement, what do you  think?\u201d In one case that we documented, the administration did not consult  with the President\u2019s overall policy advisory committee\u2014ACTPN\u2014before  submitting its proposed international trade agenda to Congress, including  the principles to be included in Trade Promotion Authority legislation. The  staff liaisons for ACTPN and TEPAC were only briefed on the matter the  day after the agenda was submitted. Furthermore, the advisory committees  were not consulted before the Clinton administration announced its  decision to pursue a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore. The  announcement provoked considerable concern across the private sector  for a variety of reasons, not least because the original proposed time frame  of completing the negotiations within 6 weeks would have allowed little  time for advisers to provide input.", "Another problem with timeliness cited by members is that certain  committees meet infrequently. USTR, Commerce, and USDA procedures  generally indicate that agency officials are responsible for calling meetings.  The problem of meeting frequency is particularly acute for the first- and  second-tier committees, which averaged 1.7 and 2.5 meetings each year,  compared with the third-tier committees, which met an average of 3.7 times  each year. The ACTPN, which consists of CEO-level advisers and is  designed to provide overall policy advice, met twice in fiscal years 2000 and  2001. It did not meet for more than 16 months between March 2000 and July  2001. During that period, the Jordan Free Trade Agreement\u2014which broke  new ground by including labor and environmental provisions in the text of  a U.S. trade agreement for the first time\u2014was finalized without formal  executive branch consultation with the ACTPN.

For example, Commerce\u2019s and USTR\u2019s procedures and rules for  managing these committees do not address the principle of timeliness or  consulting to the maximum extent feasible. USDA\u2019s procedures also do not  refer to these issues, but in practice, the agency has developed a calendar  of key negotiation events to use in scheduling advisory committee meetings  in an effort to ensure that consultations are timely."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Participants Believe the Quality of Consultations Is Not Always Meaningful", "paragraphs": ["Committee members, agency officials, and negotiators reported several  problems that sometimes affect the quality and meaningfulness of  consultations.

While respondents to our survey were broadly  satisfied with the amount of time spent on presentations by USTR and the  committees\u2019 principal agencies, 42 percent of the respondents reported  that not enough time was devoted to providing advice, 43 percent reported  that not enough time was spent on members\u2019 discussing trade issues, and  39 percent said that not enough time was devoted to presentations by other  executive branch agencies (see table 2). Commerce officials confirmed that  they were aware that the amount of time available for discussion is an  issue, but explained in agency comments that, because of the costs and  travel time associated with ISAC and IFAC meetings and the number of  issues to be discussed, meeting agendas are often packed. Negotiators  stated that this imposes practical constraints on the time devoted to each  agenda item. According to a USDA official, the agency is carefully  reviewing the number of items on committee agendas and scheduling full- day meetings for its ATACs to ensure that there is sufficient time for  member discussion.", "Limited access to certain background documents also affects the quality of  consultations. USTR often provides national security classified and trade  sensitive documents, such as proposed negotiating objectives or text of  draft agreements, to committee members for comment. However, access to  these documents\u2014which are kept in Washington, D.C., in secured reading  rooms\u2014is often not feasible for advisers who live outside of the  Washington, D.C., area, and not always convenient for advisers who work  in Washington. Numerous survey respondents complained that current  arrangements for reviewing such documents are inadequate. Officials and  members said that being able to access documents electronically, such as  through an encoded Internet site, would improve the quality of committee  advice. In agency comments, USTR, Commerce, and USDA indicated they  are exploring options for electronic access, but stressed that safeguarding  sensitive or classified negotiating material must remain paramount.", "Taking a detailed look at these documents is important to members  because it can materially affect negotiating outcomes. A Commerce official  related an example pertaining to the Chile FTA, when ISAC members felt  they had not had an opportunity to look at the negotiating text because it  was put into the reading room at the last minute before a holiday. A  subcommittee of the ISAC (8 to 10 people, mostly lawyers) reviewed the  text line by line at the Commerce reading room and provided numerous  changes to USTR, which were presented to the Chileans.

First,  although Section 135 of the Trade Act requires consultation regarding \u201cthe  development, implementation, and administration\u201d of U.S. trade policy, 30  percent of respondents reported that they were dissatisfied (\u201cvery  dissatisfied\u201d or \u201cgenerally dissatisfied\u201d) with the extent of consultation on  implementation of trade agreements, 26 percent were dissatisfied with  consultation on bilateral trade negotiations, 25 percent were dissatisfied  with consultation on general trade policy issues, and 23 percent were  dissatisfied with consultation on multilateral trade negotiations (see table  3). In one case, the administration prepared and issued, without first  consulting the top-tier committees, a comprehensive report reviewing the  WTO\u2019s operation during its first 5 years, advocating that the United States  should continue participation in the WTO. Advisers were only briefed on  the 126-page report\u2019s contents 5 days after the date it was signed by the  USTR.", "Second, consultations with the tier-1 and tier-2 policy committees have not  been satisfactory, some respondents said.Table 4 illustrates differences in  tiers\u2019 satisfaction rates for selected aspects of committee operations for  those who responded to our survey.", "At the tier 1 ACTPN, as discussed above, lack of meetings and timely  consultation were additional concerns. Although the tier-2 Labor Advisory  Committee\u2019s (LAC) formal steering committee met six times in 1999, six  times in 2000, and three times in 2001, the full committee did not meet at all  between 1994 and 2002. Steering Committee Members whom we  interviewed felt that USTR consulted them more out of obligation rather  than to obtain advice. One member added that USTR has treated the  committee like a \u201cdissent group\u201d and did not provide the same level of  briefings as it did to other advisory committees. Although members singled  out a few USTR negotiators for their willingness to listen to the  committee\u2019s views, USTR acknowledges that it did not even have an official  liaison to the LAC between 1993 and 2001. None of the labor respondents to  our survey reported that they were satisfied with the degree of attention  the executive branch paid to their committee\u2019s issues or the executive  branch\u2019s response to the committee\u2019s advice. Further, members of the tier- 2 Trade and Environment Policy Advisory Committee, comprising business  and environmental interests, generally agreed that the committee had not  been a successful vehicle for addressing environmental aspects of trade  policy. While members and negotiators said that the committee made  significant contributions to the development and implementation of  President Clinton\u2019s executive order regarding the review of environmental  implications of trade agreements, many members cited frustrations over  the committee\u2019s inability to provide advice on other environmental policy  issues. Few recognized environmental organizations still participate in the  committee, and some members reported that the diverse interests  represented in the group meant they had difficulty reaching agreement and  providing clear advice. Finally, despite USTR\u2019s efforts to convene  meetings of the tier-2 committee designed to address the trade issues of  concern to state and local governments, the Intergovernmental Policy  Advisory Committee met only once in fiscal year 2000 and once in fiscal  year 2001, both via telephone conference calls. Both members and  negotiators reported that the lack of regular meetings was a barrier to the  optimal functioning of the committees.", "Third, members and negotiators believe the system\u2019s capacity for cross- fertilization among committees should be strengthened. Although  functional committees on issues such as customs and standards have been  established and are supposed to include representatives from industry  committees, participation by such representatives is reported to be limited.  Many issues\u2014such as antidumping, biotechnology, and transparency in  trade regulation\u2014cut across several committees, but the system\u2019s capacity  to handle them is limited. A negotiator for antidumping, for example,  generally consults only with the ferrous ores and metals committee (ISAC  7), which includes steel, on such matters. Although FACA and Section 135  of the Trade Act do not preclude agencies from consulting with a cross- section of members on such issues, USTR and Commerce have not  generally taken advantage of this opportunity. Consulting with members  from different committees on an ad hoc basis also would not produce the  formal committee advice negotiators prefer. Some mechanisms for cross- fertilization already exist. A Committee of Chairs of the ISACs and IFACs is  empowered to provide collective advice and provide a cross-section of  views. Joint meetings of committees have also been convened. For  example, members of the labor committee reacted favorably to an initiative  by the USTR services negotiator to conduct a joint meeting of the services  and labor committees to discuss the issue of temporary entry of foreign  workers into the United States. Survey respondents supported additional  steps to better address cross-cutting issues, such as sharing meeting  agendas and recommendations\u2014an idea that USDA is exploring."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Officials and Members Indicate Limited Involvement by Some Negotiators", "paragraphs": ["Some agency officials and committee members believe that the quality of  consultations suffers because USTR is not as engaged as it should be with  the advisory process. While 88 percent of the members responding to our  survey supported (\u201cstrongly support\u201d or \u201cgenerally support\u201d) actions to  ensure that USTR officials attend committee meetings on a regular basis  (see app. IV, question 18), we found that some committees have had little  or no contact with USTR. For example, although the head of the USTR  office that manages the advisory committee system said the office works  actively to ensure that USTR\u2019s negotiators consult with the advisory  committees, several DFOs told us that arranging for USTR negotiators to  meet with their committees is one of their most difficult tasks. In one  example, two DFOs said they had never met their USTR liaison, nor had  they been able to arrange for the liaison to attend their committees\u2019  meetings. One of these DFOs added that, despite attempts, they have not  been able to identify anyone at USTR who covers their issues, and,  consequently, no one from USTR has attended the last five committee  meetings. Even obtaining negotiating calendars is difficult, another official  reported, making it hard to ensure that committee meetings are scheduled  to support trade policy demands.", "Our analysis of documents provided by USTR revealed that USTR  negotiators have not been actively working with some committees.  Attendance records do not indicate who was present for what portions of  committee meetings. As a proxy for this data, we reviewed scheduled  speakers at tier-3 committee meetings in fiscal years 1999 to 2001. We  found that, on average, USTR negotiators were scheduled to brief  committees on 42 percent of the topics raised at the meetings. However, for  10 of the tier-3 committees, the USTR negotiators were scheduled to brief  on 32 percent or fewer of the topics discussed. USTR argues that at tier-3  committee meetings the most knowledgeable speaker is often an employee  of another agency, not a USTR official, because that agency works most  closely with the technical information that is important to the committees.    However, a perceived lack of attention by USTR was a source of concern to  some members, who believe that the committee system was intended as a  mechanism for negotiators to obtain advice on trade policy and  agreements. For example, a committee chairman told us that a USTR  negotiator had not been meeting with its committee and put forward a tariff  proposal in ongoing FTA negotiations that placed the committee\u2019s product  in the longest phase-out category. However, because many U.S. producers  now import, the committee actually favors lowering tariffs more rapidly.", "Seven of the 27 USTR negotiators with whom we met stated that they  prefer to obtain advice outside the system because advisory committees  cannot provide the type or quality of advice that they need. For example,  three of the seven negotiators handle bilateral issues with key trading  partners and shared this view. One negotiator said that the committees  could not provide guidance on cross-cutting regulatory issues, so he speaks  to associations or key companies that can provide the necessary advice.  The negotiator also said that the committees generally do not provide  timely, targeted responses orally or on paper. The second negotiator does  not work with the ISACs or IFACs at all and, instead, uses informal  contacts to obtain industry input. She explained that the ISACs are too  broad to assist with the detailed issues she handles in bilateral trade  negotiations. The third negotiator agreed that the ISACs were most useful  when dealing with major, comprehensive negotiations like the Uruguay  trade round. She had not used the system very much in the past 4 years and  stated that, in her opinion, the system was not designed to handle the  specific disputes, often involving litigation, that dominate bilateral trade  relations.   One of the two USTR agriculture negotiators we interviewed  said the committees these negotiators work with often fail to advance  policy because they do not narrow differences among members\u2019 competing  interests. A senior industry negotiator, meanwhile, indicated that the  wealth of information she obtains through informal channels is more  helpful than advisory committee input."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Consultation Process Provides Limited Accountability and Means to Ensure Consideration and Use of Advice", "paragraphs": ["The committee system provides limited accountability to ensure that  committee positions on trade negotiating objectives are considered, as  called for in Section 135 of the Trade Act. Prior to January 15, 1994, trade  advisory committees affected by certain bilateral or multilateral trade  negotiations were required to report to the President, Congress, and USTR  at the conclusion of negotiations. This requirement was linked to  legislation that gave the President the authority to negotiate certain trade  agreements and submit them for congressional approval under expedited  legislative procedures. The reporting requirement lapsed when the  negotiating authority expired in 1994 and was not renewed until the recent  passage of the Trade Act of 2002, which granted the President Trade  Promotion Authority. According to a former USTR official, this lapsed  requirement was an essential element in the trade advisory committee  process because it assured Congress that the executive branch had sought  and considered private sector advice. Without this reporting requirement,  there was limited accountability in the advisory committee system.", "Moreover, mechanisms for tracking and distributing committee advice to  senior agency officials are not routine or reliable. Instead, agency officials  report that advice is transmitted through diffuse channels that range from  formal to informal. At the formal end of the spectrum, there is no  requirement that advisory committee input be sought before USTR officials  submit documents on U.S. trade policy for interagency clearance by the  Trade Policy Staff Committee. Although such documents sometimes  include a section on private sector views, our examination of selected  documents drafted by USTR in 2000 to 2002 revealed that many did not  acknowledge solicitation or use of advisory committee input. The problems  of tracking and distributing committee advice are aggravated bathe  predominance of oral, nonconsensus committee advice offered during  discussions at meetings. While oral advice from a range of perspectives can  be valuable, it does not provide as clear guidance as written, consensus  advice, which is easier to track and respond to. Commerce\u2019s training  manual for DFOs notes that \u201cadvisors should be encouraged to provide  advice in writing, as advice imparted at meetings is often not captured for  follow-up and is difficult to document. Members often incorrectly assume  that resolutions made at meetings are passed to action officials by the DFO  or that minutes are widely circulated in a timely manner.\u201d", "Questions have been raised about how responsive agencies are to written  committee advice. A number of chairmen felt such advice received more  serious consideration, but several chairmen expressed frustration to us  about nonsubstantive or untimely replies to their committees\u2019 letters. One  Commerce DFO stated that, at Commerce, committee letters are not  always sent to officials responsible for the issues involved and instead go  up the administrative chain and end up in a bureaucratic \u201cblack hole\u201d;  another DFO reported that the letters from the committee on which he  serves have not been answered. Commerce denies that this is typical,  indicating that committee letters are considered controlled  correspondence that involves distribution of the incoming letter and review  of the draft reply by responsible officials. Although officials at Commerce  told us that it is common to send pro forma, rather than substantive,  responses to committee letters, they noted in agency comments that this is  generally because final U.S. policy has not been decided. USDA recently  initiated a practice of summarizing resolutions made and sensitive issues  raised at advisory committee meetings for senior USDA and USTR officials  in an effort to improve agency awareness of and accountability for  committee advice.", "Finally, Section 135(i) of the Trade Act requires the executive branch to  inform committees of \u201csignificant departures\u201d from committee advice.

For example, according to one USTR negotiator, a major  telecommunications services provider opted not to participate because it  had access to USTR through other venues. The electronics committee does  not yet have a representative from the software industry, and the  intellectual property rights committee does not have a representative from  the generic drug or noncontent producing copyright industry. Second,  major foreign companies, such as DaimlerChrysler, cannot participate  because foreign-owned companies are generally prohibited from  membership on committees under USTR and Commerce procedures and rules. In commenting on a draft of this report, Commerce stated that the  rationale for this long-standing policy is the sensitivity of the subject matter  considered by the committees and possible conflicts that might be  experienced by U.S. firms that have foreign owners. U.S. subsidiaries of  foreign-owned firms accounted for more than 5 percent of U.S.  employment and more than 20 percent of U.S. goods exports in 1999; such  foreign ownership has grown with globalization and is particularly high in  certain manufacturing sectors, such as transportation equipment and  chemicals.

Furthermore, negotiators were not  always actively involved in identifying candidates to fill gaps in  composition or representation. However, Commerce has stepped up its  outreach by encouraging current members to recruit applicants, directly  soliciting applicants at trade shows, holding meetings outside of  Washington, and speaking before trade associations and outside groups. In  addition, USDA solicited applications through different means, including  widely disseminating notices to state departments of agriculture and other  farm groups.

Furthermore, the committee  structure has not evolved fully to reflect today\u2019s economy. Some key trade  interests that have recently surfaced\u2014industries, issues, and  stakeholders\u2014are missing or poorly represented in the system. Conflicts  over interpreting how FACA\u2019s fair balance requirement applies to the  advisory committees have complicated the task of incorporating  nonbusiness stakeholders. Low membership rosters for most existing  committees further reduce the opportunity for negotiators to obtain a full  range of private sector views. Finally, USTR\u2019s decentralized management of  the committees has left the system without sufficient direction or support.  With limited resources devoted to the system\u2019s functioning, agencies are  struggling with administrative tasks such as security clearances associated  with appointments and 2-year rechartering requirements.

The district court found that fair balance meant  balanced representation within each trade advisory committee, not  among all advisory committees, and ruled that the two committees  should include environmental representatives. Two of the factors the  court relied on in making its ruling were that (1) the forest product  committees routinely advised the government on trade issues that  affected the environment, both nationally and internationally, and (2)  the positions supported by the committees were directly contrary to  those supported by the environmental organizations challenging their  fair balance. Importantly, the court also rejected USTR\u2019s position that  fair balance is fulfilled if the membership of an industry sector advisory  committee is broadly representative of the industry sector for which the  committee was established. The court found that this position  contradicted one of the primary purposes of FACA, which was to end  industry domination of advisory bodies. To implement its holding, the  court ordered USTR to make a good faith effort to expedite the  appointment of at least one properly qualified environmental  representative to each of the two committees. USTR and Commerce  appealed the case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and  the United States filed a brief in support of the appeal. Nevertheless,  the United States later dropped the appeal, and environmental  representatives were appointed to the two forest product advisory  committees.", "After the decision in Northwest Ecosystem Alliance, various public  interest groups filed a lawsuit in the same federal district court,  Washington Toxics Coalition v.

The court rejected this  position and held that the committee members lacked standing to  challenge the appointment of an environmental representative to their  committee. In support of its ruling, the court also found that there was  nothing in the Trade Act of 1974 that prohibited USTR and Commerce  from appointing an environmental representative.   The court noted that  the appointment of other members was not precluded by the mandatory  language of section 135 requiring that the industry sector advisory  committees be representative of all industry, labor, agricultural, or  service interests in the sector concerned.

The Department of Commerce stated that our draft report understated  member satisfaction with the timeliness of consultations, arguing that  62 percent of the respondents to our survey reported that consultations  were held on a timely basis to a moderate or great extent. We do not  agree with this characterization of our survey data. In our survey, we  asked to what extent the executive branch timed requests so that  committee input could be used in trade negotiations. Respondents  answered this question according to a five-point extent scale that  ranged from \u201cNo extent\u201d through \u201cVery great extent.\u201d Only 25 percent of  respondents checked the top two categories, \u201cGreat extent\u201d and \u201cVery  great extent.\u201d As the Department of Commerce notes, another 37  percent of respondents checked the middle category on the scale,  which was \u201cModerate extent.\u201d If all three of these categories are added  together, they total 62 percent of respondents. However, we do not  agree that all three categories should be added together. Our report  includes the full range of responses to the question, adding together  only the top two (very great and great extent) and bottom two (some or  little and no extent) categories, and reporting those who checked \u201cto a  moderate extent\u201d separately.   As the report already notes, 37 percent of  respondents reported that they were satisfied to a moderate extent, the  third point on a five-point scale. Furthermore, 30 percent checked the  final two points on the scale, \u201cSome or little extent\u201d and \u201cNo extent.\u201d  Consequently, we believe our finding that \u201consultations were not  always timely enough to have an impact on U.S. policy . .  .\u201d is justified.  Finally, we are accurately reporting member statements in both the  survey and interviews that there were instances when advice was  sought after the fact or not sought at all. 2. We agree that the frequency of meetings varies considerably across  committees, and we have added language to this report to that effect.  With respect to scheduling meetings on a timely basis, we recognize  that there is a tension between scheduling meetings far enough in  advance and scheduling additional meetings as needed. However, it is  clearly important to have timely consultations. 3. We recognize that Commerce, USTR, and USDA have made extensive  use of electronic transmissions to provide information to and seek  input from committee members. To capture the extent of such  communication, we reported on our analysis of such transmissions  during fiscal year 2001. Specifically, we calculated the number of times  during fiscal year 2001 that USTR officials used electronic means to  request comment from advisers, including when USTR sent requests for  comment to Commerce\u2019s Industry Consultations Program (ICP) office,  which relayed them to advisers electronically. Our analysis yielded a  result of 63 requests for comments, rather than the 84 suggested by  Commerce in its agency comments. Commerce may have additional  information not made available to GAO about the content of each  communication that could account for the discrepancy between our  counts of agency requests for comment in fiscal year 2001. However,  because GAO and Commerce are analyzing the same data for the same  period, the number of requests for comment is certainly not 63 plus 84,  as Commerce\u2019s comments imply. We welcome the fact that use of  electronic means to communicate with advisers is continuing in fiscal  year 2002, a period that was outside the scope of our document review. 4. Commerce reports that USTR has been responsive to ICP requests to  extend deadlines for ISAC and IFAC members to provide comments on  fast-moving issues. However, we note that in earlier interviews ICP  officials told us that the reason they have requested extensions from  USTR was because members complained that the given deadlines were  too short to provide meaningful input. 5. We believe that, if implemented, the technological improvements  Commerce and USTR are pursuing to allow sensitive documents to be  viewed on a secure interactive Web site could help remedy member  concerns over access to key documents required for meaningful and  timely advisory committee input. 6. Regarding agency procedures, Commerce does not disagree with our  statement that Commerce\u2019s and USTR\u2019s procedures and rules \u201cdo not  address the principle of timeliness or consulting to the maximum  extent feasible.\u201d However, it requests a clarification in the report to the  effect that these rules and procedures only apply to the ISACs and  IFACs operating at the third, technical tier of the advisory committee  system. But in reaching the conclusion that Commerce\u2019s and USTR\u2019s  procedures and rules do not address the principle of timeliness and  consulting to the maximum extent feasible, we examined procedures  that apply to all three tiers of the advisory process, including the first-  and second-tier committees having the most severe scheduling  problems. Specifically, we examined the procedures for the USTR-only,  Commerce-USTR, and USDA-USTR committees. The procedures for  USTR-only committees pertain to the first- and second-tier committees  having the most acute meeting scheduling problems. The Commerce- USTR procedures pertain to 22 of the third-tier committees. Neither the  USTR-only nor the Commerce-USTR procedures address the principle  of timeliness or consulting to the maximum extent feasible. The USDA  procedures\u2014which apply to six committees at the second and third  tier\uf8e7 also do not address these issues. Although we recognize that the  procedures are based on the legal framework created by Section 135 of  the Trade Act as well as other laws and orders, Section 135 (i) states  that it shall be the responsibility of the United States Trade  Representative, in conjunction with the Secretary of Commerce and  other executive departments, \u201cto adopt procedures for consultation  with and obtaining information and advice from the advisory  committees\u201d on \u201ca continuing and timely basis.\u201d  7. Commerce recognizes that committee meetings frequently include a  very full agenda, but stresses that this reflects efforts to balance a  variety of factors, including cost, members\u2019 time, and the number of  issues to be addressed. We have added language to the report to this  effect, but we note that many survey respondents expressed a desire  for more time for committees to discuss issues and formulate advice.  Survey respondents and interviewees also indicated that the format of  meetings is sometimes not conducive to the two-way dialogue that  would characterize quality consultations. Formulation of advice is the  fundamental purpose of the advisory committees, and we urge  Commerce to consider time available for committee deliberations as it  seeks to structure meetings to make best use of members\u2019 time. 8. We have added language to the report noting Commerce and USTR\u2019s  concerns over safeguarding classified information. 9. We have added language to the report noting that Commerce and USTR  already have some mechanisms to bring to the table crosscutting issues  including the Committee of the Chairs of the ISACs and IFACs. We note  that according to documents we obtained from Commerce, that  committee met three times in fiscal year 1999, twice in fiscal year 2000,  and twice in fiscal year 2001. 10. Commerce notes that the statute places limits on sharing of advice and  information across advisory committees that could inhibit the trade  advisory committee system\u2019s capacity for cross-fertilization. Although  we agree that Section 135 places some limitations on the disclosure of  trade secrets and confidential information, it does not appear to  preclude provision of confidential information to designated advisory  committee members who possess the requisite security clearances. 11. Commerce asserted that significant departures from committee advice  are rare, and that in those infrequent instances committee members are  appropriately informed. This point of view is supported by the GAO  survey, in Commerce\u2019s opinion. In our survey, we asked committee  members how often the executive branch had pursued negotiating  strategies that significantly differed from the committee advice. One  hundred twenty committee members responding to our survey  reported that the executive branch significantly departed from their  committees\u2019 advice about half of the time, or more frequently. These  120 members constitute 25 percent of all respondents to our survey,  and about one-third of those who provided an answer to this question.  While they, by no means, constitute a majority of respondents, they do  represent a sizable minority. In any case, significant departures from  committee advice do not seem to be a rare event, as Commerce  suggests. Our survey then asked a follow-on question for respondents  who indicated that there had been significant departures from  committee advice. Thirty percent of those answering this question  indicated that they had rarely or never been informed of these  significant departures. Another 21 percent of those who answered this  question indicated that they had been informed of significant  departures about or less than half of the time. As a result, we do not  agree with Commerce\u2019s statement that committee members are  appropriately informed when there are significant departures from  advice. Section 135(i) clearly states that USTR \u201cshall inform the  advisory committees of significant departures\u201d from committee advice  or recommendations. 12. We have updated this report with the information Commerce provided  about its practices for handling formal letters from advisory  committees. We note that chairmen and members with whom we spoke  expressed some frustration about lack of feedback from the  government as to how it intends to use or respond to committee  advice\u2014a sentiment not inconsistent with Commerce\u2019s practice of  providing pro forma responses to committee advice unless it has  already made a final decision on policy. Moreover, 21.9 percent of  committee chairmen responding to our survey reported that their  committees written advice was not acknowledged most of the time  (see Q25). In general, the members told us they want to have an  opportunity to influence policy before it is finalized and expressed  dissatisfaction when feedback on committee input was not substantive  or timely in nature.  13. Regarding changes to sectoral and functional committee, our report  already notes that only three committees have been created in the past  decade to respond to emerging needs. We believe that continued efforts  by Commerce and USTR to reevaluate the sectoral and functional  advisory committee alignments with the economy and trade policy  needs are warranted. 14. Commerce\u2019s position on the services committee is consistent with the  statements in this report that certain services negotiators and 70  percent of ISAC 13\u2019s members said that the services sector is well  represented in the system. However, we note that some negotiators  with whom GAO spoke made a point of saying that the services sector  is a large share of U.S. output and trade and that it is only represented  in 2 of the 17 industry sector advisory committees; in the scheme of the  whole committee system, therefore, they stated that services is  underrepresented relative to manufacturing. This report has been  updated to note that Commerce has efforts under way to fill the gap in  representation of the software industry. 15. Commerce asks us to \u201cnote and explain\u201d USTR\u2019s long-standing policy  against including foreign-owned or \u2013controlled firms among committee  membership. Commerce indicates that this policy is based on the  sensitivity of the matters considered by the committees and the  possible conflicts that would be experienced by U.S. firms that have  foreign owners, and we have added language to this report to that  effect. However, we note that first, the U.S. government does not have a  uniform policy against inclusion of foreign-owned firms on the trade  advisory committees. USDA stated in its technical comments on our  draft report that it does not preclude foreign-owned firms from  participating in its trade advisory committees. Indeed, USDA indicates  that at least one foreign-owned or -controlled firm already participates.  USDA officials indicate that although foreign ownership can be  considered in the nomination review process, in practice, it was not  actually considered during the 2001 rechartering of the six USDA trade  advisory committees. Second, as to the rationale for the  USTR/Commerce exclusion, we note that there does not appear to be  any bar in Section 135, FACA, and GSA implementing regulations  specifically precluding participation by foreign-owned or -controlled  firms from having representatives on trade advisory committees. The  legislative history of Section 135 does not deal directly with this issue,  and in their comments, neither USTR nor Commerce bases its long- standing policy on a legal prohibition. Third, while we recognize  Commerce\u2019s and USTR\u2019s concerns about the sensitivity of the subject  matters considered by the committees, we note that neither Commerce  nor USTR has provided us with requested explanations of why the  requirements that advisory committee members obtain security  clearances and sign a legally binding nondisclosure agreement to  protect classified information, along with giving members procedural  guidance on safeguarding trade sensitive information, are not sufficient  to address these concerns. Fourth, we acknowledge that a majority of  our survey respondents expressed reservations about inclusion of  foreign-owned firms in the system. However, several members and  negotiators still suggested that the long-standing policy barring foreign- owned firms from membership altogether should be revisited, in part  because of the contribution to U.S. employment and production that  some of these firms provide. Indeed, several U.S. negotiators reported  to GAO that they already actively work with foreign-owned firms on an  informal basis during trade negotiations, many of which are already  members of key trade associations. 16. Regarding participation levels and outreach, Commerce took issue with  our position that the number of members specified in each committee\u2019s  charter represents a proper level of membership.   We note Commerce\u2019s  assertion that the \u201cauthorized capacity\u201d numbers specified in each  committee\u2019s charter are \u201csomewhat arbitrary,\u201d but we hold that they do  provide useful guidance regarding committee size. Each committee  charter specifies that it \u201cconsists of approximately X members,\u201d and  each committee\u2019s charter specifies a distinct membership number,  ranging from 30 to 50 members. For example, the charter for the Small  and Minority Businesses Committee states that it \u201cconsists of  approximately 35 members,\u201d while the charter for the Chemicals and  Allied Products Committee specifies approximately 50 members.  Further, while for some trade advisory committees managed by other  agencies the charter states that these numbers represent a maximum,  this is not the case for the committees that Commerce administers.  Even if the numbers specified in the charters do not represent an  absolute ideal, our conclusion that the trade advisory committees were  at 49 percent of their authorized capacity in fiscal year 2001 highlights  the ample room available on the committees that could be used to fill  gaps in representation.  17. We appreciate that Commerce provided us with current membership  numbers as of August 2002, although the scope of our document review  was through fiscal year 2001 (September 30, 2001). We note that  according to these current membership numbers, at 48.3 percent of  charter levels, the committees administered by Commerce remain just  below half of their authorized capacity, and well below the 55 percent  of capacity they had reached in fiscal 2000. 18. We recognize Commerce\u2019s efforts to recruit new members and have  updated the report to reflect them more fully. These efforts may  alleviate the difficulties of maintaining robust and representative  membership, concerns that both Commerce and USTR officials  expressed during our review. 19. Commerce believes that the draft report\u2019s treatment of the issue of  nonbusiness participation may be somewhat misleading and states that  the report should contain a more detailed and specific discussion of the  congressional delegation in Section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974,  particularly in distinguishing the functions and makeup of each of the  three \u201ctiers\u201d of committees. We believe this report\u2019s treatment of the  nonbusiness issue is fair and accurate and note that appendix II of our  draft report contains a detailed discussion of the functions and  committee structure for each tier. 20. We recognize that many members expressed satisfaction with the  support provided to committees by USTR and other managing agencies,  including Commerce and USDA, and we have added language to this  report to that effect. However, certain members also expressed  concerns about overall leadership of the system and stated that delays  or disruptions associated with agency execution of administrative tasks  such as rechartering and new appointments were hindering the  system\u2019s ability to fulfill its statutory purpose. Our report already notes  that\uf8e7 unlike USTR, USDA, and Labor\uf8e7 Commerce\u2019s ICP successfully  avoided disruptions in committee operations typically associated with  rechartering. This report has been updated to note that Commerce is  taking steps to fill administrative support needs by hiring additional  staff. With the renewal of trade promotion authority on August 6, 2002,  the U.S. negotiating agenda and resulting demands on the committee  system are likely to increase."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Dennis Richards, Venecia Rojas  Kenah, Kay Halpern, Jon Rose, Janet Lewis, Sharla Draemel, Martin De  Alteriis, Richard Seldin, and Janey Cohen made key contributions to this  report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, exists to  support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve  the performance and accountability of the federal government for the American  people.
