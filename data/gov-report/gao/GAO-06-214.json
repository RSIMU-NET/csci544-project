They also said that some requirements are very similar or redundant, such as EEOC's affirmative employment program and OPM's program for recruiting minorities and women. This creates duplication of effort as agencies sometimes have to submit the same information in different reports to EEOC and OPM. Further, the officials said they experienced added administrative burden because of inconsistent requirements. The officials also said that guidance from EEOC on EEO, affirmative employment, and workforce diversity issues was more frequent and more useful than that from OPM. Some officials questioned the usefulness of feedback from EEOC and OPM on their agencies' performance or submitted reports. Less than half reported that the feedback was useful or very useful and a substantial number of respondents reported that they received no feedback from OPM. In addition, EEO and human capital officials expressed the strong view that both OPM and EEOC could be doing more to help their agencies. We found little evidence of coordination at the operating level between EEOC and OPM in developing policy, providing guidance, and exercising oversight, despite overlapping responsibilities in federal workplace EEO. For example, EEOC and OPM officials do not routinely review reports that the other agency receives from federal agencies, even though those reports deal with similar matters. In addition, EEOC and OPM officials do not coordinate with each other when conducting on-site reviews of EEO-related matters at agencies. Good management practice as well as federal statute and executive order call for coordination, and not doing so results in lost opportunity to realize consistency, efficiency, and public value in EEO policy making and oversight. The Office of Management and Budget made a recommendation to OPM in 2005 that it develop a regular/formal working relationship with EEOC with respect to those programs where it shares oversight responsibility with EEOC in order to improve overall government efficiency. Although EEOC officials acknowledged a need to coordinate at the operating level and to develop an institutional coordination process, OPM officials suggested that coordination need not be institutionalized."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government has a policy to provide a workplace for its  employees that is fair, equitable, and free from discrimination and  retaliation. To help achieve this policy, the federal government has created  a framework of statutes, policies, regulations, and guidance in order to  prohibit discrimination, ensure equal employment opportunity (EEO), and  value workforce diversity. In April 2005, in response to your request, we  reported on the EEO policy framework under which (1) certain personnel  practices are prohibited, including unlawful discrimination based on race,  color, religion, gender, national origin, age, and disability; (2) avenues of  redress are offered when discrimination and retaliation have been alleged;  and (3) affirmative employment and minority recruitment programs are  required to ensure EEO in the federal workforce.", "Within the EEO framework, federal agencies are responsible for providing  for a fair and nondiscriminatory workplace.

EEOC is responsible for the enforcement of antidiscrimination laws and  oversight of federal agency EEO programs, and OPM is responsible for  ensuring that federal agencies adhere to federal merit system principles,  which include nondiscrimination. In carrying out their responsibilities,  both EEOC and OPM issue regulations, directives, and guidance that  supplement the EEO framework and establish requirements for agencies,  oversee agencies\u2019 performance in meeting framework requirements, and  provide feedback to agencies. EEOC has the additional responsibility of  providing leadership and coordination of federal EEO efforts in order to  avoid conflict, competition, duplication, and inconsistency.", "During the course of our review that led to our April 2005 EEO framework  report, we heard from EEO and human capital officials at selected  agencies about similarities and redundancies in EEO-related requirements  and concerns about the usefulness of guidance and feedback received from  those agencies. In response to your request and to better understand these  and other issues, we surveyed EEO and human capital officials in the  executive branch to determine their views on (1) the requirements dealing  with EEO and workforce diversity and the extent to which the  requirements contribute to ensuring EEO and diversity in the workplace  and (2) the usefulness of guidance and feedback they receive from EEOC  and OPM concerning these requirements. In addition, we examined how  and to what extent EEOC and OPM coordinate with each other in  developing policy, providing guidance, and exercising oversight of federal  line agencies.", "To accomplish our objectives, we sent separate surveys to the EEO/civil  rights directors and the chief human capital officers/human capital  directors at the 45 executive branch agencies (other than the United States  Postal Service and intelligence agencies) with 500 or more employees that  are required to file annual reports with EEOC on their affirmative  employment program and that also file annual reports with OPM on their  Federal Equal Opportunity Recruitment Program (FEORP). Collectively,  the 45 agencies employed 97 percent of the nonpostal federal workforce as  of September 30, 2004. Of the 90 officials to whom we sent the survey, 83  officials or their designees (92.2 percent) responded from October through  December 2004. We received a response from either an EEO or human  capital official at all 45 agencies, and from both at 38 agencies. Prior to the  survey, we also interviewed EEO and human capital officials at 6 of these  45 agencies. In addition, we reviewed statutes, executive orders, and other  executive policies that form the EEO framework as well as EEOC and OPM  requirements placed on agencies and compared them to each other. Agency  officials expressed their views, through both the survey and interviews,  about the extent to which the different framework requirements contribute  to EEO, the extent of redundancy between EEO-related requirements and  the duplication of effort this causes, the burdens created by EEOC\u2019s and  OPM\u2019s differing policies on data-related issues, and the usefulness of  EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s guidance and feedback. We provide examples of agency  officials\u2019 comments on these matters; however, we did not independently  evaluate the extent to which the different requirements contribute toward  EEO, the extent of redundancy of EEO requirements, the merits of differing  EEOC and OPM policies, or the usefulness of guidance and feedback.", "We discussed with EEOC and OPM how they coordinate with each other in  carrying out their roles and responsibilities within the EEO framework.  Since the application of EEO laws varies between the branches (executive,  legislative, and judicial) of the federal government, this report focuses  primarily on the EEO framework applicable to the executive branch.

This framework, which governs civil rights  and personnel management, places primary responsibility on federal  agencies to provide workplaces that have a culture of fairness, equity, and  inclusiveness free from discrimination. For a further discussion of the EEO  framework, see appendix II.", "Within the EEO framework, both EEOC and OPM play important roles in  leadership and oversight of federal agencies. EEOC\u2019s mission is to promote  equality of opportunity in the workplace and enforce federal laws  prohibiting employment discrimination in both the private and federal  sectors. In the federal sector, EEOC is responsible for enforcing the  employment discrimination prohibitions under title VII of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964, as amended; the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the Equal Pay Act  of 1973; and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, as  amended. In this regard, EEOC is responsible for establishing procedures  for handling federal employees\u2019 allegations of discrimination based on  race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, or disability, and providing  for the adjudication of complaints and hearing of appeals. In addition,  EEOC establishes requirements and standards for programs to provide  equal employment opportunity; monitors federal agencies\u2019 compliance  with EEO laws and procedures; and reviews and assesses the effectiveness  of agencies\u2019 programs to promote EEO, including agencies\u2019 efforts to  identify and eliminate barriers to equality of employment opportunity.", "OPM\u2019s mission is to build a high-quality and diverse federal workforce  based on merit system principles. Under title 5 of the U.S. Code, OPM is  responsible for executing, administering, and enforcing civil service laws  and regulations in the executive branch, including the merit system  principles that require fair and equitable treatment and equal opportunity  and prohibit discrimination in all aspects of federal employment. Title 5  also requires OPM to assist agencies in their equal opportunity recruitment  program activities and to oversee and evaluate these agency programs. In  carrying out their respective responsibilities, EEOC and OPM are to carry  out oversight of each other, with EEOC reviewing OPM\u2019s EEO programs  and OPM assessing human capital practices at EEOC.", "Both EEOC and OPM have articulated specific goals and objectives in their  strategic plans to carry out their EEO-related responsibilities. These goals,  while differing in some aspects, share a common theme, which is to  promote policies that contribute to building high-performing organizations  that foster inclusive work cultures. A primary focus for EEOC is to help  agencies identify and eliminate barriers to EEO, while a key focus for OPM  is to assist agencies in creating diverse candidate pools, including women,  minorities, persons with disabilities, and veterans, which can be used in  making appointments to the federal service in executive and management  positions and leadership feeder ranks.", "Carrying out the requirements of the EEO framework within federal  agencies is generally shared by human capital and EEO/civil rights offices,  with EEO offices taking the lead in programs EEOC oversees and human  capital offices taking the lead in programs OPM oversees.

(As we later discuss, a substantial number of respondents said several of  these programs had very similar or redundant elements.)

Elements of the  requirements that EEOC and OPM oversee or in fact established have  certain common aspects, including measuring representation of or  participation by race, ethnic, and gender groups and developing plans to  address barriers to equal opportunity. Although we asked for the survey  respondents\u2019 views on the extent to which requirements were very similar  or redundant and we made observations about where some similarities and  redundancies exist, we did not evaluate the degree of similarity or  redundancy among these requirements. Survey respondents also  commented about the need for EEOC and OPM to better coordinate, with  some commenting in particular about the need for the two agencies to  work together to eliminate redundant and inconsistent requirements. We  discuss the extent to which EEOC and OPM coordinate later in this report.", "EEO and human capital officials surveyed were asked to identify the extent  to which the elements making up the requirements of certain policies  relating to the EEO framework were very similar or redundant with the  requirements of at least one other policy, for example, whether any two  policy requirements contained common features, such as developing plans,  assessing progress, and preparing reports. To obtain more specific views,  we asked respondents to select from a list two specific requirements that  they believed were redundant; they also had the option of selecting none or  responding that they did not know. Of the 81 respondents to this question,  57 (70.4 percent) said that at least one of the requirements was very similar  or redundant to at least one other requirement. FEORP, for which OPM  issued implementing regulations, was identified by 41 (50.6 percent)  respondents as having very similar or redundant elements with the  requirements of another policy; 30 (37 percent) said that EEOC\u2019s MD-715  was very similar or redundant with another policy; and 19 (23.5 percent)  said this of Executive Order No. 13171, Hispanic Employment in the  Federal Government, which OPM oversees. When asked specifically to  identify two requirements that were very similar to or redundant with each  other, 21 (25.9 percent) respondents cited FEORP and MD-715, while  another 15 respondents (18.5 percent) cited FEORP and Executive Order  No. 13171.", "A number of human capital and EEO officials with whom we spoke as well  as survey respondents (who, in a few cases, we had previously  interviewed) said that the overlap in MD-715, FEORP, and Executive Order  No. 13171 requirements resulted in duplication of effort. As we reported in  our April 2005 report on the EEO framework, both EEOC, under MD-715,  and OPM, under FEORP and Executive Order No. 13171, require that  agencies analyze their workforces to determine the representation of  employee groups compared to their representation in the civilian labor  force (CLF), identify barriers where underrepresentation exists, and  develop steps to address barriers. In addition, agencies are also to report  on the status and progress of their efforts annually. Thus, for example, an  agency may have to submit similar information on its recruitment efforts,  in different formats and at different times of the year, to EEOC for its MD- 715 report and to OPM for reports required under FEORP and Executive  Order No. 13171.", "With regard to redundancies, OPM said that it views EEOC\u2019s MD-715 as  constituting guidance and not as placing requirements on agencies, adding  that the policy reflected in guidance can neither overrule nor stand in place  of statutory requirements, such as those under FEORP, or the requirements  set forth in executive orders pursuant to statutory delegations. EEOC disagreed, however, pointing out that it issued MD-715, articulating agency  responsibilities, pursuant to its authority under law and executive order.", "Many survey respondents reported redundancies in policies and  requirements concerning persons with disabilities. There are common  elements in EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s roles in the area of employees with  disabilities, which are reflected in requirements in EEOC\u2019s MD-715 relating  to affirmative action plan requirements in Section 501 of the Rehabilitation  Act, and Executive Order No. 13163, Increasing the Opportunity for  Individuals with Disabilities to Be Employed in the Federal  Government, and DVAAP, both administered by OPM. Of 81 respondents,  54 (66.7 percent) said there were redundancies among these requirements  concerning persons with disabilities. For example, 39 (48.2 percent) said  MD-715 requirements for persons with disabilities had very similar or  redundant elements with at least one other requirement, and 36 (44.4  percent) cited Executive Order No. 13163. In identifying which two specific  requirements had the most redundancies, 24 (29.6 percent) respondents  cited MD-715 and Executive Order No. 13163.", "EEO and human capital officials\u2019 concerns about redundant requirements  mirror the findings of a 1993 report of the National Partnership for  Reinventing Government (NPR) (formerly the National Performance  Review), From Red Tape to Results: Creating a Government That Works  Better and Costs Less. The report said that an inordinate amount of  resources are devoted to preparing duplicative reports and recommended  that reporting requirements for agencies be blended into one  comprehensive assessment of EEO and affirmative employment efforts,  including specific actions needed to eradicate barriers and increase  representation. The report said that such action would help reduce  administrative costs and allow agencies to spend more time on results  rather than paper processes. At the time the NPR report was issued, primary elements of the EEO framework were more limited, and included  EEOC\u2019s MD-713 (on persons with disabilities) and MD-714 (on minorities  and women), as well as OPM\u2019s FEORP requirements. Since then,  additional parts of the policy framework have been put into place,  including Executive Order Nos. 13163, 13164, and 13171; the Notification  and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation (No FEAR) Act;  MD-715 (which superseded MD-713 and MD-714); and the PMA and Human  Capital Accountability and Assessment Framework (HCAAF) standards.  These additions to the framework, and to EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s  responsibilities, have added to the redundancy and administrative burden.", "Federal EEO and human capital officials, in responding to our survey and  in the course of our interviews, provided specific comments about some of  the policies and requirements administered by EEOC and OPM. See figure  3 for some of these comments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey Respondents Say Different Reporting Policies Create Burdens for Their Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Human capital and EEO officials reported they experience additional  administrative burden because EEOC and OPM have different policies in  some areas with regard to workforce data collection or analysis. These  areas include categorization of data by occupation and race and ethnicity  and collection of data on job applicants.", "Historically, both EEOC and OPM categorized data on an agency\u2019s  workforce according to six occupational categories: professional,  administrative, technical, clerical, other white-collar, and blue-collar  (PATCOB). In 2004, EEOC changed to nine occupational categories:  officials and managers, professionals, technicians, sales, office and clerical, craft workers, operatives, laborers, and service workers. According to  EEOC, it made the change because the PATCOB categories were outdated  and too imprecise to allow the level of analysis desired, and because EEOC  uses the nine categories for private sector workforce analysis. OPM  contends that the PATCOB categories continue to support its  governmentwide occupation classification responsibility and provide more  meaningful crosswalks to national workforce data. OPM also said the nine  occupational categories EEOC uses are too broad for meaningful analysis  because they combine too many occupations within one category. Further,  OPM said that the crosswalk now used by EEOC to classify federal  occupations into one of the nine categories is inaccurate and incomplete in  some areas.", "Under EEOC\u2019s previous reporting requirements using the PATCOB  categories, agencies could download data from the government\u2019s Central  Personnel Data File (CPDF), which OPM maintains, to fulfill EEOC  analysis and reporting requirements. With the new occupational categories,  agencies must now develop computer programs to follow a crosswalk that  classifies federal occupations into one of the nine categories. This burden  may be lessened in the future. According to EEOC and OPM officials, the  two agencies have had discussions about occupational categories in  relation to OPM\u2019s new Enterprise Human Resources Integration (EHRI)  system, which will replace CPDF as the central source for federal  workforce data and will afford agencies the opportunity, for a fee, to  perform complex workforce analysis and planning tasks and maintain  personnel records in electronic form. At the time of our review, EEOC and  OPM officials said that a statement of work has been proposed that if  approved and put in place could enable EEOC and other agencies to use  EHRI for purposes related to MD-715 reporting. However, OPM also noted  that there were separate policy and legal implications that must be  resolved. In addition, according to OPM, while much of the information  sought under MD-715 is contained within the EHRI database, EHRI will not  be able to provide data on applicants, non-appropriated fund employees, or  CLF comparisons.", "Some EEO and human capital officials commented that another difference  between EEOC and OPM requirements that caused increased  administrative burden is how workforce data were reported by race and  ethnicity categories. In 1997, OMB issued revisions to standards for the  classification of federal data on race and ethnicity which were to be  adopted as soon as possible but no later than January 1, 2003. In the  instructions for MD-715, issued in March 2004, EEOC required agencies to  report data to EEOC under the minimum categories designated by OMB  under the revised standards for data on race and ethnicity. EEOC  encouraged agencies to collect data on race and national origin in a more  detailed fashion as required in OMB\u2019s revised standards (for example, by  allowing employees to identify themselves as members of more than one  race) so long as the data can be aggregated into the categories EEOC  required under MD-715. EEOC required agencies to resurvey those  employees who had previously identified themselves as Asian/Pacific  Islander in order to break out those employees into the two new categories  (Asians and Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander). EEOC also  required agencies to give all new hires and those for whom the agency did  not have race or national origin information, the opportunity to self-identify  their race and national origin, including the ability to identify their  membership in more than one race. OPM updated the CPDF to conform to  OMB\u2019s revised standards in January 2006. OPM requires data from agencies  in accordance with the OMB format for new employees only; it does not  require agencies to resurvey their workforces because it has no authority to  do so, according to OPM officials.", "Another area where a policy disagreement arose that some officials said  presents challenges to agencies involved gathering and analyzing applicant- flow data. EEOC, in MD-715, requires agencies to analyze data on race,  national origin, gender, and disabilities voluntarily provided by job  applicants in order to begin to identify areas where barriers may be  excluding certain groups. OPM takes the position that agencies are not  required or authorized to collect race, national origin, gender, and age  information on applicants. In the past, OPM said it opposed collecting race  and national origin data from job applicants because collecting such data  would be costly, ineffective, and a reporting burden. According to OPM,  agencies collecting applicant data could involve significant legal risks\u2014 such collection could be construed as pressuring agencies to engage in  preferential treatment in order to achieve \u201cresults\u201d in terms of workforce  composition, as suggested by certain recent discrimination cases. EEOC  defends the appropriateness of collecting and analyzing applicant data. In  commenting on a draft of this report, EEOC said that federal agencies are  bound by the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures  (issued jointly by EEOC, the Civil Service Commission (OPM\u2019s  predecessor), and the Departments of Justice and Labor), which requires  employers to request racial and ethnic data from applicants and analyze  applicant-flow data. Because of OPM\u2019s position that agencies are not  required or authorized to collect racial or national origin data from  applicants, EEOC officials told us that EEOC has not offered official  guidance to agencies concerning applicant-flow data collection, although  EEOC has given informal verbal guidance on request.", "Figure 4 shows some officials\u2019 comments on reporting requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies Are More Satisfied with Guidance and Feedback from EEOC Than with That from OPM and Believe Both Could Do More", "paragraphs": ["A large majority of survey respondents and officials we interviewed  suggested both EEOC and OPM could do more in their oversight and  leadership roles to ensure EEO in the workplace and achieve workforce  diversity by providing clearer guidance and feedback and by working  together to improve the quality of such guidance.", "A majority of agency EEO and human capital officials responding to our  survey said that guidance and feedback from EEOC was useful or very  useful, while less than half said that about guidance and feedback from  OPM."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Officials Believe Both EEOC and OPM Could Do More to Help Agencies with EEO, Workforce Diversity, and Affirmative Employment", "paragraphs": ["Survey respondents who served as points of contact with the central  leadership agencies\u2014EEOC, OPM, MSPB, OSC, and FLRA\u2014indicated that  on matters concerning EEO, affirmative employment, and workforce  diversity they interacted primarily with EEOC and OPM over the 2 years leading up to our survey.

OPM should make it a priority [to  work together] closer with EEOC in assessing progress and lead the way in providing  models of EEO/diversity performance standards.\u201d", "The benefits of better coordination within agencies were highlighted by an  EEOC official, who stated that review of barrier analysis in reports  submitted under MD-715 showed that the highest quality analysis had come  from agencies where there was more coordination between human capital  and EEO staffs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Government Policy Has Recognized the Importance of Coordination in Carrying Out EEO; Coordination between EEOC and OPM Is Good Management", "paragraphs": ["For nearly 30 years, government policy has recognized the importance of a  coordinated effort in carrying out federal actions to ensure EEO.

The reorganization plan and the executive order gave EEOC responsibility  for promoting efficiency and eliminating conflict, competition, duplication,  and inconsistency in the implementation of EEO requirements, and  provided coordination principles for federal departments and agencies to  follow in enforcing EEO requirements. Coordination of federal EEO efforts  is also guided by EEOC regulation.", "Additions to the EEO framework changing EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s  responsibilities since 1978 have made adherence to the underlying  principle of coordination between agencies with overlapping  responsibilities even more necessary. We have reported that the lack of  coordination between federal agencies with overlapping responsibilities  creates a situation wherein scarce funds are wasted, program customers  are confused and frustrated, and the overall effectiveness of the effort is limited. Most recently, in October 2005, we reported that agencies with  overlapping responsibilities can enhance and sustain their collaborative  efforts and produce more public value by engaging in certain practices,  such as defining and articulating a common outcome; agreeing upon  agency roles and responsibilities, including leadership; and establishing  compatible policies, procedures, and other means to operate across agency  boundaries. Clearly, these principles apply to EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s roles  within the EEO framework. \u201cthe roles and responsibilities of EEOC and OPM present an opportunity for them to work  together to provide leadership and training necessary to integrate EEO into every aspect of  human resource management policy and practice. These two agencies must make a  concentrated effort to ensure ongoing communications and understanding of EEO and  affirmative employment efforts to achieve a diverse, competent, and productive federal  workforce. They must provide joint leadership to EEO, civil rights, and personnel  professionals to create, develop, review, and improve effective ongoing governmentwide  efforts.\u201d", "The NPR suggested a number of actions, which could be implemented  administratively or by presidential order, which it believed would  \u201cdecrease duplicated efforts and redundancy\u2026 and foster coordinated,  governmentwide commitment to creating, implementing, and  accomplishing equal opportunity and affirmative employment goals.\u201d  These included establishing an Interagency Equal Employment  Opportunity and Affirmative Employment Steering Group under the joint  chair of EEOC and OPM, and combining all equal opportunity and  affirmative employment reports into one comprehensive assessment of the  total workforce EEO/affirmative employment data.

OMB indicated that although  EEOC has the statutory responsibility to coordinate EEO efforts, OPM  should seek opportunities for collaboration with EEOC in order to improve  overall government efficiency in the area of compliance reviews. OMB  noted that although OPM indicated that it was collaborating with EEOC,  OPM provided no documentary evidence of any collaboration. OMB  recommended that OPM collaborate with EEOC on activities that overlap  and further recommended that there be a regular/formal working  relationship between the two agencies.", "In addition, OPM, in preparing the annual FEORP report to Congress, does  not consult with EEOC, as EEOC guidelines to OPM regulations indicate it  should. In their discussions with us, some OPM officials responsible for  oversight were either (1) unaware of EEOC\u2019s affirmative employment  program requirements, EEOC\u2019s oversight of federal agencies, or both or   (2) mistakenly believed that EEOC\u2019s authority was limited to dealing with  violations of title VII of the Civil Rights Act, in particular, discrimination  complaints.", "We also found that EEOC and OPM did not, for the most part, coordinate  EEO information and guidance on their respective Web sites.

While OPM also agreed that there is room for  improvement, and that it would reinstate the practice of consulting with  EEOC as it prepares the annual FEORP reports, it believed that with  respect to other matters, a more appropriate approach was to continue to  coordinate on an as-needed basis and that a requirement for formal  coordination would add a layer of complexity to an already complex  situation. While we are sensitive to the need to limit unnecessary  complexity, as was evident from our survey, areas exist where agencies feel  additional administrative burden, in large measure, because OPM and  EEOC have not coordinated their oversight efforts.

Therefore,  these agencies could develop and distribute a common data collection  instrument that both EEOC and OPM could use to fulfill their respective  responsibilities.

Agencies are also to notify and provide training for their  employees on their rights and protections in cases of discrimination and  reprisal. In addition, the No FEAR Act stipulates that agencies are to  submit annual reports that contain discrimination complaint data, an  evaluation of the data to identify underlying causes, and actions planned or  taken to improve their civil rights and complaint programs.

However, the FEORP and MD-715 programs  are dissimilar in a great number of respects, and the scope of the information analyzed by MD- 715 is much broader than FEORP.  A short discussion of each program demonstrates this point:  FEORP is limited to recruitment, in the broader sense of hiring, training and career  development, by federal agencies. However, OPM by its own admission does not collect  applicant flow information about the race, national origin and sex of recruits for federal jobs.", "Instead agencies comply with FEORP by submitting snapshot workforce information annually to  OPM on the workforce by race, national origin and gender of their employees.  Agencies also  provide anecdotal information on Workforce Planning, Recruitment and Outreach, Mentoring  and Career Development Opportunities.  Moreover, the 2005 OPM Annual Report to Congress  on FEORP actually gives no information on the race, national origin or sex of  applicants for  federal jobs, or of the impact of agencies\u2019 efforts to enhance the diversity of federal recruits.", "Instead, the Annual FEORP report only provides a snapshot of the race, national origin and sex  of individuals already employed in the federal workforce, whether recently hired or with 30  years service. The report implies that if the federal workforce is diverse, then federal agency  recruitment efforts must be working properly. The FEORP annual report also analyzes  employment participation for underrepresentation.  Some anecdotal information about agency  initiatives in the area of Workforce Planning, Recruitment and Outreach, Mentoring and Career  Development Opportunities is reported by individual agencies, but no statistical analysis of those  individual agency recruitment efforts, or of agency recruitment efforts government-wide, is  provided by OPM in the Annual Report. Finally, OPM, according to survey respondents, does  not provide feedback to agencies on their FEORP reports. (Figure 8, page 29)", "Contrast that with the much broader scope of EEOC\u2019s MD-715 which requires that  agencies  report by race, national origin, sex and disability of employees and applicants affected  by numerous federal agency employment practices from outreach and recruitment (requiring that  agencies collect and report applicant flow information) to hiring, participation rates across the  general schedule, and in major occupations, training, non-competitive promotions, merit  promotions for major occupations, participation in career development and training, awards and  separations. Moreover, and unlike OPM\u2019s FEORP program, EEOC\u2019s practice is to require  agencies to do in-depth barrier analysis to identify and eliminate barriers to the employment  opportunities, using snapshot information from the agency workforce, underrepresentation  analyses and several other sources of information.  After agencies submit their MD-715 reports,  EEOC provides them feedback, in the form of extensive technical assistance, both in person and  in writing.", "GAO \u201cdid not evaluate the degree of similarity and redundancy among these requirements\u201d (p.15).   Because GAO did not conduct a careful comparison of the degree of  redundancy of any of the programs mentioned in the draft report, the analysis is insufficient.", "Statutory Requirements Limit Options to Streamline Reporting Requirements Although the survey conducted by GAO reports that several agencies officials expressed  views that there is redundancy in some programs (FEORP, CSRA and MD-715, Title VII),  (Rehabilitation Act and Executive Order 13163), neither OPM nor EEOC is free to eliminate any  redundancy by ignoring the requirements of statutes enacted by Congress or Executive Orders  promulgated by the President which assign responsibility over a given program to an individual  agency.  In other words EEOC clearly cannot simply \u201cfold\u201d OPM\u2019s FEORP requirements into its  MD-715 program without going against the plain meaning of the Civil Service Reform Act  which assigns responsibility of reporting under the FEORP to OPM. See 5 U.S.C. 7201(e) (requiring OPM to prepare and transmit a report to each House of Congress on FEORP not later  that January 31 of each year).", "Likewise, EEOC cannot simply absorb OPM\u2019s responsibilities under E.O. 13163 into the  MD-715 Rehabilitation Act reporting requirements without ignoring the plain requirements of  the Executive Order.  See 3 C.F.R. 13163 (d) (requiring that each Federal agency shall prepare a  plan to increase the opportunities for individuals with disabilities to be employed in the agency).", "If GAO is suggesting that EEOC and OPM should consolidate allegedly redundant  reporting requirements of EEO programs into a single agency, the Commission believes that  these solutions should be initiated by Congress and/or the President. This being said, EEOC  does not disagree with GAO that the Commission and OPM can further strengthen their  collaborative efforts.  There is always room for improvement.", "GAO\u2019s draft fails to note (p. 6) that its survey was conducted between October 2004 and  December 2004 prior to agency submission of annual reports under MD-715 in January 2005 or  EEOC\u2019s issuance of feedback letters. Thus, GAO\u2019s comments regarding feedback were likely  based on feedback under the now obsolete Management Directives 713 and 714.", "The GAO draft mischaracterizes EEOC\u2019s positions or responses on some issues.  For  example, GAO reports that EEOC changed the nine occupational categories because the  PATCOB categories were outdated and too imprecise to allow the level of analysis desired.", "However, EEOC expanded to the nine categories not only because this change provided a better  refinement and alignment of the data to be evaluated, but also because the nine categories are  based on the occupational categories EEOC uses for conducting similar analyses in the private  sector.  The Commission strives for consistency and uniformity in the enforcement of its EEO  responsibilities across sectors.", "Also GAO mistakenly notes that EEOC officials said that it had \u201cnot offered official  guidance to agencies concerning applicant-flow data collection.\u201d  In fact, MD-715 requires the  collection of applicant flow data.  EEOC formed an interagency working group in 2004 to assist  in the development of an applicant flow collection form.  EEOC sought to accomplish two  objectives: to assist in framing the questions on the form that ask for applicant information using  the revised race categories and methods approved by OMB, and to ensure that other proper  language and guidance was used in creating the forms.", "In 2004, several agencies informed EEOC that they would not collect applicant flow data  unless and until OPM developed new race reporting codes that could be used by the agencies to  report the data in agency personnel and OPM databases.  OPM revised the race categories in the  CPDF database in August 2005, with required use by January 1, 2006.", "Several of GAO\u2019s concerns require further information and/or discussion:   The draft report noted \u201cpolicy inconsistencies and disagreements\u2019 that EEOC and OPM  should address and resolve, but failed to specifically identify them;  An explanation as to how EEOC\u2019s more narrowly defined nine occupational categories  could be \u201ctoo broad for meaningful analysis because they combine too many occupations  within one category,\u201d but the six broader categories they replaced are not;   Specific identification of the inaccuracies and omissions in the \u201ccrosswalk\u201c developed to  classify federal occupations into one of the nine categories;   The basis for the statement that the collection of applicant flow data would be \u201ccostly, ineffective and a reporting burden\u201d (p. 23); and  Support for the statement that collecting applicant data could involve significant legal  risks and that such collection could  be construed as \u201cpressuring agencies to engage in  preferential treatment in order to achieve \u2018results\u2019 in terms of workforce composition, as  suggested by recent discrimination cases.\u201d  It should be noted that federal agencies are  bound by the Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (UGESP), which  require employers to request race and ethnic data from applicants and analyze applicant flow data.  UGESP is a joint federal rule issued by EEOC, DOL, DOJ, and OPM.", "A large part of EEOC\u2019s mission involves proactive prevention of discrimination.

Our research shows that EEOC and OFCCP jointly  developed a form (EEO-1) to meet the needs of both agencies. Further,  parties make a single submission to the joint committee, made up of  EEOC and Department of Labor staff. We believe that EEOC\u2019s  collaboration with OFCCP is a positive example of collaboration that  EEOC and OPM could emulate in seeking opportunities for  streamlining and consolidating information gathering from federal  agencies. 2. We recognize the differences in EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s authorized  responsibilities. However, this does not obviate our point that similar  information to meet both requirements could be collected through a  single common instrument, from which EEOC and OPM could extract  the information needed for their separate reports. EEOC and OPM  should look for ways to minimize the impact of these differences on  agencies.  3. This draft report and an earlier report on the EEO framework present  similarities and differences in responsibilities of EEOC and OPM and in  the requirements they place on agencies. In this report, we present the  informed views of EEO and human capital officials surveyed for the  report who deal with various requirements daily. In presenting these  views, it was beyond the scope of our review to independently analyze  the validity of the responses. We believe that it is more appropriate for  EEOC and OPM to explore opportunities to streamline and consolidate  similar and redundant requirements and, in doing so, to seek the views  of agency EEO and human capital managers who are responsible for  carrying out the requirements.  4. The statutes and executive orders place responsibility for EEO-related  programs on EEOC and OPM, as noted. However, the responsibility  relates to administering the programs and reporting results, not in  collecting data. We believe that there is no statutory impediment in title  VII or in the CSRA that would prevent EEOC and OPM from devising  and distributing a common data collection instrument, the information  from which would be subsequently used by the two agencies in  separately analyzing the data and reporting under FEORP and  Management Directive (MD) 715. Should EEOC and OPM conclude that  certain coordination or streamlining efforts might not be authorized  under current statutes, executive orders, or regulations, they could  modify regulations, request that the President revise relevant executive  orders, or request that Congress amend relevant statutes to bring about  greater efficiency in how EEOC, OPM, and federal agencies meet the  requirements of the EEO framework. We clarified this in the report. 5. Figure 7, which shows survey respondents\u2019 perceptions of the  usefulness of feedback from EEOC on agency performance or contents  of reports or documents submitted under MD-713 and MD-714, contains  a note that these requirements were operational during the early part of  the survey period. Together, the requirements under MD-713 and MD- 714, including submitting annual reports, had much in common with  the requirements under MD-715. In addition, EEOC issued feedback  letters to agencies on reports submitted under MD-713 and MD-714.  Because the first reports under MD-715 were not due until after the  survey period, it was not possible to ask survey recipients for their  views on feedback from EEOC on these reports. Though MD-713 and  MD-714 have been superseded, respondents\u2019 views on the usefulness of  EEOC feedback are not invalid. 6. EEOC\u2019s statement about the professional, administrative, clerical, other  white-collar and blue-collar (PATCOB) categories was taken from its  guidance \u201cFrequently Asked Questions About Management Directive- 715,\u201d wherein EEOC said \u201cThe EEOC determined that the PATCOB  categories are outdated, overly broad and too imprecise to allow the  level of analysis desired.\u201d In that same guidance, EEOC also said it  adopted the same nine occupational categories for use in analyzing the  federal workforce to conform with occupational categories on the  EEO-1 report used by private employees in reporting information to  EEOC in order to provide more useful information and facilitate  comparisons between the federal and private sectors. We have  modified the report to reflect this. 7. We agree that MD-715 requires that agencies gather and analyze data on  applicants\u2019 race, national origin, gender, and disabilities and provides a  form for reporting the data gathered. However, in its instructions,  EEOC did not provide guidance to agencies on how they should collect  such data from applicants, which can only be collected voluntarily, or  provide a form that agencies could use to request information from  applicants. At the time of our review, no written guidance had been  issued in this regard. As we state in our report, EEOC provided verbal  guidance when requested by individual agencies.  8. This phrase \u201cpolicy inconsistencies and disagreements\u201d appears in the  summary of the recommendations in the Results in Brief section of the  report. The inconsistencies and disagreements are discussed in the  report. These include inconsistencies between EEOC and OPM in how  federal occupations are categorized for analytical purposes and  disagreement on the need and authority to collect race and national  origin data from applicants for employment.  9. EEOC commented that further information is needed with regard to  our discussion about the occupational categories and applicant flow  data. This discussion is intended to illustrate the existence of policy  disagreements and differences between EEOC and OPM. The  comments to which EEOC refer were made to us by OPM, and were  explicitly attributed to OPM in our report. That these differences exist  further illustrates the lack of coordination and collaboration between  EEOC and OPM, and they are among the issues we recommend that the  two agencies resolve.", "We clarified the report to include a reference to the Uniform  Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures. 10. EEOC\u2019s discussion of the technical assistance it provides does not  directly address the findings in our report that, as of the time of our  survey in the fall of 2004, some EEO and human capital managers did  not consider EEO guidance to be useful, and a substantial number did  not consider EEOC feedback to be useful.", "EEOC\u2019s Strategic Plan for Fiscal Year 2004-2009 states that as a  means of assessing its performance, the agency will survey federal  agency leadership to assess how EEOC's evaluations enable agencies  to improve their EEO programs. This survey, when it is done, will be  one means of providing EEOC with more current and comprehensive  information on agency views concerning the effectiveness of its  guidance and feedback. 11. The fiscal year 2004 data were used to describe the proportion of the  federal workforce employed at the agencies at the time of our survey."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on OPM\u2019s letter dated April 21, 2006."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. We are not recommending that OPM go beyond its statutory authority  and do not assume areas of overlap to be dysfunctional and unintended.  Our recommendations are intended to help EEOC and OPM develop  means to cooperate and collaborate in gathering information from  agencies to identify opportunities to reduce the administrative  requirements on agencies while satisfying existing EEO framework  requirements.  2. We neither recommend that EEOC and OPM merge into a collective  approach nor recommend that Congress require EEOC and OPM to  adopt the recommendations we make in this report. We recommended  that Congress require EEOC and OPM to report annually on actions  taken or planned to increase coordination and communications with  each other, streamline like requirements and resolve inconsistencies  where appropriate, and improve guidance and feedback to agencies. 3. We acknowledge in our report that there are differences in EEOC\u2019s and  OPM\u2019s responsibilities. In the draft provided to OPM for its comment,  we state that OPM\u2019s mission is to build a high-quality and diverse  federal workforce and that under title 5 of the U.S. Code, OPM is  responsible for executing, administering, and enforcing civil service  laws and regulations in the executive branch, including the merit  system principles that require fair and equitable treatment and equal  opportunity and prohibit discrimination in all aspects of federal  employment. The differences in EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s responsibilities,  however, should not preclude the two agencies from exploring, and  taking advantage of, opportunities for coordination and cooperation in  areas of common interest in the oversight of EEO in federal agencies.", "4.", "In our discussion of duplication of efforts, we were mindful of the legal  distinctions between the various components of the EEO framework.  See comment 3. 5. OPM expressed concern over use of the phrase \u201caffirmative  employment,\u201d stating that the phrase may be misunderstood as relating  to past EEO programs that have come under criticism and are the  subject of ongoing litigation involving allegations of improper  preferential treatment. We are aware of case law that has addressed  federal EEO policies or practices and the issue of improper preferential  treatment, as well as the ongoing litigation involving allegations of  preferential treatment related to affirmative employment plans which  date back to superseded management directives issued by EEOC.  However, under the federal antidiscrimination statutes, the federal  sector remains obligated to go beyond merely addressing complaints of  alleged discrimination\u2014to take positive (affirmative) steps to ensure  EEO. It is this federal sector obligation to which we refer when we use  the phrase \u201caffirmative employment.\u201d Further, OPM expresses concern  about our reference to \u201cworkforce diversity.\u201d We do not believe our use  of the term \u201cworkforce diversity\u201d is unique or inconsistent with OPM\u2019s  broad policies in the area. Rather, as our definition clearly provides,  workforce diversity is a very broad concept and is not limited to  recognizing the differences protected from discrimination by statute.  6. We have added a footnote to page 1 referring readers to the definition  later in the report. 7. We have modified the report in line with OPM\u2019s comment. 8. Please see comment 5 above regarding our use of the term \u201caffirmative  employment.\u201d While OPM specifically objects to our characterization of  MD-715 as an affirmative employment program, EEOC, in its  comments, raised no objections to our use of this phrase as it relates to  MD-715, or otherwise. 9. The statements referred to by OPM are the comments of agency EEO  and human capital officials who filled out our survey. They are intended  to illustrate the survey results. We did not independently evaluate the  validity of the statements made in the comments, and they are not  presented as facts or as findings. 10. We have made a change in accordance with OPM\u2019s comment. 11. We understand that OPM and EEOC do not carry out identical reviews;  however, workforce diversity issues share a common foundation with  EEO issues, which in our view creates the opportunity for cooperation  and coordination in oversight. It is important that staff performing  work in these areas have an awareness of efforts of the other agency so  that their individual and collective efforts could be more efficient. 12. We have changed the wording in accordance with OPM\u2019s comment.  13. We have changed table 1 in accordance with OPM\u2019s comment. 14. Executive Order No. 13171 mandates that \u201cthe head of each executive  department and agency shall establish and maintain a program for the  recruitment and career development of Hispanics in Federal  employment.\u201d In the Fifth Annual Report to the President on Hispanic  Employment in the Federal Government, dated February 16, 2006, OPM  said it asked federal agencies to identify human capital practices they  found effective in recruiting Hispanics.  15. We have modified the discussion of the PMA in the report to clarify our  source, in accordance with OPM\u2019s comments. (We are referring to the  scorecard the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) uses to assess  agencies\u2019 implementation of the PMA, commonly referred to as the  \u201cPMA scorecard\u201d that contains the standard of reducing  underrepresentation and sustaining workforce diversity.) 16. We have changed the title of table 2 in accordance with OPM\u2019s  comments. With regard to OPM\u2019s point that the combination of \u201csome,  little, or no extent\u201d seems broad, our methodology specialists have  advised that collapsing \u201csome extent\u201d with \u201clittle or no extent\u201d is a  common practice. We have clarified this in appendix I. 17. The reference to \u201ccommon features\u201d was part of the two survey  questions on whether any two of the specific requirements listed were  in fact similar or redundant, and refers to those requirements.", "While it is true that OPM now supplies agencies with Central Personnel  Data File (CPDF) workforce data for their FEORP reports, agencies are  still obligated to analyze these data to assess their workforces under  FEORP requirements and respond to OPM\u2019s requests for information.  18. As stated in our report, we were informed by agency EEO and human  capital managers that they have to make separate efforts for each  reporting requirement and consider this a significant burden. OPM and  EEOC, in their roles as leadership agencies, should work together to  understand how their collective requirements affect agencies and  explore how administrative burdens on agencies could be reduced. 19. We have modified the report to more fully explain EEOC\u2019s requirements  as they relate to OMB\u2019s revised standards for race and ethnicity  classification. 20. We have removed the comment which cited the categories which have  since been revised. 21. We have modified the report in accordance with OPM\u2019s comment. 22. We have modified the report in accordance with OPM\u2019s comment. 23. We have added more specific information concerning the NPR\u2019s  recommendations to the report.  24. We have modified the report to attribute the comment directly to the  NPR. 25. We have modified our discussion of the handbook to reflect OPM\u2019s  comment.  26. We understood OPM\u2019s comments about changing URLs, but believe that  it is more convenient for Web users to be able to go directly to the  relevant EEOC page than to go to a home page and search for needed  information. We believe that necessary changes in the links can be done  by coordination between OPM and EEOC Web managers. 27. We do not believe that EEOC\u2019s and OPM\u2019s responsibilities are so  different that these agencies could not explore the opportunity to  conduct joint oversight reviews, which may not necessarily entail doing  all audit work jointly. We also do not believe that such joint efforts  would, in and of themselves, compromise the confidentiality of OPM\u2019s  oversight work. Moreover, joint efforts would involve both EEO and  human capital staff at agencies and, in this way, could help foster  collaboration between agency EEO and human capital staff. 28. In our report, we counted as responding positively to EEOC or OPM  guidance and feedback only those respondents who answered \u201cuseful\u201d  or \u201cvery useful\u201d to the relevant questions. We regarded \u201csomewhat  useful\u201d as a response that did not indicate satisfaction with EEOC or  OPM guidance and feedback. 29.
