Since GAO last reported on the status of these programs in June 2019, each program has made progress. For example, the Orion program conducted a key test to demonstrate the ability to abort a mission should a life-threatening failure occur during launch. As GAO found in June 2019, however, the programs continue to face significant schedule delays. In November 2018, within one year of announcing an up to 19-month delay for the three programs\u2014the Space Launch System (SLS) vehicle, the Orion crew spacecraft, and Exploration Ground Systems (EGS)\u2014NASA senior leaders acknowledged the revised launch date of June 2020 is unlikely. In addition, any issues uncovered during integration and testing may push the date as late as June 2021. Moreover, GAO found that NASA's calculations of cost growth for the SLS program is understated by more than 750 million dollars.", "GAO's past work has identified a number of lessons that NASA can apply to improve its management of its human spaceflight programs. For example, NASA should enhance contract management and oversight to improve program outcomes. NASA's past approach in this area has left it ill-positioned to identify early warning signs of impending schedule delays and cost growth or reap the benefits of competition. In addition, NASA's approach to incentivizing contractors through contract award fees did not result in desired outcomes for the SLS and Orion programs. Further, NASA should minimize risky programmatic decisions to better position programs for successful execution. This includes providing sufficient cost and schedule reserves to, among other things, address unforseen risk. Finally, realistic cost estimates and assessments of technical risk are particularly important at the start of an acquisition program. But NASA has historically provided little insight into the future cost of these human spaceflight programs, limiting the information useful to decision makers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made 19 recommendations in these eight prior reports to strengthen NASA's acquisition management of SLS, Orion, and EGS.

We  reported that the agency has not taken action on several  recommendations related to understanding the long-term costs of its human exploration programs. For example, EGS and SLS do not have a  cost and schedule baseline that covers activities beyond the first planned  flight, and Orion does not have a baseline beyond the second planned  flight. We have previously reported that without transparency into these  estimates, NASA does not have the data to assess long-term affordability  and it may be difficult for Congress to make informed budgetary  decisions.

To conduct our prior work on  the cost and schedule performance of these programs, we compared cost  and schedule estimates that were current as of the reporting timeframes  in our June 2019 report to their original cost and schedule baselines,  analyzed quarterly program status reports, interviewed NASA program  and headquarters officials, and reviewed program documentation. To  identify lessons that can be applied to NASA\u2019s management of human  spaceflight programs, we reviewed issues and recommendations made in  our prior reports such as those related to approaches to managing  contractors and incentivizing contractor performance, the quality of the  cost and schedule estimates, and long-term cost estimates.

Then, in 2012, NASA aligned the  requirements for the Orion program with those of the newly created SLS  and EGS programs. Figure 1 provides details about each SLS hardware  element and its source as well as identifies the major portions of the  Orion spacecraft."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "History of Program Cost and Schedule Changes", "paragraphs": ["In order to facilitate Congressional oversight and track program progress,  NASA establishes an agency baseline commitment\u2014the cost and  schedule baselines against which the program may be measured\u2014for all  projects that have a total life cycle cost of $250 million or more. NASA  refers to these projects as major projects or programs. When the NASA  Administrator determines that development cost growth within a major  project or program is likely to exceed the development cost estimate by  15 percent or more, or a program milestone is likely to be delayed from  the baseline\u2019s date by 6 months or more, NASA replans the project and  submits a report to this committee\u2014the Committee on Science, Space,  and Technology of the House of Representatives\u2014and the Committee on  Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate. Should a major  project or program exceed its development cost baseline by more than 30  percent, the program must be reauthorized by the Congress and  rebaselined by NASA in order for the contractor to continue work beyond  a specified time frame. NASA tied the SLS and EGS program cost and  schedule baselines to the uncrewed first mission\u2014known now as  Artemis-1\u2014originally planned for November 2018. The Orion program\u2019s  cost and schedule baselines are tied to a crewed second mission\u2014known  as Artemis-2\u2014planned for April 2023.", "In April 2017, we found that given combined effects of ongoing technical  challenges in conjunction with limited cost and schedule reserves, it was  unlikely that these three programs would achieve the originally committed  November 2018 launch readiness date. Cost reserves are for costs that  are expected to be incurred\u2014for instance, to address project risks\u2014but  are not yet allocated to a specific part of the project. Schedule reserves  are extra time in project schedules that can be allocated to specific  activities, elements, and major subsystems to mitigate delays or address  unforeseen risks. We recommended that NASA confirm whether the  November 2018 launch readiness date was achievable and, if warranted,  propose a new, more realistic Artemis-1 date and report to Congress on  the results of its schedule analysis. NASA agreed with both  recommendations and stated that it was no longer in its best interest to  pursue the November 2018 launch readiness date. Subsequently, NASA  approved a new Artemis-1 schedule of December 2019, with 6 months of  schedule reserve available to extend the date to June 2020, and revised  the costs that it expects to incur (see table 1)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Cost and Schedule Status of NASA\u2019s Human Spaceflight Programs", "paragraphs": ["In June 2019, we found that within 1 year of announcing a delay for the  first human spaceflight mission, senior NASA officials acknowledged that  the revised Artemis-1 launch date of December 2019 was unachievable  and the June 2020 launch date (which takes into account schedule  reserves) was unlikely. These officials estimated that there were 6 to 12  months of schedule risk associated with this later date, which means the  first launch may occur as late as June 2021 if all risks are realized. As we  found in June 2019, this would be a 31-month delay from the schedule  originally established in the programs\u2019 baselines. Officials attributed the  additional schedule delay to continued production challenges with the  SLS core stage and the Orion crew and service modules. NASA officials  also stated that the 6 to 12 months of risk to the launch date accounts for  the possibilities that SLS and Orion testing and final cross-program  integration and testing at Kennedy Space Center may result in further  delays. As we noted in our report, these 6 to 12 months of schedule risk  do not include the effects, if any, of the federal government shutdown that  occurred in December 2018 and January 2019.", "In commenting on our June 2019 report, NASA stated that its Lunar 2024  planning activities would include an Artemis-1 schedule assessment.  However, in July 2019, NASA reassigned its senior leaders responsible  for human spaceflight programs. The NASA Administrator stated in  August 2019 that, as a result, the agency does not plan to finalize  schedule plans for Artemis-1 until new leadership is in place at the  agency. Additional details follow on the status of each program, including  cost, schedule, and technical challenges.", "SLS. As we found in June 2019, ongoing development issues with the  SLS core stage\u2014which includes four main engines and the software  necessary to command and control the vehicle\u2014contributed to the SLS  program not being able to meet the June 2020 launch date. Officials  from the SLS program and Boeing, the contractor responsible for building  the core stage, provided several reasons for the delays. These reasons  include the underestimation of the complexity of manufacturing and  assembling the core stage engine section\u2014where the RS-25 engines are  mated to the core stage\u2014and those activities have taken far longer than  expected.", "Since our June 2019 report, based on our review of the program\u2019s most  recent status reports, NASA has reported progress across many parts of  the SLS program. For example, NASA has delivered the four RS-25  engines to Michoud Assembly Facility. NASA has also completed  qualification testing of all components of the boosters and reports that  there is schedule margin remaining for the booster deliverables. In  addition, NASA reports that Boeing has made continued progress and  expects that the core stage will be complete and ready for testing in  December 2019. Completion of the core stage will represent a significant  milestone for the program.", "In June 2019, we found that that SLS program has been underreporting  its development cost growth since the December 2017 replan. This  underreporting is because of a decision to shift some costs to future  missions while not adjusting the baseline costs downward to reflect this  shift. The SLS development cost baseline established in August 2014 for  Artemis-1 includes cost estimates for the main vehicle elements\u2014stages,  liquid engines, boosters\u2014and other areas. According to program officials,  because of the December 2017 replan process, NASA decided that costs  included as part of the SLS Artemis-1 baseline cost estimate would be  more appropriately accounted for as costs for future flights. Thus, NASA  decided not to include those costs, approximately $782 million, as part of  the revised SLS Artemis-1 cost estimate. However, NASA did not lower  the $7 billion SLS development cost baseline to account for this  significant change in assumptions and shifting of costs to future flights.", "This decision presents challenges in accurately reporting SLS cost growth  over time. NASA\u2019s decision not to adjust the cost baseline downward to  reflect the reduced mission scope obscures cost growth for Artemis-1. In  June 2019, we found that NASA\u2019s cost estimate as of fourth quarter fiscal  year 2018 for the SLS program indicated development cost growth had  increased by $1 billion, or 14.7 percent. However, our analysis showed  that development cost growth actually increased by $1.8 billion or 29.0  percent, when the development baseline is lowered to account for the  reduced mission scope. Essentially, NASA is holding the baseline costs  steady, while reducing the scope of work included in current cost  estimates (see figure 2). As NASA determines its new schedule for the  first mission, it is likely this cost growth will increase as additional time in  the schedule leads to additional costs.", "In our June 2019 report, we recommended that the SLS program  calculate its development cost growth using a baseline that is  appropriately adjusted for scope and costs NASA has determined are not  associated with the first flight, and determine if the development cost  growth has increased by 30 percent or more. NASA agreed with the  recommendation and NASA officials stated that they plan to implement  the recommendation when new leadership is in place for the human  space exploration programs.", "Looking ahead, based on our review of the program\u2019s most recent status  reports, completing core stage manufacturing and integration and green  run testing will be the critical path\u2014the path of longest duration through  the sequence of activities in the schedule\u2014for the SLS program. During  green run testing, NASA will fuel the completed core stage with liquid  hydrogen and liquid oxygen and fire the integrated four main engines for  about 500 seconds. The green run test carries risks because it is the first  time that several things are being done beyond just this initial fueling. For  example, it is also the first time NASA will fire the four main engines  together, test the integrated engine and core stage auxiliary power units  in flight-like conditions, and use the SLS software in an integrated flight  vehicle. In addition, NASA will conduct the test on the Artemis-1 flight  vehicle hardware, which means the program would have to repair any  damage from the test before flight.", "Orion. While the Orion program\u2019s schedule performance is measured  only to the Artemis-2 mission, we found in June 2019 that the program  was not on schedule to support the June 2020 launch date for the first  mission. This was due to delays with the European Service Module and  component issues for the avionics systems for the crew module, including  issues discovered during testing. We found that these specific problems  were resolved by the time of our report, but had already contributed to the  inability of the program to meet the June 2020 launch date. Since we last  reported, as of August 2019, the Orion program has completed significant  events including completing the crew module and the service module  prior to integration and conducting a test to demonstrate the ability to  abort a mission should a life-threatening failure occur during launch. The  program is tracking no earlier than October 2020 for an Artemis-1 launch  date but that does not reflect the ongoing agency-wide schedule  assessment noted above.", "In June 2019, we found that the Orion program has reported development  cost growth but is not measuring that growth using a complete cost  estimate. In summer 2018, the Orion program reported development  cost growth of $379 million, or 5.6 percent above its $6.768 billion  development cost estimate. Program officials explained that the major  drivers of this cost growth were the slip of the Artemis-1 launch date,  which reflected delays in the delivery of the service module; Orion  contractor underperformance; and NASA-directed scope increase.", "However, during our review, Orion program officials originally stated that  this cost estimate assumes an Artemis-2 launch date of September 2022,  which is 7 months earlier than the program\u2019s agency baseline  commitment date of April 2023 that forms the basis for commitments  between NASA, the Congress, and Office of Management and Budget.", "Subsequently, during the review, program officials told us that its cost  projections fund one of those 7 months. In either case, NASA\u2019s current  cost estimate for the Orion program is not complete because it does not  account for costs that NASA would incur through April 2023. As of  September 2019, the program was targeting October 2022 for the  Artemis-2 launch.", "In June 2019, we recommended that the Orion program update its cost  estimate to reflect its committed Artemis-2 baseline date of April 2023.  In its response, NASA partially agreed with our recommendation. NASA  stated that providing the estimate to the forecasted launch date\u2014 September 2022\u2014rather than to the committed baseline date of April  2023 is the most appropriate approach. However, by developing cost  estimates only to the program\u2019s goals and not relative to the established  baseline, the Orion program is not providing NASA or the Congress the  means of measuring progress relative to the baseline. We continue to  believe that NASA should fully implement this recommendation.", "Looking ahead, based on our review of the program\u2019s most recent status  reports, there is an emerging issue that may delay schedule further for  the first mission. Namely, there is the risk of damage to the Orion capsule  during travel to and from integrated testing at Plum Brook Station in Ohio.  The program office is studying whether it will be able to safely transport  the integrated crew and service modules via the Super Guppy airplane as  planned or if it will have to use an alternate airplane. We will continue to  monitor this effort.", "Beyond Artemis-1, the Orion program must also complete development  efforts for future missions. For example, the Artemis-2 crew module will  need environmental control and life support systems, system updates  from Artemis-1, and updated software to run these new elements.", "EGS. At the time of our June 2019 report, the EGS program was  expecting to have facilities and software ready by the planned June 2020  launch date. We found that the program had overcome many  challenging development hurdles that led to previous schedule delays.  These hurdles included completing and moving the Mobile Launcher\u2014a  platform that carries the rocket to the launch pad and includes a number  of connection lines that provide SLS and Orion with power,  communications, coolant, fuel, and stabilization prior to launch\u2014into the  Vehicle Assembly Building for the multi-element verification and validation  processes. Since our June 2019 report, the program is now targeting an  Artemis-1 launch date of August 2020. According to NASA officials, the  delay is primarily driven by challenges encountered installing ground  support equipment on the Mobile Launcher and developing software, and  does not reflect the ongoing agency-wide schedule assessment. The  program has operated within the costs established for the June 2020  launch date, $3.2 billion, but officials stated that NASA is reevaluating the  program\u2019s development cost performance and will establish an updated  baseline when new leadership is in place.", "Moving forward, based on our review of the program\u2019s most recent status  reports, the program has to complete the multi-element verification and  validation process for the Mobile Launcher and Vehicle Assembly  Building and complete its two software development efforts. Additionally,  the EGS program is responsible for the final integration of the three  programs. NASA officials stated that the 6 to 12 months of risk to the  June 2020 launch date includes risk associated with EGS completing this  integration that includes test and checkout procedures after SLS and  Orion components arrive. Officials explained that the EGS risk is based  on a schedule risk analysis that considered factors such as historical pre- launch integrated test and check out delays and the learning curve  associated with a new vehicle. As previously stated, our prior work has  shown that the integration and test phase often reveals unforeseen  challenges leading to cost growth and schedule delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons that NASA Can Apply to Better Manage its Human Spaceflight Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["NASA is currently embarking on an aggressive goal to return humans to  the lunar surface in 2024. To achieve this goal, NASA not only needs  SLS, Orion, and EGS to have completed their first two test missions, but  is also developing several new systems. These new systems include a  Lunar Gateway that will orbit the moon, landers that will transport  astronauts from the Gateway to the lunar surface, and new space suits.", "Human spaceflight projects face inherent technical, design, and  integration risks because they are complex, specialized, and are pushing  the state of the art in space technology. Moreover, these programs can  be very costly and span many years, which means they may also face  changes in direction from Administrations and the Congress. Meeting the  2024 goal will also be challenging given the effort needed to better  manage SLS, Orion, and EGS, coupled with the addition of the new  programs, which are likely to compete for management attention and  resources. Nevertheless, our past work has identified a range of actions  that NASA can take to better position its human spaceflight programs for  success.", "Today I would like to highlight three lessons from the SLS, Orion, and  EGS programs that NASA can apply to improve the management of its  human spaceflight programs.", "Enhance Contract Management and Oversight to Improve Program  Outcomes. Over the past several years, we and the NASA Office of the  Inspector General have identified shortcomings related to NASA\u2019s  management and oversight of its human spaceflight contracts. These  shortcomings have left NASA ill-positioned to identify early warning signs  of impending schedule delays and cost growth, reap the potential benefits  of competition, and achieve desired results through contractor incentives.", "In July 2014, we found that NASA allowed high-value modifications to  the SLS contracts to remain undefinitized for extended periods\u2014in  one instance a modification remained undefinitized for 30 months.  Undefinitized contract actions such as these authorize contractors to  begin work before reaching a final agreement with the government on  terms and conditions. We have previously found that while  undefinitized contract actions may be necessary under certain  circumstances, they are considered risky in part because the  government may incur unnecessary costs if requirements change  before the contract action is definitized. Because lack of agreement  on terms of the modification prolonged NASA\u2019s timeframes for  definitizing, the establishment of contractor cost and schedule  baselines necessary to monitor performance was delayed.  Specifically, we found in July 2014 that, in most cases, the SLS  program did not receive complete earned value management data  derived from approved baselines on these SLS contracts. Earned  value, or the planned cost of completed work and work in progress,  can provide accurate assessments of project progress, produce early  warning signs of impending schedule delays and cost overruns, and  provide unbiased estimates of anticipated costs at completion.", "In July 2014, we also found the SLS program could be in a favorable  position to compete contracts for the exploration upper stage, the  upper stage engine, and advanced boosters that it expected to use on  future variants of the launch vehicle. At that time, except for the RS- 25 engines, NASA\u2019s contracting approach for the SLS program did not  commit the program beyond the hardware needed for the second  mission, and we found that moving forward the agency would be in a  position to take advantage of the evolving launch vehicle market. We  found that an updated assessment of the launch vehicle market could  better position NASA to sustain competition, control costs, and better  inform the Congress about the long-term affordability of the program.  We recommended that before finalizing acquisition plans for future  capability variants, NASA should assess the full range of competition  opportunities and provide to the Congress the agency\u2019s assessment  of the extent to which development and production of future elements  of the SLS could be competitively procured. NASA agreed with the  recommendation, which we have identified as among those that  warrant priority attention.", "Since we made that recommendation, NASA has awarded a sole- source contract for the upper stage engine and agency officials told us  in July 2018 that they planned to incorporate additional booster  development under the existing contract. This further limits an  opportunity for competition for the program. Our body of work on  contracting has shown that competition in contracting is a key element  for achieving the best return on investment for taxpayers. We have  found that promoting competition increases the potential for acquiring  quality goods and services at a lower price and that noncompetitive  contracts carry the risk of overspending because, among other  reasons, they have been negotiated without the benefit of competition  to help establish pricing.", "In July 2016, we found that the lack of earned value management  data for the SLS Boeing core stage contract persisted. Without this  information, some 4.5 years after contract award, the program  continued to be in a poor position to understand the extent to which  technical challenges with the core stage were having schedule  implications or the extent to which they may have required reaching  into the program\u2019s cost reserves.", "In October 2018, the NASA Office of Inspector General reported that  NASA does not require Boeing to report detailed information on  development costs for the two core stages and exploration upper  stage, making it difficult for the agency to determine if the contractor is  meeting cost and schedule commitments for each deliverable. The  NASA Office of Inspector General found that given the cost-reporting  structure, the agency is unable to determine the cost of a single core  stage. Internally, Boeing tracks all individual costs but submits a  combined statement of labor hours and material costs through the one  contract line item for all its development activities. NASA  approximates costs based on numerous monthly and quarterly  reviews with the contractor to track the progress of each individual  deliverable. The NASA Office of Inspector General made a number of  recommendations aimed at improving reporting relative to the core  stage contract. Among these was a specific recommendation to  separate each deliverable into its own contract line item number for  tracking performance, cost, and award fees. NASA concurred with this  recommendation and is currently renegotiating the core stage contract  with Boeing.", "In June 2019, we found that NASA\u2019s approach to incentivizing Boeing  for the SLS stages and Lockheed Martin for the Orion crew spacecraft  have not always achieved overall desired program outcomes. NASA  paid over $200 million in award fees from 2014-2018 related to  contractor performance on the SLS stages and Orion spacecraft  contracts, but the programs continue to fall behind schedule and incur  cost overruns. For example, in its December 2018 award fee letter to  Boeing in which the contractor earned over $17 million in award fees,  NASA\u2019s fee determination official noted that the significant schedule  delays on this contract have caused NASA to restructure the flight  manifest for SLS. For the Lockheed Martin Orion contract, the  contractor earned over $29 million for the award fee period ending  April 2017. NASA noted that Lockheed Martin was not able to  maintain its schedule for the crew service module and that the  contractor\u2019s schedule performance had decreased significantly over  the previous year.", "In June 2019, we reported that our past work shows that when  incentive contracts are properly structured, the contractor has profit  motive to keep costs low, deliver a product on time, and make  decisions that help ensure the quality of the product. Our prior work  also shows, however, that incentives are not always effective tools for  achieving desired acquisition outcomes. We have found that, in some  cases, there are significant disconnects between contractor  performance for which the contractor was awarded the majority of  award fees possible without achieving desired program results.  Additionally, we have found that some agencies did not have  methods, data, or performance measures to evaluate the  effectiveness of award fees.", "As part of our June 2019 report, we recommended that NASA direct  the SLS and Orion programs to reevaluate their strategies for  incentivizing contractors and determine whether they could more  effectively incentivize contractors to achieve the outcomes intended  as part of ongoing and planned contract negotiations. NASA agreed  with the intent of this recommendation and stated that the SLS and  Orion program offices reevaluate their strategies for incentivizing  contract performance as part of contracting activities including  contract restructures, contract baseline adjustments, and new contract  actions. We will continue to follow-up on the actions the agency is  taking to address this recommendation after its ongoing contract  negotiations are complete.", "Minimize Risky Programmatic Decisions to Better Position  Programs for Successful Execution. Through our reviews of  NASA\u2019s human spaceflight programs, we have found that NASA  leadership has approved programmatic decisions that compound  technical challenges. These decisions include approving cost and  schedule baselines that do not follow best practices, establishing  insufficient cost and schedule reserves, and operating under  aggressive schedules. As a result, these programs have been at risk  of cost growth and schedule delays since NASA approved their  baselines.", "In July 2015, we found that NASA generally followed best practices in  preparing the SLS cost and schedule baseline estimates for the  limited portion of the program life cycle covered through launch  readiness for the first test flight of SLS. However, we could not deem  the cost estimate fully reliable because it did not fully meet the  credibility best practice. While an independent NASA office reviewed  the cost estimate developed by the program and as a result the  program made some adjustments, officials did not commission the  development of a separate independent cost estimate to compare to  the program cost estimate to identify areas of discrepancy or  difference. In addition, the program did not cross-check its cost  estimate using an alternative methodology. The purpose of  developing a separate independent cost estimate and cross-checking  the estimate is to test the program\u2019s cost estimate for reasonableness  and, ultimately, to validate the cost estimate.", "In July 2016, we found that the Orion program\u2019s cost and schedule  estimates were not reliable based on best practices for producing  high-quality estimates. For example, the cost estimate lacked  necessary support and the schedule estimate did not include the level  of detail required for high-quality estimates. Therefore, we  recommended that NASA perform an updated joint cost and schedule  confidence level analysis including updating cost and schedule  estimates in adherence with cost and schedule estimating best  practices, which we have identified as among those recommendations  that warrant priority. NASA officials have stated that they have no  plans to implement our recommendation. In commenting on the July  2016 report, NASA stated that the agency reviewed, in detail, the  Orion integrated cost/schedule and risk analysis methodology and  determined the rigor to be a sufficient basis for the agency  commitments. However, without sound cost and schedule estimates,  decision makers do not have a clear understanding of the cost and  schedule risk inherent in the program or important information needed  to make programmatic decisions. We continue to believe that NASA  should fully implement our recommendation.", "In our 2017 High-Risk Report, we highlighted concerns that all three  programs\u2014SLS, Orion, and EGS\u2014were operating with limited cost  reserves, limiting each program\u2019s ability to address risks and  unforeseen technical challenges. For example, we found in July  2016 that the Orion program was planning to maintain low levels of  cost reserves until later in the program. The lack of cost reserves at  that time had caused the program to defer work to address technical  issues to stay within budget.", "Also in our 2017 High-Risk Report, we highlighted concerns regarding  each program managing to an aggressive internal NASA launch  readiness date. This approach creates an environment for programs  to make decisions based on reduced knowledge to meet a date that is  not realistic. For example, the EGS program had consolidated future  schedule activities to prepare the Mobile Launcher\u2014the vehicle used  to bring SLS to the launch pad\u2014to meet its internal goal. The program  acknowledged that consolidating activities\u2014which included  conducting verification and validation concurrent with installation  activities\u2014increased risk because of uncertainties about how systems  not yet installed may affect the systems already installed. Officials  added, however, that this concurrency is necessary to meet the  internal schedule. Subsequently, as discussed above, NASA delayed  its committed launch readiness date.", "Improve Transparency into Costs for Long-term Plans. As we  previously reported, a key best practice for development efforts is that  requirements need to be matched to resources (for example, time,  money, and people) at program start. In the past, we have found that  NASA programs, including the Constellation Program, did not have  sufficient funding to match demanding requirements. Funding gaps can  cause programs to delay or delete important activities and thereby  increase risks.", "In addition, since May 2014, we have found there has been a lack of  transparency into the long-term costs of these human spaceflight  programs. As discussed above, the EGS and SLS programs do not  have a cost and schedule baseline that covers activities beyond the first  planned flight. In addition, as previously noted, the Orion program does  not have a baseline beyond the second planned flight. As a result, NASA  is now committing to spend billions of taxpayer dollars for missions that  do not have a cost and schedule baseline against which to assess  progress.", "To that end, we have made recommendations in the past on the need for  NASA to baseline these programs\u2019 costs for capabilities beyond the first  mission; however, a significant amount of time has passed without NASA  taking steps to fully implement these recommendations. Specifically,  among those recommendations that we have identified as warranting  priority attention, in May 2014, we recommended that, to provide  Congress with the necessary insight into program affordability, ensure its  ability to effectively monitor total program costs and execution, and to  facilitate investment decisions, NASA should:", "Establish a separate cost and schedule baseline for work required to  support the SLS for the second mission and report this information to  the Congress through NASA\u2019s annual budget submission. If NASA  decides to fly the SLS configuration used in the second mission  beyond that mission, we recommended that it establish separate life  cycle cost and schedule baseline estimates for those efforts, to  include funding for operations and sustainment, and report this  information annually to Congress via the agency\u2019s budget submission.", "Establish separate cost and schedule baselines for each additional  capability that encompass all life cycle costs, to include operations  and sustainment. This is important because NASA intends to use the  increased capabilities of the SLS, Orion, and EGS well into the future.", "As part of the latter recommendation, we stated that, when NASA could  not fully specify costs due to lack of well-defined missions or flight  manifests, the agency instead should forecast a cost estimate range\u2014 including life cycle costs\u2014having minimum and maximum boundaries and  report these baselines or ranges annually to Congress via the agency\u2019s  budget submission.", "In its comments on our 2014 report, NASA partially concurred with these  two recommendations, noting that much of what it had already done or  expected to do would address them. For example, the agency stated  that establishing the three programs as separate efforts with individual  cost and schedule commitments met the intent of our recommendation.  NASA also stated that its plans to track and report development,  operations, and sustainment costs in its budget to Congress as the  capabilities evolved would also meet the intent of the recommendation. In  our response, we stated that while NASA\u2019s prior establishment of three  separate programs lends some insight into expected costs and schedule  at the broader program level, it does not meet the intent of the two  recommendations because cost and schedule identified at that level is  unlikely to provide the detail necessary to monitor the progress of each  block against a baseline. Further, we stated that reporting the costs via  the budget process alone will not provide information about potential  costs over the long term because budget requests neither offer all the  same information as life-cycle cost estimates nor serve the same  purpose. Life-cycle cost estimates establish a full accounting of all program costs for planning, procurement, operations and maintenance,  and disposal and provide a long-term means to measure progress over a  program\u2019s life span. We continue to believe that NASA should fully  implement these recommendations.", "As NASA considers these lessons, it is important that the programs place  a high priority on quality, for example, holding suppliers accountable to  deliver high-quality parts for their products through such activities as  regular supplier audits and performance evaluations of quality and  delivery. As we found in June 2019, both the SLS and Orion programs  have struggled at times with the quality of parts and components. For  example, the Orion contractor has had a number of issues with  subcontractor-supplied avionics system components failing during testing  that have required time to address. NASA has highlighted concerns over  the contractor\u2019s ability to manage its subcontractors and the resulting  significant cost, schedule, and technical risk impacts to the program. And  the SLS program faced setbacks after its contractor did not verify the  processes that its vendors were using to clean the fuel lines, resulting in  delays to resolve residue and debris issues.", "Chairwoman Horn, Ranking Member Babin, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my prepared statement.
