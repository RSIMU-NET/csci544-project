Most of Alaska's Native villages are located on the coast or on riverbanks. In addition to the many federal and Alaska state agencies that respond to flooding and erosion, Congress established the Denali Commission in 1998 to, among other things, provide economic development services and to meet infrastructure needs in rural Alaska communities. Congress directed GAO to study Alaska Native villages affected by flooding and erosion and to 1) determine the extent to which these villages are affected, 2) identify federal and state flooding and erosion programs, 3) determine the current status of efforts to respond to flooding and erosion in nine villages, and 4) identify alternatives that Congress may wish to consider when providing assistance for flooding and erosion."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Flooding and erosion affects 184 out of 213, or 86 percent, of Alaska Native villages to some extent. While many of the problems are long-standing, various studies indicate that coastal villages are becoming more susceptible to flooding and erosion due in part to rising temperatures. The Corps of Engineers and the Natural Resources Conservation Service administer key programs for constructing flooding and erosion control projects. However, small and remote Alaska Native villages often fail to qualify for assistance under these programs--largely because of agency requirements that the expected costs of the project not exceed its benefits. Even villages that do meet the cost/benefit criteria may still not receive assistance if they cannot meet the cost-share requirement for the project. Of the nine villages we were directed to review, four--Kivalina, Koyukuk, Newtok, and Shishmaref--are in imminent danger from flooding and erosion and are planning to relocate, while the remaining five are in various stages of responding to these problems. Costs for relocating are expected to be high. For example, the cost estimates for relocating Kivalina range from $100 million to over $400 million. Relocation is a daunting process that may take several years to accomplish. During that process, federal agencies must make wise investment decisions, yet GAO found instances where federal agencies invested in infrastructure at the villages' existing sites without knowledge of their plans to relocate. GAO, federal and state officials, and village representatives identified some alternatives that could increase service delivery for Alaska Native villages, although many important factors must first be considered: (1) expand the role of the Denali Commission; (2) direct federal agencies to consider social and environmental factors in their cost/benefit analyses; (3) waive the federal cost-sharing requirement for these projects, and (4) authorize the \"bundling\" of funds from various federal agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Alaska\u2019s shoreline is subject to periodic, yet severe, erosion. During these  episodes, over 100 feet of land can be lost in a single storm. The state also  has thousands of miles of riverbanks that are prone to annual flooding  during the spring thaw. These shorelines and riverbanks serve as home to  over 200 Native villages whose inhabitants hunt and fish for subsistence.  Coastal and river flooding and erosion cause millions of dollars of property  damage in Alaska Native villages, damaging or destroying homes, public  buildings, and airport runways. Because Alaska Native villages are often in  remote areas not accessible by roads, village airport runways are lifelines  for many villages, and any threat to the runways either from flooding or  erosion may be a threat to the villages\u2019 survival. Flooding and erosion can  also destroy meat drying racks and damage food cellars, threatening the  winter food supply and the traditional subsistence lifestyle of Alaska  Natives.", "Since 1977, the state, and in some cases the federal government, has  responded to more than 190 disaster emergencies in Alaska, many in  response to these problems. Several federal and state agencies are directly  or indirectly involved in providing assistance for flooding and erosion in  Alaska. In addition, the Denali Commission, created by Congress in 1998,  while not directly responsible for responding to flooding and erosion, is  charged with addressing crucial needs of rural Alaska communities, particularly isolated Alaska Native villages. The commission is composed  of a federal and a state cochair and representatives from local agencies, as  well as Alaska Native, public, and private entities. For fiscal year 2003, the  commission was provided with almost $99 million in federal funds to carry  out its mission. The purpose of the commission is to (1) deliver the services  of the federal government in the most cost-effective manner practicable;  (2) provide job training and other economic development services in rural  communities; and (3) promote rural development and provide  infrastructure such as water, sewer, and communication systems.", "The fiscal year 2003 Conference Report for the military construction  appropriation bill directed GAO to study Alaska Native villages affected by  flooding and erosion. In response to this direction and subsequent  discussions with your staff, we (1) determined the extent to which Alaska  Native villages are affected by flooding and erosion; (2) identified federal  and Alaska state programs that provide assistance for flooding and erosion  and assessed the extent to which federal assistance has been provided to  Alaska Native villages; (3) determined the status of efforts, including cost  estimates, to respond to flooding and erosion in select villages seriously  affected by flooding and erosion; and (4) identified alternatives that  Congress may wish to consider when providing assistance for flooding and  erosion of Alaska Native villages.", "To address the objectives for this report, we reviewed federal and state  flooding and erosion studies and project documents and interviewed  federal and state agency officials and representatives from each of the nine  villages.

The state is bound on three sides by water, and its coastline,  which stretches about 6,600 miles (excluding island shorelines, bays and  fjords) and accounts for more than half of the entire U.S. coastline, varies  from rocky shores, sandy beaches, and high cliffs to river deltas, mud flats,  and barrier islands. The coastline constantly changes due to wave action,  ocean currents, storms, and river deposits and is subject to periodic, yet  severe, erosion. Alaska also has more than 12,000 rivers, including three of  the ten largest in the country\u2014the Yukon, Kuskokwim, and Copper Rivers.   (See fig. 1.)  While these and other rivers provide food, transportation, and  recreation for people, as well as habitat for fish and wildlife, their waters  also shape the landscape. In particular, ice jams on rivers and flooding of  riverbanks during spring breakup change the contour of valleys, wetlands,  and human settlements.", "Permafrost (permanently frozen subsoil) is found over approximately 80  percent of Alaska. It is deepest and most extensive on the Arctic Coastal  Plain and decreases in depth, eventually becoming discontinuous further  south. In northern Alaska, where the permafrost is virtually everywhere,  most buildings are elevated to minimize the amount of heat transferred to  the ground to avoid melting the permafrost. In northern barrier island  communities, the permafrost literally helps hold the island together.  However, rising temperatures in recent years have led to widespread  thawing of the permafrost, causing serious damage. As permafrost melts,  buildings and runways sink, bulk fuel tank areas are threatened, and  slumping and erosion of land ensue. (See fig. 2.)", "Rising temperatures have also affected the thickness, extent, and duration  of sea ice that forms along the western and northern coasts. The loss of sea  ice leaves coasts more vulnerable to waves, storm surges, and erosion.  When combined with the thawing of permafrost along the coast, this loss of  sea ice poses a serious threat to coastal Alaska Native villages.  Furthermore, loss of sea ice alters the habitat and accessibility of many of  the marine mammals that Alaska Natives depend upon for subsistence. As  the ice melts or moves away early, walruses, seals, and polar bears move  with it, taking them too far away to be hunted.", "Although Alaska is by far the largest state, it is one of the least populated,  with about 630,000 people\u2014of which 19 percent, or about 120,000, are  Alaska Natives. Over half of the state\u2019s population is concentrated in the  Kenai Peninsula, Anchorage, and the Matanuska-Susitna area in south  central Alaska. Many Alaska Natives, however, live in places long inhabited  by their ancestors in rural areas in western, northern, and interior Alaska.  Alaskan Natives are generally divided into six major groupings: Unangan  (Aleuts), Alutiiq (Pacific Eskimos), I\u00f1upiat (Northern Eskimos), Yup\u2019ik  (Bering Sea Eskimos), Athabascan (Interior Indians), and Tlingit and Haida  (Southeast Coastal Indians). For generations, these Alaska Natives have  used the surrounding waters and land to hunt, fish, and gather wild plants  for food. (See fig. 3.)  These subsistence activities are intricately woven  into the fabric of their lives. Subsistence activities require a complex  network of social relationships within the Native community. For example,  there is a division of labor among those who harvest, those who prepare,  and those who distribute the food. These activities establish and promote  the basic values of Alaska Native culture\u2014generosity, respect for the  knowledge and guidance of elders, self-esteem for the successful hunter(s),  and community cooperation\u2014and they form the foundation for continuity  between generations. As their environment changes along with the climate,  however, Alaska Natives have few adaptive strategies, and their traditional  way of life is becoming increasingly vulnerable.", "A typical coastal or river Native village has a population of a couple of  hundred people and generally contains only basic infrastructure\u2014homes, a  school, a village store, a health clinic, a washateria, a church, city or tribal  offices, and a post office. The school is usually the largest building in the  community. Since many villages do not have running water, the washateria  plays an important role; it not only contains laundry facilities, but also  shower and toilet facilities\u2014which residents must pay a fee to use. Many  village homes do not have sanitation facilities and rely on honey buckets\u2014 5-gallon buckets that serve as a toilet\u2014or a flush and haul system. Most of  the villages that are not accessible by roads contain an airport runway that  provides the only year-round access to the community. The runways are  generally adjacent to the village or a short distance away. Other  infrastructure in a village may consist of a bulk fuel tank farm, a power  plant, a water treatment facility, a water tank, meat drying racks, a village  sewage lagoon or dump site, and, for some villages, commercial structures  such as tanneries. Most river villages also have a barge landing area where  goods are delivered to the community during the ice-free period."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multiple Entities Make Up the Alaska Native Village Governing Structure", "paragraphs": ["The government structure of Native villages may contain several distinct  entities that perform administrative tasks, including making decisions  about how to address flooding and erosion. Alaska\u2019s constitution and state  laws allow for several types of regional and local government units, such as  boroughs\u2014units of government that are similar to the counties found in  many other states. About a third of Alaska is made up of 16 organized  boroughs. The remaining two-thirds of the state is sparsely populated land  that is considered a single \u201cunorganized borough.\u201d At the village level, a  federally recognized tribal government may coexist with a city government,  which may also be under a borough government. Alaska has more than 200  federally recognized tribal governments.", "In addition to these various government entities, federal agencies that  provide assistance for flooding and erosion also work with local and  regional Native corporations. Federal law directed the establishment of  these corporations under the laws of the state of Alaska, and the  corporations are organized as for-profit entities that also have nonprofit  arms. In December 1971, Congress enacted the Alaska Native Claims  Settlement Act (ANCSA), which directed the establishment of 12 for-profit  regional corporations\u2014one for each geographic region comprised of  Natives having a common heritage and sharing common interests\u2014and  over 200 village corporations. These corporations would become the  vehicle for distributing land and monetary benefits to Alaska Natives to  provide a fair and just settlement of aboriginal land claims in Alaska. The  act permitted the conveyance of about 44 million acres of land to Alaska  Native corporations, along with cash payments of almost $1 billion. (See  appendix II for a list of the regional corporations and the corresponding  nonprofit arms that provide social services to the villages and also help  them address problems, including flooding and erosion.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Federal and State Agencies Are Responsible for Responding to Flooding and Erosion", "paragraphs": ["Federal, state, and local government agencies share responsibility for  controlling and responding to flooding and erosion.

The Department of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources  Conservation Service (NRCS) is responsible for protecting small  watersheds. A number of other federal agencies, such as the Departments  of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, also have  responsibility for protecting certain infrastructure from flooding and  erosion. On the state side, the Division of Emergency Services responds to  state disaster declarations dealing with flooding and erosion when local  communities request assistance. The Alaska Department of Community  and Economic Development helps communities reduce losses and damage  from flooding and erosion.

However,  it is difficult to assess the severity of the problem because quantifiable data  on flooding and erosion are not available for remote locations.

The 184 affected  villages consist of coastal and river villages throughout the state. Figure 4  shows the location of these villages, and table 1 shows the number of  affected villages by ANCSA region. All 184 Native villages affected by  flooding and erosion are listed in appendix III.", "Villages on the coast are affected by flooding and erosion from the sea. For  example, when these villages are not protected by sea ice, they are at risk  of flooding and erosion from storm surges. Lack of sea ice also increases  the distance over water, which can generate increased waves and storm  surges. In the case of Kivalina, the community has experienced erosion  from sea storms, particularly in late summer or fall. These storms can  result in a sea level rise of 10 feet or more, and when combined with high  tide, the storm surge becomes even greater and can be accompanied by  waves that contain ice. In addition to coastal villages, communities in low- lying areas along riverbanks or in river deltas are susceptible to flooding  and erosion caused by ice jams, snow and glacial melts, rising sea levels  and heavy rainfall. For example, the village of Aniak, on the Kuskokwim  River in southwestern Alaska, experiences flooding every 3 or 4 years. Ice  jams that form on the river during the spring breakup cause the most  frequent and severe floods in Aniak, sometimes accompanied by  streambank erosion from the ice flow. (See fig. 5.)", "Flooding and erosion are long-standing problems in Alaska. For example,  these problems have been well documented in Bethel, Unalakleet, and  Shishmaref dating back to the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, respectively. The  state has made several efforts to identify communities affected by flooding  and erosion over the past 30 years. In 1982, a state contractor developed a  list of Alaska communities affected by flooding and erosion. This list  identified 169 of the 213 Alaska Native villages, virtually the same villages  identified by federal and state officials that we consulted in 2003. In  addition, the state appointed an Erosion Control Task Force in 1983 to  investigate and inventory potential erosion problems and to prioritize  erosion sites by severity and need. In its January 1984 final report, the task  force identified a total of 30 priority communities with erosion problems.  Of these 30 communities, 28 are Alaska Native villages. Federal and state  officials that we spoke with in 2003 also identified almost all of the Native  communities in the 1984 report as villages needing assistance.", "While flooding and erosion is a long-standing problem that has been  documented in Alaska for decades, various studies and reports indicate  that coastal villages in Alaska are becoming more susceptible. This  increasing susceptibility is due in part to rising temperatures that cause  protective shore ice to form later in the year, leaving the villages vulnerable  to storms. According to the Alaska Climate Research Center, mean annual  temperatures have risen for the period from 1971 to 2000, although changes  varied from one climate zone to another and were dependent on the  temperature station selected. For example, Barrow experienced an average  temperature increase of 4.16 degrees Fahrenheit for the 30-year period  from 1971 to 2000, while Bethel experienced an increase of 3.08 degrees  Fahrenheit for the same time period.", "Other studies have reported extensive melting of glaciers, thawing of  permafrost, and reduction of sea ice that may also be contributing to the  flooding and erosion problems of coastal villages in recent years.  According to a 1999 report for the U.S. Global Change Research Program,  glaciers in the arctic and subarctic regions have generally receded, with  decreases in ice thickness of approximately 33 feet over the last 40 years.  In addition, according to a 1997 report of the Intergovernmental Panel on  Climate Change, much of the arctic permafrost is close to thawing, making  it an area that is sensitive to small changes in temperature. The 1999 report  for the U.S. Global Change Research Program also states that both the  extent and thickness of sea ice in the arctic have decreased substantially in  recent decades, with thickness decreasing by more than 4 feet (from 10- feet to 6-feet thick). The report also notes that loss of sea ice along Alaska\u2019s  coast has increased both coastal erosion and vulnerability to storm surges.  With less ice, storm surges have become more severe because larger open  water areas can generate bigger waves."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quantifiable Data Are Not Available to Fully Assess the Severity of the Problem", "paragraphs": ["While most Alaska Native villages are affected to some extent by flooding  and erosion, quantifiable data are not available to fully assess the severity  of the problem. Federal and Alaska state agency officials could agree on  which three or four villages experience the most flooding and erosion, but  they could not rank flooding and erosion in the remaining villages by high,  medium, or low severity. These agency officials said that determining the  extent to which villages have been affected by flooding and erosion is  difficult because Alaska has significant data gaps. These gaps occur  because remote locations lack monitoring equipment. The officials noted  that about 400 to 500 gauging stations would have to be added in Alaska to  attain the same level of gauging as in the Pacific Northwest.", "In addition, the amount and accuracy of floodplain information in Alaska  varies widely from place to place. Detailed floodplain studies have been  completed for many of the larger communities and for the more populated  areas along some rivers. For example, the Federal Emergency Management  Agency (FEMA) has published Flood Insurance Rate Maps that show  floodplain boundaries and flood elevations for communities that  participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. However, because  only a handful of Alaska Native villages participate in the program, many of  the villages have not had their 100-year floodplain identified by FEMA. In  addition, little or no documented floodplain information exists for most of  the smaller communities. Moreover, no consolidated record has been  maintained of significant floods in Alaska Native villages. The Corps\u2019 Flood  Plain Management Services has an ongoing program to identify the 100- year flood elevation, or the flood of record of flood-prone communities  through data research and field investigations.", "State of Alaska officials also noted that there is a lack of standards and  terms for measuring erosion. Erosion zone guidance and federal (or state)  standards by which to judge erosion risks are needed. They noted that  while national standards for designing, developing and siting for the \u201c100- year flood\u201d event exists and are quantifiable and measurable, a similar  standard for erosion, such as a distance measurement needs to be  established."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Flooding and Erosion Programs Provide Limited Assistance to Alaska Native Villages; Some State Programs Are Also Available", "paragraphs": ["The key programs that construct projects to prevent and control flooding  and erosion are administered by the Corps and NRCS.

Table 4 lists these programs.", "Small and remote Alaska villages often fail to qualify for assistance under  the Corps\u2019 Continuing Authorities Program because they do not meet the  program\u2019s criteria. In particular, according to the Corps\u2019 guidelines for  evaluating water resource projects, the Corps generally cannot undertake a  project whose costs exceed its expected benefits. With few exceptions,  Alaska Native villages\u2019 requests for the Corps\u2019 assistance are denied  because of the Corps\u2019 determination that project costs outweigh the  expected benefits. Alaska Native villages have difficulty meeting the  cost/benefit requirement because many of these villages are not developed  to the extent that the value of their infrastructure is high enough to equal  the cost of a proposed erosion or flood control project. For example, the  Alaska Native village of Kongiganak, with a population of about 360 people,  experiences severe erosion from the Kongnignanohk River. The Corps  decided not to fund an erosion project because the cost of the project  exceeds the expected benefits and because many of the structures  threatened are private property, which are not eligible for protection under  a Section 14 Emergency Streambank Protection project. One additional  factor that makes it difficult for Alaska Native villages to qualify for the  Corps\u2019 program is that the cost of construction is high in remote villages\u2014 largely because labor, equipment, and materials have to be brought in from  distant locations. The high cost of construction makes it even more  difficult for villages to meet the Corps\u2019 cost/benefit requirements.", "Even villages that do meet the Corps\u2019 cost/benefit criteria may still fail to  receive assistance if they cannot provide or find sufficient funding to meet  the cost-share requirements for the project. By law, the Corps generally  requires local communities to fund between 25 and 50 percent of project  planning and construction costs for flood prevention and erosion control  projects. According to village leaders we spoke to, under these cost-share  requirements they may need to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars or  more to fund their portion of a project\u2014funding that many of them do not  have."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Qualifying for Some NRCS Programs Is Less Difficult", "paragraphs": ["As shown in table 3, NRCS has three key programs that can provide  assistance to villages to protect against flooding and erosion\u2014two of  which are less difficult to qualify for than the Corps program. The NRCS  programs are the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Program, the  Emergency Watershed Protection Program, and the Conservation  Technical Assistance Program. The purpose of the Watershed Protection  and Flood Prevention Program is to assist federal, state, and local agencies  and tribal governments in protecting and restoring watersheds from  damage caused by erosion, and flooding. Qualifying for funding under the  NRCS Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Program requires a  cost/benefit analysis similar to that of the Corps. In fact, according to an  NRCS headquarters official, there should be little if any difference in the  standards for cost benefit analyses between the Corps and NRCS  programs. As a result, few projects for Alaskan Native villages have been  funded under this program.", "In contrast, some villages have been able to qualify for assistance from the  Emergency Watershed Protection Program, because for this program  NRCS\u2019s policy is different and allows consideration of additional factors in  the cost/benefit analysis. Specifically, NRCS considers social or  environmental factors when calculating the potential benefits of a  proposed project, and protecting the subsistence lifestyle of an Alaska  Native village can be included as one of these factors. In addition, NRCS  headquarters officials have instructed field staff to \u201ctake a second look\u201d at  proposed projects in which the potential benefits are nearly equal to the  project costs. In some cases, according to NRCS\u2019s National Emergency  Watershed Protection Program Leader, there may be unusual  circumstances that might make the project worthwhile even if the costs  slightly outweigh the benefits. One example provided by this official was  for projects that involved protecting Native American burial grounds.  Furthermore, while NRCS\u2019s program encourages cost sharing by local  communities, this requirement can be waived when the local community  cannot afford to pay. Such was the case in Unalakleet, where the  community had petitioned federal and state agencies to fund its local cost- share of an erosion protection project and was not successful. Eventually,  NRCS waived the cost-share requirement for the village and covered the  total cost of the project itself. (See fig. 6.)  Another NRCS official in Alaska  estimated that about 25 villages have requested assistance under this  program during the last 5 years; of these 25 villages, 6 received some  assistance from NRCS, and 19 were turned down\u2014mostly because there  were either no feasible solutions or because the problems they wished to  address were recurring ones. One factor that limits the assistance provided  by the program is that it is intended for smaller scale projects than those  that might be constructed by the Corps. Moreover, because this program is  designed to respond quickly to emergencies, it is limited to addressing one- time events\u2014such as repairing damage caused by a large storm\u2014rather  than addressing recurring flooding and erosion.", "Unlike the other NRCS programs and the Corps program, NRCS\u2019s  Conservation Technical Assistance Program does not require any cost  benefit analysis to qualify for assistance. An NRCS official in Alaska  estimated that during the last 2 years, NRCS provided assistance to about  25 villages under this program. The program is designed to provide  technical assistance to communities and individuals that request help to  solve natural resource problems, improve the health of the watershed,  reduce erosion, improve air and water quality, or maintain or improve  wetlands and habitat. The technical assistance provided can range from  advice or consultation services to developing planning, design, and/or  engineering documents.

Surrounded by the Chukchi Sea and the  Kivalina Lagoon, the village has no further room for expansion. (See fig. 8.)   A 1994 study by a private contractor found more than one instance of 16  people living together in a 900-square-foot home. Overcrowding and poor  sanitation have led to an extremely high incidence of communicable  diseases and other health problems in Kivalina. Chronic erosion on the  lagoon side of the island and along its southeastern tip where the lagoon  empties into the sea has further exacerbated overcrowding. Several homes  along this side are currently in danger of falling into the lagoon. On the  seaside of the island, fall storm surges create annual coastal flooding and  beach erosion. Portions of the island have been breached before, and it is  believed that the right combination of storm events could flood the entire  village at any time.", "In 1990, the Corps placed sandbags around the southern tip of the island in  an attempt to stem the erosion, but that proved to be only a temporary  solution. Most recent efforts to respond to flooding and erosion have  involved studying the feasibility of possible relocation sites. The villagers  would like a site that is near their current location with access to the ocean  so that they can continue to pursue their subsistence lifestyle. Much of the  surrounding area, however, is low-lying wetlands or tundra. One of the  main obstacles for selecting a site has been the requirement of a gravel pad  for some of the sites under consideration. In those cases, several feet of  gravel must be spread over the entire site, both to elevate the new village  above the floodplain and to protect the fragile permafrost. However, gravel  is not easily accessible and would have to be barged in. Similarly, the harsh,  remote terrain and limited site access drive up other costs for materials and  machinery. The Corps has estimated that the cost to relocate Kivalina could  range from $100 million for design and construction of infrastructure  (including a gravel pad) at one site and up to $400 million for just the cost  of building a gravel pad at another site. As a result, the community is now  considering whether to ask the Corps to evaluate completely new sites that  would not require a gravel pad.

This loss is  considerable for an island that is no wider than one-quarter mile (1,320  feet). After a severe storm in October 2002, stress cracks along the western  seaside bluffs became evident. These cracks were 5 to 10 feet from the  edge of the banks and indicated that the permafrost that holds the island  together had been undermined by the storm. As the permafrost melts, the  banks cave in. (See fig. 9.)  Several homes located along these banks had to  be relocated to prevent them from falling into the sea. After the 1997 fall  storm, which was declared a state disaster, FEMA and state matching funds  were used to help move 14 homes along the coastal bluff to another part of  the village, and in 2002, the Bering Straits Housing Authority relocated an  additional 5 homes out of harm\u2019s way.", "Although the Corps had informed the villagers of Shishmaref in 1953 that  relocation would be a cheaper alternative to building a seawall to protect  the bluffs, the community did not vote to relocate until 1973 when it  experienced two unusually severe fall storms that caused widespread  damage and erosion. However, the site that the community selected proved  to be unsuitable because it had an extensive layer of permafrost.  Furthermore, other government agencies told the villagers that they would  not receive funding for their new school or a much-needed new runway if  they decided to relocate. According to Corps documents, the community  reversed its decision and voted in August 1974 to stay on the island. The  new school was completed in 1977, and a few years later a new runway was  also built.", "Since the 1970s, the village has attempted a variety of erosion protection  measures totaling more than $5 million. These projects have included  various sandbag and gabion seawalls (wire cages, or baskets, filled with  rocks) and even a concrete block mat. Each project has required numerous  repairs and has ultimately failed to provide long-term protection. In  October 2001, the governor of Alaska issued an administrative order for an  $85,000 protective sandbag wall that was intended to last only one storm\u2014 and it did just that. In July 2002, the community again voted to relocate, and  it is currently working with NRCS to select an appropriate site. Once a site  is selected, the relocation process itself will take a number of years to  complete. In the meantime, stopgap erosion protection measures and other  federal and state services continue to be necessary to safeguard the  community. For this reason, the community is working with Kawerak, a  nonprofit Native corporation, to build a 500-foot seawall at an estimated  cost of $1 million along the most affected part of the seaside bluff. The  village is also seeking the Corps\u2019 assistance to extend the wall farther to  protect the school and other public buildings.

The Denali Commission commented that it is not convinced  that expanding its role to include responsibilities for managing a flooding  and erosion program is the appropriate response. The Army commented  that the alternative to expand the role of the Denali Commission to mange a  flooding and erosion program might exceed the capabilities of the  organization. Lastly, the Department of Housing and Urban Development  commented that the Denali Commission, as an independent agency, does  not have the capacity to be fully integrated with the efforts of federal  agencies to address this issue. Moreover, while each of these entities  recognized the need for improved coordination of federal efforts to address  flooding and erosion in Alaska Native villages, none of them provided any  specific suggestions on how or by whom this should be accomplished. As  discussed in our report, the Denali Commission currently does not have the  authority to manage a flooding and erosion program, and should Congress  choose this alternative, the commission would need to develop such a  program. Consequently, we still believe that expanding the role of the  commission continues to be a possible option for helping to mitigate the  barriers that villages face in obtaining federal services.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Agriculture, the  Army, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, the  Interior, and Transportation, as well as to the federal and state cochairs of  the Denali Commission, the Governor of the state of Alaska, appropriate  congressional committees, and other interested Members of Congress.

In response to this direction and subsequent  discussions with committee staff, we (1) determined the extent to which  Alaska Native villages are affected by flooding and erosion; (2) identified  federal and Alaska state programs available to respond to flooding and  erosion and assessed the extent to which federal assistance has been  provided to Alaska Native villages; (3) determined the status of efforts,  including cost estimates, to respond to flooding and erosion in the villages  of Barrow, Bethel, Kaktovik, Kivalina, Koyukuk, Newtok, Point Hope,  Shishmaref, and Unalakleet; and (4) identified alternatives that Congress  may wish to consider when providing assistance for flooding and erosion of  Alaska Native villages.  In addition, during the course of our work we  became concerned about the possible inefficient use of federal funds for  building infrastructure in villages that were planning to relocate.  As a  result, we are including information regarding these concerns in this  report.", "To determine which Alaska Native villages are affected by flooding and  erosion, we reviewed Alaska and federal agency reports and databases that  contained information on flooding and erosion.  We interviewed officials  from Alaska and federal agencies, such as the Alaska Division of  Emergency Services, the Alaska Department of Community and Economic  Development, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the U.S. Department  of Agriculture\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service, who are involved  in addressing flooding and erosion problems.  We also interviewed Alaska  Native officials from the selected villages, as well as officials from Native  village and regional corporations, such as Tikigaq, the Association of  Village Council Presidents, and Kawarek.  For the purposes of this report  we defined an Alaska Native village as a village that (1) was deemed eligible  as a Native village under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act and (2)  has a corresponding Alaska Native entity that is recognized by the  Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Indian Affairs.", "We identified federal flooding and erosion programs by searching the  Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance and by using other information.", "We reviewed applicable federal laws and regulations for these programs.   We also reviewed program file records and interviewed federal program  officials to determine the extent to which Alaska Native villages have been  provided federal assistance.  In addition, to determine the Alaska state  programs that are available to villages for addressing flooding and erosion,  we interviewed appropriate state officials from the Alaska Department of  Transportation and Public Facilities, the Division of Emergency Services,  and the Department of Community and Economic Development.  We also  discussed these programs and the assistance provided with selected village  representatives.", "While the committee directed us to include six villages, we added three  more\u2014Koyukuk, Newtok, and Shishmaref\u2014based on discussions with  congressional staff and with federal and Alaska state officials familiar with  flooding and erosion problems.  To determine the status of efforts,  including cost estimates, to address flooding and erosion at these nine  selected villages, we reviewed federal and state databases and studies.  We  also reviewed analyses performed by the Corps and by other federal, state,  and local agencies.  We visited only four villages\u2014Bethel, Kivalina,  Newtok, and Shishmaref\u2014due to the high cost of travel in Alaska.  We  selected three of the four villages to visit that were in imminent danger (we  visited Bethel because in order to reach Newtok we had to go through  Bethel).  We interviewed village representatives from each of the nine  villages.  We also interviewed state and federal officials involved in the  efforts to address flooding and erosion for each of the nine villages.  We  identified and evaluated Corps studies that addressed these problems with  particular attention to cost estimates.  We also assessed the nature and  applicability of these cost studies.", "To determine what alternatives Congress may wish to consider in  responding to flooding and erosion of Alaska Native villages, we  interviewed local, state, and federal officials, officials from the Alaska  Federation of Natives, and Kawarek representatives.

We also modified the report on the basis  of the technical comments that the Army gave us, as appropriate. In  addition, discussed below are GAO\u2019s corresponding detailed responses to  some of the Army\u2019s comments. 1. We disagree with the Corps\u2019 statement that the Flood Control Act of  1936 requires benefits to exceed costs for flood control projects. The  pertinent provision of the act states that \u201cit is the sense of Congress  that . . . the Federal Government should improve or participate in the  improvement of navigable waters or their tributaries . . . if the   benefits . . . are in excess of the estimated costs.\u201d  33 U.S.C. \u00a7 701a. This  provision, while setting out a statement of Congressional policy, does  not establish a legal requirement that benefits exceed costs, nor does it  prohibit carrying out a project where costs exceed benefits. We have  included a reference to this provision in the report\u2019s discussion of the  Corps\u2019 guidelines for evaluating water resource projects. 2. We agree that it is not realistic for a village to go without a health clinic  for 10 years. Our report states that development and maintenance of  critical infrastructure, such as health clinics and runways, is necessary  as villages find ways to address flooding and erosion. However, given  limited federal funds, agencies must explore potentially less costly  options for meeting a village\u2019s needs until it is able to relocate.  3. As noted in our report, if Congress decides to provide additional federal  assistance to Alaska Native villages, it may wish to consider directing  relevant executive agencies as well as the Denali Commission to assess  the cost and policy implications of implementing the alternatives. 4. The names for the Alaska Native entities used in appendix III of this  report are from the official list of federally recognized Indian entities  published by the Department of the Interior in the Federal Register (see  67 Fed.

We agree that the Corps can determine whether preventing or  minimizing flooding and erosion is technically and financially feasible.  Under the Tribal Partnership Program, authorized by section 203 of the  Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Pub. L. No. 106-541, 114  Stat. 2572, 2588-2589 (2000)), the Corps is currently examining impacts  of coastal erosion due to continued climate change and other factors in  the Alaska Native villages of Bethel, Dillingham, Shishmaref, Kaktovik,  Kivalina, Unalakleet and Newtok. Congress provided $2 million for  these activities in fiscal year 2003. However, other federal agencies,  such as the NRCS, also have the ability to conduct feasibility analyses.  2. We acknowledge the commission\u2019s desire for a larger role for Alaska  state and local governments in developing and executing response  strategies and in helping to prioritize the use of scarce resources.  However, whether or not the state and local governments choose to  expend their own resources to become more involved in responding to  flooding and erosion issues is entirely a state or local government  decision.
