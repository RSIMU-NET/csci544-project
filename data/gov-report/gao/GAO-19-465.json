For example, VHA's mental health services handbook requires that treatment plans include certain components, but does not specify where to document the plan within a veteran's medical record. As a result, there is a risk that a provider may be unable to readily access information about a veteran's mental health treatment, including the use of medication or therapy, during changes in a veteran's care.", "VHA has not monitored whether mental health providers in specialty care document the required consideration of different treatment options\u2014such as psychotropic medications or non-pharmacologic therapy\u2014within mental health treatment plans. VHA officials told GAO that VHA relies on the Joint Commission (an independent, not-for-profit organization that accredits and certifies health care organizations) to assess specialty mental health treatment plans as part of the organization's accreditation process for each VAMC. However, the Joint Commission's standards do not specifically assess whether providers consider different treatment options. As a result, VHA cannot ensure that providers are considering all available treatment options and providing the most appropriate treatments to each veteran.", "VHA has taken steps to improve veterans' mental health treatment through the Psychotropic Drug Safety Initiative (PDSI)\u2014an initiative focused on the safe and effective prescribing of certain psychotropic medications. For example, the first phase included a performance metric aimed at decreasing the percentage of veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder receiving one or more outpatient prescriptions for a benzodiazepine (a medication used to treat anxiety) because of risks associated with the medication.

Methods of treatment vary; for  some veterans, psychotropic medications may be the safest and most  effective method of treatment, while specific forms of non-pharmacologic  therapy in lieu of, or in addition to, these medications may work better for  others. If conditions are left untreated or if treatment is unsuccessful,  some veterans may experience serious consequences; for example,  unresolved PTSD may lead to substance abuse, depression, or suicide.

In recent years, the  Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has aimed to increase the role of  primary care and mental health providers in the primary care setting in  making mental health treatment decisions, so that treatment can begin as  early as possible. These providers may decide to prescribe psychotropic  medications or offer non-pharmacologic therapy, among other things. The  primary care setting is also advantageous, as veterans assessed there  are concurrently screened for risk for suicide, a persistent and growing  public health problem for the United States and its veterans, particularly  those with mental health conditions. According to VHA, an average of 20  veterans die by suicide each day, and approximately 75 percent of those  veterans each had at least one mental health condition recorded in their  medical records in the 5 years prior to their deaths.", "You asked us to review how treatment decisions are being made by  VAMC providers across outpatient settings and how those decisions are  monitored by VHA.

Specifically, we interviewed providers who  work in outpatient care settings, including primary care providers (PCP),  mental health providers in specialty care (e.g., psychiatrists), and clinical  pharmacy specialists. We selected the five VAMCs for variation in (1) the  percentage of veterans who were seen by any provider at the VAMC for a  mental health diagnosis and received at least one psychotropic  medication prescription in fiscal year 2017 (the most recent year for which  data were available), (2) facility complexity level, and (3) geographic  location.

For the  first objective, to describe the factors that contributed to providers\u2019  treatment decisions for veterans with mental health conditions, we  interviewed officials at the five selected VAMCs and reviewed  documentation VAMC providers may use when making treatment  decisions. In our interviews with officials, we asked about factors that  contributed to PCPs\u2019 decisions to prescribe psychotropic medications to  veterans before or without referring veterans to mental health providers in  specialty care. We also asked about factors that contributed to providers\u2019  decisions to offer non-pharmacologic therapy to veterans in lieu of, or in  addition to, prescribing psychotropic medications. We then identified  factors that were reported by officials at multiple VAMCs. During our  interviews, 52 PCPs and mental health providers in specialty care  completed questionnaires so we could obtain their perspectives on how  frequently certain treatment decisions were made by providers within their  VAMCs. We also reviewed documents developed by VHA and VAMC  officials, such as guidance for providers to consider when treating  veterans with mental health conditions. For context, we obtained data  from VHA related to the pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic treatment  of veterans with mental health conditions for fiscal year 2018. We  analyzed these data to determine the specific outpatient care settings in  which veterans with different numbers and types of mental health  conditions were seen, as well as the types of treatment that were  provided to these veterans.", "For the second objective, to examine the extent to which VHA has  developed guidance for the documentation of mental health treatment  plans in veterans\u2019 medical records, we reviewed VHA documentation,  such as VHA\u2019s Health Information Management and Health Records  handbook. We also interviewed VHA officials from the Office of Mental  Health and Suicide Prevention and the Office of Health Informatics, as  well as officials at our five selected VAMCs, regarding the documentation  of veterans\u2019 mental health treatment plans. Additionally, we interviewed  officials from the Joint Commission, the organization responsible for  accrediting and certifying VAMCs and other health care facilities.

See table 2 for the factors and supporting  examples offered by VAMC officials during our site visits.", "In our review of documentation VAMC providers may use when making  treatment decisions, we identified some additional factors. For example,  providers\u2019 use of clinical practice guidelines (CPG) established by VA and  the Department of Defense may contribute to providers\u2019 treatment  decisions. Specifically, the CPG for mental health conditions that are  highly prevalent among veterans, including MDD and PTSD, are a  resource that all VAMC providers may use when making treatment  decisions. For example, the CPG for the management of MDD  recommends that providers offer either psychotropic medications or non- pharmacologic therapies (such as behavioral therapy) for the primary  treatment of uncomplicated MDD. In contrast, the CPG for the  management of PTSD recommends initial treatment for this condition to  be a specific type of non-pharmacologic therapy (individual trauma- focused therapy), and when this therapy is not readily available or  preferred, then treatments include prescribing psychotropic medications  or offering another form of non-pharmacologic therapy. Though it is not  mandatory for providers to follow the recommendations of the CPGs,  which are based on the strength of evidence and also the potential  benefits and harms of treatment options, every provider is responsible for  evaluating the appropriateness of applying CPG recommendations in any  particular clinical situation.", "Another factor we identified in our review of documentation was service  agreements that VAMCs have in place to help coordinate mental health  services across outpatient settings. All five of the VAMCs in our review  have formal agreements to help coordinate mental health services across  outpatient settings to help manage VAMC resources.

For example, the four service agreements indicated  that veterans with bipolar disorder should be treated by mental health providers in  specialty care.", "In light of these factors, providers we interviewed reported on the extent  to which each of the most prevalent mental health conditions resulted in  PCPs prescribing medication to veterans prior to or without being referred  to specialty care. Specifically, more providers reported that psychotropic  medications are commonly prescribed to veterans with MDD, PTSD, or  GAD prior to referring them to specialty care compared to providers who  reported that it is common to prescribe without referring veterans to  specialty care at all.

For each phase, VHA  developed a set of performance metrics from which each VAMC was  required to select a designated number as a focus for implementing  prescribing-related quality improvement efforts (referred to as the VAMC\u2019s  priority metrics). See table 3.", "VHA reported improvements in the majority of the performance metrics  from the past PDSI phases. Specifically, VHA reported nationwide  improvements in 16 of the 20 metrics that it developed for phase 1, and  all 14 of the metrics that it developed for phase 2. For example, upon the  completion of phase 1, VHA found that there was a nationwide 5.4  percentage point decrease (indicating improvement on this metric) in the  percentage of veterans with PTSD who received one or more outpatient  prescriptions for a benzodiazepine (a type of antianxiety medication).  VHA reported that the change in benzodiazepine prescribing, among  other improvements in treating veterans with PTSD, was particularly  noteworthy given that the number of veterans diagnosed with this mental  health condition increased over the duration of phase 1. Further, upon the  completion of phase 2, VHA found that there was a nationwide 1.7  percentage point decrease (indicating improvement on this metric) in the  percentage of veterans 75 or older with an outpatient prescription for a  benzodiazepine or sedative hypnotic medication.", "During each PDSI phase, VHA works with VISNs and VAMCs to support  their quality improvement efforts related to their priority metrics. For  example, VHA provides feedback and technical assistance to VISNs and VAMCs for  developing and implementing quality improvement strategies for their  priority metrics, which must be updated and submitted to VHA  semiannually;  convenes a bi-monthly PDSI conference call for VISN and VAMC staff  and providers involved in PDSI, which serves as a forum for providing  training to participants, discussing best practices, and facilitating  collaboration among VAMCs that may have chosen the same priority  metrics; develops a semi-annual feedback report for each VISN that includes,  among other content, the most recent quarterly score on the priority  performance metrics for each VAMC within the network, according to  a VHA official; and provides VISNs and VAMCs access to a PDSI clinical management  dashboard to use to identify veterans who may benefit from changes  to their psychotropic medication prescriptions. These lists can be  filtered by the care setting in which the patient is seen, such as the  primary or specialty care settings.", "Although VISNs and VAMCs are not always required (but are  encouraged) to continue quality improvement efforts related to VAMCs\u2019  priority metrics from past PDSI phases, VHA continues to monitor VAMC  performance on all metrics from each PDSI phase. Specifically, a VHA  official told us that VHA monitors performance by calculating quarterly  VAMC scores on all performance metrics, which are published on the  PDSI clinical management dashboard. VHA also disseminates these  scores to the VISNs in the semiannual feedback reports. In these  feedback reports, VHA highlights any metric\u2014from the current or a past  phase\u2014for which a VAMC within that VISN has regressed. A VHA official  stated that if a VAMC regresses significantly in any area, VHA would work  with that medical center to determine the cause and take action to  reverse the trend as needed.", "See appendix III for information on PDSI\u2019s planned focus on reducing the  co-prescribing of benzodiazepines and opioids as well as the initiative\u2019s  collaboration with VHA\u2019s Academic Detailing program, which has  developed its own campaign related to stimulant prescribing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VHA Has Included Psychotropic Medications in Multiple Efforts to Examine Suicide Risk among Veterans", "paragraphs": ["Since 2012, VHA has included psychotropic medications in multiple  efforts to examine suicide risk among veterans, including two programs  and three research studies. These efforts include:  Recovery Engagement and Coordination for Health \u2013 Veterans  Enhanced Treatment (REACH VET) Program. VHA includes  psychotropic medications as part of its effort to examine veterans who  may be at risk of suicide through its REACH VET program. Specifically,  REACH VET uses prior research findings to conduct predictive modeling  on data collected from VHA\u2019s electronic medical records to identify  veterans who are within the top tier (0.1 percent) of predicted suicide risk.  These veterans may also be at increased risk of other adverse outcomes,  such as overdoses, violence, and mental health hospitalization. Of note,  five of the 61 variables used in REACH VET\u2019s predictive model relate to  the prescription of specific psychotropic medications (e.g., alprazolam),  and three relate to the prescription of specific psychotropic classes (e.g.,  antidepressants). Other variables used in the model include  demographic characteristics, past suicide attempts, measures of VHA  care utilization, and certain diagnoses such as substance use disorder,  MDD, and chronic pain.", "REACH VET coordinators staffed at VAMCs are responsible for notifying  the appropriate mental health provider or PCP that a veteran has been  identified as being at high risk for suicide, based on a high-risk list of  veterans generated monthly by REACH VET\u2019s predictive model. As  shown in Figure 4, veterans identified as being at high risk for suicide  may then receive targeted outreach from their mental health providers or  PCPs if those providers conclude that outreach is warranted based on  their review of the veterans\u2019 medical records, according to VHA officials.  This outreach may result in changes to the veteran\u2019s treatment as agreed  upon by the provider and veteran. VHA reported that within the first year  of nationwide implementation, February 2017 through February 2018, the  program identified close to 30,000 veterans at high risk for suicide.", "Behavioral Health Autopsy Program. VHA also includes psychotropic  medications in its Behavioral Health Autopsy Program. This program  examines information about veteran deaths by suicide that are reported to  VAMC providers and suicide prevention coordinators.", "When informed that a veteran has died by suicide, suicide prevention  coordinators are to electronically report, among other things, whether the  veteran had (1) been prescribed psychotropic and other medications, for  the treatment of a mental health condition within the previous year, and  (2) adhered to the medications. Other sources of information collected  through the program may include coroners\u2019 and medical examiners\u2019  reports, death certificates, and information provided by family members  and significant others. Data are reported to and analyzed by VHA\u2019s VISN  2 Center of Excellence for Suicide Prevention. One recommendation in  the program\u2019s 2017 annual report called for more efforts to study issues  related to medication management, such as veterans\u2019 medication  adherence, overmedication, and frequent and abrupt medication  changes. In the past, recommendations from the program have been  used to inform VHA suicide prevention policies, programs, and  educational efforts, according to VHA officials. For example, officials  shared that the program informed the development of a tool kit for  providers to use to help address veterans\u2019 sleep issues after analyses  found that sleep patterns were often altered for veterans prior to their  death by suicide.", "Lithium for Suicidal Behaviors in Mood Disorders study. As of March  2019, VHA is in the process of conducting a randomized clinical trial that  examines the effect of a specific psychotropic medication (lithium) on  reducing suicide risk for veterans with MDD or bipolar disorder who either  survived a recent suicide attempt or were hospitalized to prevent one.  VHA plans to enroll 1,600 veterans in the study from 28 VAMCs and  provide them with the appropriate treatment options as determined by  their respective providers, as well as provide some additional care  coordination. Additionally, half of the participants will receive lithium,  and half of the participants will receive a placebo. The study\u2019s  investigators told us that, to their knowledge, this study is the first effort to  test lithium\u2019s efficacy for reducing suicide risk in a randomized clinical trial  setting. Investigators also told us that, because all participants will receive  medications already proven safe and effective for the treatment of their  conditions, it is not considered unethical to withhold lithium, a yet  untested medication for treating suicide risk, from half of participants.  VHA investigators told us they hope to use the results of this clinical trial  to inform future treatment options for patients with MDD or bipolar  disorder and who are at risk of suicide.", "Drugs and Suicide Risk study. Between January 2017 and October  2018, VHA officials and collaborators at the University of Chicago and  Columbia University analyzed 513 medications, which included  psychotropic medications, prescribed between 2003 and 2014 for  association with increased or decreased risk of suicidal events in VHA  patients. According to the study\u2019s investigators, they expect to be able to  identify specific psychotropic medications that are found to be associated  with the largest increases and decreases in suicide risk. VHA officials told  us that as of March 2019, the research manuscript was under review for  publication in a peer-reviewed journal.", "Using Big Data and Precision Medicine to Assess and Manage  Suicide Risk in U.S. Veterans study. As of March 2019, VHA officials,  in collaboration with the Department of Energy, were in the process of  developing a new model to predict suicidal behavior among veterans by  combining data on genetic and non-genetic risk factors, such as  demographics, medical conditions, and stressful life events; psychotropic  medications are also included as a risk factor, according to VHA  officials. The researchers are expected to combine data from VHA  electronic medical records with data from a VHA Office of Research and  Development program that collects genetic information from veterans to  develop the new algorithm.", "VHA officials we interviewed noted some broad challenges not exclusive  to VHA that may affect efforts for any researcher in examining suicide risk  and the use of psychotropic medications:", "Multiple risk factors. All VHA officials that we spoke with discussed  the need for efforts examining psychotropic medications and suicide  risk to account for other suicide risk factors beyond the use of these  types of medication. Such factors may include having a substance  use disorder or other mental health diagnoses; homelessness; chronic  (non-mental health) medical conditions; age; and psychosocial  factors, such as recent loss of a significant other or a history of abuse  or violence.", "Methodological considerations. Most VHA officials that we spoke  with mentioned some methodological considerations that must be  considered when designing a research study to examine this  relationship. For example, an official told us that measuring veterans\u2019  medication adherence is important to track, but is difficult to do as  VHA generally only has data on whether medications were dispensed  to veterans, not whether medications were actually taken.", "Ethics. Some VHA officials that we spoke with noted that certain  ethical considerations may limit the methodological options available  to researchers, such as randomized clinical trials. For example, it  would be unethical to withhold medications that have been proven as  safe and effective from veterans who may clinically benefit from  receiving such treatments, such as from veterans in a control group.", "In the face of these challenges, VHA officials also noted some  advantages VHA researchers, in particular, may experience in examining  the use of psychotropic medications and suicide risk: a large patient population with more than 2 million veterans who  have at least one mental health condition, and a corresponding  electronic medical records database, providing sufficient data and  sample sizes needed to test hypotheses;  internal funding streams dedicated to research activities examining  issues related to suicide prevention, such as funds available through  three of VA\u2019s Office of Research and Development\u2019s four central  research services; and  research centers with researchers who have specific expertise about  issues related to suicide prevention and the treatment of serious  mental health conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Veterans diagnosed with mental health conditions rely on providers in  VAMCs across the country to make treatment decisions that are safe and  effective, including whether to treat highly prevalent and serious  conditions such as MDD and PTSD with psychotropic medications, non- pharmacologic therapy, or a combination of both. In recent years, VHA  has taken steps aimed at improving the safety and effectiveness of  prescribing decisions for certain psychotropic medications and noted  important improvements resulting from these efforts. However, VHA\u2019s  oversight related to treatment planning needs improvement. VHA has yet  to disseminate guidance that clearly reflects its expectation that mental  health providers in specialty care document mental health treatment plans  in a readily identifiable manner in veterans\u2019 medical records. Additionally,  VHA does not monitor whether mental health providers are considering  evidence-based treatment options in treatment plans, as VHA requires in  its mental health services handbook. As a result, VHA cannot ensure that  providers are considering and documenting all appropriate treatment  options, adequately evaluating patient care, and making treatment  modifications as necessary, among other issues. Furthermore, the lack of  monitoring may impede VHA\u2019s ability to identify important factors that  contribute to providers\u2019 treatment decisions, which could in turn allow  VHA to identify more systemic barriers to safe and effective treatment,  such as needed training.", "In addition, being able to readily identify how veterans are being treated  for mental health conditions may allow VHA to enhance its research  efforts related to suicide risk. VHA has noted several advantages it has in  conducting research involving the role of psychotropic medications in  suicide risk among veterans, including that VHA researchers have access  to a large patient population with at least one mental health condition.
