GAO analyzed NMMSS data and agency documents and interviewed agency officials, DOE contractors, and NRC licensees, among other steps."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the United States, from October 1, 2003, through November 30, 2015, there were 817 exchanges of nuclear material that carried obligations to foreign partners under nuclear cooperation agreements. These exchanges allowed the obligated nuclear material to be transferred between U.S. facilities without physically moving it. For example, if a facility had a certain amount of obligated nuclear material and another facility had at least the same amount and type of unobligated material (which is not subject to the same conditions as obligated material), the facilities could exchange the obligations on their material so that each facility had a portion of both types of material without physically moving it.", "Numbers of exchanges. Of the 817 exchanges, 802 were conducted by Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)-licensed facilities\u2014private companies and other entities involved in commercially producing nuclear energy. Of the remaining exchanges, 14 were conducted by contractors that run Department of Energy (DOE) laboratories and weapons-production sites, and 1 by an NRC licensee that does both commercial and DOE work.", "Reasons for exchanges. NRC licensees said they conducted exchanges primarily to meet their utility customer demand, as well as to avoid the high costs and safety risks associated with physically transporting nuclear material. DOE contractors said they conducted exchanges primarily to avoid physically moving nuclear material stored at a specific site.", "DOE and NRC have procedures to ensure accurate tracking and reporting of data on obligation exchanges through the Nuclear Materials Management and Safeguards System (NMMSS). GAO tested elements of these procedures and generally found them to be reliable. But, GAO identified two issues that may impact the agencies' ability to effectively monitor nuclear material inventories.", "First, some facilities have carried negative obligation balances for extended periods. A negative obligation balance occurs when a facility conducts an exchange without having enough of a given material in its physical inventory to cover the exchange. In certain circumstances, negative balances may place the United States at risk of noncompliance with nuclear agreements. Negative balances have occurred because DOE and NRC have not addressed this issue in documented guidance on when facilities may carry such balances, which is inconsistent with federal internal control standards.", "Second, while unobligated low-enriched uranium (LEU) could be used to correct any future negative obligation balances, the U.S. inventory of it is declining and NMMSS does not have an early-warning monitoring capability to alert DOE when the inventory is particularly low. Federal internal control standards state that agencies should establish activities to monitor internal control systems and evaluate the results, but DOE officials said that the LEU inventory is currently sufficient and no early warning capability is needed. Without developing such a capability in NMMSS, DOE officials cannot know when the inventory of unobligated LEU becomes so low that supplies may not be available to correct negative obligation balances, thereby putting the United States at risk of not complying with its nuclear agreements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOE and NRC (1) clarify in guidance when facilities may carry negative obligation balances and (2) develop an early-warning monitoring capability in NMMSS to alert DOE when the inventory of unobligated LEU is particularly low.

Under these agreements, the U.S. government tracks the  amounts, locations, and uses of imported nuclear material and  periodically reports this information to its foreign partners. The  agreements generally impose certain terms and conditions on transfers of  nuclear material and equipment, including adequate physical protection,  application of safeguards, and peaceful use. Material and equipment  subject to such conditions are referred to as \u201cobligated,\u201d or carrying a  foreign obligation. Material and equipment not subject to such conditions  are referred to as \u201cunobligated,\u201d or not carrying a foreign obligation. The  agreements\u2019 peaceful use provisions mean that foreign-obligated nuclear  material in the United States cannot be used for military purposes. To  enable it to demonstrate to its foreign partners that foreign-obligated  nuclear material is used in compliance with peaceful use provisions, the  U.S. government relies on the Nuclear Materials and Management  Safeguards System (NMMSS) as its system to track such material and  report material balances to foreign partners.", "NMMSS is managed by the Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency  within DOE that is responsible for the management and security of the  nation\u2019s nuclear weapons, nonproliferation, and naval reactors programs.  Jointly funded by DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),  the nuclear regulatory body of the United States, NMMSS is the U.S.  government\u2019s official database for tracking nuclear material inventories,  material balances, and transactions in the United States. The United  States relies on NMMSS to track nuclear material as it is imported to,  exported from, or moved within the United States and to process about 1  million transaction records each year. Approximately 420 commercial  nuclear and government entities submit data to NMMSS on 17 different  nuclear materials, including those that can be used in industrial and  medical applications as well as the types of uranium and plutonium that  can be used directly to manufacture nuclear explosives. These entities  include facilities licensed by NRC, which are private companies involved  in the commercial production of and research on nuclear energy, as well  as academic institutions. DOE laboratories and weapons production  sites also submit data to NMMSS; these laboratories and sites are  responsible for military uses of nuclear material and are owned by the  U.S. government but managed and operated by contractors.", "One type of transaction conducted by both NRC licensees and DOE  contractors, and recorded in NMMSS, is known as an \u201cobligation  exchange.\u201d An obligation exchange involves the transfer between entities  of the obligations on nuclear material without physical movement of the  material. For example, Facility A may have a certain amount of material  physically located on its site, all of which is obligated. Facility B may have  an equal amount of material physically located on its site, all of which is  unobligated. In an obligation exchange between the two facilities, rather  than Facility A physically transferring a portion of its obligated material to  Facility B in exchange for the same amount of unobligated material, the  two facilities can exchange the obligations on the material, so that each  facility now has a portion of obligated and a portion of unobligated  material. The total amounts of nuclear material at each facility do not  change, and no material is physically moved, but the conditions on the  use of the material have changed.", "According to DOE documents, the United States has a vital national  security need for unobligated low-enriched uranium (LEU), which is used  in the production of tritium\u2014a key isotope used in nuclear weapons.", "DOE reported in October 2015 that obtaining tritium is its \u201cmost pressing  defense mission need.\u201d As long as the United States relies on nuclear  weapons, DOE requires a continuous supply of LEU to produce tritium.  However, according to DOE officials, the domestic supply of unobligated  LEU is declining, in part because the United States lost its sole supplier of  unobligated LEU in May 2013. At that time, a former government-owned  corporation\u2014created in 1992 as the United States Enrichment  Corporation and then privatized in 1998\u2014ceased enriching uranium at  the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. As of 2015, the majority of LEU  in the United States carried foreign obligations, and DOE officials stated  that this material could not be used for tritium production.

Administrative  arrangements with foreign partners may require DOE to produce annual  reports on inventories of obligated material. For example, under the  administrative arrangements for Australia, Canada, and EURATOM, the  reports are to be conducted at the country level, not by facility. According  to DOE documents, this is generally the case with its foreign partners.  The annual obligation inventory reports summarize the import and export  of foreign obligated material into and out of the United States in a given  year. NMMSS produces summary information for these reports, which  contain aggregated data for foreign obligation balances at all U.S.  facilities by calendar year. After NMMSS generates data for the annual  obligation inventory reports, NNSA provides these reports to U.S. foreign  partners. These foreign partners use the reports to periodically reconcile  their accounting records with those of the United States.", "Other regulations, orders, guidance and an international agreement  govern the accounting and reporting of nuclear material as well. For  example, a DOE order and NRC regulations establish requirements for  nuclear material control and accounting and the reporting of nuclear  materials to NMMSS. The DOE order provides direction on the  procedures that DOE contractors are to use in submitting data on certain  quantities of 17 DOE-owned reportable nuclear materials. NRC  regulations require NRC licensees to submit data to NMMSS on certain  quantities of some of these nuclear materials. In addition, the United  States has an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency  (IAEA) on the safeguard of nuclear material, which requires the United  States to maintain a system of accounting and control over certain  nuclear material.

These steps make  up the nuclear fuel cycle. Obligations on nuclear material may be added  at various stages in the cycle (see fig. 1). For example, if uranium is  mined and milled in Australia and is then shipped to Canada, it may carry  an Australian obligation. If the uranium goes through conversion at a plant  using Canadian technology and is then shipped to Europe, it may carry a  Canadian obligation. If the uranium is enriched at a plant using European  technology and is then shipped to Japan, it may carry an obligation from  EURATOM. Finally, if the uranium undergoes fuel fabrication at a plant  using Japanese technology before export to a final user in the United  States, it may carry a Japanese obligation.

According to NRC officials, the  edit check will identify an error, which will prompt actions to resolve  the transaction in NMMSS. Specifically, the licensee will have to  consult with NMMSS program staff to determine whether the  transaction requires additional U.S. approval before a manual  authorization is given to override the error.", "Second, we found five obligation exchanges where the shipping  facility and receiving facility reported different activity dates.

Second, the United States has a declining domestic  inventory of unobligated LEU for national security purposes that is  projected to last until 2038 to 2041, but NMMSS does not have a  monitoring capability that could alert DOE when the inventory of  unobligated LEU is particularly low."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agencies Have Not Documented the Conditions under Which Facilities May Carry Negative Obligation Balances", "paragraphs": ["Nuclear cooperation agreements and the administrative arrangements  that we reviewed do not address whether or to what extent facilities may  carry negative obligation balances but while DOE officials told us that the  practice is not prohibited, DOE and NRC have not documented the  conditions under which it is allowed. Negative obligation balances occur  when a facility conducts an obligation exchange without having enough of  a given nuclear material in inventory\u2014similar to writing a check for an  amount that is not currently in one\u2019s checking account, with the  assumption that enough funds will be deposited in time to cover the  cashing of the check. DOE and NRC have not documented the  conditions under which facilities are allowed to carry negative obligation  balances.", "Some NRC licensees stated that they carried negative balances for  extended periods\u2014including for several months or more than a year.  DOE officials confirmed that certain facilities have carried negative  obligation balances for brief periods, and others have carried them for  extended periods of time. Specifically, according to DOE officials, 17  facilities in the United States have carried negative obligation balances  between reconciliation dates. DOE officials attributed 6 of 17 instances  to facility \u201cbusiness practices.\u201d Specifically, they stated that certain  facilities, such as uranium enrichment and fuel fabrication plants, need to  deliver uranium with specific obligations to customers before they have  physically obtained such uranium. As a result, the facilities may carry  negative obligation balances for months at a time, with the assumption  that sufficient obligations will be received on incoming shipments of  nuclear material and that receipt of this material will eventually cover the  negative obligation balance.", "DOE officials attributed the negative obligation balances at 11 of the 17  facilities to the brief time lag in reporting information to NMMSS.  Specifically, the DOE/NRC Form 741 that officially records the obligation  exchange must be sent by the \u201cshipping\u201d facility to NMMSS within 1  business day, and the form that officially records the receipt of the  material must be sent by the \u201creceiving\u201d facility to NMMSS within 10 days.  Thus, it is possible for a facility to temporarily carry a negative obligation  balance within this 10-day window.", "However, we found that 1 of the 11 facilities had a negative obligation  balance that was of significantly longer than 10 days: this negative  obligation balance of LEU lasted 18 months and spanned multiple  reconciliation periods. Specifically, an NRC-licensed facility carried a  negative balance of foreign obligated LEU from February 2006 to August  2007. Representatives of the facility and DOE officials confirmed this  negative obligation balance and that it lasted for about 18 months\u2014 spanning three reconciliation periods. According to officials from the  facility, to remedy its negative balance, in August 2007 the facility  conducted an obligation exchange with another facility to obtain foreign  obligated LEU. DOE officials told us that since 2010, there have been no  other instances of negative obligation balances persisting at any facility  past reconciliation. Nevertheless, since one negative obligation balance  persisted past multiple reconciliation periods, a risk remains that facilities  may carry negative obligation balances for extended periods of time in the  future.", "Under federal standards for internal control, agency management should  design control activities to achieve objectives and respond to risk,  including by clearly documenting internal control, and the documentation  may appear in management directives, administrative policies, or  operating manuals. While NNSA\u2019s procedures for foreign obligation  reporting state that both the shipping and receiving facilities should verify  that there is sufficient inventory of the given material type to support an  obligation exchange, they do not document the conditions under which  carrying a negative obligation balance is allowed. Moreover, some NRC  licensees told us that it is unclear whether or to what extent facilities may  carry negative obligation balances. Representatives from one facility  stated that it would be helpful for NMMSS officials to help clarify when the  practice of carrying negative obligation balances is allowed and for what  duration.", "DOE officials told us they strongly encourage facilities to avoid carrying  negative obligation balances but acknowledge that they have not  documented in guidance when the practice is allowed. Specifically, DOE  and NRC officials said that they discourage this practice through  informational presentations that they provide to NRC licensees and DOE  contractors at trainings and conferences. However, DOE officials told us  that the practice of carrying negative obligation balances is not prohibited  and that they have not documented the conditions under which carrying a  negative obligation balance is allowed. Instead, DOE officials stated that  their main internal control for negative obligation balances is to review  facilities\u2019 inventory once each year as part of the annual reconciliation  process. Through this process, NMMSS analysts expect facilities to  correct any negative obligation balances by the time of reconciliation.  However, as we noted, this process did not address the negative  obligation balance carried by one facility through several reconciliation  cycles. According to NNSA documents, additional internal control  procedures have been implemented in NMMSS in the past 6 years\u2014such  as developing new edit checks to detect incidences of negative obligation  balances at the time of reconciliation\u2014which NNSA officials believe will  prevent facilities in the future from carrying negative obligation balances  past reconciliation. However, we were unable to test these internal  controls to verify whether there have been any additional incidences of  facilities carrying negative obligation balances past reconciliation. As the  inventory of LEU continues to decline, there is a growing risk that facilities  carrying negative obligation balances between reconciliation periods may  not be able to correct their negative obligation balances at year end.  Without DOE and NRC clarifying in guidance the conditions under which  facilities can carry negative balances, facilities may be at risk in the future  of conducting exchanges that they ultimately cannot fulfill, putting the U.S.  government at risk of not complying with its nuclear cooperation  agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NMMSS Does Not Have a Capability to Alert DOE When the Inventory of Unobligated LEU Is Particularly Low", "paragraphs": ["NMMSS does not have a capability to alert DOE when the inventory of  unobligated LEU is low, placing facilities with negative obligation balances  at risk of not being able to reconcile them. According to NMMSS data,  there have been significant decreases in the inventory of unobligated  LEU, particularly from 2014 to 2015, which DOE officials attributed in part  to the closure of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in 2013, when the  United States lost its sole supplier of unobligated LEU. DOE officials  project that the inventory of unobligated LEU will continue to decrease  without a domestic source. DOE documents estimate that the inventory  will run out at some point from 2038 to 2041.", "Federal standards for internal control state that management should  establish and operate monitoring activities to monitor the internal control  system and evaluate the results. Ongoing monitoring is to be built into  the entity\u2019s operations, performed continually, and responsive to change  and may include automated tools, which can increase objectivity and  efficiency by electronically compiling evaluations of controls and  transactions. DOE officials acknowledged that they do not have a specific  capability in NMMSS that could serve as an early-warning system to alert  them when the inventory of unobligated LEU becomes low enough to put  facilities at risk of running negative obligation balances that they may not  be able to reconcile. They also told us that no such capability is currently  needed because the inventory of unobligated LEU is currently sufficient to  limit such risk. Moreover, DOE officials added that they would step in to  cover a negative obligation balance that could not otherwise be covered  out of a facility\u2019s own inventory, by transferring unobligated LEU from the  U.S. national security inventory.", "Nevertheless, while the U.S. national security inventory of unobligated  LEU could be used to correct any future negative obligation balances, if  the decline in this U.S. inventory of unobligated LEU continues, and if it is  possible to carry a negative obligation balance beyond reconciliation,  there is a risk that, at some point in the future, a facility may conduct an  exchange for nuclear material that it cannot fulfill\u2014essentially bouncing a  check. DOE officials acknowledged that the decline in the national  security inventory of unobligated LEU may change the way senior DOE  officials need to use NMMSS in the future and that additional monitoring  may be needed to ensure compliance with nuclear cooperation  agreements. Without DOE and NRC developing an early-warning  monitoring capability in NMMSS to alert senior DOE officials when the  inventory of unobligated LEU becomes low, DOE cannot know when  supplies of unobligated LEU are no longer available to correct negative  obligation balances, thereby putting the U.S. government at risk of  noncompliance with its nuclear cooperation agreements."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Under terms of its nuclear cooperation agreements, the United States  must account for foreign obligated nuclear material, and NMMSS has  been designated as the system to track and report on that material as it  enters, leaves, and moves within the country.

With the  exception of a few issues, which NNSA has fixed or plans to fix by  developing new internal controls, we found that these procedures are  working as expected and that NMMSS data on obligation exchanges  appear to be reliable.", "Certain obligation exchange practices, combined with trends in the  inventory of unobligated LEU, may change the information DOE and NRC  officials need and the actions required to ensure compliance with nuclear  cooperation agreements in the future. While DOE\u2019s procedures for foreign  obligation reporting state that facilities should verify that there is sufficient  inventory of the given material type to support an obligation exchange,  neither the procedures nor other guidance document the conditions under  which carrying a negative obligation balance is allowed.

In addition, all  three agencies provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "In their written comments, DOE and NRC did not explicitly state whether  they concur with the recommendations. DOE and NRC described actions  they are implementing or planning to implement to address our  recommendations.", "Concerning our first recommendation that DOE and NRC clarify in  guidance the conditions under which facilities may carry negative  obligation balances, NRC stated that it is currently reviewing its guidance  on nuclear material reporting and will consider our recommendation when  updating this guidance. We will continue to monitor NRC\u2019s  implementation of this recommendation. DOE said that it is deferring to  NRC\u2019s response on this recommendation. DOE also stated that NNSA  has no authority to regulate negative balances that may occur as a result  of commercial business practices. DOE\u2019s response suggests that it  believes our recommendation was limited to NRC licensees engaged in  commercial transactions. However, we recommended both NRC and  NNSA develop guidance to clarify when facilities with materials under  their jurisdiction may carry negative obligation balances because the  practice of carrying negative obligation balances at either a NRC-licensed  facility or DOE facility could put the United States in a position of  noncompliance with international agreements in the future if balances of  unobligated LEU become particularly low. Developing guidance could  mitigate this risk.", "Concerning our second recommendation that DOE and NRC develop an  early-warning monitoring capability in NMMSS to alert senior DOE  officials when the inventory of unobligated LEU is particularly low, DOE  noted that it has been directed by Congress to biennially update its  Tritium and Enriched Uranium Management Plan through 2060. DOE  stated it will address our recommendation through these updates, which  will assess the inventory of unobligated enriched uranium for national  security applications. We agree that updating the plan will help DOE  monitor its inventory of unobligated LEU, and we acknowledge that for  now, biennial updates to the plan may be sufficient to monitor the  declining inventory of unobligated LEU. However, the inventory of  unobligated LEU has rapidly declined in recent years\u2014about 10 percent  in 1 year alone\u2014as noted in this report. As the inventory of unobligated  LEU continues to decline, more frequent monitoring may be necessary to  ensure that facilities do not conduct obligation exchanges for nuclear  material that they cannot fulfill, which could put the United States at risk of  noncompliance with its nuclear cooperation agreements. We continue to  believe that our recommendation for DOE to develop an early-warning  monitoring system will help mitigate the chance of DOE officials being  unable to address a sudden decline in the inventory unobligated LEU. In  its written response to our second recommendation, NRC stated that  DOE has notified it that DOE will complete biennial updates to the plan  and that NRC will support DOE as appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report\u2019s date.
