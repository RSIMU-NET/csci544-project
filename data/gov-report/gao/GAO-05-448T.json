Seaports and waterways are vulnerable given their size, easy accessibility by water and land, large numbers of potential targets, and close proximity to urban areas. Seaports are also a critical link in the international supply chain, which has its own potential vulnerabilities that terrorists could exploit to transport a weapon of mass destruction to the United States. Federal agencies such as the Coast Guard and Customs and Border Protection and other seaport stakeholders such as state and local law enforcement officials as well as owners and operators of facilities and vessels have taken actions to try to mitigate these vulnerabilities and enhance maritime security. This testimony, which is based on previously completed GAO work, reports on (1) the types of actions taken by the federal government and other stakeholders to address maritime security, (2) the main challenges that GAO observed in taking these actions, and (3) what tools and approaches may be useful in planning future actions to enhance maritime security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies and local stakeholders have taken many actions to secure seaports. For example, federal agencies have stepped up vessel monitoring, cargo and container inspection, and security patrol activities. Port stakeholders in the private sector and in state and local government have taken such actions as conducting security assessments of infrastructure and vessels and implementing security plans. These actions provide three types of protections: identifying and reducing vulnerabilities of seaports, securing the cargo moving through seaports, and developing an informed view of maritime activities through intelligence, information-sharing, and new technologies to identify and respond to threats. Due in large part to the urgency with which these actions were implemented, challenges have been encountered in implementing them. While some challenges may be resolved with time, others are more difficult to resolve and could hinder the actions' effectiveness. The main challenges GAO has identified include failure to develop necessary planning components to carry out the programs; difficulty in coordinating the activities of federal agencies and port stakeholders to implement programs; and difficulty in maintaining the financial support to continue implementation of security enhancements. As intensified homeland security efforts continue, assessing their contribution to security and their sustainability over time will become more important. Assessing the progress made in securing seaports is difficult, as these efforts lack clear goals defining what they are to achieve and measures that track progress toward these goals. As Congress and the nation consider how much security is enough, more attention will likely be needed to define these goals and measures. Doing so is important because no amount of money can totally protect seaports from attack by a determined enemy. These realities suggest that the future focus in applying resources and efforts needs to incorporate an approach to assess critical infrastructure, determine what is most at risk, and apply measures designed to make cost effective use of resources and funding."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the nation\u2019s efforts to improve  seaport security. More than 3 years after the terrorist attacks of September  11, 2001, seaport security continues to be a major concern for the nation.  For example, many seaport areas are inherently vulnerable, given their  size, easy accessibility by water and land, large numbers of potential  targets, and proximity to urban areas. Also, the large cargo volumes  passing through seaports, such as containers destined for further shipment  by other modes of transportation such as rail or truck, also represent a  potential conduit for terrorists to smuggle weapons of mass destruction or  other dangerous materials into the United States. The potential  consequences of the risks created by these vulnerabilities are significant  as the nation\u2019s economy relies on an expeditious flow of goods through  seaports. A successful attack on a seaport could result in a dramatic  slowdown in the supply system, with consequences in the billions of  dollars.", "Much has been set in motion to address these risks in the wake of the  September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Both Congress and the  administration have been active, through legislation, presidential  directives, and international agreements, in enhancing seaport security.  Key agencies, such as the Coast Guard, the Customs Service, and the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA), have been reorganized  under the new Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and tasked with  numerous responsibilities designed to strengthen seaport security. Many  of these tasks were required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act  of 2002 (MTSA).", "My testimony today draws primarily on the work we have done in  responding to congressional requests for information and analysis about  the nation\u2019s homeland security efforts (see app. I for a list of recent  reports and testimonies we have issued). We conducted our work in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, and  the scope and methodology for this work can be found in the respective  products. Over the course of completing this work, we have made a  number of recommendations for specific agencies, which can be found in  appendix II. While this body of work does not cover every program or  action that has been taken, it does encompass a wide range of these  actions. My testimony will (1) provide an overview of the types of actions  taken by the federal government and other stakeholders to address  seaport security, (2) describe the main challenges encountered in taking  these actions, and (3) describe what tools and approaches may be useful  in charting a course for future actions to enhance security.", "Seaports are vulnerable on many fronts and the actions taken to secure  them can be divided into three main categories: reducing vulnerabilities of  specific targets within seaports, making the cargo flowing through these  seaport gateways more secure, and developing what is called \u201cmaritime  domain awareness\u201d\u2014a sufficiently informed view of maritime activities by  stakeholders involved in security to quickly identify and respond to  emergencies, unusual patterns or events, and matters of particular  interest. Within each category, several actions have been taken or are  underway. For example, assessments of potential targets have been  completed at 55 of the nation\u2019s most economically and militarily strategic  seaports, and more than 9,000 vessels and over 3,000 facilities have  developed security plans and have been reviewed by the Coast Guard.  Customs inspectors have been placed at some overseas seaports and  partnerships struck up with some private sector stakeholders to help  ensure that the cargo and containers arriving at U.S. seaports are free of  weapons of mass destruction (WMD) or a radiological \u201cdirty bomb.\u201d New  assets are budgeted and are coming on line, including new Coast Guard  boats and cutters and communication systems. Finally, new information- sharing networks and command structures have been created to allow  more coordinated responses and increase awareness of activities going on  in the maritime domain. Some of these efforts have been completed and  others are ongoing; overall, the amount of effort has been considerable.", "The efforts we have reviewed over the past 3 years, many of which were  quickly implemented to address pressing security needs, have encountered  challenges that could significantly affect their success. Some of these  challenges are likely to be resolved with time, but some reflect greater  difficulty and therefore merit more attention. The more complex  challenges take three main forms:    Program design and implementation: Some agencies have failed to  design programs and planning components, such as human capital  plans and performance measures, that are necessary to successfully  implement their programs and ensure they are effective. For example,  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) started implementation of  two key container supply chain security initiatives before taking  adequate steps to develop plans and strategies to effectively manage  critical aspects of the programs such as human capital and  achievement of program objectives.", "Coordinating security efforts with stakeholders: Many private sector  companies and governmental agencies are involved in seaport security  efforts, and in some cases progress has been hampered because of  difficulties in communication and coordination between parties. For  example, deadlines in the development of an identification card for  transportation workers have been missed due in part to a lack of  communication and coordination between TSA and DHS.", "Funding security improvements: Economic constraints, such as  declining revenues and increased security costs, make it difficult to  provide and sustain the funding necessary to continue implementing  security measures and activities by maritime stakeholders including the  federal government. Consequently, many stakeholders rely heavily on  the federal government for assistance, and requests for federal grant  funding far outstrip the funding amounts available. For example,  although more than $560 million in grants has been awarded to seaport  stakeholders since 2002 under federal grant programs for  implementation of security measures and activities, this amount has  met only a fraction of the amount requested by these stakeholders.", "As actions to enhance homeland security continue, and as it becomes  clearer that the price of these actions will be measured in the billions of  dollars, it is likely that increasing attention will turn to assessing the  progress made in securing seaports and determine where future actions  and funds should be allocated to further enhance security. Although there  is widespread agreement that actions taken so far have led to a heightened  awareness of the need for security and an enhanced ability to identify and  respond to many security threats, assessing the degree of progress in  making the nation more secure is difficult. Thus far, seaport security  actions\u2014and homeland security activities in general\u2014lack performance  measures to define what these activities are intended to achieve and  measure progress toward these goals. As Congress and the nation  continue to evaluate how much security is enough, more attention on  defining these goals and measures will likely be needed by stakeholders.  Doing so is all the more important because, as groups such as the 9/11  Commission have pointed out, no amount of money can totally insulate  seaports from attack by a well-funded and determined enemy. These  realities suggest that the future focus in applying resources and efforts  also needs to incorporate an approach to identify and manage risk\u2014that  is, on assessing critical infrastructure, determining what is most at risk,  and applying sound measures designed to make cost-effective use of  resources and funding."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The vast U.S. maritime system contains more than 300 seaports and 3,700  cargo and passenger terminals. These seaports dot not only our seacoasts,  but also major lakes and rivers (see fig. 1). Much of the nation\u2019s  commercial maritime activities, however, are concentrated in about a  dozen major seaports, such as Los Angeles-Long Beach, New York-New  Jersey, and Houston.", "The nation\u2019s seaports are economic engines and a key part of the national  defense system. More than 95 percent of the nation\u2019s non-North American  foreign trade (and 100 percent of certain commodities, such as foreign oil)  arrives by ship. Cargo containers, approximately 7 million of which  entered the country in 2002, are central to an efficient transportation  network because they can be quickly shifted from ships to trains and  trucks and back again. Because of these efficiencies, the U.S. and world  economies have become increasingly reliant on cargo containers to  transport their goods. With regard to national security, the Departments of  Defense and Transportation have designated 17 U.S. seaports as strategic  because they are necessary for use in the event of a major military  deployment. Thirteen of them are commercial seaports.", "While the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, did not involve seaports,  they called attention to ways in which seaports represent an attractive and  vulnerable terrorist target. Various studies have pointed out that  significant disruptions could result from a seaport-related attack. For  example, the Brookings Institution has estimated that costs associated  with U.S. seaport closures resulting from a detonated weapon of mass  destruction could amount to $1 trillion. The firm of Booz, Allen, and  Hamilton studied the potential cost of discovering an undetonated weapon  of mass destruction at a U.S. seaport and placed the cost of a 12-day  closure of seaports at approximately $58 billion. An actual closure of  seaports along the West Coast occurred for 10 days in 2002 due to a labor  dispute. According to one estimate, the cost of this closure to the national  economy for the first 5 days was estimated at $4.7 billion and increased  exponentially after that. Similarly, if 1 or more of the 17 strategic U.S.  seaports (or the ships carrying military supplies) were successfully  attacked, not only could massive civilian casualties be sustained and  critical infrastructure lost, but the military could also lose precious cargo  and time and be forced to rely heavily on already burdened airlift  capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Many Actions Have Been Taken or Are Underway to Address Seaport Security", "paragraphs": ["Since September 11, 2001, a number of actions have been taken or are  underway to address seaport security by a diverse mix of agencies and  seaport stakeholders. Federal agencies, such as the Coast Guard, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and TSA, have been tasked with  responsibilities and functions intended to make seaports more secure,  such as monitoring vessel traffic or inspecting cargo and containers, and  procuring new assets such as aircraft and cutters to conduct patrols and  respond to threats. In addition to these federal agencies, seaport  stakeholders in the private sector and at the state and local levels of  government have taken actions to enhance the security of seaports, such  as conducting security assessments of infrastructure and vessels operated  within the seaports and developing security plans to protect against a  terrorist attack. The actions taken by these agencies and stakeholders are  primarily aimed at three types of protections: (1) identifying and reducing  vulnerabilities of the facilities, infrastructure, and vessels operating in  seaports, (2) securing the cargo and commerce flowing through seaports,  and (3) developing greater maritime domain awareness through enhanced  intelligence, information-sharing capabilities, and assets and technologies."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Identifying and Reducing the Vulnerabilities of Facilities, Infrastructure, and Vessels", "paragraphs": ["Seaports facilitate the freedom of movement and flow of goods, and in  doing so they allow people, cargo, and vessels to transit with relative  anonymity. While seaports contain terminals and other facilities where  goods bound for import or export are unloaded and loaded, or where  people board and disembark cruise ships or ferries, seaports also often  contain other infrastructure critical to the nation\u2019s economy and defense,  such as military installations, chemical factories, powerplants, and  refineries. The combination of assets, access, and anonymity makes for  potentially attractive targets. The facilities and vessels in seaports can be  vulnerable on many fronts. For example, facilities where containers are  transferred between ships and railroad cars or trucks must be able to  screen vehicles entering the facility and routinely check cargo for  evidence of tampering. Chemical factories and other installations where  hazardous materials are present must be able to control access to areas  containing dangerous goods or hazardous substances. Vessels, ranging  from oil tankers and freighters to tugboats and passenger ferries, must be  able to restrict access to certain areas on board the vessel, such as the  bridge or other control stations critical to the vessel\u2019s operation.", "Given the wide range of potential targets, an effective security response  includes identifying targets, assessing risks to them, and taking steps to  reduce or mitigate these risks. An essential step in this process is to  conduct a security or vulnerability assessment. This assessment, which is  needed both for the seaport as a whole and for individual vessels and  facilities, identifies vulnerabilities in physical structures, personnel  protection systems, processes, and other areas that may lead to a security  breach. For example, this assessment might reveal weaknesses in an  organization\u2019s security systems or unprotected access points such as a  facility\u2019s perimeter not being sufficiently lighted or gates not being secured  or monitored after hours. After the vulnerabilities are identified, measures  can be then be identified that will reduce or mitigate the vulnerabilities  when installed or implemented.", "Most actions to identify and reduce the vulnerabilities within seaports  were specifically required by the Maritime Transportation Security Act of  2002 (MTSA). Passage of MTSA was a major step in establishing a security  framework for America\u2019s seaports. This security framework includes  assessment of risks, access controls over personnel and facilities, and  development and implementation of security plans, among other activities.  Table 1 shows some of the actions that have been taken and programs that  are in the process of being implemented to carry out this framework.", "The amount of effort involved in carrying out these actions and  implementing these programs has been considerable. For example, after  following an aggressive time frame to develop regulations to implement  the requirements of MTSA, the Coast Guard reviewed and approved the  security plans of the over 3,000 facilities and more than 9,000 vessels that  were required to identify their vulnerabilities and take action to reduce  them. Six months after July 1, 2004, the date by which the security plans  were to be implemented, the Coast Guard reported that it completed on- site inspections of all facilities and thousands of vessels to ensure the  plans were being implemented as approved. In addition to its work on the  security plans and inspections, the Coast Guard completed security  assessments of the nation\u2019s 55 most economically and militarily strategic  seaports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Securing the Cargo Flowing through Seaports", "paragraphs": ["While the facilities, vessels, and infrastructure within seaports have  vulnerabilities to terrorist attack, the cargoes transiting through seaports  also have vulnerabilities that terrorists could exploit. Containers are of  particular concern because they can be filled overseas at so many different  locations and are transported through complex logistics networks before  reaching U.S. seaports. From the time the container is loaded for shipping  to the time the container arrives at a seaport, the containers must go  through several steps that involve many different participants and many  points of transfer. Each of these steps in the supply chain presents its own  vulnerabilities that terrorists could take advantage of to place a WMD into  a container for shipment to the United States. A report prepared by the  National Defense University\u2019s Center for Technology and National Security  Policy stated that a container is ideally suited to deliver a WMD or a  radiological \u201cdirty bomb.\u201d While there have been no known incidents yet  of containers being used to transport WMDs, criminals have exploited  containers for other illegal purposes, such as smuggling weapons, people,  and illicit substances. Such activities demonstrate the vulnerability of the  freight transportation industry and suggest opportunities for further  exploitation of containers by criminals, including terrorist groups.", "In general, the actions taken thus far are aimed at identifying, tracking,  and scrutinizing the container cargo shipments moving into the country.  Most of these actions are being done by CBP, the DHS agency responsible  for protecting the nation\u2019s borders and official ports of entry. CBP uses a  layered approach that attempts to focus resources on potentially risky  cargo containers while allowing other cargo containers to proceed without  disrupting commerce. This approach includes the actions and programs  shown in table 2. Several of these actions involve a strategy of moving  primary reliance for security away from control systems at U.S. seaports  of entry and toward improved controls at points of origin and along the  way.", "The table also shows Operation Safe Commerce, initiated by the private  sector and now administered by DHS\u2019s Office of Domestic Preparedness,  which employs a similar strategy. This action, in pilot-project form that  was initially funded by $58 million appropriated by Congress, is intended  to help strengthen the security of cargo as it moves along the international  supply chain in containers. In late 2004, the second of two initial phases of  the project was concluded. This phase involved identifying the security  vulnerabilities of 19 separate supply chains and trying out technologies,  such as container seals or sensors, and their integration with  governmental policies, logistic processes and procedures that could  mitigate those vulnerabilities. The project has received additional funding  of $17 million that has been targeted to conduct a third phase in which the  best technologies and practices identified in the first two phases will be  further tested on a high number of containers for their effectiveness and  tamper resistance on three separate supply chains. A report on the best  practices identified in the first two phases is expected to be issued in June  2005, and completion of the third phase is expected by October 2006.", "The other actions taken to enhance the security of cargo and commerce  have been substantial. In 2002 CBP quickly rolled out the CSI and C-TPAT  programs shown in table 2 and enlisted the participation of several  countries and companies. By April 2005, CSI was operational at 35  seaports, located in 18 countries. Similarly, C-TPAT membership grew  from about 1,700 companies in January 2003 to over 9,000 companies in  March 2005. Given the urgency to take steps to protect against terrorism  after the September 11, 2001, attacks, some of the actions were taken  using an \u201cimplement and amend\u201d approach. That is, CBP had to  immediately implement the activity with the knowledge it may need to  modify the approach later. For example, in August 2002, CBP modified the  already developed Automatic Targeting System with new terrorism-related  criteria."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Developing Greater Maritime Domain Awareness", "paragraphs": ["The third main area of activity to enhance seaport security\u2014maritime  domain awareness\u2014is the understanding by stakeholders involved in  maritime security of anything associated with the global maritime  environment that could adversely affect the security, safety, economy or  environment of the United States. This awareness is essential to identify  and respond to any unusual patterns or anomalies that could portend a  possible terrorist attack. To be effective, maritime domain awareness must  be comprehensive and include information on vessels, seaport  infrastructures and facilities, shipping lanes and transit corridors,  waterways, and anchorages, among other things. It must also identify  threats as soon as possible and far enough away from U.S. seaports to  eliminate or mitigate the threat. By effectively identifying potential threats,  this awareness can be used as a force multiplier to position resources  where they are needed most to respond, instead of spreading out limited  resources to address all threats, no matter how unlikely they are to occur.  In addition, when shared, this awareness has the potential to facilitate the  coordination of efforts of local, state, federal, and even international  stakeholders in responding to potential threats.", "After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Coast Guard took steps such  as increasing the number of security patrols conducted within seaports  and waterways that helped contribute to increased maritime domain  awareness. Although maritime homeland security duties are not new to  the Coast Guard, the number of hours the Coast Guard used resources  (such as ships, boats, or aircraft) to carry out seaport, waterway, and  coastal security activities during fiscal year 2003 increased by 1,220  percent from their pre-September 11, 2001, level. Relative to the rest of the  Coast Guard\u2019s responsibilities, this represented an increase from 4 percent  of the Coast Guard\u2019s total annual resource hours being used for seaport,  waterway, and coastal security activities before September 11, 2001, to 34  percent by September 30, 2003. These activities provide an important input  to maritime domain awareness as it places Coast Guard personnel out in  the seaports where they can observe, report, and respond to suspect  activities or vessels. In addition, these patrols provide the Coast Guard  with a visible presence out in the seaport that may deter a potential  terrorist attack from being carried out.", "As the lead federal agency responsible for protecting the U.S. maritime  domain, the Coast Guard has spearheaded an interagency approach for  establishing maritime domain awareness. Within this approach are several  activities and actions intended to collect information and intelligence,  analyze the information and intelligence, and disseminate the analyzed  information and intelligence to appropriate federal, state, local, or private  seaport stakeholders. Some of these actions were required under MTSA,  such as the establishment of an Automatic Identification System to track  vessels, as well as creation of area maritime security committees of local  seaport stakeholders who identify and address risks within their seaport.  In addition to these actions, the Department of Defense and DHS formed a  Maritime Domain Awareness Senior Steering Group in 2004 to coordinate  national efforts to improve maritime domain awareness. Under Homeland  Security Presidential Directive 13, issued in December 2004, this steering  group is required to develop a national plan for maritime domain  awareness by June 2005. According to the head of the Coast Guard\u2019s  maritime domain awareness program, a draft of this plan is being reviewed  before it is submitted to the President. Table 3 shows some of the actions  currently being taken or underway to enhance maritime domain  awareness.", "While many of the activities to develop maritime domain awareness are  still underway, some progress has already been made. One activity in this  area that we have recently looked at concerns the process of information  sharing between federal and nonfederal seaport stakeholders participating  on area maritime security committees. The Coast Guard organized 43 of  these committees, covering the nation\u2019s 361 seaports. While a primary  purpose of the committees is to develop a seaport-wide security plan for  their respective seaports, the committees also provide links for  communicating threats and security information to seaport stakeholders\u2014 links that generally did not exist prior to the creation of the committees.  The types of information shared among committee members with security  clearances included assessments of vulnerabilities at specific seaport  locations, information about potential threats or suspicious activities, and  strategies to use in protecting key infrastructure. Our review found that  the committees improved information sharing among seaport security  stakeholders, including the timeliness, completeness, and usefulness of  information shared.", "Another aspect of improving maritime domain awareness involves having  the assets to communicate and conduct patrols, and in this regard, the  Coast Guard has budgeted for and is in the process of receiving substantial  new resources. In 1996, the Coast Guard initiated a major recapitalization  effort\u2014known as the Integrated Deepwater System\u2014to replace and  modernize the agency\u2019s aging and deteriorating fleet of aircraft and vessel  assets. The focus of the program is not just on new ships and aircraft, but  also on newer, more capable assets, with improved and integrated  command, control, communications and computers, intelligence,  surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) capabilities. Although the  program was started before the attacks of September 11, 2001, the Coast  Guard plans to leverage these capabilities of the 20 year, $17 billion dollar  program to enhance its maritime domain awareness and seaport security  operations such as patrols and response."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges for Improving Maritime Security Take Three Main Forms", "paragraphs": ["Propelled by a strong sense of urgency to secure the seaports, federal  agencies, such as the Coast Guard, CBP, and TSA, accomplished a  considerable amount in a short time.

We have not examined every action that has been started or  enhanced regarding maritime security, but our work to date has covered a  number of them. It is not surprising that we have found, besides the  progress made, a number of missteps, false starts, and inefficiencies.  These represent challenges to overcome.", "While some of these challenges will be resolved with time, analysis, and  oversight, there are other challenges that bear even more careful watching,  because they may prove to be considerably more difficult to overcome.

As we noted in a July 2003  report, the former U.S. Customs Service, part of which is now CBP  initiated the Container Security Initiative (CSI) in January 2002 in  response to security vulnerabilities created by ocean container trade and  the concern that terrorists could exploit these vulnerabilities to transport  or detonate WMDs in the United States.  During the first year, program  officials quickly designed and rolled out the initiative, modifying  operations over time. The service achieved strong initial participation  among the countries that it sought to enroll in the initiative, reaching  agreement with 15 governments to place U.S. personnel at 24 seaports, and  placing teams in 5 of these seaports. However, CBP had not taken  adequate steps to incorporate human capital planning, develop  performance measures, and plan strategically\u2014factors essential to the  program\u2019s long-term success and accountability. We noted, for example,  that:    More than 1 year into the implementation of the initiative, CBP had not  developed a systematic human capital plan to recruit, train, and assign  the more than 120 program staff that would be needed for long-term  assignments in a wide range of foreign seaports, some of which could  require language capabilities and diplomatic skills.", "CBP lacked performance measures for the initiative that demonstrated  program achievements and established accountability. For example,  the service lacked measures that assessed the impact of collocating  U.S. and foreign customs officials in foreign seaports to determine  which containers should be targeted for inspection.", "CBP\u2019s focus on short-term operational planning in order to quickly  implement the program impeded its ability to systematically carry out  strategic planning. We noted that the service did not have a strategic  plan for the initiative that describes how it intends to achieve program  goals and objectives. As a result, CBP lacked elements of strategic  planning that would improve the management of the program and  allow CBP to establish accountability for planned expenditures.", "As also reported in July 2003, another program that did not take adequate  steps to incorporate the human capital planning and performance  measures necessary for the program\u2019s long-term success and  accountability is CBP\u2019s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C- TPAT) program. Initiated in November 2001, C-TPAT is an initiative that  attempts to improve the security of the international supply chain. It is a  cooperative program between CBP and members of the international trade  community in which private companies agree to improve the security of  their supply chains in return for a reduced likelihood that their containers  will be inspected.", "During the first year, more than 1,700 companies agreed to participate in  the program, and most received the key benefit\u2014a reduced likelihood of  inspections for WMDs. However, we noted similar kinds of problems to  those in the CSI program. For example, we found that:    Even as it rolled out new program elements, CBP lacked a human  capital plan for increasing the number of C-TPAT staff from 10 to more  than 160.", "CBP had not developed performance measures for C-TPAT that would  establish accountability and measure program achievements. For  example, CBP had no performance measure to assess the impact of     C-TPAT on improving supply chain security practices, possibly  resulting in benefits being granted to undeserving companies.", "CBP lacked strategic planning in rolling out C-TPAT, failing to  communicate how it planned to implement critical program elements  designed to verify that companies have security measures in place and  follow through with recommended changes.", "We are currently reviewing both the CSI and CTPAT programs and will  soon be issuing reports to update our earlier evaluation of these programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Experienced Personnel for Program Implementation", "paragraphs": ["One major challenge in program implementation is the lack of experienced  personnel, which is to be expected given the rapid increase in newly hired  personnel since September 11, 2001. Agencies such as the Coast Guard  expect to see large increases in the number of staff over the next few years  to help meet new and expanded responsibilities. Consequently, they also  face a challenge in absorbing this increase and training them to be fully  productive. We pointed out early on that this would be a challenge for the  Coast Guard, and subsequent work has shown this to be the case. For  example, after a Coast Guard internal review found that readiness of its  multi-mission stations\u2014the shore-based units whose responsibilities  include finding and rescuing mariners in danger--had been in decline for an  extended period, the Coast Guard began efforts to improve the readiness  of the stations. This effort was complicated by the new homeland security  responsibilities the stations assumed after the terrorist attacks of  September 11, 2001. In a recent review of staffing and readiness at these  multi-mission stations, we found that the Coast Guard was still in the  process of defining new standards for security activities and had yet to  translate the impact of security-related mission responsibilities into  specific station readiness requirements, such as staffing standards.  Consequently, even though station staffing had increased 25 percent since  2001, the Coast Guard was unable to align staffing resources with mission  activities, which resulted in a significant number of positions not being  filled with qualified personnel and station personnel working significantly  longer hours than are allowed under the Coast Guard\u2019s work standards.", "We also identified personnel or human capital challenges such as lack of  experienced personnel related to the Coast Guard\u2019s program to oversee  implementation of MTSA-required security plans by owners and operators  of maritime facilities and vessels. These security plans are performance- based, meaning the Coast Guard has specified the outcomes it is seeking  to achieve and has given seaport stakeholders responsibility for identifying  and delivering the measures needed to achieve these outcomes. While this  approach provides flexibility to owners and operators in designing and  implementing their plans, it also places a premium on the skills and  experience of inspectors to identify deficiencies and recommend  corrective action. Because the Coast Guard had to review and assess for  compliance more than 12,000 security plans for facilities and vessels, it  had to rely heavily on reservists, which varied greatly in the level of their  skills and experience in this area.  For example, some reservists had  graduate degrees in security management while others had no formal  security training or experience. In June 2004, we recommended that the  Coast Guard carefully evaluate its efforts during the initial surge period for  inspections. The Coast Guard has adjusted its inspection program to  make its compliance assessments more relevant and useful, but it has not  yet determined the overall effectiveness of its compliance actions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Challenges in Coordinating Actions", "paragraphs": ["Coordinating massive new homeland security actions has been an  acknowledged challenge since the events of September 11, 2001, and  seaport security has been no exception.

Since the agency\u2019s inception in March 2003, DHS  leadership has provided a foundation to maintain critical operations while  undergoing transformation, and the agency has begun to put systems in  place to operate more effectively and efficiently as an agency. In managing  its transformation, however, DHS still faces such issues as forming  effective partnerships with other governmental and private-sector entities.", "We have made numerous recommendations related to information sharing,  particularly as it relates to fulfilling federal critical infrastructure  protection responsibilities. For example, we have reported on the  practices of organizations that successfully share sensitive or time-critical  information, including establishing trust relationships, developing  information-sharing standards and protocols, establishing secure  communications mechanisms, and disseminating sensitive information  appropriately. Federal agencies such as DHS and the Coast Guard have  concurred with our recommendations that they develop appropriate  strategies to address the many potential barriers to information sharing.  However, as of January 2005, many federal efforts to do this remain in the  planning or early implementation stages especially in the area of homeland  security information sharing, including establishing clear goals, objectives,  and expectations for the many participants in information-sharing efforts;  and consolidating, standardizing, and enhancing federal structures,  policies, and capabilities for the analysis and dissemination of information.  In this regard, the issue of information-sharing across agency and  stakeholder lines has emerged as a significant enough challenge that we  have also designated it as a high-risk area.

However, as of February 2005\u2014over 4 months after the Coast Guard had  developed a list of over 350 nonfederal area maritime security committee  participants as having a need for a security clearance\u2014only 28 had  submitted the necessary paperwork for the background check.

We found that  more than half of the seaport exercises and after-action reports we  examined raised communication issues, including problems with  information sharing among first responders and across agency lines. We  also found that over half of the exercises raised concerns with  communication and the resources available, including inadequate facilities  or equipment, differing response procedures, and the need for additional  training in joint agency response.

In this regard, there is perhaps no better  example in our recent work than the delayed attempts to develop a major  component of the security framework envisioned under MTSA\u2014an  identification card for maritime workers. The transportation worker  identification credential (TWIC) was initially envisioned by TSA before it  became part of DHS to be a universally recognized identification card  accepted across all modes of the national transportation system, including  airports, seaports, and railroad terminals, using biological metrics, such as  fingerprints, to ensure individuals with such an identification card had  undergone an assessment verifying that they do not pose a terrorism  security risk. TSA initially projected that it would test a prototype of such  a card system in 2003 and issue the first of the cards in August 2004. After  TSA became part of DHS, testing of the prototype was delayed because of  the difficulty in obtaining a response from DHS policy officials who also  subsequently directed the agency to reexamine additional options for  issuing the identification card. In addition to coordinating within DHS,  TSA has had to coordinate with over 800 national level transportation- related stakeholders. Several stakeholders at seaports and seaport  facilities told us that, while TSA solicited their input on some issues, TSA  did not respond to their input or involve them in making decisions  regarding eligibility requirements for the card. In particular, some  stakeholders said they had not been included in discussions about which  felony convictions should disqualify a worker from receiving a card, even  though they had expected and requested that DHS and TSA involve them  in these decisions. Obtaining stakeholder involvement is important  because achieving program goals hinges on the federal government\u2019s  ability to form effective partnerships among many public and private  stakeholders. If such partnerships are not in place\u2014and equally important,  if they do not work effectively\u2014TSA may not be able to test and deliver a  program that performs as expected. Until TSA and DHS officials agree on  a comprehensive project plan to guide the remainder of the project and  work together to set and complete deadlines, and TSA can effectively  manage its stakeholders\u2019 interests, it may not be able to successfully  develop, test, and implement the card program.

This is the view of many transportation security experts,  industry representatives, and federal, state, and local government officials  with whom we have spoken. While some security improvements are  inexpensive, most require substantial and continuous funding. For  example, a preliminary Coast Guard estimate placed the cost of  implementing the International Maritime Organization security code and  the security provisions in MTSA at approximately $1.5 billion for the first  year and $7.3 billion over the succeeding decade. This estimate should be  viewed more as a rough indicator than a precise measure of costs, but it  does show that the cost is likely to be substantial.", "At the federal level, more than $560 million in grants has been made  available to seaports, localities, and other stakeholders since 2002 under  the Port Security Grant Program and the Urban Area Security Initiative.  The purpose of these programs was to reduce the vulnerability of seaports  to potential terrorist attacks by enhancing facility and operation security.  The programs funded several projects, including security assessments;  physical enhancements, such as gates and fences; surveillance equipment,  such as cameras; and the acquisition of security equipment, such as patrol  vessels or vehicles. Awardees have included seaport authorities, local  governments, vessel operators, and private companies with facilities in  seaport areas. Interest in receiving port security grants has been strong,  and, as figure 2 shows, applicant requests have far exceeded available  funds.

In  our 2002 statement on national preparedness, we highlighted the need to  examine the sustainability of increased funding not only for seaport  security, but for homeland security efforts in general. The current  economic environment makes this a difficult time for private industry and  state and local governments to make security investments and sustain  increased security costs. According to industry representatives and  experts we contacted, most of the transportation industry operates on a  very thin profit margin, making it difficult to pay for additional security  measures. Budgetary and revenue constraints, coupled with increasing  demands on resources, makes it more critical that federal programs be  designed carefully to match the priorities and needs of all partners\u2014 federal, state, local, and private\u2014and provide the greatest results for the  expenditure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Setting Performance Goals and Measures and Assessing Risk Are Important Next Steps", "paragraphs": ["The final purpose of my testimony today is to offer observations, based on  the work we have done to date, about important next steps for decision  makers in charting a course for future actions.

The amount of activity in response has been considerable, and  although there have been no serious incidents in the United States in the  interim, the threat of terrorism will likely persist well into the 21st century.  Thus, it is important to continue to make progress in our efforts. Beyond  addressing the kinds of challenges discussed above, however, two other  matters stand out. One involves developing a better understanding of how  much progress has actually been made to secure our seaports; the other  involves developing a better strategy to manage risk and prioritize what  areas need further progress and how resources can be best allocated."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Goals and Measures Makes Determining Progress Difficult", "paragraphs": ["Although there is widespread agreement that actions taken so far have led  to a heightened awareness of the need for security and an enhanced ability  to identify and respond to many security threats, it is difficult to translate  these actions into a clear sense of how far we have progressed in making  seaports more secure. One reason is that seaport security efforts, like  homeland security efforts in general, lack measurable goals, as well as  performance measures to measure progress toward those goals. As others  such as the Gilmore Commission have stated, a continuing problem for  homeland security has been the lack of clear strategic guidance about the  definition and objectives of preparedness. For example, the Coast Guard  has a set of performance indicators for each of its nonsecurity missions. It  regularly reports on how well it is doing in rescuing mariners at sea,  interdicting foreign fishing boats attempting to fish the in U.S. exclusive  economic zone, or maintaining aids to navigation on the nation\u2019s  waterways. However, although it has been more than 3 years since the  September 11, 2001, attacks, the Coast Guard is still in the process of  developing a performance indicator for its seaport security activities that  can be used to indicate what progress has been made to secure seaports.  Completion of this indicator and careful tracking of it over the long term is  essential to help ensure that taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely to  make seaports more secure. Similarly, as discussed earlier in describing  the actions taken to secure the cargo transiting through seaports in  containers, performance measures are needed to determine the progress  such actions are making to reduce vulnerabilities of the international  supply chain.", "A challenge exists in measuring progress in this area, because seaport  security, like many aspects of homeland security, relies upon the  coordinated actions of many stakeholders and, in many cases, upon  \u201clayers\u201d of defenses. In this regard, we have pointed out that systems and  service standards\u2014which focus on the performance, design, and overall  management of processes and activities\u2014hold great potential to improve  coordination across such dimensions and enhance measurement of  continued preparedness.

We cannot  afford to protect everything against all threats\u2014choices must be made  about security priorities. Thus, great care needs to be taken to assign  available resources to address the greatest risks, along with selecting  those strategies that make the most efficient and effective use of  resources.", "One approach to help ensure that resources are assigned and appropriate  strategies are selected to address the greatest risks is through risk  management\u2014that is, defining and reducing risk. A risk management  approach is a systematic process for analyzing threats and vulnerabilities,  together with the criticality (that is, the relative importance) of the assets  involved. This process consists of a series of analytical and managerial  steps, basically sequential, that can be used to assess vulnerabilities,  determine the criticality (that is, the relative importance) of the assets  being considered, determine the threats to the assets, and assess  alternatives for reducing the risks. Once these are assessed and identified,  actions to improve security and reduce the risks can be chosen from the  alternatives for implementation. To be effective, however, this process  must be repeated when threats or conditions change to incorporate any  new information to adjust and revise the assessments and actions.", "Some elements of risk management have been incorporated into seaport  security activities. For example, to meet the requirements of MTSA,  security plans for seaports, facilities, and vessels have been developed  based on assessments that identify their vulnerabilities. In addition, the  Coast Guard is using the Port Security Risk Assessment Tool, which is  designed to prioritize risk according to a combination of possible threat,  consequence, and vulnerability. Under this approach, seaport  infrastructure that is determined to be both a critical asset and a likely and  vulnerable target would be a high priority for security enhancements or  funding. By comparison, infrastructure that is vulnerable to attack but not  as critical or infrastructure that is very critical but already well protected  would be lower in priority. In a homeland security setting, possible uses of  data produced from risk management efforts include informing decisions  on where the federal government might spend billions of dollars within  and between federal departments, as well as informing decisions on grants  awarded to state and local governments.", "As the nation moves ahead with seaport security efforts, there are plans to  incorporate risk management as part of the nation\u2019s larger homeland  security strategy. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7, issued in  December 2003, charged DHS with integrating the use of risk management  into homeland security activities. The directive called on the Department  to develop policies, guidelines, criteria, and metrics for this effort. To meet  this requirement, the Coast Guard has taken steps to use risk management  in prioritizing the protection of key infrastructure within and between  seaports. We are currently in the process of assessing the progress the  Coast Guard has made in these efforts. In addition, we are reviewing the  extent to which a risk management approach is being used by other DHS  agencies, such as the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection  Directorate, to evaluate the relative risk faced by key infrastructure within  seaports and across broad sectors of national activity, such as seaports  and aviation, to help ensure funding and resources are allocated to where  they are needed most. Our work is still under way and not far enough  along to discuss at this time.

Striking the right balance between  increased security and protecting economic vitality is an important and  difficult task. Considering this, three things stand out as important from  the work we have conducted:    Seaports are not retreating as a homeland security issue. They are an  attractive terrorist target and are likely to remain so, because by their  nature they represent a vulnerability that is always open to potential  exploitation.", "Seaport security has lived up to its billing as an area in which security  measures can be difficult to implement. The range of activity in seaport  areas can be extremely wide, as can the range of stakeholders and the  fragmentation of responsibility among them. Many of the problems we  have identified with individual programs and efforts can likely be  overcome with time and effort, but success is not assured. We are  already seeing some efforts, such as the TWIC identification card,  becoming deeply mired in problems. These activities will thus continue  to demand close attention.", "The national dialogue on this issue is likely to focus increasingly in  trying to determine what we are getting for our efforts and where we  should invest the dollars we have. Therefore, it is critical that federal  programs be designed carefully to try to match the priorities and needs  of all partners\u2014federal, state, local, and private\u2014and use performance  measures to effectively allocate funds and resources. On this point,  there is work to do, because agencies such as the Coast Guard  currently lack a systematic approach for explaining the relationship  between the expenditure of resources and performance results in  seaport security, limiting its ability to critically examine its resource  needs and prioritize program efforts. Providing answers also requires  an ability to carefully assess what the key vulnerabilities are and what  should be done to protect them.
