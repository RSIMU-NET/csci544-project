Further, while the Internet offers time and cost savings to the process of searching for homes, Internet-oriented brokerage firms account for only a small share of the brokerage market. Finally, there has been ongoing debate about the potential competitive effects of bank involvement in real estate brokerage. GAO was asked to discuss (1) factors affecting price competition in the residential real estate brokerage industry, (2) the status of the use of the Internet in residential real estate brokerage and potential barriers to its increased use, and (3) the effect on competition and consumers of residential real estate brokerage by state-chartered banks in states that permit this practice."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The residential real estate brokerage industry has competitive attributes, but its competition appears to be based more on nonprice variables--such as quality, reputation, or level of service--than on brokerage fees, according to a review of the academic literature and interviews with industry analysts and participants. One potential cause of the industry's apparent lack of price variation is the use of multiple listing services (MLS), which facilitates cooperation among brokers in a way that can benefit consumers but may also discourage participating brokers from deviating from conventional commission rates. For instance, an MLS listing gives brokers information on the commission that will be paid to the broker who brings the buyer to that property. This practice potentially creates a disincentive for home sellers or their brokers to offer less than the prevailing rate, since buyers' brokers may show high-commission properties first. Some state laws and regulations may also affect price competition, such as those prohibiting brokers from giving clients rebates on commissions. Although such laws and regulations can protect consumers, the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission have argued that they may also unnecessarily limit competition and reduce consumers' choices. The Internet has changed the way consumers look for real estate and has facilitated the creation and expansion of alternatives to traditional brokers. A variety of Web sites allows consumers to access property information that once was available only by contacting brokers directly. The Internet also has fostered the growth of nontraditional residential real estate brokerage models, including discount brokers and broker referral services. However, industry participants and analysts cited several obstacles to more widespread use of the Internet in real estate transactions, including restrictions on listing information on Web sites, some traditional brokers' resistance to cooperating with nontraditional firms, and certain state laws and regulations. Although about 30 states potentially authorize state-chartered banks or their operating subsidiaries to engage in some form of residential real estate brokerage, few banks in these states appear to have done so. GAO's contacts with seven banks engaged in brokerage in two states found that they were located in small communities with few other brokerage options, and that their brokerage services did not differ significantly from those of other local real estate brokers. In general, because residential real estate brokerage by state-chartered banks appears to be so limited, its effect on competition and consumers has likely been minimal."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The fees paid for residential real estate brokerage\u2014the bringing together of  buyers and sellers of homes and the provision of related services by  licensed brokers and agents\u2014have increased as home prices have risen in  recent years, well beyond the rate of general price inflation.

(A bibliography of selected literature reviewed appears at the end  of this report.) We did not collect original data on residential real estate  brokerage fees or attempt to analyze the extent of price competition within  any specific market. We interviewed and obtained relevant documents  from industry analysts and officials of real estate brokerage and banking  trade associations, including the National Association of Realtors\u00ae (NAR);  national associations of state real estate and banking regulators; and the  Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Justice  (DOJ), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). We also interviewed  officials of 10 residential real estate brokerage firms and franchisors,  including 2 companies with major national franchise operations, 1 full- service brokerage firm, 2 Internet-oriented full-service discount brokerage  firms, 2 companies that franchise limited-service discount brokerage  offices, and 3 Internet-oriented information and referral companies. The  brokerages and franchisors we spoke with included both small and large  firms, and these firms relied on the Internet to varying degrees. Because we  spoke to a limited number of brokerage firms and franchisors, their views  cannot be interpreted as being representative of all such firms. We also  reviewed the activities of two states, Iowa and Wisconsin, where some  banks are active in residential real estate brokerage. We spoke with these  states\u2019 banking regulatory agencies and real estate trade associations, as  well as with seven banks in these states that engage in residential real  estate brokerage. The information on these seven banks is intended to be  illustrative and cannot be generalized to state-chartered banks nationwide.  We also reviewed relevant selected state laws and regulations and state and  federal court decisions. The scope of our work was limited to residential  real estate brokerage and did not address other aspects of real estate  transactions, such as mortgage financing, title search and insurance, or the  settlement process. We performed our work primarily in Boston,  Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; and Washington, D.C., between January  and July 2005.

Because real estate  transactions are complex and infrequent for most people, many consumers  benefit from a broker\u2019s specialized knowledge of the process and of local  market conditions. Still, some consumers choose to complete real estate  transactions without a broker\u2019s assistance, including those who sell their  properties on their own, or \u201cfor-sale-by-owner.\u201d", "For many years, the industry has used a commission-based pricing model,  with sellers paying a percentage of the sales price as a brokerage fee.  Brokers acting for sellers typically invite other brokers to cooperate in the  sale of the property and offer a portion of the total commission to whoever  produces the buyer. Agents involved in the transaction may be required to  split their shares of the commission with their brokers. Under this  approach, brokers and agents receive compensation only when sales are  completed. Common law has generally considered both brokers  cooperating in the sale of a home to have a fiduciary responsibility to  represent the seller\u2019s interests, unless the buyer\u2019s broker has specifically  agreed to represent the buyer\u2019s interests.", "In recent years, alternatives to this traditional full-service brokerage model  have become more common, although industry analysts and participants  told us that they still represent a small share of the overall market.

Discount limited- service brokerages offer a limited package of services or allow clients to  choose from a menu of \u201cunbundled\u201d services and charge reduced fees on a  commission or fee-for-service basis.", "Most local real estate markets have an MLS that pools information about  homes that area brokers have agreed to sell. Participating brokers use an  MLS to \u201clist\u201d the homes they have for sale, providing other brokers with  detailed information on the properties, including how much of the  commission will be shared with the buyer\u2019s agent. An MLS serves as a  single, convenient source of information that provides maximum exposure  for sellers and facilitates the home search for buyers. Each MLS is a private  entity with its own membership requirements and operating policies and  procedures. According to NAR, approximately 900 MLSs nationwide are  affiliated with the trade association, whose more than 1 million members  represent approximately 60 percent of all active licensed real estate  brokers and agents. NAR has affiliations with 54 state and territorial  associations and more than 1,600 local associations. When one of these  local associations owns and operates an MLS, this NAR-affiliated MLS is  expected to follow NAR\u2019s model guidelines for various operational and  governance issues, such as membership requirements and rules for  members\u2019 access to and use of listing information. If a local association or  its MLS fails to comply with these guidelines, it can lose important  insurance coverage provided through NAR or have its charter membership  in NAR revoked. An MLS that is not affiliated with NAR is not bound by  these guidelines.", "Individual states regulate real estate brokerage, establishing licensing and  other requirements for brokers and agents. Of the two categories of state- licensed real estate practitioners, brokers generally manage their own  offices, and agents, or salespeople, must work for licensed brokers. States  generally require brokers to meet more educational requirements than  agents, have more experience, or both. For the purposes of this report, we  generally refer to all licensed real estate practitioners as brokers.  Generally, a state commission, led by appointees who may have a  professional background in real estate, oversees implementation of and  compliance with state requirements and may respond to complaints about  brokers or agents or take disciplinary action.

The Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency, which is a bureau within the Department of  the Treasury (Treasury), charters and regulates national banks. State- chartered banks are overseen by state regulators and, if they have federal  deposit insurance, a federal regulator. Many companies that own or  control banks are regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System (Federal Reserve) as bank holding companies. Under the  1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (Pub. L.

In late 2000, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury  released a proposed regulation to allow banking companies to enter real  estate brokerage under some circumstances. However, from fiscal years  2003 to 2005, amendments to appropriations laws precluded the Federal  Reserve and the Treasury from issuing such regulations.

These potential causes include  broker cooperation, largely through MLSs, which can discourage brokers from competing with one another on price; resistance from traditional full- service brokers to brokers who offer discounted prices or limited services;  limited pressure from consumers for lower prices; and state antirebate and  minimum service laws and regulations, which some argue may limit pricing  and service options for consumers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Real Estate Brokerage Is Characterized More by Nonprice Competition Than Price Competition", "paragraphs": ["The real estate brokerage industry has a number of attributes that  economists normally associate with active price competition.

Moreover, uniformity in commission rates within a market  at a given time does not necessarily indicate a lack of price competition.  But some economists have noted that in a competitive marketplace, real  estate commission rates could reasonably be expected to vary across  markets or over time\u2014that is, to be more sensitive to housing market  conditions than has been traditionally observed. For example,  commission rates within a market at a given time do not appear to vary  significantly on the basis of the price of the home. Thus, the brokerage fee,  in dollar terms, for selling a $300,000 home is typically about three times  the fee for selling a $100,000 home, although the time or effort required to  sell the two homes may not differ substantially. Similarly, commission  rates do not appear to have changed as much as might be expected in  response to rapidly rising home prices in recent years. Between 1998 and  2003, the national median sales price of existing homes, as reported by  NAR, increased 35 percent, while inflation over the same period was 10  percent, leaving an increase of some 25 percent in the inflation-adjusted  price of housing. According to REAL Trends, average commission rates fell  from an estimated 5.5 percent in 1998 to an estimated 5.1 percent in 2003, a decrease of about 7 percent. Thus, with the increase in housing prices, the  brokerage fee for selling a median-priced home increased even as the  commission rate fell.", "Some economists have suggested that uniformity in commission rates can  lead brokers to compete on factors other than price in order to gain market  share. For example, brokers might hire more agents in an effort to win  more sellers\u2019 listings. Brokers may also compete by spending more on  advertising or offering higher levels of service to attract clients. Although  some of these activities can benefit consumers, some economic literature  suggest that such actions lead to inefficiency because brokerage services  could be provided by fewer agents or at a lower cost. For example,  although advertising can be effective in providing buyers and sellers with  information about broker services, the consumer benefit from brokers\u2019  expenditures on advertising or promotions aimed at acquiring listings may  be less than their cost to the broker.", "To the extent that commission rates may have declined slightly in recent  years, the change may be the result in part of rapidly rising home prices,  which have generated higher brokerage industry revenues even with lower  commission rates. However, competition from increasing numbers of  discount, fee-for-service, and other nontraditional brokerage models may  have also contributed to the decline. These nontraditional models typically  offer lower fees, and although they currently represent only about 2  percent of the market, they may be putting some downward pressure on  the fees charged by traditional brokerages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certain Factors May Inhibit Price Competition within the Real Estate Brokerage Industry", "paragraphs": ["Factors related to the cooperation among brokers facilitated by MLSs,  some brokers\u2019 resistance to discounters, and consumer attitudes may  inhibit price competition within the real estate brokerage industry."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cooperation Facilitated by Multiple Listing Services", "paragraphs": ["While MLSs provide important benefits to consumers by aggregating data  on homes for sale and facilitating brokers\u2019 efforts to bring buyers and  sellers together, the cooperative nature of the MLS system can also in effect  discourage brokers from competing with one another on price. Because  participating in an MLS in the areas where they exist is widely considered  essential to doing business, brokerage firms may have an incentive to adopt  practices that comply with MLS policies and customs. As previously noted,  MLSs facilitate cooperation in part by enabling brokers to share  information on the portion of the commission that sellers\u2019 brokers are  offering to buyers\u2019 brokers. In the past, some MLSs required participating  brokers to charge standard commission rates, but this practice ended after  the Supreme Court ruled, in 1950, that an agreement to fix minimum prices  was illegal under federal antitrust laws. Subsequently, some MLSs  adopted suggested fee schedules, but this too ended after DOJ brought a  series of antitrust actions in the 1970s alleging that this practice constituted price fixing. Today, MLSs no longer establish standard commission rates  or recommend how commissions should be divided among brokers. MLS  listings do show how much sellers\u2019 brokers will pay other brokers for  cooperating in a sale, according to industry participants. When choosing  among comparable homes for sale, brokers have a greater incentive\u2014all  else being equal\u2014to first show prospective buyers homes that offer other  brokers the prevailing commission rate than homes that offer a lower rate.  Therefore, even without formal policies to maintain uniform rates,  individual brokers\u2019 reliance on the cooperation of other brokers to bring  buyers to listed properties may help maintain a standard commission rate  within a local area, at least for buyers\u2019 brokers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Traditional Brokers\u2019 Resistance to Nontraditional Brokerage Models", "paragraphs": ["Traditional brokers may discourage price competition by resisting  cooperation with brokers and firms whose business models depart from  charging conventional commission rates, according to several industry  analysts and participants we spoke with. A discount broker may advertise a  lower commission rate to attract listings, but the broker\u2019s success in selling  those homes, and in attracting additional listings in the future, depends in  part on other brokers\u2019 willingness to cooperate (by showing the homes to  prospective buyers) in the sale of those listings. Some discount full-service  and discount limited-service brokerage firms we interviewed said that  other brokers had refused to show homes listed by discounters. In  addition, traditional brokers may in effect discourage discount brokers  from cooperating in the sale of their listings by offering discounters a lower  buyer\u2019s broker commission than the prevailing rate offered to other  brokers. This practice can make it more difficult for discount brokers to  recruit new agents because they may earn more working for a broker who  receives the prevailing commission from other brokers. Some traditional  full-service brokers have argued that discount brokers often do less of the  work required to complete the transaction and, thus, deserve a smaller  portion of the seller\u2019s commission.

Buyers may also have little concern about commission rates because  sellers directly pay the commissions. Sellers may be reluctant to reduce the  portion of the commission offered to buyers\u2019 brokers because doing so can  reduce the likelihood that their home will be shown. In addition, home  sellers who have earned large profits as housing prices have climbed in  recent years may have been less sensitive to the price of brokerage fees.

Opponents of antirebate provisions argue that such restrictions serve only  to limit choices for consumers and to discourage price competition by  preventing brokers from offering discounts. Proponents also note that  offering a rebate is one of the few ways to reduce the effective price of  buyer brokerage services since commissions are typically paid wholly by  the seller. In March 2005, DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division filed suit against the  Kentucky Real Estate Commission, arguing that the commission\u2019s  administrative regulation banning rebates violated federal antitrust laws. In  its complaint, DOJ argued that the regulation unreasonably restrained  competition to the detriment of consumers, making it more difficult for  them to obtain lower prices for brokerage services.

Advocates of minimum service standards  argue that they protect consumers by ensuring that brokers provide a basic  level of assistance. Further, full-service brokers argue that such standards  prevent them from having to unfairly shoulder additional work when the  other party uses a limited-service broker. Opponents of these standards  argue that they restrict consumer choice and raise costs by impeding  brokerage models that offer limited services for a lower price. In April  and May 2005, DOJ wrote to state officials in Oklahoma, and DOJ and FTC  jointly wrote to officials in Alabama, Missouri, and Texas, discouraging  adoption of these states\u2019 proposed minimum service laws and regulations.

It is through the Internet that these  companies are able to efficiently reach potential consumers and offer  those customers services and access to brokers.", "Alternative listing Web sites offer alternatives to the MLS, allowing  sellers who want to sell their homes themselves to advertise their  properties to buyers and giving buyers another source of information on  homes for sale. These alternative listing sites include the Web sites of  local newspapers, Craig\u2019s List, and \u201cfor-sale-by-owner\u201d Web sites.  These services, which generally do not provide buyers and sellers with  the assistance of a licensed broker, are limited to providing consumers  with a venue for advertising homes and viewing properties for sale."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wider Use of the Internet in Real Estate Brokerage Will Depend on the Availability of Listing Information and Other Factors", "paragraphs": ["Several factors could limit the extent to which the Internet is used in real  estate transactions. A key factor is the extent to which information about  properties listed in an MLS is widely available. Currently, buyers may view  MLS-listed properties on many Web sites, including broker and MLS Web  sites and on Realtor.com. NAR has considered a policy on Virtual Office  Web sites (VOW) that would allow brokers to selectively exclude their MLS  listings from being displayed on certain other brokers\u2019 Web sites and would  prohibit certain types of companies, such as information and referral  companies, from operating VOWs. Proponents of this policy argue that  listings are the work product, and thus the property, of the selling broker,  who should have control over how the listings are used. Proponents  maintain that brokers should be able to prevent certain companies\u2014such  as information and referral companies\u2014from using their listings simply to  earn referral fees. NAR and others have also argued that freely posting MLS  data\u2014such as addresses, descriptions of properties, and property tax  information\u2014on the Internet may compromise the security and privacy of  their clients.", "Opponents of the VOW policy argue that it is anticompetitive because it  would unfairly limit Internet-oriented brokers\u2019 ability to provide their  clients with access to MLS listings through their Web sites. They argue that  NAR already has policies on the appropriate distribution of MLS  information, and that their rules should treat information disseminated via  the Internet no differently than information distributed via traditional  bricks-and-mortar brokerages. They also note that measures can be taken  to address security and privacy concerns related to MLS listings on the  Internet, such as restricting the number of listings that result from an  online search. Some opponents also expressed concern that some Internet- oriented brokers would not be able to compete if\u2014in a market dominated  by a single player\u2014they were selectively excluded from displaying that  player\u2019s listings.", "Even with few restrictions on the availability of information about  properties for sale, Internet-oriented brokerage firms may face other  challenges. First, Internet-oriented brokers we spoke with described  resistance, similar to that previously described, involving some traditional  brokerages that refused to show the Internet-oriented brokerages\u2019 listed  properties or offered them buyers\u2019 brokers commissions that were less  than those offered to other brokers. However, the online availability of  listing information may discourage such behavior by enabling buyers to  more easily detect whether a broker is avoiding other brokers\u2019 listings that  are of interest. Second, some Internet-oriented companies said that state  antirebate laws and regulations could affect them disproportionately, since  their model often was built around such rebates.", "Finally, certain factors may inhibit the use of the Internet for accomplishing  the full range of activities needed for real estate transactions. For example,  some companies told us that they would like to make greater use of the  Internet to facilitate the execution of the contract used in the purchase and  sale of a property. However, they said that there is no single, uniform sales  contract for residential real estate, and state laws vary with respect to  which disclosures must accompany a sales contract. They also said that  state laws vary in their requirements for physical copies of signed  contracts, attorneys\u2019 involvement in signing a contract, and the  circumstances under which a contract may be rescinded. As a result, it  would be difficult to develop an online platform that could be used  nationwide for residential real estate contracts. Further, industry  participants told us that no uniform technology currently exists to facilitate  the assistance that brokers often provide in other aspects of the real estate  transaction, such as coordinating inspections, appraisals, financing, title  searches, and settlements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Few State-Chartered Banks Appear to Engage in Real Estate Brokerage", "paragraphs": ["Our review of certain state statutes and regulations showed that  approximately 30 states may potentially authorize state-chartered banks or  their operating subsidiaries to engage in some real estate brokerage  activities. However, we also found that because only a small number of  banks in these states appeared to have taken advantage of this authority,  the effect on competition and consumers was likely minimal. We reviewed  the state statutes and regulations that NAR and the Conference of State  Bank Supervisors, using the broadest interpretations, identified as  potentially authorizing banks\u2019 brokerage activity. While many of these laws  are ambiguous and subject to interpretation by state regulators, it appears  that at least 5 states and the District of Columbia provide relatively clear  authority for banks or their subsidiaries to engage in real estate brokerage.  An additional 8 states permit involvement in other real-estate-related  activities or in unspecified activities that might be approved by the state. At  least 7 states could potentially permit banks to conduct real estate  activities as an incidental power, an activity closely related to banking, or  an activity that is financial in nature. Many of the remaining states could  potentially allow state-chartered banks to conduct real estate activities to  the extent that national banks or other federal depository institutions are  allowed to do so.", "The exact number of state-chartered banks that engage in real estate  brokerage is unknown because not all state regulators track such activity.  However, available data and interviews with real estate, banking, and state  regulatory officials suggest that such activity is very limited among the  approximately 5,700 state-chartered banks nationwide. In separate surveys  in 2001, NAR and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors identified only  eight states where state-chartered banks had engaged in at least some real  estate brokerage activity. More recent data were not available, but  regulators and industry officials told us that they doubted that this activity  had expanded significantly since 2001. They noted that real estate  brokerage is not typically part of a bank\u2019s business model, and that banks in  small communities may be reluctant to compete with local real estate  brokers that may be clients of the banks.", "We spoke with officials from banks engaged in real estate brokerage, bank  regulators, and real estate industry representatives in Iowa and  Wisconsin\u2014two states identified as having the most banks involved in real  estate brokerage in 2001. The seven such banks we identified in these  states were all in small communities that had few or no other real estate  brokers, and some of these banks noted that their presence provided an  additional option for local residents. None of the banks we spoke with  offered brokerage services that were different than those offered by  traditional brokerages, and none offered discount brokerage services. Most  of the bank officials said that real estate brokerage was not a large portion  of their business. They said their primary goal was not to link brokerage  customers to the bank\u2019s mortgage financing and added that most of their  brokerage customers in fact obtained their mortgages outside of the bank.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the  report date.
