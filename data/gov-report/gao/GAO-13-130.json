Wait times for outpatient medical appointments--referred to as medical appointments--are calculated as the number of days elapsed from the desired date, which is defined as the date on which the patient or health care provider wants the patient to be seen. The reliability of reported wait time performance measures is dependent on the consistency with which schedulers record the desired date in the scheduling system in accordance with VHA's scheduling policy. However, VHA's scheduling policy and training documents for recording desired date are unclear and do not ensure consistent use of the desired date. Some schedulers at Veterans Affairs medical centers (VAMC) that GAO visited did not record the desired date correctly. For example, three schedulers changed the desired date based on appointment availability; this would have resulted in a reported wait time that was shorter than the patient actually experienced. VHA officials acknowledged limitations of measuring wait times based on desired date, and described additional information used to monitor veterans' access to medical appointments, including patient satisfaction survey results. Without reliable measurement of how long patients are waiting for medical appointments, however, VHA is less equipped to identify areas that need improvement and mitigate problems that contribute to wait times.", "While visiting VAMCs, GAO also found inconsistent implementation of VHA's scheduling policy that impedes VAMCs from scheduling timely medical appointments. For example, four clinics across three VAMCs did not use the electronic wait list to track new patients that needed medical appointments as required by VHA scheduling policy, putting these clinics at risk for losing track of these patients. Furthermore, VAMCs' oversight of compliance with VHA's scheduling policy, such as ensuring the completion of required scheduler training, was inconsistent across facilities. VAMCs also described other problems with scheduling timely medical appointments, including VHA's outdated and inefficient scheduling system, gaps in scheduler and provider staffing, and issues with telephone access. For example, officials at all VAMCs GAO visited reported that high call volumes and a lack of staff dedicated to answering the telephones impede scheduling of timely medical appointments. In January 2012, VHA distributed telephone access best practices that, if implemented, could help improve telephone access to clinical care.", "VHA is implementing a number of initiatives to improve veterans' access to medical appointments such as expanded use of technology to interact with patients and provide care, which includes the use of secure messaging between patients and their health care providers. VHA also is piloting a new initiative to provide health care services through contracts with community providers that aims to reduce travel and wait times for veterans who are unable to receive certain types of care within VHA in a timely way."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VHA take actions to (1) improve the reliability of its medical appointment wait time measures, (2) ensure VAMCs consistently implement VHA's scheduling policy, (3) require VAMCs to allocate staffing resources based on scheduling needs, and (4) ensure that VAMCs provide oversight of telephone access and implement best practices to improve telephone access for clinical care.

At these facilities, VHA provides outpatient care through primary and  specialty care clinics. In fiscal year 2011, there were more than 8 million  veterans enrolled in VHA\u2019s health system, and VHA provided nearly   80 million outpatient medical appointments to veterans for primary and  specialty care.", "Although access to timely medical appointments is critical to ensuring that  veterans obtain needed medical care, long wait times and inadequate  scheduling processes at VHA medical facilities have been long-standing  problems. For example, in 2001, GAO reviewed the timeliness of medical  appointments and found that two-thirds of the specialty care clinics visited  had wait times longer than 30 days, although some clinics had made  progress in reducing wait times, primarily by improving their scheduling  processes and making better use of their staff. Later, in 2007, the VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported that VHA facilities did not  always follow VHA\u2019s scheduling policies and processes and that the  accuracy of VHA\u2019s reported wait times for medical appointments was  unreliable. Most recently, in 2012, the VA OIG reported that VHA was  not providing all new veterans with timely access to full mental health  evaluations, and had overstated its success in providing veterans with  timely new and follow-up appointments for mental health treatment.", "VHA has reported continued improvements in measuring and achieving  timely access to medical appointments. For example, in fiscal year 2011,  VHA had a goal of scheduling medical appointments within 14 days of the  patient\u2019s or provider\u2019s desired medical appointment date, and in that  year, VA reported that it completed 95 percent of specialty care medical  appointments and 94 percent of primary care medical appointments  within this time frame. However, patient complaints and media reports  about long wait times have persisted, prompting renewed concerns about  excessive medical appointment wait times. You asked us to evaluate  VHA\u2019s scheduling of timely medical appointments.

At each of the four VAMCs we visited, we interviewed the leadership team, scheduling managers, and managers from all of our  selected clinics about oversight activities to ensure the accuracy of  scheduling data, and about what data and measures they use to manage  clinics and improve medical appointment timeliness. In addition, we  interviewed schedulers from the 9 primary care clinics and 10 of the   14 specialty care clinics we visited using a structured protocol to  determine the accuracy with which schedulers determined and recorded  medical appointment data for hypothetical patient medical appointments  into the scheduling system in accordance with VHA\u2019s scheduling policy.

Specifically, VHA\u2019s scheduling policy and  related scheduler training documents do not provide consistent guidance  about when or whether the desired date should be based on the patient\u2019s  or provider\u2019s preference. While the policy defines desired date as \u201cthe  date on which the patient or provider wants the patient to be seen,\u201d it also  instructs that the \u201cthe desired date needs to be defined by the patient\u201d for  new patient medical appointments, medical appointments scheduled in  response to consult requests, and established patient follow-up medical  appointments. When there is a conflict between the provider and patient  desired date, the scheduler is instructed to contact the provider for a  decision on the return time frame, but the policy and training documents  do not clearly describe under what circumstances the provider\u2019s date  should be used as the desired date. Further, providers may designate a  desired appointment time frame for a follow-up medical appointment  rather than a specific date; in such cases, the policy is unclear as to  which date within the provider\u2019s designated time frame the scheduler  should enter as the desired date. The scheduling policy and training do  not provide sufficient guidance to ensure consistent use of desired date in  these various scheduling scenarios.", "VHA central office officials responsible for developing VHA\u2019s scheduling  policy and related training documents told us that the desired date is  intentionally broad to account for all of the scheduling scenarios that may  exist. However, leadership officials from the four VAMCs we visited and  their corresponding VISNs reported problems with the unclear guidance  on the desired date definition, and difficulties achieving consistent and  correct use of the desired date by their schedulers. In addition, given the  ambiguity in the scheduling policy and related training documents, there  are different interpretations of the desired date between officials at  different levels. For example, a VISN director stated that if a provider  gives a desired time frame, the scheduler is to use the earliest date in that  range as the desired date; whereas a provider in a specialty care clinic at  the VAMC we visited within that VISN stated that the clinic uses the latest  date in the range to meet the 14-day specialty care medical appointment  scheduling goal.", "Additionally, when presented with various scheduling scenarios,  schedulers at the VAMCs we visited determined and recorded the desired  date differently. For example, when posed with the question \u201cWhat date  do you enter into the scheduling system as the desired date for an  established patient follow-up medical appointment?\u201d, 12 schedulers said  they would enter the patient\u2019s desired date, 4 said the provider\u2019s date,  and the remaining 3 said they used the next available medical  appointment date. When posed with the question \u201cIf the patient\u2019s stated  desired date conflicts with the provider\u2019s designated desired date or time  frame, what date do you enter as the desired date?\u201d, 1 scheduler said  that the patient\u2019s desired date would be entered, while another said the  desired date has to come from the provider.

However, we found that at  least one scheduler from each of the VAMCs we visited did not correctly  implement these aspects of the policy when recording the desired date in  the VistA scheduling system for specific hypothetical scheduling  situations. As summarized in table 2, we identified the following three  types of errors, each of which would have resulted in desired dates that  did not accurately reflect the patients\u2019 or providers\u2019 desired date, as well  as potentially result in the reporting of more favorable wait times for those  medical appointments.", "Determined appointment availability prior to establishing desired date:  Although VHA\u2019s scheduling policy requires schedulers to establish the  desired date for a medical appointment without regard to the schedule  capacity, four schedulers from three VAMCs determined the clinic\u2019s  next available medical appointment dates before establishing a  desired date. Therefore, reported wait times for these appointments  may not have accurately reflected how long patients actually waited.", "Altered original desired date based on appointment availability: Three  schedulers from two VAMCs established a desired date that was  recorded in the VistA scheduling system independent of schedule  capacity, but later altered the desired date because of appointment  availability. Specifically, two of the three schedulers altered the  originally established desired date to match the agreed-upon  appointment date, which would have incorrectly resulted in no wait  time reported for the appointment. The third scheduler altered the  established desired date when there was no appointment availability  within 2 weeks of that date; which would have resulted in an  incorrectly reported wait time that was shorter than the patient actually  waited from his or her original desired date.", "Recorded a new desired date when rescheduling appointment:  Additionally, eight schedulers from three VAMCs incorrectly recorded  a new desired date when rescheduling an appointment cancelled by  the clinic rather than keeping the original desired date as required by  VHA\u2019s scheduling policy.

Clinic staff reported that providers  recorded medical appointments on sheets of paper and gave those  sheets to a scheduler, who maintained a paper calendar of all medical  appointments; this scheduler later recorded the appointment into the  VistA scheduling system. Failing to use VistA to schedule medical  appointments could create additional backlogs or scheduling errors  because the schedule in VistA may not accurately reflect providers\u2019  availability. According to one provider in this clinic, for example, \u201cstaff  from other departments look in VistA  and it looks like  the clinic is not booked, so they\u2019ll send their patients as walk-in  appointments. However, the clinic is really fully booked and patients are  waiting.\u201d", "Officials from six clinics across two different VAMCs reported that staff  scheduled new patient or established patient follow-up medical  appointments without speaking to patients, and then notified patients of  the scheduled medical appointment by letter, if the appointment was at  least a few weeks away. This method of scheduling\u2014referred to as  \u201cblind\u201d scheduling by one official \u2014is not in accordance with VHA\u2019s  scheduling policy and could result in missed medical appointments for  patients who do not receive the letters, or are not available at the  scheduled time because patients are not involved in the scheduling  process. One scheduler noted that he sent medical appointment letters  because he didn\u2019t have time to call all patients to schedule appointments  as he performs scheduling duties for 27 different clinics. Furthermore,  outdated or incorrect patient contact information is an impediment to  scheduling appointments via letters; an official in one of the six clinics told  us that the databases containing patient contact information used to send  such letters often do not have veterans\u2019 correct or up-to-date contact  information.", "Officials in four clinics across three VAMCs that had backlogs of patients  waiting for medical appointments stated that they do not use the  electronic wait list, the official VHA wait list used to track patients with  whom a clinic does not have an established relationship. Clinics that do  not use the electronic wait list may be at risk of losing track of new  patients waiting for medical appointments. For example, at one specialty  clinic with a backlog of consult requests, medical appointments for new  patients were backed up almost 3 months; VAMC officials reported  tracking patients waiting for medical appointments by printing paper  copies of the consult requests from the electronic medical record. A  provider at this clinic expressed concern that the clinic manager \u201chas a  tall stack of unscreened consult referrals just sitting on her desk, and no  one is addressing them.\u201d", "Officials from one VAMC stated that it did not have the required  recall/reminder software to facilitate reminders for patients who need to  return to the clinic for follow-up medical appointments more than 3 to   4 months into the future; therefore, none of its clinics, including the five  clinics that we visited, were able to use it as intended. Instead clinics at  this VAMC use a work-around in the scheduling system to remind clerks  to print and send letters reminding patients to call and schedule their  follow-up medical appointments. However, this work-around is not  automated and relies on schedulers to remember to generate a list of  patients who need follow-up medical appointments, and print and send  those letters. The VAMC is in the process of implementing recall/reminder  software, according to officials.", "One clinic in each of the four VAMCs visited did not keep their medical  appointment schedules open 3 to 4 months into the future as required by  VHA\u2019s scheduling policy. appointments to be booked only 1 to 2 months into the future. Limiting the  future medical appointment schedule may limit patients\u2019 ability to  schedule a follow-up medical appointment before leaving the clinic, as  recommended by the policy, and also may result in additional work for  clinic staff to send recall/reminder letters to patients for medical  appointments less than 3 to 4 months away.", "VHA\u2019s scheduling policy states that for clinics to most efficiently operate, \u201cschedules  must be open and available for the patient to make  appointments at least three  to four months into the future. Permissions may be given to schedulers to make  appointments beyond these limits when doing so is appropriate and consistent with patient  or provider requests. Blocking the scheduling of future  appointments by limiting  the maximum days into the future an appointment can be scheduled is inappropriate and  is disallowed.\u201d completion of the training by all staff who were required to complete it.Although all VAMCs we visited provided a list of staff who can schedule  appointments, three VAMCs did not provide documentation that all staff  on the list had successfully completed the required training. For example,  officials from one VAMC stated that it maintained a list of staff who can  schedule appointments, and a separate list of staff who had completed  the training, but only in response to GAO\u2019s request for documentation did  the VAMC identify staff with scheduling access who needed to complete  the training. Further, three of the 19 schedulers we interviewed said they  completed training other than the required VHA scheduler training.  Completion of required VHA scheduler training and maintaining up-to- date documentation of schedulers\u2019 completion of the training is  particularly important for ensuring consistent implementation of VHA\u2019s  scheduling policy, given the high rates of scheduler turnover described by  officials.", "All four of the VAMCs we visited completed the required self-certification  of compliance with the VHA\u2019s scheduling policy for fiscal year 2011, three  of which certified overall compliance, and one certified overall  noncompliance.including the only one of the four that certified overall noncompliance,  were initially uncertain who completed the certification or the steps taken  to complete it, indicating that VAMCs are not always using the self- certification process to identify and improve problems with compliance  with VHA\u2019s scheduling policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VAMCs Identified Other Problems with Scheduling Medical Appointments, Including Issues with Outdated Technology, Staffing Gaps, and Telephone Access", "paragraphs": ["VAMCs identified several problems that can impede the timely scheduling  of medical appointments, which also may impact their compliance with  VHA\u2019s scheduling policy.", "VHA central office officials and officials from all of the VAMCs we visited  said the VistA scheduling system is outdated and inefficient, which  hinders the timely scheduling of medical appointments. In particular,  officials said the scheduling system requires schedulers to use  commands requiring many keystrokes and does not allow them to view  multiple screens at once. Schedulers must open and close multiple  screens to check a provider\u2019s or clinic\u2019s full availability when scheduling a  medical appointment, which is time-consuming and can lead to errors.  For example, providers have separate schedules within VistA to  accommodate the various types of services they provide. Because the  scheduling system cannot display multiple schedules on the same  screen, schedulers have to enter and exit multiple screens to check a  provider\u2019s full daily schedule when scheduling a medical appointment. If  schedulers do not open all of the necessary screens, they may  unknowingly create scheduling errors such as booking two medical  appointments at the same time in different sections of a provider\u2019s  schedule. Further, staff at one VAMC told us the problem of not being  able to easily view a provider\u2019s full schedule can result in the failure to  ensure that appointments are cancelled when a provider requests it. This  error could cause patients to come to the VAMC unnecessarily or a failure  to reschedule cancelled appointments in a timely way, both of which  might lead to increased wait times for those patients.", "Officials from all the VAMCs we visited also noted that the VistA  scheduling system is not easily adapted to meet clinic needs. For  example, staff cannot create a provider schedule in the scheduling  system that is longer than 8 hours. If a provider wants to extend his or her  schedule on certain days, staff must create additional clinic schedules in  the scheduling system for that provider, which can result in more delays  and possible errors because schedulers have to check additional screens  for medical appointment availability. Furthermore, officials told us that the  scheduling system does not automatically interface with VHA\u2019s electronic  medical record, which makes the scheduling process more time- consuming as schedulers alternate between the two software applications  to ensure medical appointments are made in accordance with providers\u2019  guidance.", "VAMC officials described steps they take to ensure schedulers use VistA  in accordance with the scheduling directive, including ongoing scheduler  training and supervisory reviews of scheduler performance. However, as  noted above, a lack of clarity in the desired date training documents and a  lack of documentation of scheduler training at certain facilities may limit  the effectiveness of these interventions. One VAMC provides schedulers  with dual monitors to enable them to open multiple screens at once.  Another VAMC told us they considered this solution in their primary care  clinic, but found that limited physical space in the clinic did not  accommodate additional monitors.", "In response to ongoing problems with the VistA scheduling system, VHA  undertook an initiative to replace it in 2000, but VA abandoned the  replacement due to weaknesses in project management and a lack of  effective oversight. VA released a new request for information in  December 2011 to gather information about vendors and possible  software packages that could replace the current scheduling system. In  September 2012, VHA told us that vendors\u2019 responses to the request for  information indicated that VHA will be able to choose among several  viable software packages. According to officials, VA\u2019s next step is to  compare different vendors\u2019 software packages through the summer of  2013, and subsequently issue a request for vendor proposals.", "VHA central office officials and officials from all of the VAMCs we visited  stated that shortages or turnover of schedulers also creates problems for  the timely scheduling of medical appointments. Officials said that  schedulers perform many important roles, including greeting patients,  checking patients in and out of clinics, answering telephone calls,  scheduling medical appointments for primary care, as well as specialty  care consults, and performing other administrative support functions on  behalf of the clinical staff. Officials explained, however, that high stress  and a demanding workload as well as the entry-level pay grade of the  scheduler position leads to high turnover. Further, officials told us that  high-performing schedulers often are quickly promoted to other positions  within VA. According to VHA officials, most scheduler positions are  classified as a low grade within the government general schedule pay  scale with little room for upward movement within the grade. Officials at  two of the VAMCs we visited told us they are working to raise the pay  level for schedulers; for example, one VAMC has begun to assess  scheduler position descriptions to determine whether they can be  reclassified to allow for more flexibility in determining scheduler salaries  based on the variation in their assigned duties.", "Given the important role of schedulers in the scheduling process, officials  said that even temporary staffing gaps or shortages can cause medical  appointment delays or wait times. Staff with whom we spoke in several  clinics said that when scheduler staffing is lacking, including when a  scheduler is on short-term leave, it is difficult to cover all the scheduler\u2019s  duties, and that such gaps can cause delays for patients. Further, we  were told that scheduler staffing gaps resulted in inefficient use of clinical  staff time. For example, at one specialty clinic that lacked its own  scheduler, providers routinely scheduled their own medical appointments,  which took away from time seeing patients, and also resulted in incorrect  scheduling practices. Given the training needs associated with using the  VistA scheduling system, following VHA\u2019s scheduling policy, and ensuring  the correct use of desired date, high rates of scheduler turnover could  contribute to inconsistent use of desired date in the scheduling process or  other appointment scheduling problems.", "Officials at two VAMCs noted that scheduler staffing gaps are  compounded by recent changes in their roles and responsibilities as VHA  implements a new team-based model of primary care, which calls for one  scheduler to be assigned to each primary care team. Officials told us that  these changes generally increase the administrative demands placed on  schedulers, as they are asked to respond to team duties while continuing  to answer phones, greet patients, and register new patients, among other  responsibilities. Officials from two VAMCs told us they had requested  approval to hire additional staff to meet these added administrative  needs.", "Scheduler staffing gaps may also create problems managing patient flow  through clinics, which can impede scheduling of follow-up appointments,  according to officials at two of the VAMCs we visited. Staff at these  VAMCs told us that they sometimes do not have sufficient schedulers  available to staff check-out desks, and staff at one VAMC added that as a  result patients might \u201cfall through the cracks,\u201d leaving follow-up medical  appointments unscheduled unless the patient remembers to call in to  schedule the appointment. In addition, when patients do not check out,  schedulers are responsible for tracking patients needing follow-up  medical appointments. This situation may be exacerbated in clinics that  do not use the required recall/reminder software to facilitate the  scheduling of follow-up medical appointments more than 3 to 4 months in  the future, adding further to the backlog of patients in need of follow-up  medical appointments.", "Officials from all of the VAMCs we visited told us that provider shortages  also contribute to scheduling backlogs in certain locations and specialties.  Recruitment and retention of providers was a particular challenge for  VAMCs in rural areas, areas with high costs of living, and for certain  provider specialties. All of the VAMCs we visited described gaps in  provider staffing in certain specialty care clinics. Officials at all VAMCs  also stated that a lack of salary competitiveness or the length of time to  hire new providers into the VA system also contributed to gaps in provider  staffing and scheduling backlogs.", "Gaps in provider staffing also can result from providers being on  extended or unexpected leave, including vacation time, sick leave, or  military deployments. These absences may result in longer wait times for  patients. For example, officials at one VAMC told us that even a brief  absence of one provider on leave can cause significant wait times, and  that it is difficult to catch up and eliminate the backlog.", "Staff from some clinics described steps they take to reduce backlogs  caused by gaps in provider staffing, including overbooking provider  schedules and scheduling temporary Saturday hours. Officials at one  VAMC told us that they employ a \u201cfloater\u201d primary care physician to  provide coverage for providers on leave, but an official at another clinic  told us that they were unable to hire additional providers to meet the  demand for medical appointments.", "Officials at all of the VAMCs we visited told us that high call volumes and  a lack of staff dedicated to answering the telephones impede the timely  scheduling of medical appointments. Despite VHA\u2019s telephone policy  requiring the provision of continuous telephone service for clinical care  and medical appointment management, VAMC officials noted that  schedulers are frequently overwhelmed by high call volumes and are  unable to respond to calls in a timely way. In addition, officials at one  VAMC told us that outdated telephone technology, and the lack of a  dedicated VAMC-wide call center, limited their ability to improve their  telephone responsiveness. VHA has reported that telephone access to  VHA health services has historically been a frustrating experience for  veterans, including dropped calls, multiple transfers, and long waits to  reach a staff person able to resolve their inquiries. Further, patients at  all of the VAMCs we visited registered complaints about the difficulty of  reaching outpatient clinic staff by telephone and unreturned telephone  calls. According to information on patient complaints provided by the four  VAMCs we visited, patient complaints about unreturned telephone calls  ranked among the top two categories of complaints in fiscal year 2012 at  all four VAMCs. Further, staff at two of the VAMCs reported that their  telephone calls to outpatient clinics within their own VAMC went  unanswered, and one added that their inability to reach staff in their own  clinics also was an obstacle to timely medical appointment scheduling.", "In January 2012, VHA distributed suggested best practices for improving  telephone design, service, and access in its Telephone Systems  Improvement Guide. This guide outlines steps VHA found to be effective  means of improving telephone service and maintaining health care  access, including regularly monitoring the purpose and volume of  telephone calls; establishing dedicated staff to answering calls, especially  at times of peak call volume; and training staff responsible for answering  telephones in call centers. To address telephone issues, officials at one  VAMC we visited told us they were developing a proposal to establish a  call center with a new telephone system, to be staffed by schedulers  dedicated to answering the telephones. Officials at a different VAMC  stated that a scheduling supervisor periodically checks schedulers\u2019  telephones to ensure that voice mail messages are listened to and that  calls are returned."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VHA Is Implementing a Number of Initiatives to Improve Access to Medical Appointments", "paragraphs": ["VHA is implementing several initiatives to improve veterans\u2019 access to  medical appointments.

Implementation of PACT began in 2010, and is an ongoing effort,  according to VHA officials. PACT differs from how primary care was  previously delivered by assigning each patient to an interdisciplinary  team. The PACT team is intended to be comprised of a primary care  provider, registered nurse care manager, a clinical support staff member   These teams offer  such as a licensed practical nurse, and a scheduler.patients a centralized way to get questions answered by nurses or other  clinical support staff and aim to reduce the need for face-to-face medical  appointments, thereby enabling more efficient use of providers\u2019 time. For  example, at one of the VAMCs we visited, patients are given a direct  telephone number to contact their PACT team and leave a voice mail  message to be returned by the team\u2019s registered nurse. Encouraging  PACT teams\u2019 use of telephone communication and telephone  appointments is intended to enable patients to more quickly obtain  answers to some of their administrative and medical questions, such as  requests for prescription refills, without having to schedule a face-to-face  medical appointment. VHA officials told us that they expect PACT teams\u2019  use of telephone communication and telephone appointments will open  up face-to-face medical appointment slots for patients who need them  and might enable clinics to reduce backlogs and improve access to same- day primary care medical appointments.", "Officials at two VAMCs we visited told us that the transition to the PACT  model has created some initial scheduling and staffing difficulties. For  example, officials at these VAMCs noted that it is difficult for scheduling  staff to respond to their PACT team duties in addition to meeting other  responsibilities such as answering phones, checking in patients,  registering new patients, and scheduling for more than one clinic. This is  compounded by the fact that not all PACT teams have been assigned  their own scheduler, as prescribed by the PACT model, so an individual  scheduler is sometimes serving multiple PACT teams. Officials at these  two VAMCs explained that they would need to hire more schedulers to  meet the goal of assigning one to each PACT team.", "To measure the progress of PACT implementation and its impact on  access to quality care, VHA is collecting data and tracking a series of  measures in a monthly internal data report. Five of the PACT measures  are (1) primary care medical appointments completed within 7 days of the  desired date; (2) same day access with primary care provider, or the  percentage of appointments completed within 1 day; (3) telephone  utilization, or the percentage of total encounters that occur by telephone;  (4) continuity of care, or the percentage of primary care appointments  with the patient\u2019s assigned primary care provider; and (5) post-hospital  discharge contact, or percentage of patients discharged from the hospital  who were contacted by their primary care provider within 2 days.
