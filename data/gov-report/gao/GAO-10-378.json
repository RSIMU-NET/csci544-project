Much of this material is found in a key nuclear weapon component known as a pit. The Department of Energy (DOE) plans to dispose of at least 34 metric tons of plutonium by fabricating it into mixed oxide (MOX) fuel for domestic nuclear reactors. To do so, DOE's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) is constructing two facilities--a MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF) and a Waste Solidification Building (WSB)--at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. GAO was asked to assess the (1) cost and schedule status of the MFFF and WSB construction projects, (2) status of NNSA's plans for pit disassembly and conversion, (3) status of NNSA's plans to obtain customers for MOX fuel from the MFFF, and (4) actions that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and DOE have taken to provide independent nuclear safety oversight. GAO reviewed NNSA documents and project data, toured DOE facilities, and interviewed officials from DOE, NRC, and nuclear utilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The MFFF and WSB projects both appear to be meeting their cost targets for construction, but the MFFF project has experienced schedule delays. Specifically, the MFFF and WSB projects are on track to meet their respective construction cost estimates of $4.9 billion and $344 million. However, the MFFF project has experienced some delays over the past 2 years, due in part to the delivery of reinforcing bars that did not meet nuclear quality standards. Project officials said that they expect to recover from these delays by the end of 2010 and plan for the start of MFFF operations on schedule in 2016. The WSB project appears to be on schedule. NNSA is reconsidering its alternatives for establishing a pit disassembly and conversion capability. However, it seems unlikely that NNSA will be able to establish this capability in time to produce the plutonium feedstock needed to operate the MFFF, due to the amount of time and effort needed to reconsider alternatives and construct a facility as well as the amount of uncertainty associated with NNSA's current plans. NNSA had previously planned to build a stand-alone facility near the MFFF construction site to disassemble pits and convert the plutonium into a form suitable for use by the MFFF. However, NNSA is now considering a plan to combine this capability with another project at an existing facility at the Savannah River Site. NNSA officials could not estimate when the agency will reach a final decision or establish more definitive cost and schedule estimates for the project. However, NNSA's new alternative depends on an aggressive, potentially unrealistic schedule. In addition, NNSA has not sufficiently planned for the maturation of critical technologies to be used in pit disassembly and conversion operations, some of which are being tested at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. NNSA has one potential customer for most of its MOX fuel, but outreach to other utilities may be insufficient. NNSA is in discussions with the Tennessee Valley Authority to provide MOX fuel for five reactors. NNSA plans to offer several incentives to potential customers, including offering to sell MOX fuel at a discount relative to the price of uranium fuel. In interviews with the nation's nuclear utilities, GAO found that while many of the utilities expressed interest in NNSA's proposed incentives, the majority of utilities also expressed little interest in becoming MOX fuel customers. This suggests that NNSA's outreach to utilities may not be sufficient. NRC is currently reviewing the MFFF's license application and has identified several issues related to construction. However, oversight of the MFFF and the WSB by DOE's independent nuclear safety entities has been limited. For example, DOE's Office of Health, Safety, and Security has not conducted any oversight activities or participated in any project reviews of the WSB, despite the WSB's status as a high-hazard nuclear facility. In addition, NNSA's Chief of Defense Nuclear Safety has not conducted any nuclear safety oversight activities for the MFFF project and has not conducted all oversight activities for the WSB project that are required by DOE order."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The end of the Cold War left a legacy of fissile material that the United  States no longer required for national security. This fissile material  includes large quantities of weapons-grade plutonium, such as the  plutonium used in the pit of a nuclear warhead. Plutonium is a man-made,  radioactive element that poses a danger of nuclear weapons proliferation  and a risk of environmental, safety, and health consequences. For  example, internal exposure in humans to plutonium through inhalation or  consumption poses an extremely serious health hazard by exposing organs  and tissues to ionizing radiation and increasing the risk of cancer.", "In 1997, the Department of Energy (DOE) established a strategy to provide  for the disposition of surplus, weapons-grade plutonium. The National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency  within DOE, manages this program, now called the U.S. Plutonium  Disposition program. NNSA\u2019s goal is to dispose of at least 34 metric tons of  surplus, weapons-grade plutonium by (1) combining it with uranium to  produce mixed oxide (MOX) fuel and (2) selling the MOX fuel to domestic  utilities that own nuclear reactors. Once the MOX fuel is irradiated in a  nuclear reactor, it would be rendered useless to potential proliferators.  According to NNSA officials, the sale of MOX fuel over a 15-year period  could return over $1 billion to the U.S. Treasury. To achieve this goal,  NNSA is currently constructing the following two facilities at the  Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina:    MOX Fuel Fabrication Facility (MFFF)\u2014The MFFF is projected to use up  to 3.5 metric tons of plutonium a year to fabricate about 1,700 MOX fuel  assemblies over a 15-year period. NNSA began construction on the MFFF  in August 2007. As we reported in March 2007, NNSA initially estimated  that the MFFF would cost about $1.4 billion and be completed by  September 2004. NNSA currently projects that the MFFF will cost about  $4.9 billion, be ready for operations by October 2016, and begin producing  MOX fuel assemblies in 2018.", "A Waste Solidification Building (WSB) will process radioactive waste from  the MFFF and related facilities.

The National Defense Authorization Act of 1999 amended the  Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 to require the Nuclear Regulatory  Commission (NRC), an independent oversight agency, to regulate and  license the operation of the MFFF. DOE is responsible for regulating the  nuclear safety of the WSB and the planned Pit Disassembly and  Conversion Facility (PDCF), with NNSA taking the primary role. Several  other DOE offices and entities have provided independent nuclear safety  oversight for all three facilities, including the DOE Office of Health, Safety,  and Security (HSS); the NNSA Central Technical Authority; and the NNSA  Chief of Defense Nuclear Safety (CDNS).", "This report assesses (1) the performance status of the MFFF and WSB  construction projects with respect to cost and schedule, (2) the status of  NNSA\u2019s plans to establish a pit disassembly and conversion capability to  supply plutonium to the MFFF, (3) the status of NNSA\u2019s plans to obtain  customers for MOX fuel from the MFFF, and (4) the actions that NRC and  DOE have taken to provide independent nuclear safety oversight of the  MFFF and WSB construction projects.", "To assess the performance status of the MFFF and WSB construction  projects with respect to cost and schedule, we reviewed earned value  management (EVM) data and assessed the reliability of EVM data by  evaluating each project\u2019s schedule against GAO\u2019s scheduling best  practices. We also interviewed key NNSA and contractor officials and  reviewed data and key processes used to conduct a risk analysis of the  MFFF project\u2019s schedule. To assess the status of NNSA\u2019s plans to establish  a pit disassembly and conversion capability to supply plutonium to the  MFFF, we reviewed documentation provided by NNSA and its contractors  for the MFFF, WSB, and PDCF projects, including project execution plans,  project status reports, EVM data, and independent project reviews. We  also reviewed project plans and research and development data related to  the Advanced Recovery and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) project  at DOE\u2019s Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in New Mexico; toured  site facilities at SRS and LANL; and interviewed DOE, NNSA, and  contractor officials.

According to  DOE, its approach would require the construction of three facilities\u2014a pit  disassembly and conversion facility, a MOX fuel fabrication facility, and an  immobilization facility.", "In 2000, the United States and Russia entered into a Plutonium  Management and Disposition Agreement, in which each country pledged  to dispose of at least 34 metric tons of surplus, weapons-grade plutonium,  including the disposition of no less than 2 metric tons of plutonium per  year.", "In 2000, DOE announced in a record of decision that it would construct a  pit disassembly and conversion facility, a MOX fuel fabrication facility, and  an immobilization facility at SRS.", "In 2002, NNSA canceled the immobilization portion of its surplus  plutonium disposition strategy due to budgetary constraints. In addition,  according to NNSA officials, NNSA canceled the immobilization portion  because (1) Russia would not dispose of its plutonium if the United States  adopted an immobilization-only approach and (2) the technology for MOX  fuel fabrication had been in use in Europe for three decades, whereas  immobilization of weapons-grade plutonium in glass or ceramic had never  before been demonstrated.", "In 2003, NNSA announced that it was pursuing a MOX-only plutonium  disposition program to dispose of 34 metric tons of surplus, weapons- grade plutonium.", "The majority of the 34 metric tons of surplus, weapons-grade plutonium is  in the form of pits, clean metal, and oxides. The remainder is in nonpit  forms, such as contaminated metal, oxides, and residues from the nuclear  weapons production process. While NNSA plans to build a pit disassembly  and conversion facility to obtain plutonium from pits, it also plans to use  the ARIES project\u2014a technology development and demonstration project  for pit disassembly and conversion located at LANL\u2014to obtain a small  amount of plutonium from pits. In addition, according to NNSA  documents, NNSA plans to obtain plutonium from nonpit forms in two  ways. First, the K-Area Facility at SRS is storing 4.1 metric tons of  plutonium in nonpit form that is already suitable for use by the MFFF.  Second, NNSA plans to prepare and process additional quantities of  plutonium (3.7 metric tons) already at the K-Area Facility or planned for  storage at the facility.", "Prior work by GAO has identified persistent problems with cost overruns  and schedule delays on the PDCF project. For example, in our March 2007  report on major DOE construction projects, we found that ineffective DOE  project oversight, poor contractor management, and external factors were  among the primary reasons for the cost increases and schedule delays  associated with the PDCF project. In addition, according to a May 2005  DOE Inspector General report, NNSA officials attributed schedule delays  for the PDCF to the disagreement between the United States and Russia  about liability for work performed by U.S. contractor personnel working in  Russia and a change in funding priorities.", "NNSA project directors are responsible for managing the MFFF, WSB, and  PDCF projects and overseeing the contractors that design and construct  these facilities. In doing so, project directors follow specific DOE  directives, policies, and guidance for project management. Among these is  DOE Order 413.3A, which establishes protocols for planning and executing  a project. The protocols require DOE projects to go through a series of five  critical decisions as they enter each new phase of work. These decisions  are as follows:    Critical decision 0, which approves a mission-related need.", "Critical decision 1, which approves the selection of a preferred solution to  meet a mission need and a preliminary estimate of project costs\u2014an  approval that is based on a review of a project\u2019s conceptual design.", "Critical decision 2, which approves that a project\u2019s cost and schedule  estimates are accurate and complete\u2014an approval that is based on a  review of the project\u2019s completed preliminary design.", "Critical decision 3, which reaches agreement that a project\u2019s final design is  sufficiently complete and that resources can be committed toward  procurement and construction.", "Critical decision 4, which approves that a project has met its performance  criteria for completion or that the facility is ready to start operations.", "To oversee projects and approve these critical decisions, DOE conducts its  own reviews, often with the help of independent technical experts. For  example, for large projects (with a total project cost of greater than $100  million), DOE\u2019s Office of Engineering and Construction Management  (OECM) validates the accuracy and completeness of the project\u2019s  performance baseline as part of the critical decision 2 process.", "DOE Order 413.3A also requires projects to use EVM to measure and  report the progress of construction projects (with a total project cost of  greater than or equal to $20 million). EVM measures the value of work  accomplished in a given period and compares it with the planned value of  work scheduled for that period and with the actual cost of work  accomplished. Differences in these values are measured in both cost and  schedule variances. EVM provides information that is necessary for  understanding the health of a program and provides an objective view of  program status. As a result, EVM can alert program managers to potential  problems sooner than expenditures alone can, thereby reducing the  chance and magnitude of cost overruns and schedule delays.", "The following DOE offices and entities provide independent nuclear safety  oversight:    HSS is responsible for policy development, independent oversight,  enforcement, and assistance in the areas of health, safety, the  environment, and security across DOE.

EVM provides a proven means for measuring  such progress and thereby identifying potential cost overruns and  schedule delays early, when their impact can be minimized. Differences  from the performance baseline are measured in both cost and schedule  variances. Positive variances indicate that activities are costing less or  are completed ahead of schedule. Negative variances indicate that  activities are costing more or are falling behind schedule. These cost and  schedule variances can then be used in estimating the cost and time  needed to complete the project.", "Figure 1 presents information on both cumulative cost and schedule  variances for the MFFF project over the 2-year period ending November  2009. With respect to cost, the MFFF project has experienced fluctuating  variances during this period. Overall, these cost variances are relatively  small compared with the project\u2019s average monthly expenditures of over  $20 million. In addition, it is normal for variances to fluctuate during the  course of a project.", "However, with respect to the project\u2019s schedule, the MFFF project has  experienced consistently negative variances for most of the past 2 years.  Specifically, as shown in figure 1, these schedule variances were  consistently negative for most of 2008, and, for much of 2009, the project  had not completed almost $40 million in scheduled work. According to the  data and project officials, delays during 2008 were due primarily to the  delivery of reinforcing bars that did not meet nuclear quality standards.  Specifically, in February 2008, NRC inspectors identified numerous pieces  of reinforcing bars\u2014steel rods that are used in reinforced concrete\u2014that  did not meet industry standards for nuclear facilities. At that point,  NNSA\u2019s contractor, Shaw AREVA MOX Services, LLC (MOX Services), had  accepted delivery of about 10,000 tons of reinforcing bars on-site and had  installed almost 4,000 tons. Although NRC and MOX Services officials  determined that the error did not affect the safety of reinforcing bars  already installed, this issue had a major effect on the overall schedule for  pouring concrete and installing reinforcing bars in the structure during  2008. According to project officials, the project switched to a different  supplier of reinforcing bars in September 2008 and by April 2009 had a  sufficient supply of material to support the construction schedule.", "Schedule delays in 2009 occurred primarily because project officials  decided that they had not allocated sufficient time in the existing schedule  to ensure the delivery of materials that would meet the stringent safety  and design standards for nuclear facilities. For example, according to  project officials, the project extended the amount of time needed to  produce concrete for the MFFF to provide additional assurance that the  concrete will meet nuclear quality standards. The rate of concrete  production will be gradually increased beginning in early 2010, according  to project officials. In addition, the project extended the amount of time  needed to fabricate and deliver slab tanks, which are used to hold liquid  fissile material, to provide additional assurance that these tanks meet  stringent safety and design standards.", "In recent months, the MFFF project has improved its schedule  performance, so that it faced roughly $25 million in uncompleted work by  November 2009, compared with almost $40 million in uncompleted work  earlier in the year. According to project officials, this amount of negative  schedule variance is equivalent to about 2 to 3 week\u2019s worth of work on  the project, and they expect to recover from this variance during 2010. In  comparison, these officials stated that the project\u2019s schedule includes 16  month\u2019s worth of contingency to mitigate any risks from additional delays  before the expected start of MFFF operations.", "Figure 2 presents information on both cumulative cost and schedule  variances for the WSB project over a 11-month period ending in November  2009. With respect to cost, the WSB project has experienced consistently  positive cost variances. However, schedule variances have been  consistently negative over the same period. By November 2009, the project  had not completed over $4 million worth of scheduled work, compared  with average monthly expenditures of roughly $2 million during fiscal year  2009. According to the NNSA federal project director, the schedule  variances are due to a variety of factors, including delays in the  procurement of cementation equipment and in the installation of piping  due to inclement weather. However, the official said that he expects the  project to recover from these delays, and that none of these factors will  affect the overall construction schedule for the project.", "The reliability of a project\u2019s EVM system depends in large part on the  reliability of its underlying schedule. A reliable schedule specifies when  the project\u2019s work activities will occur, how long they will take, and how  they relate to one another. We have previously identified nine key  practices necessary for developing a reliable schedule. In a March 2009  testimony before this subcommittee, we identified several instances in  which the MFFF project\u2019s schedule did not adhere to these practices. In  particular, we found that MFFF project staff had not conducted a risk  analysis on their current schedule.", "However, since our March 2009 testimony, MFFF project officials have  taken a number of steps to address our concerns. For example, project  officials conducted a risk analysis of the MFFF project schedule in the  summer of 2009 and used the results to update their risk management  plan. In addition, project officials stated that they have significantly  reduced the number of scheduled activities with long durations\u2014that is,  activities with start-to-finish durations of over 200 days. On the basis of  these actions, we reevaluated the MFFF project\u2019s schedule against the  nine key scheduling practices. We also evaluated the WSB project\u2019s  schedule against these same practices. We found that both projects met  most of the key practices to a satisfactory degree. For example, one key  practice is to plan the schedule so that it can meet critical project dates.  To do so, project officials must logically sequence all planned activities in  the order that they are to be carried out. In particular, project officials  must identify both predecessor activities\u2014which must finish prior to the  start of another activity\u2014as well as successor activities\u2014which cannot  begin until other activities are completed. We found that the MFFF project  had logically sequenced all scheduled activities, while the WSB project had  logically sequenced the vast majority of its scheduled activities.

In 2000, DOE decided to construct and operate a PDCF at  SRS. Through 2009, NNSA\u2019s strategy has been to design and construct the  PDCF as a new, stand-alone facility on a site adjacent to the current  construction site of the MFFF. While NNSA has never established a  definitive cost and schedule estimate for the PDCF project, a 2009 NNSA  report estimated that the PDCF would cost $3.65 billion to construct and  be operational by April 2021.", "However, DOE recently proposed a new alternative for establishing a pit  disassembly and conversion capability at SRS. In September 2008, DOE  authorized a study to review alternatives to the siting location of the PDCF  capability within existing facilities at SRS and, as a result, to potentially  improve its approach to disposition of surplus plutonium at SRS.  Specifically, the study looked at the feasibility of combining the  capabilities of the PDCF project with the Plutonium Preparation project,  another project at SRS being managed by DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental  Management. The purpose of the Plutonium Preparation project, as  approved by DOE in June 2008, was to prepare for disposition of up to 13  metric tons of surplus, nonpit, plutonium-bearing materials that are either  at the SRS K-Area Facility or planned for storage at the facility. According  to DOE\u2019s plans, the project would be installed in the K-Area Facility and  would prepare the plutonium-bearing materials for disposition via two  pathways: (1) converting some of the materials into plutonium oxide  feedstock for the MFFF and (2) immobilizing the rest of the materials with  high-level waste in glass using the Defense Waste Processing Facility at  SRS. According to DOE\u2019s 2008 preliminary estimate, this project would be  operational in the 2013-2014 time frame at a cost of $340 million to $540  million.", "In November 2008, DOE issued a report stating that it would be feasible  to combine the two projects at the K-Area Facility.

The first phase would include the  design and installation of equipment in one area of the K-Area Facility to  provide the capability (formerly associated with the Plutonium  Preparation project) to process 3.7 metric tons of surplus, nonpit  plutonium, which would be used as an early source of plutonium oxide  feedstock to the MFFF. The second phase would include the modification  of a different area within the facility and the design and installation of  equipment to provide the pit disassembly and conversion capability. In  December 2008, NNSA suspended many of the activities associated with  the PDCF project while it performed additional analyses, and DOE  suspended activities associated with the Plutonium Preparation project.  Finally, in November 2009, DOE approved the \u201cpursuing\u201d of the combined  project approach, noting several potential benefits, such as greater funding  flexibility, greater flexibility regarding DOE\u2019s secure transportation  system, the avoidance of expenditures associated with constructing a new  facility, and the avoidance of costs associated with decontaminating and  decommissioning two Category 1 nuclear facilities, among others.", "However, it appears unlikely that NNSA will be able to establish a pit  disassembly and conversion capability in time to produce the plutonium  feedstock needed to operate the MFFF beginning in 2021, due to the  amount of time and effort needed to reconsider alternatives and construct  a facility as well as the amount of uncertainty associated with the agency\u2019s  new proposal.

Specifically, officials told us that prior to making  any decision, NNSA must first select its preferred alternative as part of the  DOE critical decision 1 process. To prepare for critical decision 1, NNSA  will need to develop and manage numerous details, including (1) the  appropriate review and documentation pursuant to the National  Environmental Policy Act; (2) a transfer by the Secretary of Energy from  the Office of Environmental Management to NNSA of the necessary  materials, functions, and facilities to carry out the preferred alternative;  and (3) issues related to federal and contractor program management,  contract management, project management, and budget/financial  management. As a result, NNSA officials said that they are still developing  plans and schedules for the combination project and cannot provide any  specific project schedule dates at this time. In addition, they stated that  once NNSA makes a final decision on its strategy for pit disassembly and  conversion as part of the critical decision 1 process, it will take several  additional years to develop definitive cost and schedule estimates for its  final approach as part of the critical decision 2 process.", "Second, a number of issues with NNSA\u2019s new proposal raise doubts  regarding whether the agency will be able to construct a facility in time to  provide the plutonium feedstock necessary to operate the MFFF.

Phase 1 of the  project is scheduled to be operational by 2014 to provide an early source  of feedstock (from nonpit plutonium sources) to the MFFF, and phase 2  must be operational by 2021 to provide the bulk of the plutonium oxide  feedstock that the MFFF will require to meet its planned production  schedule.", "According to NNSA documents, the existing schedule for the K-Area  Facility combined project is at an early stage of development and lacks  any quantified schedule contingency.", "The project will require construction within an existing, secure, operating  facility.

The ARIES project includes (1)  laboratory facility preparation activities, (2) the acquisition of  gloveboxes, (3) the design and assembly of a control system to operate  the demonstration modules, (4) the preparation of all system  documentation requirements, (5) the demonstration of the disassembly  and conversion of all types of surplus nuclear weapon pits, (6) material  control and accountability, and (7) measurements of personnel radiation  exposure from all surplus pit types. LANL conducts activities associated  with the ARIES project at its Plutonium Facility 4 building, which was  constructed in 1978 as a multiuse plutonium research and development  facility. NNSA\u2019s current production mission for the ARIES project is to  produce about 2 metric tons of plutonium oxide feedstock. Specifically,  LANL is to produce 50 kilograms of plutonium oxide by the end of fiscal  year 2010, ramp up to a target rate of 300 kilograms per year in fiscal year  2012, and sustain this rate through fiscal year 2017. However, this  material\u2014along with additional quantities of plutonium in nonpit form  currently stored at the K-Area Facility\u2014will only be enough for the first 5  years of the MFFF production schedule.", "NNSA has examined the possibility of expanding the ARIES project at  LANL to provide additional plutonium oxide feedstock to the MFFF.  Specifically, in May 2008, NNSA published a report that estimated NNSA  might need as much as 12 metric tons of plutonium oxide feedstock to  bridge a time gap between the startup of operations at the MFFF and the  PDCF. The report\u2019s authors evaluated several potential scenarios for  increasing the amount of equipment and the number of work shifts at  LANL and estimated that ARIES could produce up to 16.7 metric tons of  plutonium oxide at a cost of over $700 million. In conducting its analysis,  the report\u2019s authors made a number of assumptions, including that space  would be available within the Plutonium Facility 4 building to  accommodate an expanded ARIES mission, and that LANL would be able  to provide the necessary vault space to accommodate an expanded ARIES  mission. However, recent GAO work raises questions about the validity of  these assumptions. Specifically, in May 2008, we assessed NNSA\u2019s plans  to expand pit manufacturing operations within the Plutonium Facility 4  building. We found that NNSA would not be able to substantially increase  its pit manufacturing capacity in the building for the foreseeable future  because of several major constraints, including (1) limited vault space in  the Plutonium Facility 4 building for storing pits and associated wastes  and (2) competition for available floor space in the building due to the  presence of other NNSA and DOE programs. For example, we found that  vault space was one of the major limiting factors for pit production in  fiscal year 2007, and that the vault was operating at 120 percent of its  originally designed capacity.", "In a more recent study, NNSA concluded that LANL would not be a viable  option to perform the entire pit disassembly and conversion mission.  Specifically, in a November 2009 report, NNSA stated that the ARIES  project would be unable to sustain the annual output of plutonium oxide  feedstock necessary to support MFFF operations for a number of reasons.  For example, the report stated that because the Plutonium Facility 4  building is a one-of-a-kind, mission-critical facility for national defense,  national defense missions in the facility will continue to take precedence  over other programs\u2014including the pit disassembly and conversion  mission\u2014for the foreseeable future. In addition, the report pointed out  several of the same constraints to expanding operations in the Plutonium  Facility 4 building that we described in our prior report on pit  manufacturing.", "NNSA\u2019s November 2009 report also concluded that LANL continues to be a  viable option to produce some additional plutonium oxide material to fill a  potential gap if the PDCF project is delayed further. However, the report  did not update the prior 2008 report to determine what additional amount  of material it would be feasible for the ARIES project to produce. The  report also did not provide estimates for how much an expanded ARIES  mission would cost or when LANL would be able to produce additional  plutonium oxide material. Instead, the report noted that NNSA would need  to prepare and validate a detailed, resource-loaded, integrated schedule  for an expanded ARIES mission. As a result, it remains uncertain whether  ARIES could fill a potential gap if NNSA\u2019s main pit disassembly and  conversion operations are delayed.", "In March 2010, DOE stated that NNSA does not plan on expanding the  current mission of the ARIES project until LANL demonstrates that it can  sustain a production rate of 300 kilograms of plutonium oxide a year over  an extended period of time. In addition, DOE stated that NNSA is  evaluating other options to provide plutonium oxide feedstock to the  MFFF prior to the start of pit disassembly and conversion operations.  These options included (1) the use of 1.4 metric tons of fuel-grade  plutonium\u2014material originally not intended for use by the MFFF\u2014already  in storage at the K-Area Facility and (2) starting up \u201climited but sufficient\u201d  pit disassembly processes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NNSA Has Not Sufficiently Planned for the Maturation of Critical Technologies", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s current strategy relies on a number of technologies that are  critical to establishing a pit disassembly and conversion capability.

Proceeding through these critical decision  points without a credible and complete technology readiness assessment  can lead to problems later in the project. Specifically, if DOE proceeds  with a project when technologies are not yet ready, there is less certainty  that the technologies specified in the preliminary or final designs will work  as intended. Project managers may then need to modify or replace these  technologies to make them work properly, which can result in costly and  time-consuming redesign work.", "DOE has endorsed the use of the technology readiness level (TRL) process  for measuring and communicating technology readiness in cases where  technology elements or their applications are new or novel. In March 2008,  DOE\u2019s Office of Environmental Management published guidance on  conducting technology readiness assessments and developing technology  maturation plans. According to the guidance, staff should conduct  technology readiness assessments using the TRL framework. Specifically,  staff are to use a nine-point scale to measure TRLs. This scale ranges from  a low of TRL 1 (basic principles observed) to a midlevel of TRL 6  (system/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in relevant  environment) to a high of TRL 9 (total system used successfully in project  operations). According to the guidance, for any critical technologies that  did not receive a TRL of 6 or higher during such an assessment, staff  should develop a technology maturation plan, which is supposed to  describe planned technology development and engineering activities  required to bring immature technologies up to the desired TRL of 6 or  higher. This plan should include preliminary schedule and cost estimates  to allow decision makers to determine the future course of technology  development. In addition, the guidance stated that once a project reached  the critical decision 2 stage, all critical technologies should have reached a  TRL of 6.", "NNSA has undertaken a number of assessments of technological maturity  and readiness for pit disassembly and conversion over the past decade as  part of the ARIES project. For example, the PDCF project team carried out  an evaluation of the maturity of ARIES equipment in 2003. According to  project officials, the TRL framework was first used to assess the maturity  of pit disassembly and conversion technologies in November 2008, in  accordance with the Office of Environmental Management\u2019s 2008  guidance. In addition, as part of an independent review of the PDCF  project, NNSA issued a report in January 2009 that included a technology  readiness assessment of the ARIES equipment and other critical  technologies.

According to NNSA officials, LANL had  developed such a plan. However, we found that LANL\u2019s plan lacked  several key attributes of a technology maturation plan as described by  DOE\u2019s guidance. Specifically, we found the following problems with  LANL\u2019s plan:    A technology maturation plan is supposed to be developed to bring all  immature critical technologies up to an appropriate TRL. However, LANL\u2019s  plan only addressed the technologies under development at LANL as part  of the ARIES project. The plan did not address technologies, such as the  oxide product handling equipment, being tested by the four other  organizations.", "For each technology assessed at less than TRL 6, a technology maturation  plan should include preliminary schedule and cost estimates to allow  decision makers to determine the future course of technology  development. However, LANL\u2019s plan did not include preliminary estimates  of cost and schedule.", "LANL\u2019s plan is dated November 2007. However, NNSA has conducted or  sponsored two technology readiness assessments of the PDCF critical  technologies since that date. As a result, LANL\u2019s plan is out of date and  does not take into account the current state of maturity of its critical  technologies.", "NNSA officials told us that while they recognize some of the problems  with the project\u2019s existing technology maturation plan, they have already  prepared budget and schedule estimates for technology development  activities in a number of separate documents (including the overall PDCF  project schedule).

The MFFF\u2019s production  rate is then to increase over the next 5 years up to a maximum rate of 151  fuel assemblies per year (see fig. 3). The MFFF is expected to produce  1,700 fuel assemblies during its production run. In addition, according to  NNSA\u2019s plans, these fuel assemblies will be designed for use in pressurized  water nuclear reactors, which are the most common type of nuclear  reactor in use in the United States.", "In June 2000, Duke Power (now Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, or Duke), a  power utility that operates seven pressurized water reactors in North  Carolina and South Carolina, signed a subcontract with NNSA\u2019s contractor  for the MFFF project, MOX Services. According to NNSA officials, this  subcontract gave the utility the option to purchase up to three-fourths of  the MOX fuel produced by the MFFF at a discount relative to the price of  normal reactor fuel, which uses low enriched uranium. According to the  officials, the subcontract also obligated MOX Services to compensate  Duke if the MOX fuel was not delivered by December 2007. However, as  project delays continued to push back the start of construction, Duke,  MOX Services, and NNSA began discussions in 2005 to renegotiate the  subcontract. After nearly 3 years of discussions, Duke and MOX Services  were unable to reach agreement by the negotiation deadline, and the  subcontract automatically terminated on December 1, 2008.", "As negotiations with Duke came to an end, MOX Services, at NNSA\u2019s  direction, issued a request to nuclear utilities in October 2008 to express  their interest in the MOX fuel program. The request outlined a number of  possible incentives to mitigate the risks to utilities in using MOX fuel\u2014 risks that include the need to modify reactors and obtain an operating  license amendment from NRC to use MOX fuel. For example, the request  discussed the possibility of (1) selling MOX fuel at a discount relative to  the price of uranium fuel and (2) paying for costs associated with  modifying a reactor and obtaining an operating license amendment from  NRC. Furthermore, in January 2009, DOE reserved 12.1 metric tons of  highly enriched uranium from its stockpile and hired a contractor to  downblend this amount into 155 to 170 metric tons of low enriched  uranium to serve as a backup supply of fuel if MOX fuel deliveries to  customers are delayed. As of December 2009, NNSA and MOX Services  were still working on an agreement on liability if fuel is not delivered on  time.", "According to NNSA officials, three utilities have responded to MOX  Services\u2019 request and have expressed interest in the MOX fuel program.  Notably, in February 2010, NNSA and TVA executed an interagency  agreement to fund TVA studies on the use of MOX fuel in five of TVA\u2019s  reactors. Under the agreement, TVA will perform work on core design,  licensing, modifications, and other related activities to evaluate the use of  MOX fuel in its reactors. According to an NNSA official, using MOX fuel in  five of TVA\u2019s reactors could account for up to 85 percent of the MFFF\u2019s  output. The official also stated that an agreement with TVA to become a  customer could be signed by the fall of 2010. TVA officials stated that they  believed that familiarity gained by working with DOE during the Blended  Low Enriched Uranium would help them work with DOE during the MOX  program and cited this factor in their decision to begin discussions about  becoming a customer for MOX fuel. Aside from TVA, NNSA officials  characterized their contact with two other utilities as in the preliminary  stages, and they could not estimate when or if they would secure them as  customers for MOX fuel.", "Because utilities typically contract with fuel suppliers at least 5 years in  advance, NNSA and MOX Services will need to secure customers several  years before they deliver MOX fuel to them. NNSA officials said that their  goal is to obtain at least one customer by the end of fiscal year 2010, in  part because the 5-year period during which the MFFF will increase its  production capacity will allow them additional time to secure more  customers. Furthermore, if TVA agrees to be a customer and uses MOX  fuel in five of its reactors, these officials said that NNSA may only need  one additional utility to account for the remainder of the MFFF\u2019s planned  production of MOX fuel assemblies.", "However, NNSA faces two main obstacles in obtaining TVA as its primary  customer. First, some of TVA\u2019s reactors that would be candidates for using  MOX fuel may not be permitted to use the fuel due to their status as  backup reactors in DOE\u2019s tritium production program. According to NNSA  officials, the 2000 U.S.-Russian plutonium disposition agreement could be  interpreted as precluding reactors involved in weapons production from  being used to dispose of MOX fuel. TVA officials told us that they are  working with DOE to transfer tritium production responsibilities to  another TVA reactor that is not presently a candidate for the MOX  program. Second, although NNSA currently plans to produce MOX fuel  assemblies for use in pressurized water reactors, three of TVA\u2019s reactors  that are candidates for burning MOX fuel are boiling water reactors.  NNSA officials told us that they are studying how the MFFF can be  reconfigured to produce fuel assemblies for boiling water reactors. In  particular, they stated that the MFFF\u2019s design is based on a French MOX  Facility, which can switch production between fuel assemblies for  pressurized water reactors and for boiling water reactors in about 10 to 20  days. However, the officials also stated that they might need to conduct  additional tests on using MOX fuel assemblies in boiling water reactors  before producing the fuel assemblies in large quantities, and that it was  unclear whether such tests would delay the MOX production schedule.", "In March 2010, DOE stated that NNSA is evaluating several options for  providing alternative sources of plutonium oxide material to the MFFF  prior to the start of pit disassembly and conversion operations.

Finally, HSS has other oversight and advisory  responsibilities related to nuclear safety during critical decision reviews  for major DOE facilities. These responsibilities are spelled out in DOE\u2019s  Order 413.3A, which provides direction on program and project  management for the acquisition of capital assets, and include the following  actions:    participating on the Energy Systems Acquisition Advisory Board\u2014a body  comprising senior DOE officials who advise DOE\u2019s Secretarial Acquisition  Executive in critical decisions regarding major projects and facilities;    advising the DOE Secretarial Acquisition Executive on environmental,  safety, and security matters related to all critical decision approvals;   serving on independent project reviews as a team member at the request  of the Secretarial Acquisition Executive or program officials; and   participating on external independent reviews as an observer at OECM\u2019s  request.", "Regarding the MFFF project, HSS has provided limited oversight.  According to HSS officials, a more limited amount of oversight is  appropriate for the MFFF because of the National Defense Authorization  Act of 1999, which gave NRC responsibility for regulating nuclear safety at  the MFFF. HSS has conducted some inspection activities at the MFFF,  including reviewing reinforced concrete and structural steel at the facility  during site visits to SRS in August and September, 2009. However, HSS  officials said that these activities did not include a review of documents  supporting the MFFF\u2019s safety basis. In addition, while HSS officials stated  that personnel from HSS\u2019s predecessor office participated in the critical  decisions 2 and 3 reviews for the MFFF project during 2006, HSS was  unable to provide any documentation to substantiate this statement.  According to department officials, HSS had limited resources for  conducting reviews and needed to focus its resources on facilities that  were not subject to external regulation.", "Regarding nuclear safety oversight of the WSB project, which is solely  regulated by DOE, we found that HSS had not conducted any oversight  activities or participated in any critical decision reviews. Specifically, HSS  officials told us that they have not reviewed any documents supporting the  WSB\u2019s safety basis, nor have they conducted any inspection activities at  the WSB construction site. Despite the issuance of HSS\u2019s new appraisal  process guide, which contains inspection protocols for new and  unfinished high-hazard nuclear facilities, an HSS official told us that the  office has yet to determine when they will inspect the WSB. An HSS  official told us that he was uncertain whether a WSB inspection would  occur in 2010 because an ongoing internal DOE review has delayed the  development of the office\u2019s 2010 inspection schedule. However, if HSS\u2019s  initial visit occurs later than 2010, NNSA will have already completed at  least half of the WSB\u2019s construction, according to the project\u2019s schedule.", "Additionally, HSS did not participate in any of the critical decision reviews  for the WSB project because of existing DOE guidelines. Specifically,  although the WSB is considered a category 2 (high-hazard) nuclear facility,  it is categorized as a nonmajor project.

The office\u2019s  current policy is to review a project\u2019s safety documentation early in the  design process and determine whether it conforms to DOE\u2019s relevant  safety standard for integrating safety into design and incorporating  defense-in-depth. The WSB project had completed its design work before  DOE issued its current standard, and before the CDNS implemented a  systematic approach to fulfilling its functions. Consequently, the CDNS did  not perform a systematic review of WSB safety documentation. The CDNS  head characterized the WSB review as being an ad hoc, qualitative  assessment of some of the project\u2019s safety documentation. Additionally,  the CDNS has not evaluated the qualifications of the nuclear safety expert  that replaced the one evaluated as part of the critical decision 3 review.  However, according to the head of the CDNS, his office only plans to  evaluate the qualifications of new staff during technical reviews of the  project, not after every change to the project team\u2019s composition.", "The head of the CDNS told us that his office has begun developing a more  systematic approach to evaluating the design safety of DOE facilities. In  addition, he stated that he would like to conduct additional safety reviews  of facilities currently in design and construction. However, he said that  these efforts have been hampered, in part due to staffing shortages. For  example, the CDNS had a staff of 13 people in 2007. As of December 2009,  however, only 4 people remained on the CDNS staff due to attrition and  NNSA\u2019s decision to transfer some of the personnel into other program  offices. The head of the CDNS stated that current staffing levels have led  the CDNS to focus its attention on projects that are still in the design  phase. He said that it was doubtful that the CDNS would return to the WSB  to ensure that safety basis controls are fully integrated during its  construction. Concerns over CDNS staffing issues also were raised by the  Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board.

However, NNSA has not established a  definitive strategy for pit disassembly operations, nor does it expect to do  so in the near future. As a result, it appears unrealistic that NNSA will be  able to meet its current production schedule for MOX fuel without  obtaining additional sources of plutonium oxide. NNSA has stated that  while it does not plan on expanding the current mission of the ARIES  project until LANL demonstrates a sustained production rate over an  extended period of time, it is evaluating other options to address this  potential shortfall of plutonium oxide. These options include (1) the use of  1.4 metric tons of fuel-grade plutonium already in storage at the K-Area  Facility, (2) starting up \u201climited but sufficient\u201d pit disassembly processes,  and (3) adjusting the \u201cquantity and timing\u201d in delivering MOX fuel to  potential customers.

Conversely, the CDNS  has played no role in the MFFF project and has provided some elements of  nuclear safety oversight for the WSB project. However, it has not fully met  the responsibilities laid out for it by DOE order, in part due to a lack of a  formal, standardized approach for reviewing project safety documents.

We assessed the adequacy of the MFFF project\u2019s use  of EVM reporting by using a set of analysis tasks developed by GAO. In  addition, we assessed the reliability of the EVM data by evaluating each  project\u2019s schedule against GAO\u2019s scheduling best practices. We have  previously identified nine key practices necessary for developing a reliable  schedule. These practices are (1) capturing all activities, (2) sequencing  activities, (3) establishing the duration of activities, (4) assigning  resources to activities, (5) integrating activities horizontally and vertically,  (6) establishing the critical path for activities, (7) identifying the float time  between activities, (8) performing a schedule risk analysis, and (9)  monitoring and updating the schedule.

In particular, durations of longer than  200 days should be minimized.", "Mostly  Ninety-eight of the 2,066 activities  that are currently in progress or have  not yet started have durations of 100  days or more. While durations should  be as short as possible and have  specific start and end dates to  objectively measure progress,  project officials provided a valid  rationale for the duration of these  activities.", "The schedule should reflect what resources (e.g., labor,  material, and overhead) are needed to do the work, whether  all required resources will be available when needed, and  whether any funding or time constraints exist.", "The schedule reflects $336 million in  resource costs. The project\u2019s cost  baseline is $344 million. According to  project officials, they are aware of  this discrepancy. They stated that  while all of the project resources are  reflected in the schedule, a software  problem has caused some of these  resources to not show up. Project  officials are working to correct this  software problem.", "The schedule should be horizontally integrated, meaning that  it should link the products and outcomes associated with  other sequenced activities. These links are commonly  referred to as \u201chandoffs\u201d and serve to verify that activities are  arranged in the right order to achieve aggregated products or  outcomes. The schedule should also be vertically integrated,  meaning that traceability exists among varying levels of  activities and supporting tasks and subtasks. Such mapping  or alignment among levels enables different groups to work  to the same master schedule.", "Project officials provided evidence  that the schedule is sufficiently  integrated.", "Using scheduling software, the critical path\u2014the longest  duration path through the sequenced list of key activities\u2014 should be identified. The establishment of a program\u2019s critical  path is necessary for examining the effects of any activity  slipping along this path. Potential problems that might occur  along or near the critical path should also be identified and  reflected in the scheduling of the time for high-risk activities.", "A critical path has been established.  The critical path dates are driven by  the logic of the schedule.", "The schedule should identify float time\u2014the time that a  predecessor activity can slip before the delay affects  successor activities\u2014so that schedule flexibility can be  determined. As a general rule, activities along the critical  path typically have the least amount of float time. Total float  time is the amount of time flexibility an activity has that will  not delay the project\u2019s completion (if everything else goes  according to plan). Total float that exceeds a year is  unrealistic and should be minimized.", "Mostly  The schedule contains 1,482  activities that have a float time of  over 100 days. However, project  officials provided a valid rationale for  having activities with large float  times.", "A schedule risk analysis should be performed using  statistical techniques to predict the level of confidence in  meeting a program\u2019s completion date. This analysis focuses  not only on critical path activities but also on activities near  the critical path, since they can potentially affect program  status.", "Project officials stated that they  conducted a schedule risk analysis  using statistical techniques in July  2008 on the baseline schedule.", "The schedule should be continually monitored to determine  when forecasted completion dates differ from the planned  dates, which can be used to determine whether schedule  variances will affect downstream work. Individuals trained in  critical path method scheduling should be responsible for  ensuring that the schedule is properly updated. Maintaining  the integrity of the schedule logic is not only necessary to  reflect true status, but is also required before conducting a  schedule risk analysis.", "Project officials conduct weekly  meetings to review and update the  project schedule."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Summary Results of Interviews with 22 Utilities", "paragraphs": ["Appendix IV: Summary Results of Interviews  with 22 Utilities 1.
