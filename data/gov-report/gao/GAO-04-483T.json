The report presents a plan of action to close these gaps through both management and budgetary processes. Fiscal year 2003 FISMA data showed that, overall, the 24 federal agencies reported increasing numbers of their systems met the information security requirements represented by key OMB performance measures. For example, of the total number of systems reported by these agencies, the reported number assessed for risk climbed from 65 percent to 78 percent, those having a contingency plan jumped from 55 to 68 percent, and those authorized for processing following certification and accreditation rose from 47 to 62 percent. However, reported results varied widely among individual agencies, with some reporting that less than half of their systems met certain requirements. Further, GAO noted opportunities to improve the usefulness of reported performance management data, including independent validation of these data and completion of system inventories. Reported Performance Measurement Data for Selected Information Security Requirements for 24 Large Federal Agencies NIST made progress in developing security-related standards and guidance required by FISMA.

Further, since 1997,  we have identified information security as a governmentwide high-risk  issue in reports to the Congress\u2014most recently in January 2003.", "Concerned with accounts of attacks on commercial systems via the  Internet and reports of significant weaknesses in federal computer  systems that make them vulnerable to attack, in October 2000 the  Congress passed and the President signed into law the Government  Information Security Reform provisions (commonly known as GISRA) to  strengthen information security practices throughout the federal  government. With GISRA expiring in November 2002, FISMA permanently  authorized and strengthened the information security program, evaluation,  and reporting requirements established for federal agencies by GISRA.  FISMA added important new requirements, such as mandating that the  National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) develop minimum  information security requirements for information systems.", "In my testimony today, I will summarize the federal government\u2019s overall  information security progress and challenges as discussed in the Office of  Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) report to the Congress on fiscal year  2003 FISMA implementation released on March 1, 2004.

The  significance of these weaknesses led GAO to recently conclude that  information security was a material weakness in our audit of the federal  government\u2019s fiscal year 2003 financial statements. Audits also identified  instances of similar types of weaknesses in non-financial systems, which  continue to receive increased audit coverage in response to FISMA  requirements. Weaknesses continued to be reported in each of the six  major areas of general controls\u2014the policies, procedures, and technical  controls that apply to all or a large segment of an entity\u2019s information  systems and help ensure their proper operation. These six areas are (1)  security program management, a principal focus of FISMA, which provides  the framework for ensuring that risks are understood and that effective  controls are selected and properly implemented; (2) access controls,  which ensure that only authorized individuals can read, alter, or delete  data; (3) software development and change controls, which ensure that  only authorized software programs are implemented; (4) segregation of  duties, which reduces the risk that one individual can independently  perform inappropriate actions without detection; (5) operating systems  controls, which protect sensitive programs that support multiple  applications from tampering and misuse; and (6) service continuity, also  addressed by FISMA, which ensures that computer-dependent operations  experience no significant disruptions.", "To fully understand the significance of the weaknesses we identified, it is  necessary to link them to the risks they present to federal operations and  assets. Virtually all federal operations are supported by automated systems  and electronic data, and agencies would find it difficult, if not impossible,  to carry out their missions and account for their resources without these  information assets. Hence, the degree of risk caused by security  weaknesses is extremely high. The weaknesses identified place a broad  array of federal operations and assets at risk. For example,  resources, such as federal payments and collections, could be lost or  stolen;   computer resources could be used for unauthorized purposes or to launch    sensitive information, such as taxpayer data, social security records,  medical records, and proprietary business information, could be  inappropriately disclosed, browsed, or copied for purposes of espionage  or other types of crime;   critical operations, such as those supporting national defense and  emergency services, could be disrupted;   data could be modified or destroyed for purposes of fraud or disruption;    agency missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents that  result in diminished confidence in their ability to conduct operations and  fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities.", "Congress and the administration have established specific information  security requirements in both law and policy to help protect the  information and information systems that support these critical  operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FISMA Permanently Authorizes and Strengthens Information Security Requirements", "paragraphs": ["On October 30, 2000, Congress passed GISRA, which was signed into law  and became effective November 29, 2000, for a period of 2 years. GISRA  supplemented information security requirements established in the  Computer Security Act of 1987, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and  the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 and was consistent with existing  information security guidance issued by OMB and NIST, as well as audit  and best practice guidance issued by GAO. Most importantly, however,  GISRA consolidated these separate requirements and guidance into an  overall framework for managing information security and established new  annual review, independent evaluation, and reporting requirements to help  ensure agency implementation and both OMB and congressional oversight.", "Enacted into law on December 17, 2002, as title III of the E-Government  Act of 2002, FISMA permanently authorized and strengthened GISRA\u2019s  information security program, evaluation, and reporting requirements.  Like GISRA, FISMA assigns specific responsibilities to agency heads, chief  information officers (CIO), and IGs. It also assigns responsibilities to  OMB, which include developing and overseeing the implementation of  policies, principles, standards, and guidelines on information security; and  reviewing at least annually, and approving or disapproving, agency  information security programs. FISMA continues to delegate OMB  responsibilities for national security systems to the Secretary of Defense  and the Director of Central Intelligence.", "Overall, FISMA requires each agency, including agencies with national  security systems, to develop, document, and implement an agencywide  information security program to provide information security for the  information and information systems that support the operations and  assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another  agency, contractor, or other source. Specifically, this program is to include    periodic assessments of the risk and magnitude of harm that could result  from the unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or  destruction of information or information systems;  risk-based policies and procedures that cost-effectively reduce  information security risks to an acceptable level and ensure that  information security is addressed throughout the life cycle of each  information system;   subordinate plans for providing adequate information security for  networks, facilities, and systems or groups of information systems;   security awareness training for agency personnel, including contractors  and other users of information systems that support the operations and  assets of the agency;   periodic testing and evaluation of the effectiveness of information security  policies, procedures, and practices, performed with a frequency depending  on risk, but no less than annually, and that includes testing of  management, operational, and technical controls for every system  identified in the agency\u2019s required inventory of major information systems;   a process for planning, implementing, evaluating, and documenting  remedial action to address any deficiencies in the information security  policies, procedures, and practices of the agency;   procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding to security incidents;    plans and procedures to ensure continuity of operations for information  systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.", "FISMA also established a requirement that each agency develop, maintain,  and annually update an inventory of major information systems (including  major national security systems) operated by the agency or under its  control. This inventory is to include an identification of the interfaces  between each system and all other systems or networks, including those  not operated by or under the control of the agency.", "The law also requires an agency\u2019s CIO to designate a senior agency  information security officer who, for the agency\u2019s FISMA-prescribed  information security responsibilities, shall    carry out the CIO\u2019s responsibilities;    possess professional qualifications, including training and experience,  required to administer the required functions;   have information security duties as that official\u2019s primary duty; and    head an office with the mission and resources to assist in ensuring agency  compliance.", "Under FISMA, each agency must continue to have an annual independent  evaluation of its information security program and practices, including  control testing and compliance assessment. Evaluations of non-national- security systems are to be performed by the agency IG or by an  independent external auditor, while evaluations related to national  security systems are to be performed only by an entity designated by the  agency head.", "FISMA requires each agency to report annually to OMB, selected  congressional committees, and the Comptroller General on the adequacy  of information security policies, procedures, and practices, and  compliance with FISMA\u2019s requirements. In addition, agency heads are  required to annually report the results of their independent evaluations to  OMB, except that to the extent an evaluation pertains to a national  security system, only a summary and assessment of that portion of the  evaluation is reported to OMB. OMB is also required to submit a report to  the Congress no later than March 1 of each year on agency compliance  with FISMA\u2019s requirements, including a summary of findings of agencies\u2019  independent evaluations. FISMA also requires the Comptroller General to  periodically evaluate and report to Congress on (1) the adequacy and  effectiveness of agency information security policies and practices and (2)  implementation of FISMA requirements.", "Other major FISMA provisions require NIST to develop, for systems other  than national security systems, (1) standards to be used by all agencies to  categorize all their information and information systems based on the  objectives of providing appropriate levels of information security  according to a range of risk levels; (2) guidelines recommending the types  of information and information systems to be included in each category;  and (3) minimum information security requirements for information and  information systems in each category. NIST must also develop a definition  of and guidelines concerning detection and handling of information  security incidents; and guidelines, developed in conjunction with the  Department of Defense and the National Security Agency, for identifying  an information system as a national security system.", "The law also assigned other information security functions to NIST,  including    providing technical assistance to agencies on such elements as compliance  with the standards and guidelines and the detection and handling of  information security incidents;   conducting research, as needed, to determine the nature and extent of  information security vulnerabilities and techniques for providing cost- effective information security;   developing and periodically revising performance indicators and measures  for agency information security policies and practices;   evaluating private-sector information security policies and practices and  commercially available information technologies to assess potential  application by agencies;   evaluating security policies and practices developed for national security  systems to assess their potential application by agencies; and   periodically assessing the effectiveness of and revising, as appropriate, the  NIST standards and guidelines developed under FISMA.", "NIST is required to prepare an annual public report on activities  undertaken in the previous year, and planned for the coming year, to carry  out its responsibilities under FISMA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB Reporting Instructions and Guidance Emphasize Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["On August 6, 2003, OMB issued its fiscal year 2003 FISMA reporting  instructions and guidance on quarterly IT security reporting. These  instructions, which required agencies to submit their reports to OMB by  September 22, 2003, essentially continued many of the reporting  requirements established for GISRA, including performance measures  introduced for fiscal year 2002 reporting under that law. The instructions  also highlighted the more substantive changes introduced by FISMA. For  example, OMB emphasized that FISMA applies to both information and  information systems used by an agency and by its contractors or other  organizations and sources that possess or use federal information or that  operate, use, or have access to federal information systems. OMB also  underscored that FISMA requires each agency to test and evaluate the  effectiveness of the information security policies, procedures, and  practices for each system at least annually.", "OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2003 reporting instructions also emphasized the strong  focus on performance measures and formatted these instructions to  emphasize a quantitative rather than a narrative response. OMB also  required agencies to provide quarterly updates for a key subset of these  performance measures, with the first update due December 15, 2003.  Measures within this key subset are the numbers of systems that have  risk assessments and assigned levels of risk,   up-to-date IT security plans,    security control costs integrated into their life cycles,    security controls tested and evaluated in the last year,    contingency plans tested.", "Further, OMB provided instructions for continued agency reporting on the  status of remediation efforts through plans of action and milestones  (POA&M). Required for all programs and systems where an IT security  weakness has been found, a POA&M lists the weaknesses and shows  estimated resource needs or other challenges to resolving them, key  milestones and completion dates, and the status of corrective actions.  POA&Ms are to be submitted twice a year. In addition, agencies are to  submit quarterly updates that show the number of weaknesses for which  corrective action was completed on time (including testing), is ongoing  and on track to be completed as originally scheduled, or has been delayed;  as well as the number new weaknesses discovered since that last update.", "Consistent with last year, OMB\u2019s fiscal year 2003 guidance continued to  authorize agencies to release certain information from their POA&Ms to  assist the Congress in its oversight responsibilities. Agencies could release  this information, as requested, excluding certain elements, such as  estimated funding resources and the scheduled completion dates for  resolving a weakness.", "Lastly, as part of IG FISMA reporting, OMB instructed the IGs to respond  to essentially the same questions that the agencies were to respond to in  their reports. The IG responses were to be based on the results of their  independent evaluations, including agency progress in implementing and  maintaining their POA&Ms, and any other work performed throughout the  reporting period (such as financial statement or other audits). This year,  OMB also asked the IGs to assess against specific criteria whether the  agency had developed, implemented, and was managing an agencywide  POA&M process. OMB noted that this assessment was critical because  effective remediation of IT security weaknesses is essential to achieving a  mature and sound IT security program and securing information and  systems. Further, OMB identified this IG assessment as one of the criteria  used in evaluating agencies under the Expanding E-Government Scorecard  of the President\u2019s Management Agenda.", "OMB also instructed the IGs to use the performance measures to assist in  evaluating agency officials\u2019 performance. However, it did not request them  to validate agency responses to the performance measures.

Overall, the report discusses the steps taken by OMB and federal  agencies to implement FISMA, details progress made in fiscal year 2003,  and identifies IT security gaps and weaknesses. The report also presents a  plan of action that OMB is pursuing with agencies to close these gaps and  improve the security of federal information and systems. This plan is  intended to resolve information and security challenges through both  management and budgetary processes.", "OMB\u2019s report discussed four governmentwide findings:  1.  Agencies\u2019 Progress Against Governmentwide IT Security Milestones.", "The President\u2019s fiscal year 2004 budget established three  governmentwide goals to be met by the end of calendar year 2003.  These goals and the progress reported against them were:    Goal 1 \u2014 As required by FISMA, all federal agencies are to have  created a central remediation process to ensure that program and  system-level IT security weaknesses, once identified, are tracked and  corrected. In addition, each agency IG is to verify whether the agency  has a process in place that meets criteria specified in OMB guidance.  Based on IG responses to these criteria, OMB reported that each  agency has an IT security remediation process, but that the maturity of  these processes varies greatly. In particular, the report noted that for  the 24 large agencies, only half have a remediation process verified by  their IGs as meeting the necessary criteria.", "Goal 2 \u2014 Eighty percent of federal IT systems are to be certified and  accredited. OMB reported that many agencies are not adequately  prioritizing their IT investments to ensure that significant IT security  weaknesses are appropriately addressed. As a result, at the end of 2003,  the reported percentage of systems certified and accredited had  increased to 62 percent, but was still short of the goal. Related to this  goal, the report noted that most security weaknesses can be found in  operational systems that either have never been certified and  accredited or whose certification and accreditation are out of date.", "Goal 3 \u2014 Eighty percent of the federal government\u2019s fiscal year 2004  major IT investments shall appropriately integrate security into the  lifecycle of the investment. OMB reported that agencies have made  improvements in integrating security into new IT investments, but that  significant problems remain, particularly in ensuring security of  existing systems. As an example, the report provided results for the  performance measure related to this goal, which showed that at the  end of 2003, the percentage of systems that had integrated security into  the lifecycle of the investment increased to 78 percent.  2.  Agency Progress Against Key IT Security Measures. As the report  highlights, because of GISRA and the OMB-developed performance  measures, the federal government is now able to measure progress in  IT security; and the Congress, OMB, the agencies, and GAO are able to  track and monitor agency efforts against those measures. Noting  agency progress, the report provides a table comparing results of 24  large federal agencies for key performance measures for fiscal years  2001, 2002, and 2003. However, it also notes that further work is  needed, and uses the area of contingency planning as an example,  where only 48 percent of the systems had tested contingency plans. A  comparison of reported overall results for fiscal year 2002 and 2003 is  provided below in table 1.  3.  IGs\u2019 Assessment of Agency Plan of Action and Milestones Process. As  mentioned in the discussion of goal 1, OMB requested that IGs assess  against a set of criteria whether the agency had a robust agencywide  plan of action process. OMB reported the overall results of this  assessment for the 24 agencies, which showed that 8 had such a  process; 4 did, but with improvements needed; 11 did not; and one did  not submit a report (DOD).  4.  Lack of Clear Accountability for Ensuring Security of Information  and Systems. The report emphasizes that even with the strong focus of  both GISRA and FISMA on the responsibilities of agency officials  regarding security, there continues to be a lack of understanding, and  therefore, accountability within the federal government. Issues that  continue to be a concern include the following:    Agency and IG reports continue to identify the same IT security  weaknesses year after year, some of which are seen as repeating  material weaknesses.", "Too many legacy systems continue to operate with serious weaknesses.", "As a result, there continues to be a failure to adequately prioritize IT  funding decisions to ensure that remediation of significant security  weaknesses are funded prior to proceeding with new development.", "In further discussing this finding, the report concludes that these concerns  must be addressed through improved accountability, that is, holding  agency program officials accountable for ensuring that the systems that  support their programs and operations are secure. Further, it emphasizes  that ensuring the security of an agency\u2019s information and systems is not  the responsibility of a single agency official or the agency\u2019s IT security  office, but rather a responsibility to be shared among agency officials that  support their operations and assets.", "The report also outlines a plan of action to improve performance that  identifies specific steps it will pursue to assist agencies in their IT security  activities, promote implementation of law and policy, and track status and  progress. These steps are:    Prioritizing IT Spending to Resolve IT Security Weaknesses. OMB  reports that it used information from agencies\u2019 annual FISMA reports and  quarterly POA&M updates in making funding decisions for fiscal year 2004,  as well as for fiscal year 2005 to address longer term security weaknesses.  For example, agencies with significant information and system security  weaknesses were directed to remediate operational systems with  weaknesses prior to spending fiscal year 2004 IT development or  modernization funds. Further, if additional resources are needed to  resolve those weaknesses, agencies are to use those fiscal year 2004 funds  originally sought for new development.", "President\u2019s Management Agenda Scorecard. To \u201cget to green\u201d under the  Expanding E-Government Scorecard for IT security, agencies are required  to meet the following three criteria: (1) demonstrate consistent progress in  remediating IT security weaknesses; (2) attain certification and  accreditations for 90 percent of their operational IT systems; and (3) have  an IG-assessed and IG-verified agency POA&M process.", "Fiscal Year 2004 OMB FISMA Guidance. OMB plans to further emphasize  performance measurement in next year\u2019s guidance. In particular, its focus  will center on three areas: (1) evolving the IT security performance  measures to move beyond status reporting to also identify the quality of  the work done, such as determining both the number of systems certified  and accredited and the quality of certification and accreditation  conducted; (2) further targeting of IG efforts to assess the development,  implementation, and performance of key IT security processes, such as  remediation and intrusion detection and reporting; and (3) providing  additional clarity to certain definitions to eliminate interpretation  differences within agencies and among agencies and IGs.", "Threat and Vulnerability Response Process. In response to the increasing  number and potential impact of threats and vulnerabilities, OMB will  continue to focus on improving the federal government\u2019s incident  prevention and management capabilities. Such improvements include an  increased emphasis on reducing the impact of worms and viruses through  more timely installation of patches for known vulnerabilities, and  improved information sharing to rapidly identify and respond to cyber  threats and critical vulnerabilities. OMB also notes the critical importance  of agency business continuity plans to mitigating the impact of threats and  vulnerabilities.", "Finally, OMB\u2019s March 2004 report to the Congress identifies several other  issues, and provides additional summary and agency-specific information.  These include the following:    As one of the changes or additions introduced by FISMA, a stronger  emphasis is placed on configuration management. Specifically, FISMA  requires each agency to develop specific system configuration  requirements that meet its own needs and ensure compliance with them.  According to the report, this provision encompasses traditional system  configuration management, employing clearly defined system security  settings, and maintaining up-to-date patches. Further, adequate ongoing  monitoring and maintenance must accompany the establishment of such  configuration requirements.", "Federal funding for IT security increased from $2.7 billion in fiscal year  2002 to $4.2 billion in fiscal year 2003. The report also continues to  emphasize that, historically, a review of IT security spending and security  results has demonstrated that spending is not a statistically significant  factor in determining agency security performance. Rather, the key is  effectively incorporating IT security in agency management actions and  implementing IT security throughout the lifecycle of a system.", "The report appendixes provide an overview of the federal government\u2019s IT  security program, a summary of performance by 55 small and independent  agencies, and individual summaries for each of the 24 large agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FISMA Reports Highlight Overall Increases in Performance Measures, But Individual Agency Results Vary Widely", "paragraphs": ["Overall, fiscal year 2003 data reported by the agencies for a subset of  OMB\u2019s performance measures show increasing numbers of systems  meeting the requirements represented by these measures.

Also as  discussed later, we noted opportunities to improve the usefulness of  agency-reported data. Further, in considering FISMA data, it is important  to note that as more systems are subject to the certification and  accreditation process and periodically tested, it is probable that additional  significant weaknesses will be identified; and until all systems have  contingency plans that are periodically tested, agencies have limited  assurance that they will be able to recover from unexpected events.

However, several opportunities  exist to improve the usefulness of such information as indicators of both  governmentwide and agency-specific performance in implementing  information security requirements. As discussed earlier, OMB plans to  further emphasize performance measurement in next year\u2019s FISMA  reporting guidance, including evolving measures to identify the quality of  work performed, targeting IG efforts to assess key security processes, and  clarifying certain definitions. In developing its guidance, OMB can  consider how their efforts can help to address the following factors that  lessen the usefulness of current performance measurement data:    Limited assurance of data reliability and quality. The performance  measures reported by the agencies are primarily based on self- assessments and are not independently validated. OMB did not require the  IGs to validate agency responses to the performance measures, but did  instruct them to assess the reliability of the data for the subset of systems  they evaluate as part of their independent evaluations. Although not  consistently addressed by all the IGs, some IG evaluations did identify  problems with data reliability and quality that could affect agency  performance data. For example, for the performance measure on the  number of agency systems authorized for processing after certification  and accreditation, 6 IGs indicated different results than those reported by  their agencies for reasons such as out-of-date certifications and  accreditations (systems are to be reaccredited at least every 3 years).  Further, other IGs identified problems with the quality of the certifications  and accreditations, such as security control reviews not being performed.", "Accuracy of agency system inventories. The total number of agency  systems is a key element in OMB\u2019s performance measures, in that agency  progress is indicated by the percentage of total systems that meet specific  information security requirements. Thus, inaccurate or incomplete data on  the total number of agency systems affects the percentage of systems  shown as meeting the requirements. Further, a complete inventory of  major information systems is a key element of managing the agency\u2019s IT  resources, including the security of those resources. As mentioned, FISMA  requires that each agency develop, maintain, and annually update an  inventory of major information systems operated by the agency or under  its control. However, according to their fiscal year 2003 FISMA reports,  only 13 of the 24 agencies reported that they had completed their system  inventories. Further, independent evaluations by IGs for 3 of these 13  agencies did not agree that system inventories were complete. In addition,  although there was little change in the reported total number of systems  shown for the 24 agencies (an increase of only 41 systems from 7,957  systems for fiscal year 2002 to 7,998 systems for fiscal year 2003, large  changes in individual agencies\u2019 total systems from year to year could make  it more difficult to interpret changes in their performance measure results.  For example, the total number of systems reported by the Department of  Agriculture decreased by 55 percent from 605 for fiscal year 2002 to 271  for fiscal year 2003, which the department attributed, in large part, to its  efforts to develop the FISMA-required inventory of major information  systems. At the same time, all of the department\u2019s key performance  measures increased, with some, such as systems assessed for risk,  showing a large increase (from 18 percent for fiscal year 2002 to 72  percent for fiscal year 2003).", "Limited Department of Defense data. In interpreting overall results for  the federal government, it is important to note that reported numbers  include only a small sample of the thousands of systems identified by  DOD. Attributing its size and complexity and the considerable lead time  necessary to allow for the collection of specific metrics and the approval  process by each service and agency, DOD determined that the collection  of a sample of system and network performance metrics would effectively  support its emphasis on network-centric operations and complement its  overall information assurance security reporting. Obtaining OMB  concurrence with this approach, DOD provided performance  measurement data on a sample of 378 systems in its fiscal year 2003  FISMA report. As OMB reported in its fiscal year 2003 report to the  Congress, DOD reported a total of 3,557 systems for the department\u2014 almost half of the combined total systems for the other 23 agencies. OMB  also reported that DOD plans to report on all systems for the fiscal year  2004 reporting cycle. As a result, including performance data on all DOD  systems for fiscal year 2004 could significantly affect the overall  performance measurement results both for DOD and governmentwide.", "Data reported in aggregate, not according to system risk. Performance  measurement data are reported on the total number of agency systems and  do not indicate the relative importance or risk of the systems for which  FISMA requirements have been met. Reporting information by system risk  would provide better information about whether agencies are prioritizing  their information security efforts according to risk. For example, the  performance measures for fiscal year 2003 show that 48 percent of the  total number of systems have tested contingency plans, but do not indicate  to what extent these 48 percent include the agencies\u2019 most important  systems. Therefore, agencies, the administration, and the Congress cannot  be sure that critical federal operations can be restored if an unexpected  event disrupts service. As required by FISMA, NIST recently issued its  Standards for Security Categorization of Federal Information and  Information Systems to provide a common framework and understanding  for expressing security that promotes effective management and oversight  of information security programs and consistent reporting to OMB and the  Congress on the adequacy and effectiveness of information security  policies, procedures, and practices.
