This report examines the extent to which Treasury is reviewing unexpended balances and cost projections for the MHA programs. To do this work, GAO used 2015 mortgage and other data from a private vendor and Treasury to help illustrate potential future costs of MHA/HAMP, reviewed internal Treasury documents, and interviewed relevant federal agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) monitors activity and aggregate expenditures under its Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)-funded Making Home Affordable (MHA) program, but it has not instituted a system to review the extent that it will use the full available program balance ($7.7 billion as of October 16, 2015). In a July 2009 report, GAO found that Treasury's estimates of program participation may have been overstated, reflecting uncertainty caused by data gaps and assumptions that had to be made, and recommended that Treasury periodically review and update its estimates.", "In response, Treasury started performing periodic estimates of the eligible HAMP population. Treasury officials previously told GAO that they could not reliably estimate future participation levels due to data limitations and that they assumed that all available MHA funds would be spent. GAO recognizes that no estimate of future participation and expenditures can be made with certainty. But prior GAO work has concluded that reviewing unexpended balances, including those that have been obligated, can help agencies identify possible budgetary savings. Moreover, Congress's recent action to limit entry into the MHA programs after December 31, 2016, and to allow Treasury to obligate up to $2 billion in TARP funds, including MHA funds, to the Housing Finance Agency Innovation Fund for the Hardest Hit Housing Markets (Hardest Hit Fund), provides Treasury with greater certainty and opportunity with respect to estimating and reprogramming excess MHA fund balances. Since then, the President's 2017 Budget identified $4.7 billion in potential excess funds, and Treasury has announced its intention to transfer $2 billion of these funds to the Hardest Hit Fund. Officials said that deobligating additional amounts would present undue risk of having insufficient funds, and that further estimates of excess funds should await the completion of all new activity.", "GAO performed its own analysis of September 2015 mortgage data to estimate potential future HAMP participation and costs. This analysis resulted in estimates of MHA program balances as of October 16, 2015, that ranged from using all available funds to a surplus of $2.5 billion. In preparing these estimates, GAO attempted to provide a wide range of possible outcomes and generally used inclusive assumptions. Thus the actual number of eligible loans is likely to be lower and the unexpended balances higher than GAO's estimates. Taking action to estimate likely MHA expenditures allows Treasury to deobligate excess funds and, as appropriate, move funds to the Hardest Hit Fund. To the extent that additional funds may be deobligated, Congress may then have the opportunity to use those funds on other priorities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations to Treasury and has one matter for congressional consideration. Treasury should (1) estimate future expenditures for the MHA program and any unexpended balances and (2) deobligate funds that its review shows will likely not be expended and move up to $2 billion of such funds to the TARP-funded Hardest Hit Fund as authorized. Congress should consider permanently rescinding any deobligated MHA funds that are not moved to the Hardest Hit Fund and make them available for other priorities.

Treasury initially announced  that up to $50 billion would be used to help as many as 3 million to 4  million struggling homeowners avoid potential foreclosure but  subsequently reduced the amount to $37.5 billion. Of that amount,  Treasury has obligated $27.8 billion in TARP funds for the Making Home  Affordable (MHA) program. The cornerstone program under MHA is the  Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), which provides financial  incentives for eligible borrowers, servicers, and mortgage  holders/investors to modify first-lien mortgages.

However, billions of dollars obligated under the  MHA program remain unexpended, and GAO and the Congressional  Budget Office (CBO) have raised questions about the potential for excess  funds.", "In previous reports, we looked at Treasury\u2019s design and implementation  of HAMP and other TARP-funded housing programs and made several  recommendations to improve Treasury\u2019s oversight of the programs. This  60-day report examines the extent to which Treasury has conducted  reviews of unexpended balances of MHA program funds. To address this  objective, we reviewed Treasury data and reports on program  expenditures and participation, CBO reports, and TARP documentation  related to the housing programs. We also analyzed MHA program  documentation, including supplemental directives for recent MHA  program changes and the MHA Program Handbook, and Treasury  memorandums and other internal documents.", "To assess changes in mortgage performance since 2009 and the state of  the loan modification market, we analyzed summary data from (1) the  Mortgage Bankers Association, CoreLogic, Inc., and the Urban Institute  on mortgage delinquencies, negative equity, and credit availability, and  (2) the HOPE NOW Alliance and the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency (OCC) on mortgage loan modifications completed between  January 1, 2009, and September 30, 2015.

We used those data to (1) estimate the  likely universe of residential mortgage loans potentially eligible for a  HAMP loan modification, (2) estimate the proportion of potentially eligible  loans that are likely to need and qualify for a HAMP loan modification  using factors which we first developed in our 2012 report in which we  evaluated the at-risk mortgage universe, and (3) estimate potential future  HAMP expenditures on the basis of average estimated life-time costs for  the various HAMP loan modification types using various scenarios. We  took a number of steps to ensure the reliability of the data and analyses  we purchased from Black Knight. For example, we discussed with Black  Knight officials the company\u2019s internal procedures for ensuring data  reliability and the process used to complete the work we requested.

The largest component of MHA is the  first-lien modification program. The program was intended to help  eligible borrowers stay in their homes and avoid potential foreclosures  by reducing the amount of their monthly payments to affordable  levels. Modifications are available for single-family properties (one to  four units) with mortgages no greater than $729,750 for a one-unit  property. Borrowers are eligible only if companies servicing their  mortgages have signed program participation agreements.  Participating loan servicers use a standardized net present value  (NPV) model to compare a modified loan\u2019s expected cash flows to the  cash flows that would be expected from the same loan with no  modifications, using certain assumptions. If the expected cash flow  with a modification is positive (i.e., more than the estimated cash flow  of the unmodified loan), the participating loan servicer is required to  offer the loan modification. HAMP provides both one-time and  ongoing incentives to mortgage investors, loan servicers, and  borrowers for up to 6 years after a loan is modified. These incentives  take into consideration the servicers\u2019 and investors\u2019 costs for making  the modifications and are designed to increase the likelihood that the  program will produce successful modifications over the long term.  They include principal balance reductions for borrowers who make  payments on time and incentives for servicers tied to the amount by  which a modification reduces the borrower\u2019s monthly payment.", "The HAMP first-lien modification program has three components\u2014the  original HAMP (Tier 1), an additional first-lien modification known as  HAMP Tier 2, and a modification with reduced borrower  documentation requirements known as Streamline HAMP. Announced  in March 2009, HAMP Tier 1 is generally available to qualified  borrowers who occupy their properties as their primary residence and  whose first-lien mortgage payments are more than 31 percent of their  monthly gross income, as calculated using the front-end debt-to- income (DTI) ratio. HAMP Tier 2, which was announced in January  2012, is available for both owner-occupied and rental properties, and  borrowers\u2019 monthly mortgage payments prior to modification may be  less than 31 percent DTI. Streamline HAMP, which was announced in  July 2015 and requires servicers to have an implementation policy in  place as of January 2016, offers modification terms and eligibility  criteria similar to those of HAMP Tier 2 but does not require  documentation (or verification) of borrower income.", "As part of the HAMP Tier 1 modification, servicers reduce a  borrower\u2019s interest rate until the DTI is 31 percent or the interest rate  reaches 2 percent. The new interest rate is fixed for the first 5 years  of the modification. It then gradually increases by increments of no  more than 1 percent per year until it reaches the cap, which is the  Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey rate at the time of the  modification agreement. The interest rate is then fixed at that rate for  the remaining loan term. In contrast, under HAMP Tier 2 and  Streamline HAMP, the interest rate is adjusted to a rate that remains  fixed for the life of the loan. The fixed rate is set using the weekly  Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey Rate at the time of the  modification agreement.", "For HAMP Tier 1, HAMP Tier 2, and Streamline HAMP, borrowers  must demonstrate their ability to pay the modified amount by  successfully completing a trial period of 3 months or more before a  loan is permanently modified and any government payments are  made. When a borrower defaults\u2014misses three consecutive monthly  mortgage payments\u2014after the loan has been permanently modified,  Treasury stops paying financial incentives to the borrower, servicer,  and investor for that modification. Borrowers who have received a  HAMP Tier 1 modification may be eligible for a HAMP Tier 2 or  Streamline HAMP modification under certain conditions. These  include having undergone a change in circumstances, having entered  into a permanent HAMP Tier 1 loan modification at least 12 months  earlier, or having defaulted on the HAMP Tier 1 modification (referred  to as redefault). In all cases, borrowers must otherwise meet HAMP  eligibility criteria, such as having a financial hardship.", "The Second Lien Modification Program (2MP). 2MP is designed to  work in tandem with HAMP modifications to provide a comprehensive  solution to help borrowers afford their mortgage payments. Under  2MP, when a borrower\u2019s first lien is modified under HAMP and the  servicer of the second lien is a 2MP participant, that servicer must  offer a modification and/or full or partial extinguishment of the second  lien. Treasury provides incentive payments to second lien mortgage  holders in the form of a percentage of each dollar in principal  reduction on the second lien. Treasury has doubled the incentive  payments offered to second lien mortgage holders for 2MP permanent  modifications that include principal reduction and have an effective  date on or after June 1, 2012.", "Principal Reduction Alternative (PRA). In October 2010, PRA took  effect as a component of HAMP to give servicers more flexibility in  offering relief to borrowers whose homes were worth significantly less  than their mortgage balance. Under PRA, Treasury provides  mortgage holders/investors with incentive payments in the form of a  percentage of each dollar in principal reduction. Treasury has tripled  the PRA incentive amounts offered to mortgage holders/investors for  permanent modifications with trial periods effective on or after March  1, 2012. Participating servicers of loans not owned by the housing  enterprises (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac) must evaluate the benefit of  principal reduction for mortgages with a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio that  is greater than 115 percent when evaluating a homeowner for a  HAMP first-lien modification. Servicers must adopt and follow PRA  policies that treat all similarly situated loans in a consistent manner  but are not required to offer principal reductions, even when the NPV  calculations show that the expected value of the loan\u2019s cash flows  would be higher with a principal reduction than without it. When  servicers include principal reduction in modifications under PRA, the  reduction is initially treated as noninterest-bearing principal  forbearance. If the borrower is in good standing on the first, second,  and third anniversaries of the effective date of the modification\u2019s trial  period, one-third of the principal reduction amount is forgiven on each  anniversary.", "Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives (HAFA) Program. Under  this program, servicers offer foreclosure alternatives (short sales and  deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure) to borrowers who meet the basic  eligibility requirements for HAMP and do not qualify for a HAMP trial  modification, do not successfully complete a HAMP trial modification,  default on a modification (miss three or more consecutive payments),  or request a short sale or deed-in-lieu.

The historical default  rates, combined with data about loan terms and borrower characteristics  at origination, are used to generate a measure of expected default risk at  origination. The HCAI presents this measure in terms of the percentage of  loans originated in a given quarter that will probably default, that is,  become 90 or more days delinquent. This overall percentage is the sum  of product risk (risk due to characteristics of loans) and borrower risk (risk  due to characteristics of borrowers).

Additionally, Fannie Mae continues to  provide Treasury with an internal estimate of potentially eligible HAMP  Tier 1 borrowers based on a combination of industry data and information  received from MHA servicers (known as a \u201cwaterfall\u201d).", "Treasury officials have indicated that they have historically assumed that  all funds obligated for MHA would be spent under that program, and,  therefore, had not been analyzing likely unexpended or excess MHA  funds that could potentially be deobligated. Additionally, Treasury officials  previously indicated that they had not found the servicer survey data to be  reliable predictors of future participation. Instead, Treasury uses the  servicer surveys to look for trends in the HAMP modification activity data  and as a vehicle for discussions with servicers on their approaches to the  MHA program. Treasury officials also questioned the utility of the  waterfall, given several limitations. First, it may not be possible to acquire  a full knowledge of the factors that would make a borrower eligible, such  as current income, the current occupancy/use of the property, any  financial hardship, the borrower\u2019s ability to meet applicable underwriting  criteria, and the modified loan\u2019s net present value status from available  industry data sources. Second, estimating the potentially eligible  population for HAMP Tier 2, which the waterfall does not attempt to do, is  difficult because (1) all borrowers are first considered for HAMP Tier 1,  raising the possibility of double counting; (2) non-owner-occupied units  are only eligible if they are used for rental purposes; (3) each servicer  determines its own DTI range within Treasury\u2019s established parameters;  and (4) servicers have limited historical data for HAMP Tier 2 on which to  base estimates. Third, Treasury officials noted that Fannie Mae\u2019s waterfall  is only a point-in-time estimate and does not account for borrowers who  might become eligible in the future (a number that depends on a variety of  changing economic and market factors).", "Instead, as we found in our July 2015 report, Treasury has focused on  identifying ways to increase the reach and effectiveness of MHA  programs by making program changes and modifications. For example,  Treasury\u2019s internal Action Memorandums that describe program changes  and modifications, including its Streamline HAMP modification process,  for senior management indicate that Treasury has assumed that all funds  obligated for MHA would be spent. Over the course of the MHA program,  Treasury has extended program deadlines and introduced new features  designed to increase program participation and program expenditures.  However, as previously noted, in December 2015 Congress mandated  that the MHA program be terminated on December 31, 2016. Treasury  has stated that any program expansions or modifications resulting in  additional expenditures would remain within the amount obligated to the  MHA program. Treasury\u2019s Action Memorandum that discussed Streamline  HAMP also explained that the amount that would ultimately be expended  in connection with the program change was difficult to estimate and would  depend on a number of factors that Treasury could not predict at that time  (e.g., national mortgage delinquency rates and other economic  conditions, borrower application rates, and the performance of modified  loans over time). Treasury officials previously told us that Treasury\u2019s  mandate is to help as many struggling homeowners as possible. Treasury  officials also told us that the MHA Program Administrator will be  conducting program readiness assessments for Streamline HAMP  starting in January 2016 and will request the servicers\u2019 Streamline HAMP  policies at that time. However, Treasury officials indicated that they  would not require servicers to report estimates of the population eligible  for Streamline HAMP as they do for HAMP Tier 1 and Tier 2. Given the  common eligibility criteria, Treasury expects that the potentially eligible  population for Streamline HAMP will significantly overlap with that of  HAMP Tier 1 and HAMP Tier 2. Estimating the potentially eligible  population for Streamline HAMP is challenging, in part because servicers  can tailor the eligibility criteria to their unique loan portfolios."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Treasury May Be Missing Opportunities to Achieve Budgetary Benefits", "paragraphs": ["Because Treasury has not routinely estimated expenditures associated  with estimated likely future MHA program participation, it may not have  identified in a timely manner whether it is retaining funds that may not be  needed. Estimating likely future participation and associated expenditures  would provide Treasury greater assurance that the funds it has obligated  are necessary. As previously stated, as of October 2015, Treasury had  $7.7 billion in unexpended obligations representing the amounts  potentially available to servicers for future MHA transactions, including,  but not limited to, HAMP modifications. The President\u2019s fiscal year 2017  budget submission indicates that Treasury is now estimating a $4.7 billion  reduction in total outlays for the MHA program. This estimate is based on  analysis Treasury prepared assuming that future activity will be similar to  recent activity. Treasury deobligated $2 billion of this $4.7 billion on  February 25, 2016. Treasury officials told us that deobligating all MHA  funds in excess of the current cost estimate would unduly increase the  risk of insufficient funding for future program expenditures. Additionally,  Treasury has indicated it plans to evaluate whether to deobligate  additional funds after the complete universe of MHA transactions (i.e.,  modifications, short sales, and deeds-in-lieu of foreclosure) is known,  sometime after entry into the MHA program is complete in late 2017.", "In our 2012 assessment of federal grant programs, we found that  deobligating excess funds helps ensure that federal agency resources are  not improperly spent and helps agencies maintain accurate accounting of  their budgetary resources. Further, by preparing such estimates on a  periodic basis, Treasury can achieve greater certainty over time and  provide Congress with the opportunity to use those funds more efficiently  elsewhere."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Some of Our Estimates of Future MHA Program Activity and Costs Suggest That Treasury May Not Use All Funds", "paragraphs": ["Because prior to the President\u2019s 2017 budget submission Treasury had  not projected expenditures associated with likely future MHA participation  or the likely resulting unexpended balances, we performed our own  analysis to illustrate the potential range of estimated future participation in  the various HAMP programs and generate cost projections from those  estimations. These estimates are derived from data provided by a vendor  and are based on the vendor\u2019s two datasets, for which it had September  30, 2015, loan-level information, and an extrapolation to the remaining  universe of loans for which the vendor had no data. We limited the  analysis to loans that were determined by the vendor to be originated  prior to January 2009 that were not owned by the housing enterprises or  insured or guaranteed by the government. These are just two of the  criteria for determining whether a loan meets basic eligibility criteria for  the MHA program. We also limited the analysis to reflect other program  requirements, as discussed further below. Based upon these estimates  of potential eligibility and program data on the typical costs of  modifications, we produced estimates of potential future costs. We  compared these estimates of future cost with available, but unused, funds  as of October 16, 2015, to produce estimates of potential excess funds.  For a complete description of our methodology, see appendix II.", "Our results provide a range of potential future costs and excess funds  using various assumptions for three important factors\u2014the extent to  which potentially eligible loans are serviced by HAMP-approved servicers,  whether the loan had been previously modified, and whether the loan was  60 or more days delinquent or otherwise met certain measures of risk that  might indicate that the loan was in imminent danger of default. Specifics  of each of the three factors follow.    1.  We prepared higher and lower estimates of costs and excess funds  assuming for the higher estimate that 62 percent of loans were  serviced by HAMP-approved servicers, and for the lower estimate that  57 percent of loans were serviced by HAMP-approved servicers.    2.  Within the higher and lower estimates, we projected estimated future  program costs for (a) loans that were 60 or more days delinquent that  met the basic HAMP eligibility criteria and (b) loans that were 60 or  more days delinquent combined with loans that were in imminent  danger of default. Loans that are 60 or more days delinquent are  potentially eligible for all three HAMP loan modification categories  (HAMP Tier 1, Tier 2, and Streamline HAMP). Loans in imminent  danger of default are potentially eligible for HAMP Tier 1 and Tier 2  modifications.    3.  Also within the higher and lower estimates, we estimated future costs  based on two different assumptions\u2014that 25 percent of the at-risk  loans were currently in a loan modification (HAMP or non-HAMP) and  that none of the at-risk loans were currently in a loan modification.", "Our analysis found that when considering the most inclusive of the  assumptions\u2014that more loans are serviced by HAMP-approved  servicers, that both loans that are 60 or more days delinquent and loans  that might be at risk of default would be eligible, and that no loans are  already in modification\u2014results in an estimate of Treasury using all  available funds. Conversely, using the least inclusive assumptions\u2014that  fewer loans are serviced by HAMP-approved servicers, that only loans  that are currently 60 or more days delinquent would be eligible, and that  25 percent of loans are already in modification\u2014results in an estimated  surplus of $4.8 billion, not considering other non-HAMP MHA costs. (See  table 1.)", "Our high and low estimates of potential unused or excess funds are  based upon assumptions that generally would result in higher expected  eligibility and participation, higher overall costs and, therefore, lower  unused or excess funds, than might actually be realized. In particular, for  all scenarios, we assumed a borrower participation rate of 100 percent.  That is, we assumed that all borrowers that are eligible for modification  are offered and accept the modification. We also assumed that all  borrowers offered a trial modification would successfully complete their  trial and convert the modification into a permanent one, which is not likely  to be the case. In some scenarios we also established measures of  mortgage risk to approximate a definition of loans that are not 60 or more  days delinquent, but in imminent danger of default\u2014a potential eligibility  qualification for modification under the Tier 1 and Tier 2 programs. Based  upon our analysis of at-risk loans, we assumed an approximate equal  split between the modifications for the 60 days or more delinquent and  the imminent default loans. According to Treasury data, approximately 20  percent of HAMP loan modifications went to borrowers that servicers  determined were in imminent danger of default. If instead one assumed  that loans that are in imminent danger of default would comprise 20  percent of the loans receiving a modification, then even our most  inclusive estimate of future cost would be $5.3 billion (versus $8.6 billion)  and the estimate of unused or excess funds would be much higher\u2014$2.4  billion (versus a deficit of $0.9 billion).", "Not shown in table 1 are estimates for program costs related to the non- HAMP programs of MHA. Treasury officials told us these non-HAMP  MHA programs are important because servicers can use the funds  obligated under the participation agreement for MHA programs other than  HAMP.Therefore, funds that are not used for HAMP loan modifications  could be used for non-HAMP MHA programs, such as the Home  Affordable Foreclosure Alternative and the FHA/RD HAMP programs.  According to Treasury, it expended approximately $467 million for the  non-HAMP programs during fiscal year 2015. Extrapolating that amount  over an additional 6 years (entry into the MHA programs ends on  December 31, 2016, and incentive payments can extend up to 5 years  after entry, as in the case of the 2MP program) would result in an  additional $2.3 billion in MHA expenditures. Together with our lowest  estimate of HAMP program costs, total MHA program costs could  therefore be $5.2 billion, which would leave an estimated $2.5 billion in  potentially excess funds. In contrast, our high estimate resulted in all  available MHA program funds being spent. Also, as previously noted,  our analysis does not include estimates for HAMP modification of loans  owned by the housing enterprises or insured or guaranteed by the  government.", "CBO has also conducted analysis that illustrates the uncertainty about  whether or not Treasury will likely spend all the funds allocated to the  MHA programs. CBO\u2019s most recent analysis, published in March 2015,  projected a $9 billion surplus (with Treasury estimating full use of $37  billion in funds and CBO estimating use of $28 billion) over the amount  that Treasury has estimated, because CBO anticipated that fewer  households would participate in housing programs. CBO had increased  its estimate of likely expenditures of TARP-funded housing programs by  $2 billion from its previous year\u2019s estimate, primarily because of  Treasury\u2019s announcement in November 2014 of an additional $5,000 in  principal reduction for participants in the sixth year of a mortgage  modification.

Additionally, if Treasury were to deobligate  MHA funds that it determines were likely to not be expended, this may  provide Congress with the opportunity to use those funds for other  priorities. Our eligibility estimates, cost projections, and estimated  unexpended balance figures represent a wide range of possible future  outcomes, including a potential surplus in some cases, even when  including potential future costs of non-HAMP housing programs.  Treasury, with the assistance of its program administrators and servicers,  is in a better position to conduct its own estimates of the number of  eligible borrowers, potential costs of the program, and any balances that  remain unexpended. We recognize that no estimate of future participation  and expenditures can be made with complete certainty. However,  Treasury has historically assumed that all MHA program funds will be  spent and has instead focused on ways to expend the existing balance by  making program changes and modifications.

This assumption  was based on the expectation that Streamline HAMP is expected to have  similar participation rates based on current trends reported by the  enterprises and the increases in HAMP Tier 2 relative to HAMP Tier 1  observed during 2015. We further assumed that modifications of  potentially eligible loans that were not 60 days delinquent and had two or  more risk factors would be split between HAMP Tier 1 and HAMP Tier 2  at a ratio of 50 percent and 50 percent (loans that are not 90 days-plus  delinquent are not eligible for Streamline HAMP) based on the split  between new HAMP modifications made during calendar year 2015.", "We then reduced the estimate of potentially at-risk eligible loans to  account for various exclusions or reasons that a loan modification may  not be offered.
