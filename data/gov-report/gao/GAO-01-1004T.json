Dramatic increases in computer interconnectivity, especially in the use of the Internet, are revolutionizing the way our government, our nation, and much of the world communicate and conduct business, bringing vast amounts of information and myriad resources and activities literally at our fingertips. However, along with the enormous benefits it brings, this widespread interconnectivity poses significant risks to our computer systems, and more important, to the critical operations and infrastructures they support.", "As with other organizations, Commerce relies extensively on computerized systems and electronic data to support its mission. Moreover, Commerce generates and disseminates some of the nation's most important economic information that is of paramount interest to U.S. businesses, policymakers, and researchers. Accordingly, the security of its systems and data is essential to avoiding disruption in critical operations, data tampering, fraud, and inappropriate disclosure of sensitive information. Further, there has be a dramatic rise in the number and sophistication of cyberattacks on federal information systems. My testimony today specifically focuses on the effectiveness of Commerce\u2019s (1) logical access controls and other information system controls over its computerized data, (2) incident detection and response capabilities,and (3) information security management program and related procedures.We reviewed Commerce\u2019s information security controls and currently have a draft report at Commerce for comment.", "At the seven Commerce organizations we reviewed, significant and pervasive computer security weaknesses exist that place sensitive Commerce systems at serious risk. Using readily available software and common techniques, we demonstrated the ability to penetrate sensitive Commerce systems from both inside Commerce and remotely, such as through the Internet. Individuals, both within and outside Commerce, could gain unauthorized access to these systems and read, copy, modify, and delete sensitive economic, financial, personnel, and confidential business data. Moreover, intruders could disrupt the operations of systems that are critical to the mission of the department. Additionally, unauthorized access to sensitive systems may not be detected in time to prevent or minimize damage. The underlying cause for the numerous weaknesses we identified was the lack of an effective program to manage information security.", "We identified vulnerabilities in four key areas in the bureaus we reviewed:", "First, controls intended to protect information systems and critical data from unauthorized access are ineffectively implemented, leaving sensitive systems highly susceptible to intrusions or disruptions. Specifically, \u2212  Systems were either not configured to require passwords\u2014including powerful systems administrator accounts\u2014or, if passwords were required, they were relatively easy to guess, such as the word \u201cpassword\u201d or commonly known default passwords supplied by vendors. Further, (1) a significant number of passwords never expired, (2) individuals had unlimited attempts to guess passwords, and (3) unencrypted passwords, including those having powerful system administrator functions, could be widely viewed. Commerce bureaus also granted excessive system administration privileges to employees who did not require them, including 20 individuals who had powerful system privileges that should be used only in exceptional circumstances, such as recovery from a power failure. \u2212  The configuration of Commerce operating systems exposed excessive amounts of system information to anyone, without the need for authentication, allowing potential attackers to collect systems information that could be used to circumvent security controls and gain unauthorized access. In addition, Commerce did not properly configure operating systems to ensure that they would be available to support bureau missions or prevent the corruption of important data. For example, in a large computer system affecting several bureaus, thousands of important programs had not been assigned unique names, which could result in unintended programs being inadvertently run, potentially corrupting data or disrupting system operations. In this same system, because critical parts of the operating system were shared by the test and production systems, changes in either system could corrupt or shut down the other system. Additionally, unnecessary and poorly configured system functions existed on important computer systems in all bureaus we reviewed, allowing us to gain access from the Internet. \u2212  None of the Commerce bureaus reviewed had effective external and internal network security controls. Our testing demonstrated that individuals, both within and outside Commerce, could compromise external and internal security controls to gain extensive unauthorized access to the department\u2019s networks and systems. We obtained such access as a result of weakly configured external control devices, poorly controlled dial-up modems, and ineffective internal network controls.", "Second, we found other control weaknesses, including inadequate (1) segregation of computer duties of the staff to mitigate the risk of errors or fraud, (2) control of software changes to ensure that only authorized and fully tested software is placed in operation, and (3) development of comprehensive and completed recovery plans to ensure the continuity of service in the event of a service disruption.", "Third, Commerce is not adequately (1) preventing intrusions before they occur, (2) detecting intrusions as they occur, (3) responding to successful intrusions, or (4) reporting intrusions to staff and management. Thus, there is little assurance that unauthorized attempts to access sensitive information will be identified and appropriate actions taken in time to prevent or minimize damage. For example, Commerce has not instituted key measures to prevent incidents, such as acquiring software updates to correct known vulnerabilities. During our testing we discovered 20 systems with known vulnerabilities for which patches were available but not installed. As a result of ineffective detection capabilities, the tested bureaus were generally unable to detect our extensive intrusion activities (only two of the bureaus had installed intrusion detection systems). Also, only one of the bureaus has established incident response procedures; in two of five instances when our activity was detected, Commerce employees who detected our testing inappropriately responded by launching attacks against our systems. Moreover, these two incidents were never reported to the bureaus\u2019 security officer.", "Fourth, and most important, Commerce does not have an effective departmentwide information security management program to ensure that sensitive data and critical operations are adequately addressed and that appropriate security controls are in place to protect them. Key issues include \u2212  Lack of a strong centralized management function to oversee and coordinate departmentwide security-related activities. At the time of our review, Commerce's CIO, who had broad responsibility for information security throughout the department, said that he believed that he did not have sufficient resources or the authority to implement this program. This lack of a centralized approach to managing security is particularly risky considering the widespread interconnectivity of Commerce's systems. \u2212  Widespread lack of risk assessment. Commerce is doing little to understand and manage risks to its systems. For example, as of March 2001, of the bureaus' 94 sensitive systems we reviewed, 91 did not have documented risk assessments, 87 had no security plans, and none were authorizedfor processing by Commerce management. Consequently, most of the bureaus' systems are being operated without considering the risks associated with their immediate environment. Moreover, several bureau officials acknowledged that they had not considered how vulnerabilities in systems that interconnected with theirs could undermine the security of their own systems. \u2212  Significantly outdated and incomplete information security policies. Commerce's information security policy, developed in 1993 and partially revised in 1995, does not reflect current federal requirements for managing computer security on a continuing basis, developing security plans, authorizing processing, providing security awareness training, or performing system reviews. Moreover, Commerce has not updated its policy to reflect the risks of Internet use and has no policies establishing baseline security requirements for all systems. For example, there is no policy specifying required attributes for passwords, such as minimum length and the inclusion of special characters. \u2212  Inadequately promoted security awareness and training.", "Although each of the seven bureaus reviewed have informal programs in place, none have documented computer security training procedures that meet federal requirements for ensuring that security risks and responsibilities are understood by all managers, users, and system administrators. \u2212  Lack of an ongoing program to test and evaluate security controls. No oversight reviews of the Commerce bureaus\u2019 systems have been performed by the staff of Commerce\u2019s information security program. Furthermore, the bureaus we reviewed do not monitor the effectiveness of their information security. Only one of the bureaus has performed isolated tests of its systems.", "The lack of an effective information security program is exacerbated by Commerce's highly interconnected computing environment in which the vulnerabilities of individual systems affect the security of systems in the entire department. A compromise in a single poorly secured system can undermine the security of the multiple systems that connect to it.", "In the last 2 years, the Commerce CIO introduced several initiatives to improve the security posture of the department, including a summary evaluation of information security based on bureau self-assessments and related follow-up. Also, in June 2001, after our fieldwork was completed, the Secretary of Commerce approved a high-level Commerce information technology (IT) restructuring plan. The acting CIO stated that Commerce is developing a more detailed implementation plan. Regardless of its particular approach, we have made recommendations that Commerce needs to implement in order to address the weaknesses in its information security controls.", "In the rest of my statement today, I will discuss in more detail the results of our review of Commerce\u2019s information security controls; these results are included in our draft report, which also contains more detailed recommendations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Information security is an important consideration for any organization that depends on information systems to carry out its mission.

The number of computer security incidents reported to the CERT Coordination Center\uf8e8 (CERT/CC) rose from 9,859 in 1999 to 21,756 in 2000. For the first 6 months of 2001, the number reported was 15,476.", "As the number of individuals with computer skills has increased, more intrusion or \u201chacking\u201d tools have become readily available and relatively easy to use. A potential hacker can literally download tools from the Internet and \"point and click\" to start a hack. According to a recent National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) publication, hackers post 30 to 40 new tools to hacking sites on the Internet every month. The successful cyber attacks against such well-known U.S. e- commerce Internet sites as eBay, Amazon.com, and CNN.com by a 15-year old \"script kiddie\" in February 2000 illustrate the risks. Without proper safeguards, these developments make it easier for individuals and groups with malicious intentions to gain unauthorized access to systems and use their access to obtain sensitive information, commit fraud, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other organizations\u2019 sites."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Systems Are At Risk", "paragraphs": ["incidents reported in 2000, which occurred at 32 agencies, resulted in what is known as a \u201croot compromise.\u201d For at least five of the root compromises, government officials were able to verify that access to sensitive information had been obtained.", "How well federal agencies are addressing these risks is a topic of increasing interest in the executive and legislative branches. In January 2000, President Clinton issued a National Plan for Information Systems Protection and designated computer security and critical infrastructure protection a priority management objective in his fiscal year 2001 budget. The new administration, federal agencies, and private industry have collaboratively begun to prepare a new version of the national plan that will outline an integrated approach to computer security and critical infrastructure protection.", "The Congress, too, is increasingly interested in computer security, as evidenced by important hearings held during 1999, 2000, and 2001 on ways to strengthen information security practices throughout the federal government and on progress at specific agencies in addressing known vulnerabilities. Furthermore, in October 2000, the Congress included government information security reform provisions in the fiscal year 2001 National Defense Authorization Act. These provisions seek to ensure proper management and security for federal information systems by calling for agencies to adopt risk management practices that are consistent with those summarized in our 1998 Executive Guide. The provisions also require annual agency program reviews and Inspector General (IG) evaluations that must be reported to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as part of the budget process.", "The federal CIO Council and others have also initiated several projects that are intended to promote and support security improvements to federal information systems. Over the past year, the CIO Council, working with NIST, OMB, and us, developed the Federal Information Technology Security Assessment Framework. The framework provides agencies with a self-assessment methodology to determine the current status of their security programs and to establish targets for improvement. OMB has instructed agencies to use the framework to fulfill their annual assessment and reporting obligations.", "Since 1996, our analyses of information security at major federal agencies have shown that systems are not being adequately protected. Our previous reports, and those of agency IGs, describe persistent computer security weaknesses that place a variety of critical federal operations at risk of inappropriate disclosures, fraud, and disruption. This body of audit evidence has led us, since 1997, to designate computer security as a governmentwide high-risk area.", "Our most recent summary analysis of federal information systems found that significant computer security weaknesses had been identified in 24 of the largest federal agencies, including Commerce. During December 2000 and January 2001, Commerce's IG also reported significant computer security weaknesses in several of the department's bureaus and, in February 2001, reported information security as a material weakness affecting the department's ability to produce accurate data for financial statements. The report stated that there were weaknesses in several areas, including entitywide security management, access controls, software change controls, segregation of duties, and service continuity planning. Moreover, a recent IG assessment of the department's information security program found fundamental weaknesses in the areas of policy and oversight. Also, the IG designated information security as one of the top ten management challenges for the department."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commerce Missions Are Diverse", "paragraphs": ["Commerce's missions are among the most diverse of the federal government's cabinet departments, covering a wide range of responsibilities that include observing and managing natural resources and the environment; promoting commerce, regional development, and scientific research; and collecting, analyzing, and disseminating statistical information. Commerce employs about 40,000 people in fourteen operating bureaus with numerous offices in the U.S. and overseas, each pursuing disparate programs and activities.", "IT is a critical tool for Commerce to support these missions. The department spends significant resources\u2014reportedly over $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2000\u2014on IT systems and services. As a percentage of total agency expenditures on IT, Commerce ranks among the top agencies in the federal government, with 17 percent of its $9-billion fiscal year 2000 budget reported as spent on IT.", "A primary mission of Commerce is to promote job creation and improved living standards for all Americans by furthering U.S. economic growth, and the seven bureaus we reviewed support this mission through a wide array of programs and services. Commerce uses IT to generate and disseminate some of the nation\u2019s most important economic information. The International Trade Administration (ITA) promotes the export of U.S. goods and services\u2014which amounted to approximately $1.1 trillion in fiscal year 2000. Millions of American jobs depend on exports, and with 96 percent of the world's consumers living outside U.S. borders, international trade is increasingly important to supporting this mission. The Economics and Statistics Administration (ESA) develops, prepares, analyzes, and disseminates important indicators of the U.S. that present basic information on such key issues as economic growth, regional development, and the U.S. role in the world economy. This information is of paramount interest to researchers, business, and policymakers.", "The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA), whose efforts supported sales of approximately $4.2 billion in fiscal year 1999, assists in stimulating the growth of U.S. exports while protecting national security interests by helping to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Sensitive data such as that relating to national security, nuclear proliferation, missile technology, and chemical and biological warfare reside in this bureau's systems.", "Commerce's ability to fulfill its mission depends on the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this sensitive information. For example, export data residing in the BXA systems reflect technologies that have both civil and military applications; the misuse, modification, or deletion of these data could threaten our national security or public safety and affect foreign policy. Much of these data are also business proprietary. If it were compromised, the business could not only lose its market share, but dangerous technologies might end up in the hands of renegade nations who threaten our national security or that of other nations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Commerce\u2019s IT Infrastructure Is Decentralized", "paragraphs": ["Commerce's IT infrastructure is decentralized. Although the Commerce IT Review Board approves major acquisitions, most bureaus have their own IT budgets and act independently to acquire, develop, operate, and maintain their own infrastructure. For example, Commerce has 14 different data centers, diverse hardware platforms and software environments, and 20 independently managed e-mail systems. The bureaus also develop and control their own individual networks to serve their specific needs. These networks vary greatly in size and complexity. For example, one bureau has as many as 155 local area networks and 3,000 users spread over 50 states and 80 countries. Some of these networks are owned, operated, and managed by individual programs within the same bureau.", "Because Commerce does not have a single, departmentwide common network infrastructure to facilitate data communications across the department, the bureaus have established their own access paths to the Internet, which they rely on to communicate with one another. In April 2001, the department awarded a contract for a $4 million project to consolidate the individual bureaus' local area networks within its headquarters building onto a common network infrastructure.

An information security manager, under the direction of the CIO's Office of Information Policy, Planning, and Review, is tasked with carrying out the responsibilities of the program. The CIO's responsibilities for the security of classified systems has been delegated to the Office of Security.", "In the last 2 years, the CIO introduced several initiatives that are essential to improving the security posture of the department. After a 1999 contracted evaluation of the bureaus' security plans determined that 43 percent of Commerce's most critical assets did not have current information system security plans, the CIO issued a memorandum calling for the bureaus to prepare security plans that comply with federal regulations. Also, in May 2000, the Office of the CIO performed a summary evaluation of the status of all the bureaus' information security based on the bureaus' own self-assessments. The results determined that overall information security program compliance was minimal, that no formal information security awareness and training programs were provided by the bureaus, and that incident response capabilities were either absent or informal. The Commerce IG indicated that subsequent meetings between the Office of the CIO and the bureaus led to improvements. The Office of the CIO plans to conduct another evaluation this year and, based on a comparison with last year's results, measure the bureaus\u2019 success in strengthening their security postures.", "Finally, for the past year, the CIO attempted to restructure the department's IT management to increase his span of control over information security within the bureaus by enforcing his oversight authority and involvement in budgeting for IT resources.

Organizations accomplish this objective by establishing controls that limit access to only authorized users, effectively configuring their operating systems, and securely implementing networks. However, our tests identified weaknesses in each of these control areas in all of the Commerce bureaus we reviewed. We demonstrated that individuals, both external and internal to Commerce, could compromise security controls to gain extensive unauthorized access to Commerce networks and systems. These weaknesses place the bureaus\u2019 information systems at risk of unauthorized access, which could lead to the improper disclosure, modification, or deletion of sensitive information and the disruption of critical operations.

As with many organizations, passwords are Commerce\u2019s primary means of authenticating user identity. Because system administrator capabilities provide the ability to read, modify, or delete any data or files on the system and modify the operating system to create access paths into the system, such capabilities should be limited to the minimum access levels necessary for systems personnel to perform their duties. Also, information can be protected by using controls that limit an individual\u2019s ability to read, modify, or delete information stored in sensitive system files.", "One of the primary methods to prevent unauthorized access to information system resources is through effective management of user IDs and passwords. To accomplish this objective, organizations should establish controls that include requirements to ensure that well-chosen passwords are required for user authentication, passwords are changed periodically, the number of invalid password attempts is limited to preclude password guessing, and the confidentiality of passwords is maintained and protected.", "All Commerce bureaus reviewed were not effectively managing user IDs and passwords to sufficiently reduce the risk that intruders could gain unauthorized access to its information systems to (1) change system access and other rules, (2) potentially read, modify, and delete or redirect network traffic, and (3) read, modify, and delete sensitive information. Specifically, systems were either not configured to require passwords or, if passwords were required, they were relatively easy to guess. For example, powerful system administrator accounts did not require passwords, allowing anyone who could connect to certain systems through the network to log on as a system administrator without having to use a password, systems allowed users to change their passwords to a blank password, completely circumventing the password control function, passwords were easily guessed words, such as \"password,\" passwords were the same as the user's ID, and commonly known default passwords set by vendors when systems were originally shipped had never been changed.", "Although frequent password changes reduce the risk of continued unauthorized use of a compromised password, systems in four of the bureaus reviewed had a significant number of passwords that never required changing or did not have to be changed for 273 years. Also, systems in six of the seven bureaus did not limit the number of times an individual could try to log on to a user ID. Unlimited attempts allow intruders to keep trying passwords until a correct password is discovered.", "Further, all Commerce bureaus reviewed did not adequately protect the passwords of their system users through measures such as encryption, as illustrated by the following examples:", "User passwords were stored in readable text files that could be viewed by all users on one bureau\u2019s systems.", "Files that store user passwords were not protected from being copied by intruders, who could then take the copied password files and decrypt user passwords. The decrypted passwords could then be used to gain unauthorized access to systems by intruders masquerading as legitimate users.", "Over 150 users of one system could read the unencrypted password of a powerful system administrator's account.", "System administrators perform important functions in support of the operations of computer systems. These functions include defining security controls, granting users access privileges, changing operating system configurations, and monitoring system activity. In order to perform these functions, system administrators have powerful privileges that enable them to manipulate operating system and security controls. Privileges to perform these system administration functions should be granted only to employees who require such privileges to perform their responsibilities and who are specifically trained to understand and exercise those privileges. Moreover, the level of privilege granted to employees should not exceed the level required for them to perform their assigned duties. Finally, systems should provide accountability for the actions of system administrators on the systems.", "However, Commerce bureaus granted the use of excessive system administration privileges to employees who did not require such privileges to perform their responsibilities and who were not trained to exercise them. For example, a very powerful system administration privilege that should be used only in exceptional circumstances, such as recovery from a power failure, was granted to 20 individuals. These 20 individuals had the ability to access all of the information stored on the system, change important system configurations that could affect the system\u2019s reliability, and run any program on the computer. Further, Commerce management also acknowledged that not all staff with access to this administrative privilege had been adequately trained.", "On other important systems in all seven bureaus, system administrators were sharing user IDs and passwords so that systems could not provide an audit trail of access by system administrators, thereby limiting accountability. By not effectively controlling the number of staff who exercise system administrator privileges, restricting the level of such privileges granted to those required to perform assigned duties, or ensuring that only well-trained staff have these privileges, Commerce is increasing the risk that unauthorized activity could occur and the security of sensitive information be compromised.", "Access privileges to individual critical systems and sensitive data files should be restricted to authorized users. Not only does this restriction protect files that may contain sensitive information from unauthorized access, but it also provides another layer of protection against intruders who may have successfully penetrated one system from significantly extending their unauthorized access and activities to other systems.

Another form of external threat is flooding a network with large volumes of access requests so that the network is unable to respond to legitimate requests, one type of denial-of- service attack. External threats can be countered by implementing security controls on the perimeters of the network, such as firewalls, that limit user access and data interchange between systems and users within the organization\u2019s network and systems and users outside the network, especially on the Internet. An example of perimeter defenses is only allowing pre-approved computer systems from outside the network to exchange certain types of data with computer systems inside the network.
