The 2012 AOA reflected additional trade-offs made among cost, schedule, risk, and performance. Some key performance requirements changed from the terminated VH-71 program to the VXX.", "Per the AOA, using this approach would reduce investment cost by approximately $1.5 billion (19.7 percent) and shorten the schedule by about 18 percent from the approach anticipated in 2010, which included more time and cost to develop technology within the program.", "DOD's Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation deemed the AOA sufficient to inform future acquisition decisions and the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics approved the program to move forward toward a decision to begin engineering and manufacturing development.

While the program reports that these efforts are on track and assesses the risks of integration as low, it is possible that key technologies may not be realized as planned or be as easy to integrate as anticipated. To mitigate integration risk, the Navy is making use of an integration laboratory and plans to demonstrate key technologies in a test aircraft.", "Building on these decisions, the program will have to manage challenges in a number of areas, including holding the line on VXX requirements, controlling helicopter weight growth, and ensuring that efforts to mitigate integration risks are adequately planned, resourced, and executed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report.

The Navy  subsequently began work to define a follow-on program, now known as  VXX, to acquire aircraft to replace the current presidential helicopters.  The Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011  directed that we review and report annually to the congressional defense  committees on the program beginning in 2011 and ending in 2013. We  have previously issued two reports in response to this requirement. In the  first, we identified major lessons learned from the terminated program that  should be applied in the follow-on program.

We  assessed the program\u2019s Analysis of Alternatives (AOA) report and  supporting materials against GAO identified factors that have affected the  scope and quality of AOAs in the past. We also reviewed and assessed  the AOA report and supporting materials against cost estimating and  analysis best practice standards. In addition, we discussed the AOA  report with the study team director and other study team staff. We also  compared the requirements for VXX to the requirements for the  terminated VH-71 program. However, because the VXX requirements  were not finalized until January 2013, we were unable to complete our  analysis of them during this review. To determine the status of DOD\u2019s  efforts to develop key technologies and capabilities for integration in VXX  aircraft, we obtained a list of ongoing and planned upgrades to the current  presidential helicopters and had the program office identify those  intended for use in the VXX platform. We reviewed documents related to  each upgrade, discussed those efforts with program officials, including  those responsible for the cockpit mission system and the aircraft\u2019s  avionics system, and analyzed those documents and the results of those  discussions to identify issues. We discussed the benefits and status of  each upgrade effort. We also discussed the risks associated with  maturing key technologies in time for insertion into the platform.

These aircraft have been in service for decades. The  events following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United  States highlighted the need for improved transportation, communication,  and security capabilities for the presidential helicopter fleet. As a result, a  program (subsequently designated the VH-71 program) was initiated in  April 2002 to develop aircraft to replace the helicopters currently in  service. Initial plans to field the VH-71 by 2011 were accelerated in  response to a November 2002 White House memorandum directing that  a replacement helicopter be fielded by the end of 2008. By 2009  significant cost growth, plus schedule delays and performance issues  resulted in the decision to terminate the VH-71 program. At the time of  termination, in June 2009, the estimated VH-71 program cost had  doubled from about $6.5 billion at development start in 2005 to $13  billion. Because there remained a need to replace the current in-service  presidential helicopters, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition Technology and Logistics (OUSD(AT&L)) directed the Navy  by late June 2009 to present a plan to develop options for a new program  to acquire replacement aircraft, now designated VXX.", "The Navy\u2019s VXX efforts began immediately with the initiation of an AOA to  assess options on how to proceed toward developing and fielding the  replacement presidential helicopter. It was focused, at least in part, on  one of the primary lessons learned from the VH-71 program experience\u2014 the need to establish and maintain a sound business case. A sound  business case is one in which a balance is established between  requirements, costs, and schedule that reflects an executable program  with acceptable risk. According to program officials, the program would  be aligned to pursue a best practices knowledge-based acquisition  approach with the intent of establishing and maintaining an affordable  business case.", "Last year, we reported that VXX program\u2019s entry into development had  been delayed as the program worked to provide a sound initial business  case for development, which is a best practice that was not followed by  the terminated VH-71 program. The Navy had produced an initial AOA  report under June 2010 study guidance from DOD\u2019s Office of Cost  Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE). This initial work presumed  an acquisition strategy under which the program would start in the  technology development phase of DOD\u2019s acquisition process. The Navy  released this initial AOA report to DOD. While CAPE found this initial  work sufficient, OUSD(AT&L) did not accept its results. Rather, it  identified the need for a 2012 update to address using a streamlined  acquisition strategy focused on mitigating cost drivers identified in the  2010 AOA study. Additional guidance was provided by the Office of the  Secretary of Defense (OSD) in December 2011. That guidance reflected  insights on requirements gained in the 2010 study and expectations of  using a streamlined acquisition approach proposed by the Navy. The  proposed approach would leverage mature technologies being developed  outside of the program before including them on aircraft selected for the  program with their adoption being facilitated by open systems  architectures. This would allow the program to start with Milestone B  approval for engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) and then  selecting an existing in-production commercial or military platform and  working to integrate communications and mission systems provided by  the government, which are expected to be mature by that time.

The 2012 updated study (focused on the most promising  aircraft) assessed that mature, certified, and capable in-production  commercial and military aircraft exist that can be modified for presidential  requirements and be procured under the proposed strategy using a  \u201cCustomized\u201d rather than a \u201cMin Mod\u201d approach. It determined that there  are candidate aircraft with performance characteristics that can meet to  varying degrees the February 2012 draft Capability Development  Document (CDD) requirements used to conduct the study and found that  the Navy\u2019s proposed streamlined acquisition strategy is feasible and  would reduce the program\u2019s expected schedule, cost, and risk.", "Specifically, the 2012 study estimates suggest that using the proposed  approach of having the program enter the acquisition process in the  engineering and manufacturing development phase rather than the  technology development phase, as was anticipated in the 2010 study,  would reduce investment cost by approximately $1.5 billion (19.7 percent)  and shorten the development schedule by about 18 percent. The 2012  study also revealed, however, that the alternatives offered varying  degrees of individual system performance with no single alternative  meeting all of the VXX requirements. For example, while one alternative  met most of the requirements, it would require strict weight and  requirements management throughout its life to avoid a more costly Min  Mod approach. While other alternatives provided differing capacities for  weight growth, they would be challenged in meeting other requirements,  such as range, transportability, landing zone suitability, or material  supportability requirements. Further, for all of the alternatives in the 2012  study, it was found that if they were required to meet the military\u2019s  airworthiness standards (as opposed to the certifying authority standard  they currently meet), the weight growth associated with meeting some of  these standards would likely trigger a more costly Min Mod approach.", "The 2012 VXX AOA study team made a number of recommendations  including:", "To mitigate aircraft certification risk, the airworthiness certifying  authority actively participate in all government development activities  for the cockpit, communications, and mission systems and be  involved in the source selection process for the aircraft;", "To reduce the risk of having to resort to a Min Mod approach, an  active and aggressive life cycle weight management effort should be  put in place if the selected platform does not provide a large enough  margin to accommodate future weight growth; and", "The release of a request for proposals be contingent upon achieving  acceptable technical maturity of critical government developments,  such as communications and mission systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AOA Accepted and VXX Program Approved to Proceed", "paragraphs": ["The Director of CAPE in a May 30, 2012, memorandum concluded that  the 2012 study achieves a logical outcome and was sufficient to inform  future acquisition decisions.

The study team assessed  effectiveness, suitability, technical, schedule, and operational risks  associated with the alternatives, though, according to CAPE, it did not  assess the risks of integrating government-furnished communications and  mission control systems into those alternatives. The study director noted  that this integration risk could not be assessed by the study team, given  the maturity of these subsystems at the time. Rather, the AOA identified  the need to consider this issue at a future engineering review when  sufficient maturity existed and an accurate assessment could be made.", "The AOA process reflected and influenced performance trade-offs. The  initial 2010 analysis was based on performance requirements that were  lower in a number of areas than for the VH-71 program. The 2012 AOA  study reflected additional trade-offs made with regard to cost, schedule,  risk and performance. The performance trade-offs enabled the Navy\u2019s  revised strategy, and is expected to result in reduced costs and schedule.  Following the 2012 study the performance requirements were further  refined as reflected in the final CDD. Table 1 illustrates some of the  performance trade-offs made by comparing the minimum requirements  for VXX aircraft as captured in the final CDD to the minimum VH-71  requirements captured in the equivalent Operational Requirements  Document for that program.", "We also assessed the cost estimating procedure for the AOA using  GAO\u2019s criteria for cost estimating and assessment and found that it was  substantially compliant with those criteria.

The cost estimating best  practices associated with each of those characteristics used in judging  the AOA are provided in appendix I.", "We found the AOA cost estimate to be comprehensive and well  documented. We also found that it was substantially accurate and  partially met our criteria for being credible. The AOA cost estimate was  properly adjusted for inflation, relied on historical analogous aircraft data,  contained no significant calculation errors, and had been recently updated  from the estimate contained in the 2010 study. While the documentation  stated that the estimate reflected most likely costs, it did not specifically  identify potential contingency costs and no cost risk analysis was  performed to determine a level of confidence for the cost estimate. As  result, we were unable to determine if the costs were indeed most likely.  In addition, the AOA cost estimate was deemed as having partially met  the best practices criteria for being credible as there was evidence that a  robust sensitivity analysis had been performed but not an independent  cost estimate or cost risk analysis.", "Although there was not a cost risk analysis, a detailed technical risk  assessment process was followed for identifying technical risks, their  likelihood of occurring, and the consequences if they occurred. The  technical risks were mitigated by incorporating costs into the cost  estimate through derivation of realistic and reasonable staffing levels and  sufficient schedule for design, development and testing of each  alternative. In addition, while an independent cost estimate had not been  conducted, the USD(AT&L)\u2019s August 28, 2012, acquisition decision  memorandum directs CAPE\u2019s completion of one prior to the Pre-EMD  Review. This is to occur in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. As a  result, the program could have confirmation of the AOA cost estimating  results at that point.

It dropped its planned use of this system. Adopting its use  would likely necessitate an airworthiness recertification of the platform  selected to be the VXX aircraft, a costly and time-consuming endeavor.
