Over  time, FAA has implemented efforts to address these issues, but as we  reported in July 2014,demand and its overall workload has increased. In 2013, FAA published a  detailed implementation plan for addressing the six certification process  recommendations, and, in January 2015, published a detailed  implementation plan for addressing the six regulatory consistency  recommendations.   they persist as FAA faces greater industry  As of April 2015, FAA has made progress in addressing the Certification  Process Committee\u2019s recommendations, but as we reported in January  2015, challenges remain that could affect successful implementation of  the recommendations. FAA is implementing its plan for addressing the 6  certification process recommendations, which involves completing 14  initiatives. According to an April 2015 update that FAA provided to us, 13  initiatives were completed or were on track to be completed, and one will  not meet planned milestones. Figure 2 illustrates the evolving status of the 14 initiatives based on the update reported by FAA.", "As figure 2 above indicates, 5 of the 14 certification process initiatives are  related to improving FAA\u2019s organization designation authorization (ODA)  program. As of April 2015, FAA had completed three of the five ODA- related certification process initiatives, while the remaining two are  expected to be completed by the end of 2015. In January 2015, we noted  that industry stakeholders had emphasized the need for FAA to expand  its use of the ODA program to better leverage its available resources in  other needed areas (e.g., staff and other resources for processing foreign  approval applications\u2014which will be discussed later in this statement).  For example, one aircraft manufacturer told us it is a practical necessity  for FAA to expand its ODA program to (1) better utilize private sector  expertise to keep pace with the growing aviation industry, (2) allow more  aerospace products to reach the market sooner, and (3) increase the  efficiency of the agency\u2019s scarce resources. According to the General  Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA), the key strength of ODA is  FAA\u2019s ability to delegate, at its discretion, certain certification activities  and test data reviews to qualified individuals or specific manufacturers\u2019  employees. In doing so, FAA can leverage its resources by delegating  more of the lower priority work during the certification process, thereby  enabling FAA to better concentrate its limited staff resources on the most  pressing aspects of certification projects. Another manufacturer noted that  without expanded use of the program by FAA, the additional cost  associated with maintaining an ODA has begun to outweigh the benefits  of having the authorization.", "As we found in July 2014, industry union representatives we spoke to  also reported concerns about the lack of FAA resources to effectively  expand the program.  While one labor union agreed with the concept of ODA, representatives had concerns related to expanding the program in  other areas because they contended that oversight of the program  required significant FAA resources. Furthermore, the representatives told  us that due to staffing shortages and increased workload, FAA did not  have enough inspectors and engineers to provide the proper surveillance  of the designees who had already been granted this authority. However,  as we reported in January 2015, it is too soon for us to determine whether  FAA\u2019s initiatives adequately address the recommendations as intended,  and in this case, specifically for expanding the use of the ODA program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FAA Has Developed Plans to Address Recommendations to Improve the Consistency of Its Regulatory Interpretations, but Progress Has Been Slow", "paragraphs": ["According to the January 2015 regulatory consistency implementation  plan, FAA closed two recommendations\u2014one as not implemented and  one as implemented in 2013\u2014and plans to complete the remaining 4 by  July 2016.

However, in that report, we also found  that challenges remain that could affect the successful implementation of  FAA\u2019s planned actions. Industry representatives continued to indicate a  lack of communication with and involvement of stakeholders as a primary  challenge for FAA in implementing the committees\u2019 recommendations,  particularly the regulatory consistency recommendations. However, FAA  noted that the processes for developing and updating its plans for  addressing the certification process and regulatory consistency  recommendations have been transparent and collaborative, and that FAA  meets regularly with industry representatives to continuously update them  on the status of the initiatives and for seeking their input. We also  reported in January 2015 that several industry representatives told us that  FAA had not effectively collaborated with or sought input from industry  stakeholders in the agency\u2019s efforts to address the two sets of  recommendations, especially the regulatory consistency  recommendations. For instance, some stakeholders reported that FAA  did not provide an opportunity for them to review and comment on the  certification process implementation plan updates, and did not provide an  opportunity for them to review and offer input on the regulatory  consistency implementation plan. However, FAA reported meeting with  various industry stakeholders in October 2014 to brief them on the  general direction and high-level concepts of FAA\u2019s planned actions to  address each regulatory consistency recommendation.", "Since we reported in January 2015, FAA officials met with stakeholders of  the Regulatory Consistency Committee in March 2015 to brief them and  further clarify the plan to implement the regulatory consistency  recommendations. According to FAA, they are planning to conduct  quarterly briefings with the Committee stakeholders, starting in June  2015, to provide updates on the progress for addressing the four  remaining recommendations. FAA officials also noted that while the  implementation plan lists a completion date of March 2016 for the  recommendation for developing the Master Source Guidance System\u2014 which FAA calls the Dynamic Regulatory System\u2014this completion date is  specifically for FAA\u2019s efforts to determine the feasibility of including Office  of Chief Counsel letters in the system. In terms of completing the  development of the system, the officials told us they are currently ahead  of the schedule outlined in the implementation plan and are working on  finalizing the design concept for the new system. Once this process is  completed, they would be able to provide a more accurate completion  date for deployment of the system.

Once U.S. aviation companies obtain a  type certificate from FAA to use an aviation product in the United States,  the companies often apply for approvals for the same products for use in  other countries. In 2012, the U.S. aerospace industry contributed $118.5  billion in export sales to the U.S. economy, with this sector remaining  strong in the European markets and growing in the emerging markets of  Asia and the Middle East. Some countries accept the FAA approval  outright as evidence that the product is safe for use in their country. Some  other countries, however, do not accept the FAA certification and conduct  their own approval processes for U.S. products, which can be lengthy,  according to some U.S. industry stakeholders. These stakeholders have  raised concerns that such practices provide no additional safety benefit  and result in U.S. companies facing uncertainty and costly delays in  delivering their products to foreign markets. FAA has taken steps to  address these concerns, but FAA\u2019s authority to address some of the  challenges is limited because each country retains control of its basic  regulatory framework for approving aviation products and ensuring the  safety of those products for use in their countries\u2014effectively a  recognition of the sovereignty of each country.", "As counterparts to FAA, other countries\u2019 civil aviation authorities\u2014which  we will refer to as foreign civil aviation authorities (FCAA)\u2014approve  domestically-manufactured aviation products for use in their respective  countries.

In our January 2015 statement, we identified  some efforts FAA is making to address these challenges, such as holding  regular meetings with some bilateral partners\u2014i.e., countries for which  FAA has a BASA in place\u2014and setting up forums in anticipation of issues  arising.", "Reported FCAA process challenges. Of the 15 companies we  interviewed, representatives from 12 companies reported mixed or  varied experiences with FCAAs\u2019 approval processes, and 3 reported  positive experiences. Thirteen companies reported challenges related  to delays, 10 reported challenges with approval process length, and 6  reported challenges related to FCAA staffs\u2019 lack of knowledge or  uncertainty about the approval processes, including FCAA requests  for data and information that, in the companies\u2019 views, were not  needed for approvals. FAA has taken actions aimed at alleviating  current and heading off future challenges related to foreign approval  processes. For example, in September 2014, FAA\u2014along with Brazil,  Canada, and the EU\u2014established a Certification Management Team  to provide a forum for addressing approvals and other bilateral  relationship issues. FAA also recently established a pilot program that  allows a U.S. company to work concurrently with multiple FCAAs for  obtaining approvals and to identify key FCAA approval needs and  ensure adequate FAA support.", "Reported issues related to some BASAs. Although representatives  from 11 of the 15 U.S. companies and the 3 foreign companies we  interviewed reported being satisfied with the overall effectiveness of  having BASAs in place or with various aspects of the current BASAs,  representatives of 10 U.S. companies reported challenges related to  some BASAs lacking specificity and flexibility, 2 raised concerns that  there is a lack of a formal dispute resolution process, and 1 noted a  lack of a distinction between approvals of simple and complex aircraft.", "Companies suggested several ways to address these issues,  including updating BASAs more often and making them clearer. FAA  has taken action to improve some BASAs to better streamline the  approval process that those countries apply to imported U.S. aviation  products. For instance, according to FAA officials, they meet regularly  with bilateral partners to address approval process issues and are  working with these partners on developing a common set of approval  principles and to add specific dispute resolution procedures in the  agreements with some countries. FAA officials also indicated that they  are working with longstanding bilateral partners\u2014such as Brazil,  Canada, and the EU\u2014to identify areas where mutual acceptance of  approvals is possible.", "Reported Challenges in Communicating with FCAAs. Representatives  from 12 U.S. companies reported challenges in communicating with  FCAAs. Representatives from six U.S. companies reported, for  example, that interactions with developing countries can be confusing  and difficult because of language and cultural issues. Representatives  from two companies noted that they hire local representatives as  consultants in China to help them better engage the Civil Aviation  Administration of China (CAAC) staff with their approval projects and  to navigate the CAAC\u2019s process. One company\u2019s representative also  reported having better progress in communications with FCAAs in  some Asian countries, such as India Japan, and Vietnam, when a  local \u201cthird-party agent\u201d (consultant) is involved because it provides a  better relationship with the FCAAs\u2019 staff. Representatives from three  companies also reported that, in general, some FCAAs often do not  respond to approval requests or have no back-ups for staff who are  unavailable. They noted that potential mitigations could include a  greater FAA effort to develop and nurture relationships with FCAAs.  According to FAA officials, they are working with the U.S.-China  Aviation Cooperation Program to further engage with industry and  Chinese officials.", "Reported Challenges Related to Foreign Approval Costs.", "Representatives from 12 of the 15 U.S. companies and 2 of the 3  foreign companies indicated challenges with regard to approval fees  charged by FCAAs. They specifically cited EASA\u2014the EU\u2019s  counterpart to FAA\u2014and the Federal Aviation Authority of Russia. For  example, they noted that EASA\u2019s fees are very high (up to 95 percent  of the cost of a domestic EASA certification)\u2014especially relative to  the amount levied by other FCAAs\u2014are levied annually, and are  unpredictable because of the unknown amount of time it takes for the  approval to be granted. The fees are based on the type of product  being reviewed for approval and can range from a few thousand  dollars to more than a million dollars annually. Representatives from  two companies also noted that EASA lacks transparency for how the  work it conducts to grant approvals aligns with the fees it levies for  recovering its costs. FAA officials indicated to us that a foreign  approval should take significantly less time and work to conduct than  the work required for an original certification effort\u2014roughly about 20  percent\u2014and that they have initiated discussions with EASA officials  about making a significant reduction in the fees charged to U.S.  companies. However, recently, FAA indicated that it is more important  to work with EASA to ensure its fees are commensurate with the  actual costs of the services being provided and those incurred by  EASA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Companies Also Reported FAA-Related Challenges, Which FAA Is Taking Actions to Address", "paragraphs": ["As mentioned previously, FAA provides assistance to U.S. companies by  facilitating the application process for foreign approvals of aviation  products. Although FAA seeks to provide an efficient process, companies  we interviewed for our January 2015 statement reported challenges that  they faced related to FAA\u2019s role in this process. FAA-related challenges  cited by the companies we interviewed fell into three main categories:  process, resources, and staff expertise.", "Process for facilitating foreign approvals. Most of the U.S. companies  in our selection (12 of 15) reported challenges related to FAA\u2019s  process for handling foreign approvals. These included concerns  about foreign approvals not being a high enough priority for FAA staff,  a lack of performance measures for evaluating BASAs, and an  insufficient use of FAA\u2019s potential feedback mechanisms. For  example, representatives of three companies told us that sometimes  FAA is delayed in submitting application packets to FCAAs because  other work takes priority; one of these companies indicated that  sometimes FAA takes several months to submit packets to FCAAs. In  another example, representatives of four companies cited concerns  that BASAs do not include any performance measures, such as any  expectations for the amount of time that it will take for a company\u2019s  foreign approval to be finalized. With regard to FAA using feedback  mechanisms to improve its process for supporting foreign approvals,  representatives of one company told us that applicant companies are  not currently asked for post-approval feedback by FAA, even though it  would be helpful in identifying common issues occurring with foreign  approvals.", "Available resources. Most of the U.S. companies in our selection (10  of 15) reported challenges related to the availability of FAA staff and  other resources. These include limited FAA travel funds and limited  FAA staff availability to process foreign approval applications.  According to FAA officials, FAA is responsible for defending the  original type certification and, more broadly, for handling any disputes  that arise with FCAAs during the foreign approval process. In doing  so, FAA is also responsible for working with an FCAA in an authority- to-authority capacity, and communications should flow through FAA to  the applicant company. However, representatives of five companies  noted that due to a lack of FAA travel funds, FAA staff are generally  not able to attend key meetings between U.S. companies and FCAAs  conducted at the beginning of the foreign approval process. These  representatives noted that this can complicate the process for  companies, which then have to take on a larger role in defending the  original type certificate issued for a product. Representatives of two  companies also noted that when there is limited FAA staff availability  at the time a foreign approval application is received, it contributes to  delays in obtaining their approvals. In fact, the Certification Process  Committee made recommendations to encourage FAA to include the  expansion of delegation in its efforts for improving the efficiency of its  certification process. As previously discussed, FAA does have  initiatives under way related to expanding the use of delegation, but  concerns continue to exist about the lack of FAA resources to  effectively do so.", "Staff expertise. Some of the U.S. companies in our selection (7 of 15)  reported issues related to FAA staff expertise. These issues cited  included limited experience on the part of FAA staff in dispute  resolution as well as limited expertise related to intellectual property  and export control laws. For example, representatives of three  companies told us that FAA staff sometimes lack technical knowledge  due to having little or no experience with some aviation products,  while a representative of another company argued that increased  training for FAA staff in dispute resolution could be very helpful,  especially for disputes involving different cultural norms. In another  example, representatives of two companies described situations in  which FAA staff were ready to share information with an FCAA that  the applicant company considered proprietary, until the company  objected and other solutions were found.", "In January 2015, we found that FAA has initiatives under way aimed at  improving its process for supporting foreign approvals that may help  address some of the challenges raised by the U.S. companies in our  review. Specifically, FAA\u2019s current efforts to increase the efficiency of its  foreign approval process could help address reported challenges related  to FAA\u2019s process and its limited staff and financial resources. For  example, FAA is planning to address its resource limitations by focusing  on improving the efficiency of its process with such actions as increasing  international activities to support U.S. interests in global aviation, and by  implementing its 2018 strategic plan, which includes the possibility of  allocating more resources to strengthening international relationships.  FAA has also initiated efforts to improve the robustness of its data on  foreign approvals, to further improve the efficiency of its process for  supporting these approvals. With more complete data, FAA aims to track  performance metrics, such as average timeframes for foreign approvals,  and to better evaluate its relationships with bilateral partners.", "As we concluded in January 2015, to its credit, FAA has made some  progress in addressing the Certification Process and Regulatory  Consistency Committees\u2019 recommendations, as well as in taking steps to  address challenges faced by U.S. aviation companies in obtaining foreign   It will be critically important for FAA to follow  approvals of their products.through with its current and planned initiatives to increase the efficiency  and consistency of its certification processes, and its efforts to address  identified challenges faced by U.S. companies in obtaining foreign  approvals. Given the importance of U.S. aviation exports to the overall  U.S. economy, forecasts for continued growth of aviation exports, and the  expected increase in FAA\u2019s workload over the next decade, it is essential  that FAA undertake these initiatives to ensure it can meet industry\u2019s future  needs. It is also important that FAA continue to demonstrate that it is  making progress on these important initiatives, as well as enhance its  data tracking for monitoring the effectiveness of its bilateral agreements  and partnerships.", "Going forward, we will monitor FAA\u2019s progress, highlight the key  challenges that remain, and identify potential steps that FAA and industry  can take to find a way forward on the issues covered in this statement as  well as other issues facing the industry.
