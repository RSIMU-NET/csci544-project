Key factors that tribes reported considering were the (1) importance of tribal sovereignty, (2) financial matters such as the timeliness with which they receive funds, (3) the level of support they anticipated receiving from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and (4) their own emergency management capacity. For example, survey results showed that tribal officials' confidence in their capacity to manage the declaration was a key factor in determining whether to make a request directly. Specifically, various elements of emergency management capacity, as illustrated below, could affect tribes' ability to manage a declaration.", "FEMA has developed pilot guidance for tribal declarations and solicited comments from tribes, as part of its effort to consider the needs of tribes and develop regulations. According to FEMA officials, they are currently assessing the effectiveness of policies and procedures based on data collected from tribal declarations since the passage of SRIA. These officials said they intend to begin the rulemaking process as soon as 2 years into the pilot, but may delay if they cannot collect enough data about different disaster situations during that time to conduct a complete analysis. Until the regulations are final, officials say they will exercise flexibility whenever possible.

Prior to 2013, to receive  disaster assistance, tribes had to join a major disaster request made by  the governor of the state in which the tribe is geographically located. The  2013 amendments to the Stafford Act allow the chief executive of an  affected tribal government to make a direct request for a major disaster  declaration or join a state\u2019s request for a major disaster declaration. When  making this decision, tribal officials have to consider whether they have  the ability to meet the federal requirements for managing the disaster  assistance independent of the state, if approved. The 2013 amendments  also direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to issue  regulations to carry out these changes and, as part of this process, to  consider the unique conditions that affect the general welfare of tribal  governments.", "A major disaster declaration activates numerous assistance programs  from FEMA to assist a state or tribal government in its response and  recovery efforts.

FEMA is  also the primary federal agency responsible for administering assistance  to aid recovery efforts after a disaster has been declared.", "This report examines (1) the factors that influence selected tribes\u2019  decisions about how to seek federal assistance through a major disaster  declaration, and (2) the actions FEMA has taken to help tribes exercise  the new authority.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed FEMA\u2019s pilot guidance for  tribal disaster declarations that was published in January 2017, as well as  federal regulations and statutes governing the major disaster declaration  process. We also reviewed emergency management-related documents  provided by tribal governments. We interviewed experts from tribal  emergency management organizations and officials from FEMA to  compile a list of factors that may have influenced a tribe\u2019s decision to  make a direct request or join a state\u2019s request as a sub-recipient. We  used that list to form the basis of a survey designed to collect information  about the factors that influenced whether a tribe used the new authority or  pursued disaster assistance under a state declaration. The survey  questions asked tribal officials to identify whether a particular factor was a  major factor, a minor factor, or not a factor at all in their decisions to make  a direct request or to join a state\u2019s request. We sent our survey to all 36  tribal governments that either (1) received disaster relief funds through a  direct request, (2) received disaster relief funds as a sub-recipient of a  state\u2019s request, or (3) made a direct request that was denied from  January 2013 through December 2016. This time period coincides with  the first year after SRIA was enacted to the most recently completed  calendar year in which full data on declarations were available at the time  we were planning our survey and site visit administration. Officials from  23 of the 36 tribes responded to our survey.", "To report on FEMA pre-disaster grant funds select tribes received during  this period, we collected grant data from FEMA Grants Program Division.  To assess the reliability of these data, we performed electronic data  testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, and interviewed  agency officials knowledgeable about the collection and processing of  these data. We determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of reporting the grant funds obligated from 2013 through 2016.", "In addition, we conducted site visits to 7 tribes selected from the 23 tribes  that responded to our survey in order to obtain tribal officials\u2019 views on  factors influencing their disaster declaration decisions during this period  and to observe recent disaster damages, ongoing recovery projects, and  aspects of each tribe\u2019s emergency management capability. We selected  these sites so that as a set they included tribes that made a direct request  whether granted or denied, joined a state declaration, and were located in  a variety of FEMA regions.

We  interviewed representatives from two national tribal organizations to  discuss any successes and issues with the new authority that had been  reported by their constituents. In addition, during our seven site visits, we  gathered testimonial evidence of successes and challenges each tribe  faced in implementing the new authority and carrying out the various  requirements associated with requesting and managing a major disaster  declaration directly or as a sub-recipient to a state declaration.

They are:  Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG). The purpose of  EMPG is to help build and sustain core emergency management  capabilities. EMPG is particularly important for building the capacity to  declare and manage a disaster, because it is the primary federal program  for which salaries and training for emergency management personnel is  an allowable expense. Only states and U.S. territories are eligible to  receive EMPG funds directly. According to FEMA officials, after states  receive EMPG funds, they make determinations about whether and under  what conditions to provide the funds to tribes and local governments  within their geographical boundaries. However, according to officials, not  all states will distribute EMPG funds to tribes.", "State Homeland Security Program (SHSP). The purpose of SHSP is to  help states and U.S. territories prevent, prepare for, protect against, and  respond to acts of terrorism and otherwise reduce overall risk.

For example, in  instances where the state\u2019s request for a major disaster declaration has  been denied, tribes now have the option to request disaster assistance  directly as a result of this new authority.", "This factor was also of practical importance for tribes with reservations  located in more than one state or county. During our site visit interviews,  officials from one tribe said it was a challenge to manage multiple state  bureaucracies when the reservation spans multiple states. In some  cases, portions of a reservation may not receive disaster assistance if  one state\u2014or county\u2014did not request or receive a major disaster  declaration. Officials from 5 tribes we visited said they prefer making  direct requests because of the government-to-government relationship  with the United States, and because working through the state as an  intermediary impinged on their sovereignty. An official from one small  rural tribe said that the tribe currently does not have the capacity to make  a direct request but is taking the steps to do so in the future because it is  important to their tribal sovereignty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Tribal officials responding to our survey and interview questions reported  that the potential to receive additional assistance from states to pay the  non-federal cost share might influence them to join a state\u2019s request.  Conversely, the timeliness of reimbursement and the potential to receive  administrative costs and HMGP grants might be factors in deciding to  make a direct request.", "Eight out of 13 respondents that received disaster assistance only as a  sub-recipient of a state reported that they had concerns about paying the  required nonfederal cost-share. When managing disaster assistance  grants as a direct recipient, a tribal government is solely responsible for  the entire nonfederal cost share. On the other hand, if the tribe is a sub- recipient to a state request, the tribe may have a lighter financial burden  since several states offer partial or full nonfederal cost share assistance  to their local and tribal sub-recipients. For example, officials from one  tribe said that there is a strong financial incentive to join a state\u2019s request  because the state reimburses the tribal government\u2019s half of the cost  share.", "In addition, some tribes may face financial hardship with the startup cost  for recovery projects because PA and HMGP are reimbursement  programs. For example, one tribal official said that it is especially  difficult for small, rural, non-gaming tribes to find the financial capital to  initiate recovery and hazard mitigation projects. While some tribes may  have the money set aside for this purpose or may be able to secure loans  to begin projects like the one illustrated in figure 5, other tribes are unable  to start certain internal processes until the FEMA funds have been  obligated. At a minimum, recipients have to present a scope of work before they can receive funds, the preparation of which usually requires  the services of engineers or other technical experts. Therefore, the  timeliness of the reimbursements, especially when the tribe is a sub- recipient under a state request, can result in financial challenges. For  example, one tribal official we interviewed said that it takes much longer,  on average, to request and receive reimbursement for recovery projects  when the tribe has to submit the request through the state. Conversely,  the official noted that reimbursement processes are typically much  quicker when working directly with FEMA.", "During our site visit interviews, officials from one tribe told us that they  prefer to make direct requests so they could receive HMGP funds to  make decisions about the hazard mitigation projects on their reservation.  Generally, as a direct recipient, a state or tribe will receive HMGP funding  based on a percentage, usually 15 percent, of the total amount of PA and  IA funds received for the disaster recovery. HMGP funds can be used for  eligible hazard mitigation projects or to create or renew hazard mitigation  plans. Under a state declaration, the state receives these funds and can,  at its discretion, use them anywhere within its boundaries for eligible  projects. According to officials from one tribe, they can ensure they  receive the total amount of HMGP funds to use on hazard mitigation  projects within their own jurisdiction when they are a direct recipient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA\u2019s Policies, Guidance, and Technical Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Tribal officials\u2019 confidence in the level of support they expected to receive  from FEMA influenced their decision whether to make a direct request or  to join a state.

Conversely, eight of the 13  tribes that only joined a state request reported that concern about FEMA\u2019s  policies and requirements being clear enough to seek a direct request  was a factor in their decision to join a state request.", "During our site visit interviews, officials from 2 tribes discussed  challenges they have experienced with FEMA\u2019s policies and requirements  for estimating IA-related damages. Applicants for IA, including owners  and renters, must be able to prove they occupied the damaged dwelling,  pre-disaster, as their primary residence before receiving assistance.  However, according to tribal officials, many homeowners on reservations  do not possess formal deeds to their home or do not carry insurance,  making it difficult for FEMA to ensure that potential recipients of the IA  funds meet the requirements of the program. According to FEMA officials,  the agency has attempted to be flexible during the pilot phase of the tribal  declarations program. For example, FEMA officials in one region told us  that they would accept a tribal government\u2019s declaration of home  ownership in lieu of a formal deed. FEMA officials told us they will  continue to evaluate how issues of homeownership will be adjudicated.", "In addition, during our site visit interviews, officials from 3 tribes discussed  various types of difficulty with completing and maintaining the paperwork  associated with recovery projects. For example, officials from a tribe  stated that they are not equipped to manage and comply with processes  such as permit requirements or federal procurement procedures and as a  result are currently seeking to hire a full time emergency manager.  Throughout the life of a major disaster declaration, tribal officials are  required to maintain paperwork to document the recovery projects, which  can require both physical and electronic recordkeeping systems, space,  time, and expertise. For example, figure 6 below shows an example of the  volume of paperwork needed to support and close out the recovery  projects associated with a landslide in Washington State, according to the  tribal and state officials involved.", "Nine of 10 tribes responding to our survey that were awarded a direct  disaster declaration reported that a factor (six major and three minor) in  their decision making was their determination that the availability of timely  and accurate assistance from FEMA would help them successfully  manage the request process. For tribes that only joined state requests,  fewer tribes reported that concerns about receiving timely and accurate  technical assistance affected their decisions than those that had concerns  about the clarity of FEMA\u2019s policy and guidance. Four of the 13 total  tribes that only joined a state declaration cited concerns about having  access to technical assistance as a factor (one called it a major and three  deemed it minor).", "Damage Assessments  After a disaster occurs, the first step in the  declaration process is for the tribe to conduct  an assessment of the impacts of the disaster  to determine if there are needs that cannot be  addressed with tribal resources or through  insurance. Using this assessment\u2014known as  an initial damage assessment\u2013-a tribal  government can determine what, if any, needs  or damages are eligible for FEMA disaster  assistance. If a tribe determines that such  needs or damages are beyond its capabilities  to address with its own resources or  insurance, the next step is to request a Joint  Preliminary Damage Assessment (Joint PDA)  from their FEMA Regional Administrator so  that FEMA and the tribe can go through a  process of reaching agreement about what  damages and needs are eligible.", "According to FEMA officials, the agency has assigned staff as dedicated  Regional Tribal Liaisons (RTL) in all FEMA regional offices. RTLs help  tribes maintain awareness of various program requirements, including  those for conducting damage assessments and submitting requests for  major disaster declarations. RTLs accomplish this role by connecting  tribes with FEMA subject matter experts, who help tribes navigate the  major disaster declaration processes and programs.

While states have had decades to develop the emergency management  capacity needed to request and administer federal disaster assistance,  tribes have had the opportunity to apply directly for federal disaster  assistance since the passage of SRIA in 2013. Developing and  maintaining such a capacity requires, among other things, having in- house knowledge or the ability to contract for (or otherwise access)  specialized expertise to navigate through complex planning and  processes.", "Multiple officials from tribes we interviewed and surveyed reported  challenges building and maintaining emergency management capacity  that affected their ability to make direct requests for, and manage the  recovery effort associated with, a major disaster declaration.", "Specifically, 9 of 10 tribes responding to our survey that made a direct  request said determining that their tribes had the emergency  management capacity to successfully manage the major disaster  declaration request process was a factor (6 identified it as minor, 3 as  major). Conversely, 7 of the 13 tribes responding to our survey that only  joined a state request said determining that they did not have the  emergency management capacity to successfully manage the major  disaster declaration request process was a factor in their decisions (4  identified as major, 3 as minor). As with the capacity to handle the  declaration process, determining whether the tribe had the capacity to  manage the recovery process, as illustrated in figure 7, also affected  decision making.

When making a  direct request for a major disaster declaration,  a tribal government must have a Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)- approved Tribal Mitigation Plan that meets the  requirements in 44 C.F.R. \u00a7 201.7 before  receiving FEMA disaster assistance funds  under certain programs. If electing to be a  sub-recipient under a state\u2019s major disaster  declaration request, the tribal government  may be eligible to receive disaster assistance  funds through the state without having a Tribal  Mitigation Plan.", "A tribal emergency management consultant who works with several tribes  in one of the areas where we conducted site visits told us that the lack of  a FEMA-approved tribal hazard mitigation plan limits the ability of many of  these tribes to receive disaster funding. A hazard mitigation plan is  required prior to a recipient being able to receive PA permanent work or  HMGP. As of December 2017, 143 out of 567 tribes had a FEMA- approved Tribal Mitigation Plan, according to FEMA. In addition, the  consultant reported that some tribes also lacked a designated emergency  manager and hiring one may be unaffordable or in some cases, the  applicants lack qualifications. For another tribe, the designated  emergency manager had several job titles, including the tribe\u2019s first  responder and fire chief, which the official said makes it difficult to  dedicate the time required to hone the skills necessary to manage the  FEMA declaration processes. The official recounted an attempt to  develop a hazard mitigation plan that at the time of our interview was still  incomplete due, in part, to the complexity of the FEMA guidelines. In such  cases, tribes may need to hire a specialist to assist with this  administrative requirement, but may not have the budget to do so.", "Another challenge tribal officials identified is that tribes face barriers to  accessing federal pre-disaster funding that could help them build capacity  to manage post-disaster grants following a successful declaration  request. During our site visit interviews, officials from two tribes told us  they have considered seeking federal grant opportunities to help enhance  emergency management capacity, but the eligibility requirements, such  as the requirement to be near designated critical infrastructure or within  100 miles of the border, for the tribal homeland security grants program  precluded them from applying.

According to the FEMA and tribal officials we spoke with, as  well as grant data provided by FEMA, tribes receive relatively low  amounts of EMPG funding (see table 1 below) through the states. Tribes  are not eligible to apply directly to FEMA for EMPG funds. In addition,  according to tribal officials, when tribes apply to states for EMPG funds,  the states can impose conditions that impinge on tribal sovereignty. For  example, one state requires tribes to waive their legal immunity and agree  to follow state laws, which some tribal officials viewed as contradictory to  their sovereignty. As a result, these officials said they choose not to apply  for these grants through the states and have never received EMPG funds.", "FEMA officials acknowledged that tribes face challenges getting federal  grant funds to help them enhance their emergency management capacity.  According to the officials there are statutory, policy, and budget  considerations that limit their ability to make significant changes in the  way such grant funds are distributed.

In the meantime, according to these  officials, their aim is to be as flexible as possible while maintaining  consistency with other relevant disaster regulations, so that they can  respond to any unique challenges that arise in implementing this new  authority.", "In addition to assessing how the pilot is working for tribes, FEMA has  developed and implemented training to help tribes understand the  disaster declaration process and provided technical assistance to tribes  as needed, prior to, during, and after disasters. FEMA has offered  training opportunities at the Emergency Management Institute in  Emmitsburg, Maryland, and has hosted regional training workshops and  consultations throughout the country. According to tribal officials, these  training courses have helped increase tribes\u2019 emergency management  expertise. One of the offerings, Tribal Declarations Pilot Guidance, was a  1-hour briefing offered in multiple locations and provided to dozens of  tribes and other government agencies. In addition, FEMA has RTLs in  each regional office that are a primary point of contact for tribal  governments that have questions or require technical assistance on  FEMA programs. Officials from one tribe we visited told us they believe  the technical assistance they received from a FEMA RTL was timely and  thorough. These officials said the tribe contacted FEMA for assistance  following the Tribal Council\u2019s decision to declare a state of emergency on  the reservation. According to the tribal officials, a fire had started on a  Sunday and the FEMA team was on-site at the reservation by  Wednesday to conduct a joint preliminary damage assessment with tribal  officials. The officials also said they were impressed with FEMA\u2019s quick  response on the damage assessment results, which they received within  a week. The tribe did not ultimately request a major disaster declaration  because the damage assessment fell short of the minimum damage  amount at that time. However, officials from the tribe said the experience  they gained was helpful for the tribe\u2019s emergency management staff and  that they are now confident they will be able to conduct an initial damage  assessment should a future disaster occur."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Homeland Security  and FEMA for review and comment.

We also interviewed  officials from two national tribal organizations (the National Congress of  American Indians and the National Tribal Emergency Management  Council) and FEMA to develop a preliminary list of potential factors that  may influence a tribe\u2019s decision to make a direct request or to join a  state\u2019s request as a sub-recipient. Using these factors, we developed a  survey with both closed and open-ended questions. To minimize non- response error, we pre-tested the survey instrument with officials from  two tribes in FEMA Regions VI and X (see figure 1) to ensure the  questions were clear and unbiased and that the survey questions were  culturally appropriate. We also consulted tribal officials during a FEMA  training course and held additional interviews with officials from tribal  organizations to ensure that the questions were clear, understandable,  and appropriate. An independent reviewer within our agency also  reviewed a draft of the survey prior to the pre-tests. We made appropriate  revisions to the content and format of the questionnaire based on the  pretests and independent review.", "We sent our survey to the 36 tribal governments that either (1) received  declaration funds through a direct request,  (2) received declaration  funds as a sub-recipient of a state\u2019s request, or (3) made a direct request  that was denied between January 2013 and December 2016.The time  period we chose coincides with the year SRIA was enacted to the most  recent calendar year in which a full year of data on major disaster  declarations was available when we began this work. Using e-mail  addresses provided by FEMA Regional offices, we emailed the survey in  an attached document that respondents could complete electronically or  by hand and return via email or mail. We sent an invitation letter to the  tribes on July 12, 2017, informing them of the purpose of the survey and  the date it would be sent. We then sent the survey on July 18, 2017 and  began soliciting survey responses from August 7, 2017 until January 12,  2018, by phone and email. We received completed surveys from 23 of the  36 tribes in the target population. We compared selected characteristics  of the tribes responding to the survey with the same characteristics of the  36 tribes in the target population, as well as the completion of individual  questions, and did not find a nonresponse bias. The final survey  questionnaire is in appendix III.", "To complement the survey responses, we conducted site visits to 7 tribes  selected from among the 23 tribes that responded to our survey. The  objectives of these site visits were to obtain added information from the  tribal officials regarding the factors influencing their disaster declaration  decisions during this period. We also observed recent disaster damage;  ongoing recovery projects; and aspects of each tribe\u2019s emergency  management capability. We selected these various sites so that, as a set,  they included a mixture of tribes that had participated in direct  declarations; in state declarations as a sub-recipient; participated in  declarations that were granted and denied; and were located in different  FEMA regions. The selected tribes are located in Arizona, New Mexico,  Washington, and Idaho, representing FEMA Regions VI, VIII, IX, and X.  During our site visits, we interviewed tribal executives and emergency  management officials and toured completed projects. Although the  information gathered from our survey and site visits cannot be  generalized across the tribes, our observations and the tribal officials\u2019  responses underscored the uniqueness of each tribe and each disaster,  as well as offering important details regarding the opportunities and  challenges for tribes under this new authority.", "To report on related FEMA grant funds obligated from 2013 through 2016,  we collected data regarding the Homeland Security Grant Program, Tribal  Homeland Security Grant Program, Emergency Management  Performance Grant, and the Pre Disaster Mitigation grant data from  FEMA Grants Program Division officials. We selected these programs  because they provide pre-disaster grant funds to states and tribes that  are, in part, intended to enhance grantees emergency management  capacity. To assess the reliability of these data, we performed electronic  data testing for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness, and  interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the collection and  processing of these data. We determined these data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of reporting FEMA\u2019s awards of these grant  funds.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed federal documentation\u2014 such as FEMA\u2019s Tribal Declarations Pilot Guidance, federal regulations  and statutes governing the major disaster declaration process to see what  actions FEMA has taken specifically related to tribe\u2019s requesting and  managing major disaster declarations. We also reviewed disaster-related  documentation provided by tribal governments and available on-line,  including correspondence between tribes and FEMA, testimony  statements, and additional documents that provided details of tribes\u2019  experiences requesting and managing major disaster declarations. In  addition, we interviewed officials from the two aforementioned national  tribal organizations to discuss any successes or challenges they were  familiar with related to the new authority that allows tribes to request a  major disaster declaration directly from the President of the United States.  During our interviews with tribal organizations and tribal officials, we  examined challenges related to implementing the new authority and  carrying out the various requirements associated with requesting and  managing a major disaster declaration.", "We also interviewed FEMA officials about the actions they had taken to  help tribes make informed decisions about whether they would prefer to  exercise the new authority. In addition, we interviewed FEMA officials  about how they assisted tribes that were considering whether to exercise  the new authority and how to do so, if desired, as well as what, if any,  steps they had taken to address the challenges identified by tribes. For  example, we discussed what actions FEMA has taken to assess the pilot  program, offer training opportunities, and provide technical assistance to  tribes that seek to enhance their emergency management capacity. We  also attended a tribal emergency management conference in June 2017,  attended a FEMA tribal emergency management training session in  person in March 2017, and attended two FEMA-sponsored webinars  designed specifically for tribal participants.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2016 through May  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
