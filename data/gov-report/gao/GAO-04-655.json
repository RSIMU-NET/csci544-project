Most require guardians to submit periodic reports, but do not specify court review of these reports. Interstate jurisdictional issues sometimes arise when states do not recognize guardianships originating in other states. Most courts responding to our survey did not track the number of active guardianships, and few indicated the number of incapacitated elderly people under guardianship. Four courts recognized by members of the National Guardianship Network as having exemplary guardianship programs devote staff to strong programs for guardianship training and oversight. Three of these courts offer training to guardians even though state law does not require it. Three also have programs in which volunteers or social work student interns visit people under guardianship and report on their condition. Although state courts and federal agencies are responsible for protecting many of the same incapacitated elderly people, they generally work together only on a case-by-case basis. Some courts send notices of guardianship to the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration, but generally coordination among federal agencies and courts is not systematic. Federal agencies and courts do not systematically notify other agencies or courts when they identify someone as incapacitated, or when they discover that a guardian or a representative payee is abusing the incapacitated person. This lack of coordination may leave incapacitated people without the protection of responsible guardians and representative payees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As people age, some of them become incapable of caring for themselves  and must rely on a guardian\u2014a person or entity appointed to make  decisions for them. In the United States, the number of people requiring a  guardian is expected to increase considerably in the years ahead. The  number of elderly people (those aged 65 and older) is expected to increase  substantially over the next several decades, and the number of people  aged 85 and older is expected to triple by 2040 to 15 million. The Census  Bureau estimates that about one-quarter of the people in this older age  group has Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which may lead to dementia that is severe  enough that people become incapable of caring for themselves. Generally,  adults are identified as incapacitated when they become physically or  mentally incapable of making or communicating important decisions, such  as those required in handling finances or securing possessions. In many  cases, incapacitated adults are elderly, but in many other cases they are  not, and generally the same laws and procedures apply to all incapacitated  adults. Often, family members can provide assistance, but sometimes a  state or local court needs to appoint a guardian to act on behalf of the  incapacitated person. The guardian becomes responsible for making  decisions to protect the incapacitated person from financial and physical  abuse or neglect, and the incapacitated person loses decision-making  rights.", "Although guardianship is a state responsibility, there are many  incapacitated elderly people who receive federal benefits, and this group  of people may need federal agencies to identify a representative payee\u2014a  person or organization designated to handle those benefits on their behalf.  State and local courts are responsible for oversight of guardianship  appointments, and federal agencies are responsible for oversight of  representative payees. Courts and federal agencies have identified  instances in which guardians or representative payees have taken  advantage of incapacitated elderly people by, for example, stealing from  them or billing for services not provided. Such cases of abuse and neglect  of elders by guardians and representative payees have prompted questions  about the oversight of these programs.", "As part of your committee\u2019s focus on aging issues, you asked us to study  guardianships for the elderly and the representative payee programs of  federal agencies such as the Social Security Administration (SSA), the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), which manages retirement programs for federal  employees. In response to your request, we examined: (1) what state  courts do to ensure that guardians fulfill their responsibilities, (2) what  exemplary guardianship programs do to ensure that guardians fulfill their  responsibilities, and (3) how state courts and federal agencies work  together to protect incapacitated elderly people. To study these topics, we  reviewed state statutes and conducted surveys of courts responsible for  guardianships in the three states with the largest elderly populations\u2014 California, Florida, and New York. Forty-two of 58 courts in California,   55 of 67 courts in Florida, and 9 of 12 judicial districts in New York  responded to our surveys. We also visited courts in eight states and  interviewed officials responsible for representative payee programs at  SSA, VA, and OPM and officials at the Department of Health and Human  Service\u2019s Administration on Aging. In addition, we visited 4 courts  identified by members of the National Guardianship Network (a joint  council representing eight national organizations involved in guardianship  issues) as having exemplary guardianship programs. We conducted our  work between March 2003 and May 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

In addition, while  some incapacitated adults may have family members who can assume  responsibility for their decision-making, many elderly incapacitated people  do not. The Census Bureau predicts that in the future the elderly  population will be more likely to live alone and less likely to have family  caregivers. In situations such as these, additional measures may be  necessary to ensure that incapacitated people are protected from abuse  and neglect.", "Several arrangements can be made to protect the elderly or others who  may become incapacitated. A person may prepare a living will, write  advance health care directives, and appoint someone to assume durable  power of attorney, or establish a trust. However, such arrangements may  not provide sufficient protection. Some federal agencies do not recognize  durable powers of attorney for managing federal benefits. SSA, for  example, will assign a representative payee for an incapacitated person if  it concludes that the interest of the incapacitated beneficiary would be  served, whether or not the person has granted someone else power of  attorney. In addition, many states have surrogacy healthcare decision- making laws, but these alternatives do not cover all cases. Additional  measures may be needed to designate legal authority for someone to make  decisions on the incapacitated person\u2019s behalf.", "To provide further protection for both elderly and non-elderly  incapacitated adults, state and local courts appoint guardians to oversee  their personal welfare, their financial well being, or both. The  appointment of a guardian typically means that the person loses basic  rights, such as the right to vote, sign contracts, buy or sell real estate,  marry or divorce, or make decisions about medical procedures. If an  incapacitated person becomes capable again, by recovering from a stroke,  for example, he or she cannot dismiss the guardian but, rather, must go  back to court and petition to have the guardianship terminated.", "The federal government does not regulate or provide any direct support  for guardianships, but courts may decide that the appointment of a  guardian is not necessary if a representative payee has already been  assigned to an incapacitated person by a federal agency. Representative  payees are entirely independent of court supervision unless they also  serve their beneficiary as a court-appointed guardian. Guardians are  supervised by state and local courts and may be removed for failing to  fulfill their responsibilities. Representative payees are supervised by  federal agencies, although each federal agency with representative payees  has different forms and procedures for monitoring them.", "Each state provides a process for initiating and evaluating petitions for  guardianship appointment. Generally, state laws require that a petition be  filed with the court and notice be provided to the alleged incapacitated  person and other people with a connection to the person. In nearly all  states, the alleged incapacitated person is granted the right to be present  at the hearing, and the right to counsel. Most states require clear and  convincing evidence of a person\u2019s incapacity before a guardian can be  appointed. The court may appoint a family member, friend, attorney, a  paid private professional, a nonprofit social service agency, or a local  public agency to serve as the guardian.", "In many cases, both courts and federal agencies have responsibilities for  protecting incapacitated elderly people, as shown in figure 1. For federal  agencies, a state court determination that someone is incapacitated or  reports from physicians often provide evidence of a beneficiary\u2019s  incapacity, but agency procedures also allow statements from lay people  to serve as a sufficient basis for determining that a beneficiary needs  someone to handle benefit payments on their behalf\u2014a representative  payee. SSA, OPM, and VA ask whether the alleged incapacitated person  has been appointed a guardian and often appoint that person or  organization as the representative payee. In some cases, however, the  agencies choose to select someone other than the court-appointed  guardian. Social Security officials sometimes designate the nursing home  where the incapacitated person resides as the representative payee  because it provides for direct payment to the nursing home, ensuring  continuity of care for the incapacitated person.", "In many cases, guardians are appointed with a full range of responsibilities  for making decisions about the incapacitated person\u2019s health and well- being as well as their finances, but several states\u2019 laws require the court to  limit the powers granted to the guardian, if possible. The court may  appoint a \u201cguardian of the estate\u201d to make decisions regarding the  incapacitated person\u2019s finances or a \u201cguardian of the person\u201d to make  nonfinancial decisions. An incapacitated person with little income other  than benefits from SSA for example, might not need a \u201cguardian of the  estate\u201d if he or she already has a representative payee designated by SSA  to act on their behalf in managing benefit payments. Sometimes the  guardian is paid for their services from the assets or income of the  incapacitated person, or from public sources if the incapacitated person is  unable to pay. In some cases, the representative payee is paid from the  incapacitated person\u2019s benefit payments.", "Guardians and representative payees may have conflicts of interest that  pose risks to incapacitated people. While many people appointed as  guardians or representative payees serve compassionately, often without  any compensation, some will act in their own interest rather than in the  interest of the incapacitated person.  Oversight of both guardians and  representative payees is intended to prevent abuse by the people  designated to protect the incapacitated people.", "While the incidence of elder abuse involving persons assigned a guardian  or representative payee is unknown, certain cases have received  widespread attention. The following are examples of abuse by guardians  and representative payees provided by courts and federal agencies:    A guardian and an employee of the guardian\u2019s law firm brought a  nursing home resident in New York a cake and flowers on her birthday  and billed her $850 for the visit using hourly rates for legal services.", "Rather than using electronic direct deposit, a guardian in New York  City appointed to protect an incapacitated person regularly traveled to  their branch bank in another borough to deposit her monthly $50 Social  Security check, charging her $300 per deposit.", "A company in Michigan acting as guardian for more than 600  incapacitated people committed felonies against them, including selling  one individual\u2019s home to a relative of a company employee for $500.", "A woman in the position of Public Fiduciary at the Gila County Public  Fiduciary\u2019s Office in Arizona served as guardian of incapacitated  people and in that capacity embezzled and misused a total of at least  $1.2 million of public funds.

Nearly all states require two kinds of reports: one regarding the personal  status and well being of the incapacitated person and another regarding  the accounting of the person\u2019s finances. The personal status reports  usually include information regarding the condition of the incapacitated  person, although many states require more specific information regarding  various aspects of the incapacitated person\u2019s status. In many states, the  laws require the report to include documentation of the need for  continued guardianship. Many statutory requirements are very detailed  and require a physician\u2019s statement, a determination of the mental status  of the incapacitated person, or in some instances, reports of any change in  the condition of the incapacitated person. Other basic report elements  may include living conditions, place of residence, and the number of  guardian visits. Some states may allow courts to waive certain reporting  requirements.", "Most states require that guardians submit a financial accounting and  record of expenditures for the care of the incapacitated person on an  annual basis. This document may list the assets and income of the  incapacitated person, including bank balances, real property holdings, and  detailed expenses associated with the care and housing of the  incapacitated person. State statutes usually require court approval for the  sale of real estate by a guardian.", "How often guardians are required to submit reports varies. Most states  require guardians to submit personal status reports at least annually. Only  the District of Columbia\u2019s law requires submission at least semiannually.  Statutory requirements for filing financial accountings range from annually  to at least once every 3 years. (See fig. 2.) In states where accounting  frequency requirements are left to the discretion of the courts, the  minimum requirement is that an accounting be made upon resignation or  removal of the guardian. In many states, there is an explicit requirement  that court personnel take action when reports are not filed on time. In  Texas, if a guardian of the person fails to file a report or a guardian of the  estate fails to file an annual accounting, the guardianship appointment  expires.", "Some state statutes require an independent party or court personnel to  determine the accuracy and validity of personal status and accounting  reports. However, fewer than half of the states require courts to review the  reports guardians have submitted to them. Other states leave it to the  court to determine who reviews the reports. For example, Texas specifies  that a statutory probate court must review filings as part of the annual  determination of the continued need for a guardianship, but provides that  courts of general jurisdiction may use any appropriate method determined  by the court according to the court\u2019s caseload and resources available\u201d in  order to assess the continued need for a guardianship.", "Apart from requirements for review of the submitted reports, some states\u2019  statutes require a periodic review of the guardianships to ensure that  guardians are adequately fulfilling their responsibilities and there is a  continuing need for the guardianship. In some states, an investigator will  visit the incapacitated person to determine whether there is a continuing  need for a guardianship or if the current guardian should be terminated  and a new one appointed. For example, Alaska requires courts to evaluate  incapacitated persons every 3 years. Some states hold a hearing to assess  the continuing need for a guardianship. For example, Connecticut law  requires a hearing every 3 years to determine if any changes need to be  made to the guardianship appointment.", "Many states\u2019 laws authorize penalties that courts can impose to enforce  guardianship responsibilities. These most frequently include termination  of the guardianship appointment or imposition of fines for failure to fulfill  responsibilities. Some states have statutes providing for the denial of  guardianship fees while others authorize penalties against negligent or  ineffective guardians, including charging the guardian with contempt of  court, imprisonment, restitution for mismanagement of property, recovery  of assets and surcharges, or loss of bond. Many other state statutes allow  hearings at the court\u2019s discretion or in response to a petition.", "Some states are reluctant to recognize guardianships originating in other  states, leading to jurisdictional complications. The 1998 Uniform  Guardianship and Protective Procedures Act has been adopted into many  states\u2019 statutes. This act gives courts the power to exercise jurisdiction  when an incapacitated person is moved or travels from one state to  another. However, these provisions may not sufficiently address all  complications that arise in guardianships for the elderly such as when  more than one jurisdiction is asked to appoint a guardian for the same  incapacitated person. For example, a guardian appointed in one state that  attempts to sell an incapacitated person\u2019s real property located in another  state may need to travel to that state and petition a court there in order to  establish authority to act on behalf of the incapacitated person. Interstate  jurisdictional issues also arise when the guardian or the incapacitated  person needs to move to another state.

Most courts responding to our  survey require an initial inventory of assets, income, and liabilities, and  courts in Florida and New York typically require annual financial  statements or accountings. Most courts in Florida and New York require  some or all guardians to submit a financial plan detailing how the guardian  will manage the financial affairs of the incapacitated person. Most of the  responding courts in California and Florida and all of the responding  judicial districts in New York indicated they require some or all guardians  to petition or inform the court if plans for the incapacitated person\u2019s care  change. Nearly all of the courts responding to our survey in each state  indicated that judges, court personnel, or court examiners review  guardians\u2019 reports, and a few courts use volunteers.", "In each state surveyed, when guardians receive pay for services, the pay  varies.

In New York,  rates typically ranged from $25 to $400 per hour, in California they ranged  from $7 to $250 per hour, and in Florida they ranged from $8 to $85 per  hour. In other cases, guardians\u2019 compensation was based on the value of  an elderly incapacitated person\u2019s estate but, while most judicial districts in  New York had allowed this, few courts in Florida and about one-quarter of  the courts in California had. In each state, most courts responding to our  survey required all guardians to submit time and expense records to  support petitions for compensation, but other courts in each state only  require these reports for some guardians.", "In all 3 states, responding courts reported a variety of measures for  guardianship oversight. Most California courts indicated that court  personnel visit all or almost all the incapacitated people, and several  responding Florida courts and two New York judicial districts indicated  they had court personnel visit some or most of the incapacitated people.  Most responding courts reported that they ask questions raised by  guardians\u2019 reports, send follow-up letters to conservators, or send notices  or orders to appear in court when reports are late, incomplete, or  inaccurate.", "Most responding courts in each state indicated they had imposed some  kinds of penalties when guardians failed to fulfill their responsibilities. The  most commonly used measures included withholding or reducing  guardianship compensation, terminating guardianship appointments, and  contempt of court citations. Several courts indicated they had done one or  more of these things more than 10 times during the past 3 years. A   1999 California State law established a statewide registry of private  professional guardians and requires courts to notify the registry when a  complaint against a guardian is valid. Only one court indicated it had yet  notified the registry of a guardian\u2019s resignation or removal for cause.  Eleven responding courts in California and 9 in Florida indicated they had  convicted guardians of a crime against the incapacitated person.

Judges who spend little of their time on  guardianship cases tend to focus on each case as it comes up on their  calendar and find it difficult to devote the time and resources needed to  develop an effective guardianship program, according to some officials at  courts recognized as exemplary, but others disagreed saying that general  jurisdiction courts can also provide good oversight of guardians.

The  system in Rockingham County automatically notifies court staff when  reports are due for each guardianship case. For example, when a  guardianship of the estate is established, the system prints a notice to the  guardian that an inventory of the incapacitated person\u2019s assets must be  submitted to the court within 90 days. If the court has not received the  inventory, the system notifies court staff that an inventory default notice is  needed. This system also tracks the number of new guardianship cases  and the total number of active cases. Similarly, Tarrant County enters  information about each new guardianship case into a database.

In Florida, the state statute requires that the clerk of  the court review each guardianship report to ensure that it contains the  appropriate information. Broward County has implemented a three-tiered  sampling system for reviewing the reports from the substantial caseload of  approximately 5,000 guardianships. All reports are subject to the first level  of review, which is conducted by the Audit Division of the Clerk of the  Court\u2019s office. A further sample of reports is selected, and the Audit  Division conducts a more intensive second level review. At the third level  of review, a further sample of reports is selected, and the audit division  conducts detailed in-house and field audits of supporting documentation  to verify the information in the reports. If these reviews indicate any  irregularities, the Audit Division sends a memorandum to the judge to  review the report and the auditor\u2019s findings. Tarrant County also employs  an auditor who is responsible for monitoring guardianships of the estate.  The auditor uses a database to track when guardians\u2019 reports are due.  Twice a month, the auditor checks this database to ensure that no reports  are overdue or overlooked.", "As shown in table 5, each court recognized as exemplary uses a visitor  program to support guardianship oversight. Tarrant County is required by  state law to have court visitors monitor the status of people under  guardianship, so the court provides visitation internships to social work  students who work as court visitors. A licensed Master Social Worker on  the court staff acts as program manager and trains and supervises the  interns. The students receive course credit, and the program is of little  cost to the court. There are typically 4 or 5 interns making an average of  60-70 visits each month.

Researchers prepare files for the court with  contact information, case background, and the last annual guardian\u2019s  report. The visitors then contact the guardian and arrange to visit the  incapacitated person. They assess the ward\u2019s living situation, finances,  health, and social activities, and recommend follow-up actions to the  court. A court employee serves as the volunteer coordinator. According to  the volunteer coordinator in Rockingham County, costs are minimal  because volunteers use court telephones, and the state provides supplies.

SSA annually  sends each representative payee (whether a court-appointed guardian or  not) a two-page report form asking for certain information\u2014-for example,  whether the representative payee was convicted of a felony, whether the  beneficiary continued to live in the same circumstances, how much of the  benefit payments were spent on the beneficiary\u2019s behalf, how much was  saved, and in what kind of account the funds are held. Similarly, OPM  biennially sends its representative payees a brief survey asking for similar  information, though those who are court-appointed guardians are not  required to complete the survey. OPM leaves it to the courts to monitor  these payees. VA also requires its representative payees to submit a two- page accounting report, but asks payees who are court-appointed  guardians to submit the same accountings that they submit to the court.  Each agency sends follow-up mailings, and SSA and VA visit payees as  needed in cases where payees fail to submit a report. In addition, VA sends  field examiners to visit each incapacitated beneficiary. Agency officials  indicated that these efforts often help identify cases in which beneficiaries  or representative payees have moved or cases where a payee may need to  be replaced for a variety of reasons. For example, they may no longer be  living close enough to the beneficiary or they themselves have become  unable to handle the benefit payments. Typically, however, cases of abuse  come to the agencies\u2019 attention by way of tips from individuals who know  of the beneficiary rather than from report and survey follow-up efforts.", "Some state courts and federal agencies share certain information about  some beneficiaries on a case-by-case basis. Some state court officials that  we spoke with indicated that they have established a rapport with staff in  local offices of federal agencies, such as SSA and VA, and are able to  obtain information concerning incapacitated beneficiaries or their  representative payees. (See table 7.) For example, upon request, federal  agencies will sometimes provide them with information to allow the court  to determine all sources of the incapacitated person\u2019s income and whether  the guardian needs to coordinate with a payee. State courts may also offer  information to federal agencies. For example, some courts send  occasional notices of guardianship appointment to SSA, allowing SSA staff  to identify which of their beneficiaries is incapacitated and determine if  the guardian can be designated as a representative payee.", "While coordination is often case-by-case, some takes place more  systematically and is based on previously established agreements. For  example, about one-third of the states have adopted the Uniform Veterans\u2019  Guardianship Act that requires state courts to notify VA when they appoint  a guardian for a veteran. According to this act, VA must receive copies of  court orders and accountings related to the veteran\u2019s case. The act also  gives VA the right to appear in court during guardianship proceedings  involving a veteran.", "Federal agencies may also establish agreements with one another to  exchange information. For example, SSA allows a limited number of VA  service representatives nationwide to electronically access some SSA  information about veterans\u2019 SSA benefits. This SSA data system includes  the amount of SSA benefits veterans receive, whether SSA has identified  them as incapacitated, and the identity of a representative payee, if one  has been designated. VA officials regularly look at SSA\u2019s information  before conducting a field examination to help determine incapacity and  choose a fiduciary, according to a VA official responsible for managing the  agency\u2019s fiduciary program. VA is not, however, notified when SSA  changes a beneficiary\u2019s representative payee. Many VA representative  payee program staff that do not currently have access to the database see  it as a useful tool and have expressed a desire to be able to use it in order  to more efficiently assess beneficiaries\u2019 needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Systematic Coordination Weakens Oversight of Incapacitated People", "paragraphs": ["The lack of systematic coordination weakens the oversight of both elderly  and non-elderly incapacitated people and may leave incapacitated people  at risk of not being assigned a representative payee or guardian despite  having been identified either by a state or federal entity as a person who  needs one. For example, if a federal agency has identified one of its  beneficiaries as incapacitated and assigns a representative payee, the  agency does not systematically notify the courts or other agencies. (See  table 7.) The other agencies making payments to the same person may not  learn that they may need to assign a representative payee to handle their  benefit payments to the person. Such notification could also be useful to  state courts in assessing the need for a guardian. This lack of coordination  could leave the incapacitated person who needs a representative payee or  guardian without one.", "Insufficient interagency coordination may also leave incapacitated elderly  people more vulnerable to abuse or neglect. For example, when an agency  identifies a representative payee who is abusing or neglecting an  incapacitated person, it does not automatically notify the state court or  other federal agencies that have assigned a guardian or representative  payee. Without such a notification, the court or other federal agency may  be unaware of the need to replace an abusive or negligent guardian or  representative payee.", "If agencies and courts do not communicate with each other concerning  incapacitated beneficiaries, they may unknowingly assign different people  as representative payees or guardians with overlapping responsibilities.  However, in some cases, agencies and courts intentionally select different  people or organizations as representative payee or guardian. Although  most Old Age, Survivor, and Disability Insurance beneficiaries with both a  guardian and SSA-designated representative payee, have the same person  serving in both roles, for an estimated 19 percent of these beneficiaries the  guardian is not their representative payee. Some guardians choose not to  be the representative payee, so SSA designates someone else. (See fig. 3.)  Sometimes VA designates a nursing home as a representative payee, even  though a court has appointed a family member or other person to be the  incapacitated resident\u2019s guardian. The guardian and the nursing home may  get into conflict over the use of the incapacitated person\u2019s benefit  payments. Additional coordination among federal agencies and courts and  cooperation among guardians and representative payees may be necessary  to avoid conflicts and better protect the incapacitated person.", "Federal officials have recognized the need for better exchange of  information regarding incapacitated beneficiaries. In response to  provisions in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, SSA and VA  studied the feasibility of collaborating in serving veterans who were also  SSA beneficiaries. In 1993, several agencies participated in a discussion  group on representative payee programs. Two of the agencies\u2014SSA and  VA\u2014signed an agreement calling for each agency to notify the other when  it had information that could be helpful to the other agency\u2019s oversight of  its representative payee. However, according to VA and SSA officials,  efforts to implement the agreement failed due to changes in management  personnel, concerns about costs, and issues concerning nondisclosure of  confidential information.", "Not only is it likely that the lack of coordination limits the protection of  incapacitated people and their federal benefits, it may also result in  increased federal expenditures. The recently enacted Social Security  Protection Act of 2004 requires SSA to repay the benefits in certain cases  of misuse. For example, if a representative payee that is an organization,  or an individual serving 15 or more beneficiaries misuses the benefit  payments, SSA will have to reissue the misused benefits to the  beneficiaries or to an alternate representative payee, resulting in increased  federal expenditures. Before the passage of this act, SSA was only required  to replace benefits if SSA was negligent in its oversight of a representative  payee. Annually, SSA has found fewer than 1,000 cases of misuse, and only  in a small percentage of those cases was SSA found to be negligent.  However, according to an SSA official, the new provisions may mean that  more benefits will have to be reissued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Statistical Data to Analyze Options for Improving Oversight Not Available", "paragraphs": ["Certain data, such as the number of active guardianships and incidence of  abuse, could help courts and agencies determine the effectiveness of  efforts to protect incapacitated people but are not currently available. The  courts we surveyed generally do not compile aggregate data such as the  number of incapacitated people, or elderly incapacitated people, with  guardians. Often the only records concerning guardianship appointments  aside from a calendar of upcoming hearings and due dates for required  reports are in individual paper files. Some states, however, are making  efforts to compile statewide data on guardianships. In Vermont, for  example, the Supreme Court compiles reports from each court on the  number of open guardianship cases, but without any information on the  age of the incapacitated people. In New York, the state court\u2019s Guardian  and Fiduciary Services is working on the development of a statewide  database on guardians, fiduciaries, and the people they were appointed to  serve.", "The federal agencies that we examined, SSA, VA, and OPM, do more to  compile data on representative payees than most courts responding to our  3-state survey do for incapacitated people with guardians. All three of the  federal agencies that we examined have databases that keep count of the  different types of representative payees for incapacitated people. Neither  SSA nor VA, however, consistently compiles information showing how  many beneficiaries with representative payees have a court-appointed  guardian who is not the representative payee.", "To keep these databases current, all three agencies require most of their  representative payees to submit periodic reports. SSA, VA, and OPM  compile and maintain basic information, such as contact information,  about the representative payees they designate. They also ask whether an  incapacitated beneficiary has a court-appointed guardian before  designating a representative payee. They do not, however, compile and  maintain more detailed information that could contribute to more effective  oversight of representative payees. For example, none of these agencies  consistently records information about a beneficiary\u2019s court-appointed  guardian in its computerized records system or updates the information  unless the agency also designates the court-appointed guardian as its  beneficiary\u2019s representative payee. Although SSA compiles some  information about the reasons it replaces representative payees, such as  the assignment of a more suitable payee, misuse of benefits, or fraud, for  example\u2014OPM and VA do not. This information might be useful in making  future assignments.", "Sufficient data are not available to determine the incidence of abuse of  incapacitated people by guardians or representative payees, nor the extent  to which guardians and representative payees are protecting incapacitated  people from abuse. Current efforts to compile aggregate national data on  elder abuse do not identify cases when a guardian or representative payee  has been assigned to the victim of abuse, or whether a guardian or  representative payee commits the abuse. States compile statistics on  incidence of abuse and neglect, including information on the age of  victims. National associations collect these statistics from Adult  Protective Service agencies and Area Agencies on Aging. Generally, states  track types of abuse and some of the relationships between perpetrators  and victims, but they do not track instances where the victim had been  assigned a guardian or representative payee or had granted a power of  attorney to someone. As a result, federal agencies lack national data  concerning the incidence of elder abuse by guardians and representative  payees or the incidence of abuse with and without the assignment of a  guardian or representative payee. Similarly, national crime statistics, such  as crime victimization surveys, identify various relationships between  victims and perpetrators, and the age of victims, but fail to identify cases  involving guardians or representative payees. SSA tracks the number of  cases in which representative payees are found to have misused benefits\u2014 fewer than a 1,000 cases each year for beneficiaries of all ages. SSA  officials agreed, however, that since SSA largely relies on tips from third  parties to discover cases of misuse, their records of misuse might be  incomplete."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although state and local courts have primary responsibility for protecting  incapacitated people, including the elderly, by appointing and overseeing  guardians, federal agencies also have responsibilities to help protect many  of the same incapacitated people through representative payee programs.  Yet, courts and federal agencies collaborate little in the protection of  incapacitated elderly people and the protection of federal benefit  payments from misuse. Court and agency efforts to improve protection of  the incapacitated is limited by their failure to systematically compile and  exchange data\u2014by, for example, promptly notifying each other when an  incapacitated person is identified or a representative payee or guardian is  appointed or needs to be replaced, due to their failure to fulfill their  responsibilities, or for other reasons. However, the extent to which the  courts and agencies leave elderly incapacitated people at risk is unknown.  Neither the states nor the federal government compile data concerning the  incidence of abuse of people assigned a guardian or representative payee  or even the number of elderly people with guardians. Without better  statistical data concerning the size of the incapacitated population or how  effectively it is being served, it will be difficult to determine precisely what  kinds of efforts may be appropriate to better protect incapacitated elderly  people from exploitation, abuse, and neglect.", "Improvements in oversight of guardians and representative payees depend  in part on additional efforts by states, state and local courts, federal  agencies, state area agencies on aging, and HHS. Although the focus of our  review was elderly incapacitated people, state guardianship and federal  representative payee programs also serve other incapacitated adults.  Improvements could be of benefit to all incapacitated adults, particularly if  they are designed with both the elderly and non-elderly in mind. However,  certain actions that would improve oversight are not currently being  undertaken. For example, the various entities responsible for oversight do  not collaborate to compile, on a continuing basis, consistent national data  concerning guardianships and representative payees. Without such  statistical data, the extent of preventable abuse and neglect of  incapacitated elderly people is unknown. Finally, the states have done  little to collaborate on interstate recognition and transfer of guardianship  appointments. Few states have adopted procedures for accepting transfer  of guardianship from another state or recognizing some or all of the  powers of a guardian appointed in another state. This can be a problem  when an incapacitated elderly person needs to move to another state or  the guardian needs to conduct business in another state on his or her  behalf. The need to establish a new guardianship in another state because  of these gaps in states\u2019 law can make it difficult for guardians and the  courts that supervise them to ensure that they fulfill their responsibilities.", "The prospect of increasing numbers of incapacitated elderly people in the  year\u2019s ahead signals the need to reassess the way in which state and local  courts and federal agencies work together in efforts to protect  incapacitated elderly people."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To increase the ability of representative payee programs to protect federal  benefit payments from misuse, SSA should convene an interagency study  group that includes representatives from HHS, federal agencies with  representative payee programs, including VA and OPM, and state courts  that wish to participate in order to study the costs and benefits of options  for improving interagency cooperation and federal-state cooperation in the  protection of incapacitated elderly and non-elderly people.

It views the study we recommend as something beyond its purview.  Although SSA shares concern about incapacitated people\u2019s general  welfare, it stated that its responsibility focuses on ensuring that any SSA  benefits incapacitated people receive are used for their maintenance and  welfare. SSA stated that systematic sharing of information among federal  agencies and state courts would be extremely difficult and a study group  focusing on such sharing would not be within SSA\u2019s purview.  SSA also  commented that efforts to coordinate with state courts must meet Privacy  Act requirements, and in that regard they noted that there is currently no  statement of routine use allowing SSA to share representative payee  information with state courts. Because state courts, SSA, and other federal  agencies have such different policies regarding representative payees and  guardians, SSA believes that it is constrained by the Privacy Act in  releasing information.", "We believe that the systematic exchange of data could help SSA better  ensure that SSA benefits are used for incapacitated people\u2019s maintenance  and welfare. The interagency study group should be able to develop  policies allowing for the sharing of information consistent with the Privacy  Act and other applicable nondisclosure requirements. We believe that an  interagency study group could identify carefully specified kinds of  information that under specified circumstances could be shared among  limited numbers of federal and state court officials with jurisdiction over  guardianships in a manner that is consistent with the Privacy Act and  other applicable nondisclosure requirements. SSA and the other federal  agencies involved have the authority to develop statements of routine use  to provide for such exchange of information. They currently have such  agreements in place to share data with other federal agencies, such as  SSA\u2019s sharing of information concerning its representative payees with a  limited number of VA staff. Although exchange of data among federal  agencies with representative payee programs may be easier to establish  than exchange between federal agencies and state courts, further study is  warranted to assess the feasibility of such exchange and the extent to  which it could enable courts and federal agencies to better protect  incapacitated elderly people.", "VA and OPM agreed with our conclusions pertaining to their agencies,  indicating that they look forward to participating in the study group we are  recommending. VA noted wide variations in state guardianship laws and  procedures, the need for federal agencies and state courts to share  information on cases of common interest, and the current lack of  systematic information sharing among federal agencies state agencies, and  state courts relating to the protection of elderly beneficiaries. OPM  suggested that we assert that it would be to the federal government\u2019s  benefit, either in terms of efficiency or savings, to create systems for  sharing information on guardians or representative payees. OPM also  urged that we add to the report statistics demonstrating the efficiency of  coordination with state courts.  Although adding these would strengthen  the report, data necessary to do so are not currently available. Our  findings strongly suggest that savings and greater efficiency would result  from collaboration, but the extent to which this is the case will not be  known until agencies and state courts start collaborating in efforts to  assess overlaps in the populations of incapacitated people they serve,  incidence of abuse, and the costs and benefits of data exchange.", "HHS agreed that guardians should be adequately trained and monitored,  and that governmental agencies and courts should coordinate their efforts  and share information concerning guardians and representative payees.
