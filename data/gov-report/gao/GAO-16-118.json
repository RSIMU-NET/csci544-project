NNSA used established methods in its OTH initiative, including: (1) a literature review of studies on proliferation threats; (2) structured interviews with participants from the U.S. government, nongovernmental organizations, and industry; and (3) a peer review of OTH findings by external subject matter experts. Although NNSA used established methods, the way NNSA implemented them had several limitations. For example, NNSA officials did not document the rationale for selecting individuals for structured interviews to show that those selected provided a balanced range of views and were sufficiently knowledgeable. NNSA officials also did not have detailed records or analyses of these interviews. Established methods and common methodological practices call for structured interviews to be documented and analyzed. GAO has found that such practices help ensure the reliability and validity of the information collected. Another limitation was that the peer review was not conducted in a way consistent with established standards. For example, NNSA officials did not document the results of the peer review, as called for by established peer review standards, and some reviewers told GAO that it was unclear how their comments had been incorporated into a 2012 OTH report. These limitations raise concerns about the quality of the analyses produced, and about the usefulness of the OTH initiative, as it has been implemented so far, as a planning tool in NNSA's Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation (DNN).", "It is unclear how information generated by the OTH initiative informed recent organization and planning decisions in the DNN office, even though NNSA established the initiative partly to support decision making on such matters. For instance, in January 2015, NNSA reorganized DNN programs by consolidating five DNN program offices into four offices. The extent to which the OTH initiative informed the reorganization is unclear because NNSA officials could not provide documentation or examples of links between OTH findings and elements of the reorganization. Instead, NNSA officials told GAO that the OTH initiative was one of several sources that informed the reorganization and that there were other reasons for it, including consolidating similar functions to achieve efficiencies. In addition, in March 2015, NNSA issued an unclassified strategic plan that was presented as defining and describing NNSA program missions\u2014including DNN programs\u2014to prevent, counter, and respond to future nuclear proliferation and terrorism threats. However, the extent to which the OTH initiative informed the plan was unclear because the plan and the OTH initiative covered different time frames, and because the plan and a draft classified appendix contained conflicting information about the role of the initiative in the plan's development. GAO is not making a recommendation on these matters because NNSA is creating a new strategic planning function that will oversee the OTH process and manage integration of OTH and other long-range studies into future versions of the NNSA strategic plan on nuclear threats."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In conducting any future proliferation threat assessments, through the OTH initiative or another process, NNSA should better implement established methods, including literature reviews, structured interviews, and peer reviews.

To address this threat, the National  Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)\u2014a semiautonomous agency  within the Department of Energy (DOE)\u2014implements nuclear  nonproliferation programs worldwide under its Office of Defense Nuclear  Nonproliferation (DNN). DNN\u2019s mission is to develop and implement  policy and technical solutions to eliminate proliferation-sensitive materials  and limit or prevent the spread of materials, technology, and expertise  related to nuclear and radiological weapons and programs around the  world. DNN programs include efforts to limit or prevent the spread of  nuclear and radiological materials and associated technology and  expertise, advance technologies that detect nuclear and radiological  proliferation worldwide, and eliminate or secure inventories of surplus  materials and infrastructure usable for nuclear weapons.", "Some DNN programs have been under way for 20 years or more\u2014for  instance, NNSA\u2019s nonproliferation research and development (R&D)  activities have been implemented under different program names since  the mid-1960s. In addition, nuclear security in Russia and the former  Soviet republics has been a major focus of DNN programs created in the  aftermath of the cold war and the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.  Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, NNSA undertook  new nonproliferation initiatives to better secure stockpiles of weapon- usable nuclear materials and radiological sources in dozens of other  countries around the world.", "The proliferation threat environment is changing and evolving. In the last  several years, some nuclear proliferation threats have been substantially  reduced. For example, as a result of the President\u2019s 2009 global nuclear  material security initiative, progress has been made to reduce the threat  posed by vulnerable nuclear material stockpiles around the world.  However, some nuclear nonproliferation efforts have stalled, exemplified  by discontinuation of many joint nuclear security activities between the  United States and Russia following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in 2014,  which has resulted in diminished DNN program engagement with Russian  nuclear material sites. In addition, some proliferation concerns may  intensify, and new threats may emerge, for example, as commercial  nuclear power expands internationally.", "In response to the changing nonproliferation environment, DOE and  NNSA have undertaken several efforts. In particular, in 2010, NNSA  began an initiative, known as the \u201cOver the Horizon\u201d (OTH) initiative, to  identify and assess future nuclear and radiological proliferation threats  and related trends over the next 5 to 10 years\u2014beyond NNSA\u2019s 5-year  budget planning horizon\u2014and to consider the implications for the future  of DNN programs. According to NNSA officials and documentation,  establishment of the OTH initiative was intended to institutionalize long- term DNN planning, and the information produced by the initiative would,  among other things, support DNN program planning and organization  decisions.", "In addition, in January 2015, NNSA reorganized the DNN programs into a  new program office structure. Furthermore, in response to a  recommendation contained in an August 2014 interim report by the  Secretary of Energy Advisory Board\u2019s Task Force on Nuclear  Nonproliferation, NNSA, in March 2015, issued the first strategic plan to  define and describe DNN missions and those of other NNSA programs to  prevent, counter, and respond to nuclear terrorism and proliferation.", "In this context, the Joint Explanatory Statement Accompanying the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 included a  provision for us to examine the status and future of NNSA\u2019s nuclear  nonproliferation programs.

To  address our second objective, we interviewed NNSA officials regarding  the DNN reorganization and the rationale for changing the DNN program  structure. In addition, we reviewed the March 2015 NNSA strategic plan  and draft classified appendix describing the planned activities of DNN and  other NNSA programs to prevent, counter, and respond to nuclear  terrorism and proliferation and we interviewed NNSA officials about the  plan.

Each DNN program office is  headed by an Assistant Deputy Administrator (ADA). In August 2012,  DNN established a DNN Management Council to serve as its corporate  management mechanism. This council, consisting of the NNSA Deputy  Administrator for DNN, the DNN Principal Assistant Deputy Administrator,  the DNN Chief Operating Officer, the DNN Senior Advisor, and the ADAs,  has formulated various DNN program decisions\u2014including on budget,  staffing, and priorities\u2014and has addressed other issues relating to the  DNN programs on an ad hoc basis.", "In January 2015, NNSA reorganized the DNN programs into a new  program office structure.

Among other things, that task force recommended that  DOE produce a biannual report on nonweapons national security  activities\u2014especially nonproliferation programs\u2014comparable to an  annual report NNSA currently produces on the management of the  nuclear weapons programs over the next 25 years, known as the  Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan. The DOE Secretary  agreed with this recommendation and asked NNSA to begin drafting such  a report. The March 2015 plan was presented as the first strategic plan to  define and describe DOE and NNSA missions to prevent, counter, and  respond to the threats of nuclear proliferation and terrorism, including the  DNN programs. For each DNN program, the plan identifies program  objectives, priorities, and performance measures; program activities,  accomplishments, and challenges; and program plans over NNSA\u2019s fiscal  year 2016 to fiscal year 2020 budget horizon.

This NIS specific phase of OTH work included the  use of several established methods consistent with those in GAO- developed guidance, including a literature review encompassing several  dozen U.S. government documents and other publications, two  workshops, and structured interviews with participants from the U.S.  government, nongovernmental organizations, and industry.", "According to GAO-developed guidance of established methods for  designing evaluations, a key first step in designing an evaluation is to  collect background information\u2014such as by conducting a literature  review\u2014to understand a program\u2019s history, related policies, and  knowledge base. Such a review can help focus evaluation questions on  knowledge gaps, identify design and data collection options used in the  past, and provide important context. In addition, to aggregate and  generalize results, it is important to collect uniform data from everyone  interviewed, such as through structured interviews or self-administered  questionnaires, which help ensure that the same questions are asked of  all. According to the guidance, designing a consistent set of responses  into the data collection process, such as by using a structured interview,  helps establish the uniformity of data across units in the sample.", "The NIS program office produced a report from this phase in July 2011.  The report identified 10 overarching trends that could impact the future of  the NIS program, grouped under three broad categories: (1) the evolving  strategic landscape, (2) proliferation and nuclear terrorism challenges,  and (3) existing and potential stresses on current nonproliferation and  nuclear security regimes. The report also examined over 50 potential  proliferation-related \u201cwild cards\u201d\u2014events considered to be generally  unanticipated, even if sometimes speculated, extremely difficult to  prepare for, and outside of the U.S. government\u2019s control\u2014that could  impact the trends and planning through 2020, such as terrorist or state  use of a nuclear weapon.

In this second phase of OTH work,  which began in March 2012, NNSA developed formal terms of reference  for OTH work specifying the objective, approach, and methodology for  evaluating such threats and trends.

To do its work, this working group met weekly,  received briefings from each DNN program office and the DOE Office of  Intelligence and Counterintelligence, and convened a peer review group  to provide external validation of study results consistent with established  methods. Federal agencies and other organizations, such as the  National Academies of Sciences, have established standards and  principles for peer review of technical and scientific work.

However, these officials could not provide us with documentation or point  to specific examples that could demonstrate direct links between the  findings in the 2011 and 2012 OTH reports and elements of the DNN  reorganization, such as how changes in certain threats or concerns about  new or emerging threats prompted changes in program structure. In a  subsequent meeting, NNSA officials in the DNN Deputy Administrator\u2019s  office stated that the information produced through the OTH process  about the changing proliferation threat environment provided general  context for the decision to reorganize the DNN programs. They also  stated that the initiative was one of several sources of information that  DNN management considered in developing the new DNN structure;  according to these officials, other sources included information about  evolving proliferation threats provided by the intelligence community.", "NNSA officials in the DNN Deputy Administrator\u2019s office also stated that  there were other drivers behind the reorganization, and that it was not  solely a threat-based reorganization. Specifically, these officials stated  that a key reorganization goal was to achieve greater efficiency in DNN  program management by consolidating similar nonproliferation functions  that were fragmented among several DNN program offices. For instance,  NNSA officials stated that some programs were spread among several  DNN program offices working on issues related to the security of nuclear  material overseas and that the reorganization would consolidate those  functions under a single program office. In addition, these officials told us  the reorganization was motivated by uncertain prospects for future joint  nuclear security work in Russia and by the completion or review of certain  DNN programs, such as an assessment of alternative options for U.S.  plutonium disposition. NNSA officials stated that the new structure will  provide DNN the capability and flexibility to respond to changes in the  future proliferation threat environment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which OTH Threat Assessments Informed DOE\u2019s and NNSA\u2019s Plan for Countering Nuclear Threats Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["The OTH initiative was established to institutionalize long-term DNN  planning and inform development of DNN strategic plans. In March 2015,  NNSA issued a strategic plan to reduce global nuclear threats that was  presented as the first strategic plan to define and describe NNSA  program missions\u2014including DNN programs\u2014to prevent, counter, and  respond to future threats of nuclear proliferation and terrorism. The  unclassified plan states that a classified appendix will be issued, which  will provide more details about future nuclear and radiological threats and  NNSA activities to address the evolving global nuclear security  environment. On the basis of our review of the unclassified plan and a  draft of the classified appendix, as well as our interviews with NNSA  officials, we found that the extent to which the OTH initiative informed the  new plan is unclear for two reasons.", "First, the time frames covered by the March 2015 plan and the OTH  initiative are not aligned. The March 2015 plan focuses on NNSA program  plans over the agency\u2019s 5-year budget planning horizon\u2014i.e., fiscal years  2016 to 2020. However, the objective of the OTH initiative is to assist  DNN by analyzing nuclear and radiological security and nonproliferation  challenges 5 to 10 years into the future, or beyond NNSA\u2019s 5-year budget  planning horizon. For example, in October 2013, the OTH initiative  produced an updated analysis of nuclear and radiological security threats  and trends for the 2018 to 2023 time frame. Because the March 2015  plan focuses on NNSA program objectives, activities, and plans for the  next 5 fiscal years, it is not clear how information produced through the  OTH initiative would align with that planning effort.", "Second, the extent to which the OTH initiative informed development of  the new NNSA plan is unclear because of conflicting information in the  unclassified plan and the draft of the classified appendix regarding the  contributions of the initiative in supporting both documents. The  unclassified plan includes several references to the OTH initiative,  including the future nuclear security threats and trends identified through  the initiative, and the role it will play in developing future versions of the  plan. For instance, the document\u2019s executive summary and conclusion  state that NNSA will continue to use OTH studies to validate that its  efforts are focused on addressing current threats and to anticipate  emerging and evolving threats. The plan also states that information from  OTH studies, along with information from external sources, will be used to  conduct cross-program and program-specific risk assessments and  priority setting. In addition, the document describes 5 proliferation-related  threat trends that the plan states were identified by the OTH initiative.  These 5 threat trends, described in general terms in the plan\u2019s  introduction, consolidate most of the 10 threats and trends for the 2018 to  2023 time frame identified in the October 2013 OTH report. (See app. II  for a list of the unclassified proliferation-related threats and trends  identified in the October 2013 OTH report and the March 2015 plan.)", "In April 2015, we reviewed a copy of the draft classified appendix to the  March 2015 plan, and we discussed the appendix and the unclassified  plan with the NNSA official who coordinated production of both  documents. Based on our review of the documents and our discussion  with the NNSA official, we did not find a clear connection between the  plan and the OTH initiative. The draft classified appendix did not contain  any references to the OTH initiative or findings of future proliferation  related threats generated through its process. Instead, the NNSA official  stated that the details on the future proliferation-related threats and trends  described in the classified appendix were derived from a classified  analysis prepared by an entity within the intelligence community, not from  the completed OTH studies. Furthermore, the NNSA official told us that  the OTH initiative was on a \u201cseparate but parallel track\u201d with preparation  of the strategic plan, and that findings from the OTH process were used  only to provide general setup and context for the plan\u2014specifically the 5  threat trends discussed in the unclassified plan\u2019s introduction.", "The official said that information from the OTH studies did not provide the  threat basis for the new plan because the threats and trends identified by  the initiative were stated in terms that were too general or academic.  However, he noted that the OTH initiative was still completing regional  studies to map proliferation-related threats and trends identified in the  October 2013 OTH report to specific countries and regions, and he told  us that findings from the regional studies could inform the next version of  the strategic plan, to be issued in 2016.", "NNSA officials told us that the OTH initiative is in the process of being  integrated into a new DNN strategic planning and integration function that  was implemented as part of the reorganization, which will be led out of  the office of the DNN Deputy Administrator. Among other things, the  NNSA official responsible for managing this effort will lead the analysis  and coordination of the OTH process and other long-range studies, and  manage the integration of these studies into strategic planning  documents, such as future versions of the NNSA strategic plan to reduce  global nuclear threats."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DNN programs remain critical to addressing the serious threats  associated with the proliferation of nuclear and radiological weapons.  NNSA has taken an important step through the OTH initiative to identify  and assess proliferation-related threats and trends over the next decade  and evaluate what they mean for the future of the DNN programs. NNSA  used established methods for designing the OTH studies, but we found  several limitations in the way the NNSA implemented these methods.  These limitations raise concerns about the quality and usefulness of the  analyses produced through the OTH process, including absence of  documented analysis from its literature review; limited documentation of  structured interviews; and limited application of established peer review  standards. In turn, these limitations raise concerns about the usefulness  of the OTH initiative\u2014as it has been implemented so far\u2014as a DNN  planning tool.

We also analyzed documentation NNSA officials  provided regarding the OTH process and findings from it. In particular, we  analyzed the OTH published reports: Office of Nonproliferation and  International Security: Over the Horizon Study, 2016-2020, July 2011;  Office of Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation Over the Horizon Opportunity  Analysis, 2017-2021 December 2012; and Threats and Trends Impacting  Nuclear and Radiological Security and Nonproliferation in 2018 to 2023,  October 2013. We also interviewed individuals who participated in OTH  process activities. NNSA officials provided us documents that identified  participants\u2014including NNSA officials, other agency officials, national  laboratory representatives, and independent nonproliferation experts\u2014in  four activities of the OTH process: (1) October 2010 workshop; (2)  November 2010-February 2011 structured interviews; (3) April 2011  workshop; (4) June 2012 meeting of external validators in a peer reviewer  group. We established a criterion to select a nonprobability sample of  participants in these sessions; we selected individuals that participated in  multiple activities of the OTH. This allowed us to gain more  comprehensive responses across activities. In selecting participants using  this criterion, the list of 146 participants across the four OTH initiative  activities was reduced to the 32 participants who were involved in more  than one OTH activity. We excluded participants from other U.S.  agencies, as well as participants who had only served as activity  facilitators. We also excluded NNSA personnel to better ensure candid  responses and to aim to avoid a conflict of interest. This narrowed our list  down to 18 participants. We contacted all 18 of these participants and  scheduled interviews based on their availability. We were able to  schedule and conduct interviews with 15 of these participants. We  determined that the responses from these participants were consistent  enough to constitute saturation, and we did not schedule any additional  interviews. We compared the methods NNSA used to established  methods for designing evaluations, as discussed in GAO-developed  guidance, and in criteria adopted by the Department of Energy that were  used or recommended by the Office of Management and Budget and the  National Academy of Sciences.", "To address our second objective, we interviewed NNSA officials  regarding the DNN reorganization and the rationale for changing the DNN  program structure, and the extent to which information provided through  the OTH initiative regarding future proliferation-related threats and trends  informed the restructuring of the DNN programs.
