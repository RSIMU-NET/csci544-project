Although Defense reported committing CERP funds for 1,600 kilometers of roads, data on the roads were incomplete and Defense has not reported information on these roads to USAID, as required. Poor security, project implementer limitations, and starting construction with limited planning have contributed to project delays and cost increases. U.S. agencies have not conducted sound impact evaluations to determine the degree to which projects achieved the objective of economic development. Limitations of USAID's funding, data collection, and frameworks to assess results have impeded its ability to evaluate project impact. Defense has not conducted any impact evaluations and lacks clear guidance on project evaluation. However, agency officials have noted some anecdotal examples of road construction impact, such as reduced travel times and increased commerce. Moreover, no other donor has performed impact evaluations. A sustainable road maintenance program has not been established, although it is a goal of the Afghan government and international donors. The Afghan government's support of this goal has been limited due to factors such as a lack of resources and a fragmented institutional organization. As a result, international donors have agreed to temporarily fund road maintenance to protect their investments.

According to USAID, this road is important as it connects the Kajaki dam,  a source of water and power in southern Afghanistan, to the ring road.  However, because attacks prevented contractors from working on the  project, it was terminated in 2008 after USAID had spent about $5 million.  USAID\u2019s first Afghan infrastructure program also experienced cost  increases due to deteriorating security. According to a USAID Office of the  Inspector General report, almost $9 million of a proposed ceiling increase  to the contract was directly attributable to increased security costs.  Additionally, according to USACE road project data and officials, security  issues resulted in frequent schedule delays for roads.

The Ministry of Public Works\u2019 Road Sector Master Plan  estimated in 2005 that the total maintenance cost for regional and national  highways and provincial roads would be $38 million for 2007. In October  2007, a senior ministry official told us that while the Ministry of Public  Works estimated that it needed $30 million to maintain roads in 2007, the  Ministry of Finance had allocated only $8 million. Thus, the Ministry of  Public Works planned only to undertake routine maintenance, and  postpone more expensive periodic maintenance work.", "Weak private sector capacity has also hindered the Afghan government\u2019s  ability to carry out road maintenance. Many donors have recommended  that the Ministry of Public Works involve more private sector entities in its  road maintenance efforts. However, according to a senior official at the  ministry, the private sector still lacks the capacity to undertake and  complete road maintenance projects. For example, in 2006, the Ministry of  Public Works requested bids for maintenance of the Kabul-Kandahar road  three times without receiving a single bid. In its 2005 assessment of road  maintenance needs in Afghanistan, the World Bank recommended that  Ministry of Public Works staff perform urgent maintenance until private  sector contractors have the capacity to do so. According to a USAID needs  assessment of the transportation sector, the Afghan private sector\u2019s  participation is also limited due to a lack of available cash and debt  financing.

However, USAID  officials and a Ministry of Finance official said that ministries with a stake  in the transportation sector are expected to oppose such a  recommendation. The Transport Sector Strategy finalized in February 2008  includes a recommendation to establish an interministry working group  for the transportation sector, but falls short of recommending  consolidation of transportation sector functions under one ministry.  Additionally, donors have recommended that, in accordance with  international best practices, a road fund be established to ensure that  revenues from road user charges are used only for road operations and  maintenance.

Additionally, according to these documents,  transportation sector laws are incomplete. For example, while there is a  traffic regulation law that defines restrictions on drivers and regulates the  weight of vehicles, it does not set the penalties for vehicle overloading,  according to the strategy. Overloaded vehicles cause the most serious  damage to roads in Afghanistan, according to USAID\u2019s needs assessment.", "Additionally, the Afghan government has not been able to generate  sufficient revenues for road maintenance due, in part, to ineffective  enforcement of tolls and fee collection. For instance, according to a  USAID needs assessment, the Ministry of Finance started a new system of  issuing stickers for a fee based on vehicle size to drivers who use toll  roads. However, the ministry had no mechanism to ensure that vehicles  passing through road checkpoints had the stickers that allowed them to  use the toll road. According to the assessment, the Ministry of Finance did  not appear to have coordinated its efforts with the Ministry of Interior,  which controls the Afghan National Police who man the checkpoints and  have enforcement authority. Consequently, the effort failed. A senior  Ministry of Public Works official confirmed that the sticker system had  failed to generate expected toll revenues.

While some have  noted that reconstructed roads contribute positively to economic and  social conditions in Afghanistan, there is currently little evidence based on  sound impact assessments that these projects have resulted in expected  benefits. Because donors are building an interconnected road network,  coordination in planning and conducting impact assessments would  complement individual donors\u2019 efforts to assess the impact of their own  projects and could result in more efficient use of resources. Moreover,  without a sustainable road maintenance program, newly constructed roads  will ultimately deteriorate, expected benefits will not materialize, and the  billions of dollars spent on road reconstruction would be wasted.
