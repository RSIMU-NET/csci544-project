Since 2007, State, DOD, and USAID have allocated over $1 billion in assistance to help Yemen counter AQAP and address other challenges. The three largest U.S. assistance programs in Yemen are USAID\u0092s Food for Peace program, which has provided emergency food aid, and DOD\u0092s Section 1206 and 1207(n) programs, which have provided training and equipment to Yemeni security forces.", "In response to a Senate report that directed GAO to review U.S. assistance to Yemen, and following up on GAO\u0092s February 2012 report on the types and amounts of such assistance, GAO examined (1) the extent of progress made toward U.S. strategic goals for Yemen, (2) the extent of progress made by the Food for Peace and Section 1206 and 1207(n) programs, and (3) key challenges to U.S. assistance efforts.

The Departments of State (State) and Defense (DOD) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) have conducted numerous civilian and security assistance activities in support of these strategic goals. Although some progress has been made since the civil unrest in 2011, obstacles remain to achieving each goal. For example, while there has been an orderly political transition to a new president, key milestones\u0097such as convening a national dialogue to promote reconciliation\u0097have been delayed. In addition, while Yemeni security forces have retaken territory seized by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in 2011, the security situation remains unstable.", "USAID data indicate that the Food for Peace program exceeded most of its annual targets between fiscal years 2008 and 2011 for the number of individuals in Yemen benefiting from food donations. However, reports to Congress about the program have lacked timeliness, accuracy, clarity, and consistency. With regard to the Section 1206 and 1207(n) programs, DOD has developed an evaluation process to assess the programs\u0092 effectiveness but has not conducted an evaluation in Yemen, citing security concerns. Consequently, limited information exists for decision makers to use in conducting oversight of these assistance programs and making future funding decisions.", "Security conditions and political divisions in Yemen pose key challenges to U.S. assistance efforts. First, Yemen\u0092s unstable security situation constrains U.S. training of Yemeni security forces, restricts oversight of civilian assistance projects, and endangers Yemeni nationals who work for the United States. For example, a Yemeni employee of the U.S. embassy was murdered in October 2012, and other Yemeni staff at the embassy, as well as their families, face threats. Second, because of leadership and coordination challenges within the Yemeni government, key recipients of U.S. security assistance made limited use of this assistance until recently to combat AQAP in support of the U.S. strategic goal of improving Yemen\u0092s security. However, according to DOD officials, recent actions by the Yemeni government to replace key leaders of security force units and reorganize security ministries have addressed some of these challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USAID improve performance reporting on Food for Peace efforts in Yemen and that DOD collect and analyze data on the effectiveness of the Section 1206 and 1207(n) programs in Yemen until security conditions permit an evaluation of these programs.

Further, Yemen faces  substantial economic and social challenges, such as a reported  unemployment rate of nearly 40 percent and, according to the United  Nations, a third of Yemenis suffering from acute hunger. Yemen is also  undergoing a difficult political transition following mass protests in 2011  that culminated in the end of the 33-year rule of former President Ali  Abdullah Saleh.

The most impoverished country in the  Middle East and North Africa region, Yemen is experiencing a rapidly  growing population, which is estimated at about 25 million; increasing  scarcity of natural resources, including water, and its primary export\u2014 oil\u2014in steady decline; extremely high unemployment; and dwindling  revenues that decrease the government\u2019s ability to fund basic operations.  Internal conflicts have displaced over 430,000 Yemenis from their  communities, and a December 2012 United Nations report found that  nearly half of Yemen\u2019s population had limited or no access to sufficient  food. Moreover, Yemen is a safe haven for the terrorist group AQAP,  which the June 2011 National Strategy for Countering Terrorism identifies  as a sustained threat to the United States with both the intent and  capability to plan attacks against the U.S. homeland and U.S. partners.", "Adding to these challenges, Yemen\u2019s history has been marked by serious  political tensions, including civil war, secessionist movements, and  conflict between the government and various tribes. As shown in figure 2,  in early 2011, mass protests began against the 33-year regime of  President Ali Abdullah Saleh. Saleh\u2019s government responded by cracking  down on protestors and clashing with troops that had defected to side  with the protest movement. As the Yemeni government focused on  suppressing upheaval in the capital, AQAP was able to take advantage of  the situation by seizing control of portions of southern Yemen. In late  2011, after months of political unrest, Saleh signed a Gulf Cooperation  Council\u2013proposed agreement outlining a transfer of power to his vice  president, Abdo Rabu Mansour Hadi. Hadi was elected president in  February 2012, beginning a 2-year transition process that is intended to  lay the groundwork for national elections in February 2014.", "According to State, the overarching objective of U.S. policy in Yemen is a  successful democratic transition that promotes political, economic, and  security sector reforms that will enable the Yemeni government to  respond to the needs and aspirations of the Yemeni people. Following the  November 2011 transition agreement, the U.S. government developed a  comprehensive new strategy to support the U.S. policy objective for  Yemen. U.S. agencies are using this strategy to guide assistance  activities during the 2-year transition period (2012\u20132014) outlined in the  Gulf Cooperation Council\u2013sponsored transition agreement. The primary  agencies providing assistance to Yemen in support of the U.S. strategy  are State, DOD, and USAID.

USAID and State have  provided civilian assistance focused on addressing Yemen\u2019s  humanitarian, economic, and political needs, while DOD and State have  provided security assistance focused primarily on building Yemeni  counterterrorism capacity. Overall, civilian assistance has constituted  approximately 51 percent ($518 million) of the total $1.01 billion in U.S.  assistance, with security assistance constituting the remaining 49 percent  ($497 million).

The political  unrest contributed to further reductions in available government services.  State noted that there continue to be severe strains on the Yemeni  government\u2019s ability to provide public funds and government services  throughout the country.

The International  Monetary Fund subsequently reported in December 2012 that the Yemeni  economy had improved since 2011 and that the exchange rate had  returned to levels experienced prior to the 2011 unrest. Additionally,  according to the World Food Program, the inflation rate had dropped to  less than 5.5 percent in December 2012.

Specifically, State, DOD, and Yemeni officials stated  that the new administration led by President Hadi has been more  aggressive in countering AQAP than the previous administration. Of  particular note, in June 2012, a Yemeni military offensive conducted in  conjunction with tribal militias in southern Yemen removed AQAP from  regions where it had seized control during the civil unrest in 2011.  However, DOD officials stated that AQAP continues to conduct attacks  against the Yemeni government and remains a threat to the United  States, and according to a senior Yemeni MOD official, AQAP\u2019s decision  to change tactics from seizing and holding territory to conducting targeted  assassinations of Yemeni government officials, including in Sana\u2019a,  constitutes a major security challenge. In addition to AQAP, other  destabilizing elements are active in Yemen. For example, a senior  Yemeni MOD official cited the Houthi tribe based in northern Yemen as  another security challenge. Similarly, in January 2013, the U.S.  ambassador to Yemen stated that Iran was destabilizing the region by  assisting secessionists in southern Yemen.

In March 2011,  the USAID Inspector General reported that security-related travel  restrictions in Yemen had severely limited the monitoring and  oversight of project activities. During our October 2012 fieldwork in  Yemen, USAID officials stated that the security situation continues to  prevent USAID staff from accessing areas of the country outside of  the capital to conduct monitoring and evaluation of civilian assistance  activities. To address this challenge, USAID has employed a  contractor that hires Yemeni staff to monitor assistance efforts in other  urban areas that U.S. officials are unable to access. However, as  noted below, Yemeni nationals are also subject to significant security  risks, and as the USAID Inspector General reported in March 2011,  the tribal affiliations of Yemeni staff may make it difficult for them to  travel to parts of the country controlled by rival tribes.", "Locally employed Yemeni staff endangered. According to senior  officials at the U.S. embassy in Sana\u2019a, locally employed Yemeni staff  members play a critical role in embassy operations\u2014including in U.S.  assistance activities\u2014and provide extremely valuable \u201cinstitutional  memory.\u201d However, these individuals face considerable risks as a  result of their association with the U.S. government, as demonstrated  by the October 2012 murder of a Yemeni national who was a longtime  embassy employee and other instances of intimidation. Locally  employed staff with whom we met during our October 2012 trip to  Yemen expressed concerns about their safety, with several  individuals citing the threats to them and their families as a serious  disincentive to continuing their employment at the embassy.  According to USAID, the embassy has since provided training in  countersurveillance and personal security to several hundred locally  employed staff.

DOD officials stated that, until recently, key recipients of U.S.  equipment and training in Yemen had conducted few counterterrorism  operations since the outbreak of political hostilities in Yemen in early  2011. DOD officials attributed this in part to opposition to the Hadi  administration among some leaders at key Yemeni security ministries.  Specifically, according to DOD, two counterterrorism units\u2014one each  within the Yemeni MOD and MOI\u2014have been among the largest  recipients of U.S. security assistance. However, DOD officials noted that  MOI\u2019s counterterrorism unit played a limited role in attacking AQAP  strongholds in southern Yemen, while MOD\u2019s counterterrorism unit did  not make any contribution to those operations. DOD officials stated that  this limited involvement was due in part to the nature of the conflict  against AQAP\u2014an effort to regain control of territory that was more suited  to a response by conventional military forces. However, they added that  the MOI and MOD counterterrorism units were under the leadership of the  former president\u2019s supporters at the time of the operations against AQAP  and were consequently unwilling to strongly support the new president\u2019s  counterterrorism initiatives.", "Coordination challenges between MOD and MOI have further limited  MOI\u2019s ability to participate in counterterrorism operations. DOD noted that  MOI has had difficulty receiving replacement parts, equipment, and  vehicles from the MOD logistics system, hindering its ability to conduct  counterterrorism operations outside of the Yemeni capital. For example,  although the United States has provided MOD with spare parts for  Humvee vehicles to share with MOI, a senior MOI official stated that MOD  has not done so, resulting in MOI\u2019s inability to maintain and use its U.S.- provided Humvees as intended, as shown in figure 7.", "Similarly, U.S. and Yemeni officials stated that although the United States  has provided helicopters for both MOD and MOI to use in  counterterrorism operations, MOD does not give MOI access to the  helicopters in a timely fashion. Specifically, a senior MOI official stated  that MOD takes approximately 3 months to respond to MOI requests for  access to the helicopters, which are based at an MOD facility. The official  explained that the length of time it takes MOD to approve MOI\u2019s requests  is not conducive to conducting time-sensitive counterterrorism operations.", "According to DOD officials, recent actions by the Yemeni government  have addressed some of these challenges. In December 2012, President  Hadi announced a number of decrees to, among other things, remove  several key leaders of Yemeni security forces units\u2014including the heads  of the MOD and MOI counterterrorism units\u2014from their current positions.  DOD officials stated that, as of February 2013, a new official had taken  command of the MOD counterterrorism unit, which had also increased its  involvement in counterterrorism operations. In addition, the current head  of the MOI counterterrorism unit had agreed to step down. President  Hadi\u2019s decrees also called for further reorganization of the Yemeni  security ministries\u2014specifically, consolidating the MOD and MOI  counterterrorism units under a newly created Yemeni special operations  command under MOD. As of February 2013, this new special operations  command had been formed, according to DOD, and was overseeing the  MOD counterterrorism unit, while planning was under way for the MOI  counterterrorism unit to be absorbed under the new command.
