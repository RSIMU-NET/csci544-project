In fiscal year 2004, states paid an average of $0.20 per can for milk-based concentrate formula, a savings of 93 percent off the wholesale price. However, states also allow some use of non-rebated formula that can cost states more than 10 times as much as contract formulas. For example, in 2004, 8 percent of infant formula provided to WIC participants was non-rebated. Rebate savings from infant formula cost-containment contracts have allowed WIC to serve an additional 2 million participants per year, but recent increases in the cost per can of formula could lead to reductions in the number of participants served with rebates. Rebate savings have remained near $1.6 billion per year since 1997 after adjusting for inflation, but the amount states pay per can of infant formula has increased since 2002. We estimated that in 2004, if the cost per can of formula increased in every state by as much as it did in two states, approximately 400,000 fewer participants would have been able to enroll in WIC nationwide. State and federal agencies have both taken steps to contain WIC infant formula costs, but FNS also focuses on sustaining the cost-containment system. States have sought to increase their costs savings through their infant formula contracts--for example, by joining coalitions to leverage greater discounts. Some also try to restrict the use of the more expensive non-contract formulas. FNS, in turn, helps states to contain costs through its review of contracts and through policy and guidance. For example, FNS reduced--but did not eliminate--the price increases that can result from the introduction of new, more costly formulas. FNS has also used its oversight authority to ensure that all interested manufacturers can compete for state infant formula contracts in an effort to maintain the long-run sustainability of the infant formula cost-containment system."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and  Children (WIC) provides food, nutrition education, and health care  referrals to close to 8 million low-income pregnant and postpartum  women, infants, and young children each year.

Using FNS data, we calculated trends in the  average per-can cost of milk-based concentrate infant formula in the   50 states plus the District of Columbia between 2000 and 2005, as well as  trends in total rebates, and trends in the share of participants served using  rebate savings. We also used this data to estimate the potential impact of  reduced rebates on program participation under three alternate scenarios.  To better understand the factors that affect program spending on infant  formula, we surveyed 50 state WIC programs and the District of Columbia  to obtain additional information about their infant formula contracts. We  achieved a 100 percent response rate. We also reviewed literature on  factors that influence infant formula spending, and interviewed several  state and local WIC directors, all three infant formula manufacturers  currently participating in the WIC market, and policy experts with an  interest in WIC infant formula cost containment.

Manufacturers agree to provide a rebate to the state WIC agency for every  can of infant formula purchased under the WIC contract, and the state  awards the contract to the bidder offering the lowest net wholesale price  after subtracting the rebate from the cost of infant formula. In exchange,  the state provides the contract brand of infant formula to most infants  enrolled in the program except those that are breastfeeding exclusively  and those with a medical condition that requires the use of a non-contract  infant formula.

Most infants are provided an  infant formula that is covered by the state\u2019s cost-containment contract.  There are three categories of infant formula provided to WIC participants:    Contract brand infant formula is produced by the contract manufacturer  and is suitable for routine use by the majority of healthy full-term infants.

Rebates are the most important factor driving state  spending on infant formula because such a large proportion of WIC infant  formula is purchased under cost-containment contracts with  manufacturers. According to infant formula manufacturers, the  attractiveness of a WIC contract depends, at least in part, on factors over  which states have some control, including the extent to which a WIC  contract will help a manufacturer market its products to non-WIC  consumers; state-level administration of WIC contracts; and the provision  of powder, concentrate, and ready-to-feed infant formula to WIC  participants. These factors, in turn, could affect whether or not a  manufacturer bids on a contract and the level of rebates offered by the  manufacturers.

As a result, states paid an average of $0.20 per   13-ounce can of milk-based infant formula with a wholesale price of   $2.60 to $3.57. However, while average rebates were high, rebate levels  varied significantly by state. For example, in 2004, Virginia and South  Carolina were paying as little as $0.07 per can of milk-based concentrate  after rebates, while New York was paying $0.80 per can after rebates.", "Representatives of the three infant formula manufacturers identified  several factors that influence how \u201cattractive\u201d they find a state contract.  The attractiveness of a contract, in turn, could influence whether a  manufacturer bids on a contract and the size of the rebate offered. Many of  the factors cited by manufacturers are things over which states have at  least some control.", "Shelf space and product placement: WIC-brand infant formulas may  get more shelf space than competing brands, particularly in stores that  serve areas with large concentrations of WIC participants. Because WIC  participants purchase such a large share of infant formula in some stores,  retailers tend to stock more of the WIC brand of infant formula. In  addition to shelf space, WIC-brand products may be placed at eye level so  that they are easy to spot.", "All three infant formula manufacturers noted the importance of shelf  space and product placement to their marketing strategies. In addition,   31 of the 51 state WIC directors that responded to our survey felt that shelf  space was moderately, very, or extremely important to manufacturers in  determining how much they bid on an infant formula contract. While WIC  agencies do not have direct control over shelf space and product  placement, some include stocking requirements in their contracts with  vendors.", "State policies regarding authorization of WIC vendors can also impact  manufacturers\u2019 access to non-WIC consumers. Some states have  authorized WIC vendors that sell exclusively or primarily to WIC  participants. Manufacturers have less access to non-WIC consumers if  more WIC participants purchase their infant formula at these \u201cWIC-only\u201d  stores. In those cases, retailers that serve the non-WIC population in the  area may be less likely to focus on product placement or devoting shelf  space to the WIC brand\u2014two factors that benefit manufacturers in their  drive to reach non-WIC consumers.", "Physician and Hospital Recommendations: Having WIC contracts  could also benefit manufacturers through physician recommendations.  State WIC programs often work with physicians to educate them about the  program and the requirement that most WIC participants use the contract  brand of infant formula. Physicians may decide to recommend the WIC  brand of infant formula to all patients to avoid having to differentiate  between those enrolled and not enrolled in WIC. Similarly, some hospitals  agree to provide WIC-brand infant formula to new mothers so that they  won\u2019t have to switch infant formulas after they leave the hospital. It may  be easier for hospitals to provide the WIC-brand infant formula to all new  mothers. Moreover, two of the infant formula companies that participate  in the WIC market are divisions of pharmaceutical companies that  primarily market their products directly to physicians and hospitals while  also marketing, though to a lesser extent, directly to consumers. States  vary in the extent to which they emphasize doctor and hospital outreach.", "Product Innovation: All three manufacturers cited the central role of  product innovation in their business strategies. Manufacturers seek to  compete on the basis of product innovation and product quality despite  the fact that infant formula is a relatively homogeneous product.  Manufacturers said that certain state practices could make it more difficult  to pursue their core strategy of innovation, and the development,  distribution, and marketing of new products. These practices include the  use of long-term contracts, requirements that manufacturers notify states  of product changes in advance of introducing new products into the  market, provisions that allow states to unilaterally extend contracts  without requesting the consent of the manufacturer, state restrictions on  the ways in which manufacturers market their infant formula, and  restrictions on their interactions with physicians. While these state  practices could inhibit innovation, many are put in place to protect states  from increases in infant formula costs.", "State Billing Systems: All three manufacturers cited the accuracy of  state billing systems as a key factor they consider when developing bids,  and all stated that the vast majority of state billing systems need  improvement. One manufacturer said that most states rely on antiquated  information technology that is prone to costly billing errors. According to  FNS officials, disputes over billing for infant formula rebates have long  been a problem in the WIC program. In the past, some states requested  reimbursement from infant formula manufacturers for every can of infant  formula listed on redeemed vouchers. However, some WIC participants  did not purchase every can of infant formula listed on the voucher. In  these instances, the manufacturers claimed they were being billed for  purchases that were never made. Partly in response to these disputes, a  new provision was included in the Child Nutrition and WIC  Reauthorization Act of 2004 that requires states to bill only for infant  formula actually purchased.", "Contract size: State WIC directors said they believe that contracts that  cover more infants yield higher rebates; however, the manufacturers said  that the largest contracts may not draw their highest bids. A few state WIC  directors expressed concerns that new provisions in the Child Nutrition  and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 limiting the size of state coalitions  and requiring separate contracts for milk-based and soy-based infant  formula could reduce the size of contracts and the size of rebates.  However, manufacturers noted that costly shifts in demand occur when  very large states or coalitions change contractors. Manufacturers must be  able to respond to these shifts by quickly increasing or decreasing  production, and must, therefore, consider their own production capacity  when they bid on very large contracts.", "Contract Provisions: Manufacturers noted that states sometimes include  contract provisions that manufacturers consider complex, ambiguous, and  extraneous and inclusion of these provisions could affect rebates. For  example, manufacturers cited provisions that increase the potential  liabilities of manufacturers, give states control over manufacturer  activities, or require manufacturers to provide products or services not  directly related to the sale of infant formula\u2014such as sponsoring  conferences, providing literature on nutrition education, or providing free  infant formula\u2014as particularly unattractive.  Because states rarely modify  contract provisions in response to manufacturer concerns, manufacturers  may respond to these provisions by either not bidding on contracts or  offering lower rebates.", "Provision of Powder, Concentrate and Ready-to-Feed Infant  Formulas: All three manufacturers cited the importance of state policies  governing the provision of powder, concentrate, and ready-to-feed infant  formulas. Historically, the WIC program has issued more concentrate than  powder, but there has been an increase in the use of powder in the WIC  program since 2000. Because ready-to-feed infant formula is the most  expensive, WIC regulations allow WIC agencies to provide it only in  certain circumstances Twenty-nine states were able to provide us with  data on their use of the different forms of infant formula in both 2000 and  2004. In 2000, 55 percent of all infant formula issued in those states was in  the form of liquid concentrate. By 2004, liquid concentrate represented  only a third of all infant formula provided to WIC participants in those  states. Powder use may have increased because it can be more convenient  for mothers who are partially breastfeeding because mothers can  reconstitute small amounts of powdered infant formula at a time, whereas  liquid concentrate must be diluted all at once. Manufacturers did not  provide information on how the provision of different forms of infant  formula might affect their bids on infant formula contracts. However, if  concentrate is more profitable, the shift to powder could reduce  manufacturer profits\u2014and the rebates they offer to states. Alternatively, if  powder is more profitable or there are no differences in the profitability of  different forms, the shift to powder might not affect rebates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Non-Contract Infant Formula Increases Formula Costs", "paragraphs": ["Although non-contract infant formula, including both exempt and non- contract, non-exempt infant formula, accounts for less than 10 percent of  infant formula purchased through WIC, its use can have a significant  impact on total infant formula spending because it can cost as much as   10 to 20 times more per can than rebated formula. Among the 27 states  that were able to provide us with data on their use of contract, exempt,  and non-contract, non-exempt formulas in both 2000 and 2004, use of  exempt formula increased and use of non-contract, non-exempt formula  decreased over the 4-year period.

Eight of the 9 states that implemented a new contract in 2002  did so at either the same net price as under their previous contract or at a  lower net price. This trend shifted over the next few years.

Among states that implemented new contracts in 2005, the average net  price for a can of milk-based concentrate was $0.43 after rebates. This  represented a discount of about 87 percent off the wholesale price. In a  few states, however, the net price states paid for milk-based concentrate  under their contracts was significantly higher than the average.

Since  the early 1990s, infant formula manufacturers have diversified their  product lines to include a greater number of infant formula types, all of  which have higher wholesale prices than traditional unenhanced milk- and  soy-based infant formulas. The most significant change in infant formulas  came with the introduction of DHA and ARA enhanced infant formulas  starting in 2002. All three manufacturers have introduced DHA and ARA  enhanced infant formulas at prices that are higher than the unenhanced  versions. At the time of our survey in mid-2005, 23 states reported that  they issue enhanced infant formula as their primary contract brand; only   8 states reported that they do not approve enhanced infant formula. In  addition, four of the five most recent contracts to be awarded specified the  enhanced infant formulas as the primary contract brand.

In addition, 27 states limit the amount of time that  non-contract, non-exempt infant formulas can be issued to participants.", "Eight states do not provide more expensive enhanced infant formula.", "Despite these state efforts to contain costs, opportunities remain for more  states to further reduce the use of non-rebated infant formulas. Use of  non-contract, non-exempt infant formula varies. Twelve states reported  that they have policies in place not allowing the use of non-contract, non- exempt infant formula.  Of the 43 states that provided complete  information on their average monthly usage of contract, exempt, and non- contract, non-exempt infant formulas in 2004, 27 states reported that  between 0.3 percent and 4 percent of infant formula provided is non- contract, non-exempt, and 8 states reported use between 4.5 percent and   9 percent. As required by the Infant Formula Act, infant formula is a  relatively homogeneous product. Consequently, it is unlikely that large  discrepancies among states in the use of non-contract, non-exempt infant  formulas designed for use by healthy infants can be explained by  differences in health conditions of infants receiving WIC infant formula in  these states. There are also large discrepancies in the use of exempt infant  formula designed to treat infants\u2019 medical conditions. State provision of  exempt infant formula ranges from a low of 0 percent to a high of about   23 percent. (See app. II for information on use of non-contract, non- exempt and exempt infant formula by state.) Again, as with non-contract,  non-exempt infant formula, it is not clear how infants\u2019 medical needs  could vary so significantly among states. Figure 6 shows the minimum,  median, and maximum use of each type of infant formula in 2004.", "Most states reported that they require participants to obtain medical  documentation for non-rebated infant formula, as required by FNS.  However, some local WIC directors said there are instances in which  doctors do not diagnose a medical condition but still write a prescription  at the request of the participant. Local WIC agency staff told us that they  identify these cases only by confirming diagnoses with each physician  which not all agencies have the resources to do. As a result, some WIC  participants may be receiving non-rebated infant formula even though they  do not have a medical condition requiring such infant formula."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FNS Has Taken Steps to Reduce Infant Formula Costs", "paragraphs": ["In its oversight capacity, FNS has helped states increase their cost- containment savings by providing technical assistance to states as they  develop their cost-containment contracts, and by implementing  regulations that help states achieve cost savings. For example, FNS  requires manufactures to provide the same discount on all infant formulas  after state costs rose with the introduction of a new infant formula. In  1993, one company introduced a lactose-free infant formula to  accommodate infants with intolerance for milk-based infant formula.  When this company introduced its lactose-free infant formula, it provided  a significantly lower rebate amount on this infant formula than it provided  on its milk-based infant formula covered by the existing contract, even  though the wholesale price of the new infant formula was higher per can.  As a result, states received a much lower discount on the new infant  formula than they received on the original contract infant formula. At the  same time, prescriptions for the lactose-free infant formula increased  because the company marketed the infant formula directly to doctors. The  cost savings states achieved through rebates began to erode. To maintain  competition by ensuring that all manufacturers could bid on contracts and  to help preserve rebate savings, FNS in 2000 established the requirement  that infant formula manufacturers provide the same percent discount for  all infant formulas, even those introduced when a contract is already in  effect.", "The requirement that manufacturers provide the same percent discount  for infant formulas introduced during a contract slows but does not  completely stem increases in state spending on infant formula. Even with  the requirement, states must still pay more for each can of newly- introduced infant formula when the wholesale price of the infant formula  is higher. As a result, manufacturers still have a financial incentive to  introduce and market more expensive infant formula because they charge  a higher price per can.", "By 2003, all three manufacturers introduced new infant formulas enhanced  with the fatty acids DHA and ARA. Like other newly-introduced infant  formulas, these enhanced infant formulas were more expensive. Two state  officials told us that the manufacturers replaced the milk-based infant  formula the state was providing to WIC participants in some parts of the  state with the enhanced infant formula. Retail outlets stopped stocking the  original milk-based infant formula; as a result, states had to purchase the  enhanced infant formula. In contrast, when manufacturers introduced new  infant formulas in the past, states had a choice not to provide the new  infant formulas or to limit their use because the original milk-based infant  formula was still available. At least one state has since introduced a  contract provision that requires manufacturers to charge the same price  per can for newly-introduced products when those products replace the  primary contract infant formula."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FNS Promotes the Long- Run Sustainability of the Competitive Bidding System", "paragraphs": ["Recognizing the history and dynamics of the infant formula market and the  importance of competition to the cost-containment goals of the WIC  program, FNS has attempted to ensure that all manufacturers can compete  for state infant formula contracts regardless of their share of the market.  Infant formula manufacturers operate within a highly concentrated  industry. Beginning in the 1970s, three manufacturers\u2014Wyeth-Ayerst,  Mead Johnson, and Ross Laboratories\u2014dominated the infant formula  market. By the 1990s, the industry had shifted. Wyeth-Ayerst exited the  domestic infant formula market in 1996. By then Nestl\u00e9 had begun selling  infant formula and had at least one state WIC contract. By 2000, Nestl\u00e9 still  had the smallest market share of the three companies.", "In order to ensure the sustainability of competitive bidding, FNS has not  allowed provisions in cost-containment contracts that would have boosted  state savings when FNS believed those provisions would reduce  competition:    For example, during negations FNS held with New England and Tribal  Organization (NEATO) coalition from January 1995 through February  1996, FNS disapproved a contract provision that would have required that  manufacturers demonstrate that they had the production capacity  sufficient not only to meet infant formula contract commitments they had  with NEATO, but also commitments they had made with other states and  those to be awarded. NEATO included this provision, in part, because its  contractor at the time had run out of infant formula, and, as a result,  smaller states in the coalition did not have enough infant formula. FNS  rejected the requirement that manufacturers prove they could fulfill  contracts commitments with others states, which it viewed as intrusive  and which it felt hindered fair and open competition.", "Similarly, in 2005, FNS did not approve a contract provision that would  have allowed Wisconsin to continue with its current contractor if the bids  it received differed by $10,000 or less. Under the provision, the state could  have avoided expenses associated with switching contracts. FNS did not  approve the provision because it believed it would give the current  contract holder an advantage over the other two competitors.", "Several state WIC directors we interviewed questioned FNS\u2019 role in the  infant formula contracting process. Three state WIC directors pointed out  that infant formula cost containment was initiated by states. In addition, a  few state WIC directors noted that the manufacturers have stayed in the  WIC market for years, even though some say that providing infant formula  under these contracts is not profitable. FNS officials, however, pointed out  that Wyeth stopped bidding on WIC contracts, and that competition would  decrease if any other manufacturers stop bidding on WIC contracts.", "The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004contained two  provisions that promote competition among infant formula manufacturers  by limiting the size of contracts and coalitions to ensure all manufacturers  can bid on contracts regardless of their capacity:    A requirement that states or coalitions serving more than 100,000 infants  request separate bids for milk-based and soy-based infant formulas.", "Limits on the size of state coalitions.", "The act also addressed manufacturers\u2019 concerns about how WIC agencies  implement their infant formula contracts:    A requirement that states provide participants, as the infant formula of  first choice, the infant formula designated by the contract manufacturer as  its \u201cprimary contract infant formula.\u201d", "A requirement that manufacturers not only raise the rebates they provide  to states in response to any increase in wholesale price, but also lower the  rebates they provide to states by an amount equal to any decreases in  wholesale price.", "A requirement that states accurately account for the number of cans of  infant formula purchased, not just the number of vouchers redeemed at  retailers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Although states developed and implemented measures to contain the cost  of infant formula, FNS has played an increasingly important role in  balancing the goals of containing infant formula costs and maintaining  competition among infant formula manufacturers. FNS actions have not  always maximized the cost savings of individual states, but by ensuring  that all interested manufacturers can compete for WIC contracts, it has  helped to ensure the long-run sustainability of the WIC cost-containment  system. However, if manufacturers continue to emphasize a business  strategy focused on innovation and product differentiation, WIC cost- containment savings are likely to erode further despite existing measures  to protect state cost savings. By providing manufacturers with a higher  per-can reimbursement for newly introduced, more expensive products,  and by allowing states to issue non-contract, non-exempt infant formulas  to participants with physician prescriptions, federal regulations encourage  manufacturers to diversify their product lines and charge more for infant  formula, even within a contract period.

The officials said they generally agreed with our recommendations. They  stated that they will provide guidance related to product changes to assist  state agencies in minimizing cost increases when infant formula  manufacturers introduce a new infant formula that replaces the primary  contract infant formula. Officials agree that a regulatory change would be  necessary to require that state agencies include provisions in their  contracts to accomplish this goal. They cautioned, however, that they have  limited influence over the recent increases in infant formula costs  attributable to manufacturers\u2019 price and product changes. While we agree  that FNS is constrained in its ability to affect manufacturer marketing and  pricing decisions, we believe the agency should take any steps available to  contain infant formula costs given the importance of cost-containment  savings to serving as many eligible women, infants, and children as  possible.", "Agency officials also stated that they will continue to provide guidance to  state agencies related to the issuance of non-contract infant formula for  those states where the use of these infant formulas appears high.  However, officials expressed concern that some states may have  misreported their use of exempt and non-contract, non-exempt infant  formulas due to confusion over terminology and interpretation of the  survey instrument.  Officials noted that since some state agencies may  require the same medical documentation for exempt infant formulas, non- contract, non-exempt infant formulas, and certain contract infant formulas  other than the primary contract brand, some states may have  misunderstood the distinction between the three types of infant formula  we identified and misreported use of the different types of infant formula.  We believe that the survey provided sufficient examples to allow states to  distinguish between the three infant formula types we identified. We  pretested our survey with officials in five states, in which we discussed  their understanding of each question and the terms we used, and all of the  officials we spoke with understood the differences between the categories  of infant formula we identified. However, we acknowledge that because  states are not required to track infant formula use by the categories we  used or by the technical categories defined in the Infant Formula Act, our  estimates of the use of the three types of infant formula may not be  consistent across all states.", "Agency officials also expressed concern over the fact that we requested  data for non-contract and exempt infant formulas by the average monthly  percentage of total cans issued rather than by average monthly percentage  of participation. Agency officials stated that some state agencies capture  their data in terms of percentage of participation and this may have  contributed to misreporting. In our discussions with state officials, we  were told that because information on the number of cans provided  through WIC is usually used to bill manufacturers for infant formula  rebates, most states track the number of cans of infant formula provided  to WIC participants.", "In 2003, GAO reported similar findings related to use of non-contract  infant formula based on a survey that used different terminology and a  different measure of use. The consistency between the findings in the two  reports reinforces the ongoing importance of ensuring that states clearly  understand the distinction between the different types of non-contract  infant formula, monitoring the use of different types of infant formula, and  providing technical assistance to state agencies where use of non-contract  infant formula is high.", "Agency officials also provided technical comments, which we  incorporated into the report where appropriate.

All 51 survey recipients  responded to our survey, but not all respondents provided answers to  every question. Where fewer than 51 responses were provided, we noted in  the text the number of respondents on which the finding was based. We  pretested the survey questionnaire with state WIC officials in five states.  During these pretests, we administered the questionnaire and asked the  officials to fill it out as they would if they had received it in the mail. After  completing the questionnaire, we interviewed the respondents to ensure  that the questions were clear and unbiased, the data we requested were  feasible to collect, and the questionnaire did not place an undue burden on  the agency officials completing it. To encourage respondents to complete  the questionnaire, we sent one follow-up mailing containing the full survey  instrument to nonrespondents approximately 3 weeks after the initial  mailing and a second follow-up letter about 2 weeks later.", "We also conducted a review of literature on infant formula cost  containment and spoke with officials from the U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS); state WIC  directors in Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York,  Pennsylvania, and Washington; and local WIC directors from Belford, New  Jersey; Chicago, Illinois; Odessa, Texas; Salt Lake City, Utah; and Tempe,  Arizona. These state and local WIC directors were selected based on  recommendations of the National WIC Association and FNS and represent  several different geographic areas. We included states that belong to  contracting coalitions as well as those that contract themselves, and those  that had rebid their infant formula contracts recently as well as those that  last rebid their contracts several years ago. We also interviewed  individuals with expertise related to WIC and infant formula cost  containment from the National WIC Association and the Center on Budget  and Policy Priorities. In addition, we interviewed representatives from  Nestl\u00e9, Mead Johnson, and Ross Products to understand the perspectives  of the infant formula manufacturers.", "To assess trends in rebate savings and in the number of participants  served with rebate savings, we analyzed administrative data we received  from FNS on WIC program participation, food costs, and total rebates  from 1990 through 2005. We assessed the reliability of the data by  reviewing existing information about the data and the system that  produced them and interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the  data. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. We adjusted the rebate figures for inflation using  the producer price index for pharmaceuticals.

This allowed us to estimate the share of infant formula  spending that was spent on rebated infant formula and the share that was  spent on non-rebated infant formula including exempt and non-contract,  non-exempt infant formulas. We then held spending on non-rebated infant  formulas constant, and estimated the reduction in total rebates that would  have resulted if the average rebate states received through their cost- containment contracts in 2004 had been lower than the actual average  discount of 93 percent of the wholesale price of milk-based concentrate.   We considered three scenarios to represent recent trends in infant formula  rebates, either nationwide or in individual states:      A reduction in rebates from 93 percent of the wholesale price of infant  formula to 90 percent of the wholesale price of infant formula, a modest  decrease to rebate levels experienced by states in 2000.", "A moderate decrease to 85 percent of the wholesale price of infant  formula, the average rebate on newly awarded contracts in 2004.", "A larger decrease to 75 percent of the wholesale price of infant formula, a  decrease similar to that experienced by two states.", "To estimate trends in the per-can cost of infant formula, we also analyzed  information we received from FNS on the rebates individual states  received per can of milk-based concentrate infant formula from fiscal  years 2000 to 2005.
