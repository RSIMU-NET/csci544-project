In  addition, a representative from an organization representing indigenous  communities said that USAID helped his group recognize the threat that  subsistence farming by poor indigenous people poses to the forest and  identify options that are less damaging. The U.S. Forest Service is also  helping Peru build technical capacity for forest management and  monitoring, and improve institutional capacity for forest administration,  according to its officials. Forest Service officials said a key activity to help  Peru increase effective implementation and enforcement of its  environmental laws and multilateral commitments was a project to  develop a prototype for an information and control system for forest and  wildlife resources. The system tracks timber that originates from the  Amazon forest in Peru by creating electronic records of harvested timber  that allows officials to monitor the flow of the timber, including CITES- listed species. Forest Service officials also said the prototype is designed  to replace a paper-based system, which is subject to fraud and  falsification of documents, and allow operators to limit opportunities for  illegally harvested timber to enter the chain of custody. The U.S. Forest  Service has also helped Peru provide training and outreach to civil  society\u2014particularly indigenous communities\u2014in order to solicit  comments on the draft regulations and enhance public participation in  environmental decision making. In addition, the U.S. Forest Service  helped Peru implement an online portal to gather public comment on the  regulations, and provided training to Peru on management and analysis  of public comment. Finally, the U.S. Forest Service supported Peru in  developing the methodology, management, dissemination, and legal  framework for field-based forest inventory data as well as remote sensing  data for improved coordination and management of the Amazon forest,  according to officials.

For  example, in El Salvador we visited the wastewater reference laboratory  that EPA helped set up, as well as several private firms that participated  in cleaner production activities, including a boutique hotel, a producer of  dairy products; and a dairy and pig farm. Among the project sites we  visited in Guatemala were the Cleaner Production Center, the ARCAS  Wildlife Rescue Center, and a sawmill in the Pet\u00e9n region. In Chile, we  met with World Wildlife Fund officials and a group of olive oil producers  participating in a clean production program. Finally, we visited a number  of project sites in the Ucayali province in Peru. For example, we visited a  site where logs are transported from the Amazon region down the river to  sawmills for processing. We witnessed a demonstration of USAID\u2019s and  U.S. Forest Service\u2019s prototype of an electronic tracking system. In  addition, we met with regional government officials and officials  implementing the USAID/ Peru-Bosque project to enhance public  participation by helping local groups and indigenous people comment on  draft regulations for the new Forestry and Wildlife Law.", "To examine selected partner mechanisms to process public  environmental submissions, we reviewed the environmental chapters of  FTAs, which entered into force from 2003 through 2013, to determine  which agreements required the establishment of an independent body,  such as a secretariat, to receive and respond to citizen submissions. We  interviewed officials at State, USTR, and USAID. In addition, we  interviewed officials at the CAFTA-DR Secretariat for Environmental  Matters in Guatemala City, Guatemala; and analyzed data obtained from  the CAFTA-DR Secretariat to determine the number of citizen  submissions it had received, and the number of factual records published  since the establishment of the CAFTA-DR Secretariat. To determine the  status of negotiations for establishing the Peru Secretariat for  Environmental Matters, we interviewed officials from USTR, State, and  the Organization of American States; and submitted questions to officials  in the government of Peru.", "To examine U.S. resources to assist partners in implementing  environmental commitments, we collected budget data on funding of FTA  environmental activities from State and USAID. To show trends in total  funding for environmental activities by FTA, we aggregated funding for  each FTA across agencies and plotted total funding over the years in  which the FTA was in effect. We depicted total resources for each FTA by  adding available funding data across both agencies and years in which  the FTA was active. We also used FTA-level budget data to show the  allocation of funding across programs. We asked USTR officials for  estimates of staff resources dedicated to FTA implementation and  monitoring. We assessed the reliability of the data by (1) performing  electronic testing for errors in accuracy and completeness and (2)  interviewing agency officials knowledgeable about the data sources. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for illustrating trends in  FTA-related environmental assistance across agencies.", "To examine how State monitors FTA environmental cooperation activities  and USTR monitors partner compliance with FTA environmental  commitments, we interviewed officials at State and USTR and  implementing agencies, including EPA, Justice, Interior, USAID, the U.S.", "Forest Service and NOAA. In addition, we interviewed officials from the  Organization of American States and Le Groupe-conseil Baastel  (Baastel), a private firm, which have assisted State with collecting,  analyzing, and reporting the results of nine partner countries under four  agreements. Furthermore, we reviewed documentation, such as data  collection templates, monitoring reports, and performance management  plans from State, the Organization of American States, Baastel, and  supporting U.S. agencies, such as EPA and USAID. We interviewed  officials at USTR, and reviewed documentation, such as its plan to  monitor compliance and implementation. Furthermore, we reviewed  cables detailing the status of the environment in partner countries over  the past 5 years. USTR requested this information\u2014through State\u2014from  U.S. embassies in partner countries, to collect information as part of its  plan to monitor progress under the provisions. We interviewed officials at  USTR to identify mechanisms that it uses\u2014such as the Interagency  Timber Committee\u2014to monitor compliance and implementation of  provisions in the environmental chapter of the Peru Trade Promotion  Agreement, and its Annex on Forest Sector Governance. Also, we  reviewed documentation, such as the environmental chapter of the Peru  Trade Promotion Agreement, and its Annex on Forest Sector  Governance, the matrix detailing the status of implementing provisions  provided to USTR and the public by the government of Peru, and the  Joint Communiqu\u00e9 of the Meetings of the Governments of the United  States and Peru Regarding Forest Sector Governance.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2013 to November 2014  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Agriculture\u2019s U.S. Forest Service", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Kim Frankena, (Assistant  Director), Tom Zingale (Analyst-in-Charge), Kyerion Printup and John  O\u2019trakoun made key contributions to this report.
