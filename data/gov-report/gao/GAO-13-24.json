As a result, NHTSA cannot currently identify how many crashes involve vehicles carrying unsecured loads. NHTSA intends to make changes to both its systems to better identify crashes involving unsecured loads. These changes will go into effect in 2013. However, NHTSA may still face challenges collecting this data because 1) law enforcement officials face difficulties in determining whether a crash involved an unsecured load and 2) states do not collect uniform data on unsecured loads in their police crash reports. NHTSA officials stated that they would likely recommend changes to the Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria (MMUCC)\u0097voluntary guidelines intended to create uniform data in police crash reports; however, the revised guidelines will not be released until 2017 because of MMUCC\u0092s 5-year cycle of updates.

However, the exact number of crashes involving non- commercial vehicles carrying unsecured loads is unknown, in part  because there is no mechanism for distinguishing road obstructions  resulting from human error, such as an unsecured load, and those  involving natural elements such as a fallen tree. Moreover, while the  Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates securing  cargo on commercial vehicles, similar federal regulations for non- commercial vehicles do not exist.

NHTSA officials stated that they will make every effort to capture the data  available in the source documents to provide the most accurate  assessment of this safety issue.", "Even though NHTSA is improving its data systems, determining whether  a crash is a result of an unsecured load will remain a challenge. Several  law enforcement officials we spoke with indicated that classifying a crash  involving an unsecured load is difficult in some cases, because it is  unclear whether the object on the road was as a result of an unsecured  load or another factor. One law enforcement official explained that if an  object falls from a moving vehicle and immediately hits a vehicle or a  person, the crash is generally classified as an unsecured-load crash.  However, if an object falls from a moving vehicle onto the road and  remains on the road for some time before another vehicle subsequently  strikes the object, then the crash will generally not be classified as an  unsecured-load crash unless there is a witness available to report that the  object originally fell off of another vehicle (see fig. 2). The official  explained that identifying the first incident as an unsecured-load crash is  generally easier because of a higher likelihood of witnesses at the scene  who saw the crash occur and saw the unsecured-load fall from the  vehicle. In the second scenario, where debris remains on the road for  some time, there may be no information to explain how the object on the  road ended up there. According to this official, it is up to the reporting  officer to determine how to classify or describe the crash in the police  report. Under NHTSA\u2019s planned data system changes, the agency will be  able to specify in their data systems crashes that involve unsecured loads  if all pertinent information is available to the reporting officer. However, if  the incident is not identified by the reporting officer as an unsecured-load  crash in the first place, it may not be flagged as such in NHTSA\u2019s data  systems. NHTSA officials acknowledged that it can be difficult in some  cases to determine if something in the road fell off a vehicle if there is no  evidence available.", "States do not uniformly define and report data on unsecured loads in  police crash reports. NHTSA uses information from police crash reports to  determine whether a crash is an unsecured-load incident or another type  of incident.

NHTSA uses information from both sections of the report in  developing their data. However, in some cases, information about  whether a crash involved an unsecured load may not be included in the  narrative portion of the police reports. According to NHTSA officials,  reports on fatal crashes are more likely to have this information; however,  the level of information that is included in the narrative report could vary  from officer to officer. If a police crash report does not contain information  indicating that a crash involved an unsecured load, then NHTSA cannot  classify the crash as such.", "On a voluntary basis, most states have begun collecting a similar  minimum core of information in their police crash reports. These core  elements are outlined in the Model Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria  (MMUCC), voluntary guidelines for the implementation of uniform crash  data elements.guidelines to varying degrees. One avenue for ensuring that all states  collect consistent information on unsecured loads in their police crash  reports would be to include unsecured-load data as a core data element  in the next edition of the guidelines. NHTSA does not have independent  authority to seek changes in state police reports; however, NHTSA  officials stated that they will likely recommend changes to MMUCC  guidelines. In order for a new data element to be added, it must be  approved by the MMUCC Expert Panel, which includes representatives  from NHTSA, FMCSA, the Federal Highway Administration, the National  Transportation Safety Board, the Governors Highway Safety Association,  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Ford Motor Company, Emergency  Medical System agencies, and local and state police agencies.

If changes are made to the guidelines, these  changes would not go into effect until after 2017. NHTSA officials also  noted that making changes to police crash reports in response to  changes in the guidelines can take from 12 to 18 months. Some police  agencies now use electronic police crash reports, and as a result,  changes to the police crash reports could require information technology  infrastructure investments to update their electronic systems. Moreover,  additional training of police officers regarding how to use the new data  elements would be required.
