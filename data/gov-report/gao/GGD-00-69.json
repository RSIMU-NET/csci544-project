The Department of Justice has not provided us with the legal analysis underlying this position.  As a result of this interpretation, COPS determined that it had to pay such costs from COPS operating funds. COPS officials said that, while they made an effort to provide staffing to the Police Corps program, their options were limited because the entire COPS Office was understaffed.

Although the Police Corps statute is silent regarding the payment of federal administrative costs, we believe that options were available to the COPS office for the payment of these costs. In our view, the COPS office could have charged the Police Corps line-item appropriations for fiscal years 1996 through 1998 to pay for these costs. A primary statute dealing with the use of appropriated funds, 31 U.S.C. 1301(a), provides that \u201cAppropriations shall be applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as otherwise provided by law.\u201d However, it does not require, nor would it be reasonably possible, that every item of expenditure be specified in an appropriation act. The spending agency has reasonable discretion in determining how to carry out the objects of the appropriation.  This concept is known as the \u201cnecessary expense\u201d doctrine.", "For an expenditure to be justified under the necessary expense doctrine, three tests must be met: (1) the expenditure must bear a logical relationship to the appropriation to be charged; (2) the expenditure must not be prohibited by law; and (3) the expenditure cannot be authorized if it is otherwise provided for under a more specific appropriation or statutory funding mechanism. Under the first test, the key determination is the extent to which the proposed expenditure will contribute to accomplishing the purposes of the appropriation the agency wishes to charge. Clearly, any administrative costs incurred by COPS in implementing the Police Corps program should contribute to accomplishing the purposes of that program. Concerning the second and third tests, the payment of federal administrative costs is not prohibited by law, nor were federal administrative costs otherwise provided for under a more specific appropriation. Thus, the COPS office could have paid these administrative costs from the Police Corps\u2019 line item appropriations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Believe Program Delays Caused by Lack of State Administrative and Recruiting Funds", "paragraphs": ["According to COPS officials, the Police Corps statute did not allow for federal reimbursement of states\u2019 administrative or recruiting costs.

The lead agency is obligated to provide overall program management, which includes developing and monitoring the state plan as well as the outreach, selection, and placement of the participants.
