Religious worker visas constituted about 11,000, of the 7 million immigrant  and nonimmigrant visas issued in fiscal year 1997.  The Department of State  and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) share responsibility  for issuing visas and admitting aliens into the United States.  As a result of  some recent fraud investigations, both agencies have expressed concern  that some individuals and organizations that sponsor religious workers  may be exploiting this category to enable unqualified aliens to enter or stay  in the United States illegally.", "At your request, we determined (1) the extent and nature of any fraud INS  and State have identified in the religious worker visa program and (2) any  steps INS and State have taken or plan to take to change the visa screening  process.  To meet our objectives, we interviewed INS and State  headquarters officials, and we visited INS facilities in California, New York,  Texas, and Vermont responsible for processing visas and investigating  fraud.  We also met with representatives of 12 religious organizations  involved in the program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990 established special immigrant  and nonimmigrant categories for religious workers, religious professionals,  and ministers.  The act authorizes special immigrants to be admitted to the  United States as religious workers if, for 2 years prior to admission, they  have been members of a religious denomination having a bona fide,  nonprofit, religious organization in the United States; they intend to enter  the United States to work for the organization at the organization's request  in a religious vocation or occupation; and they have been carrying on the  religious work continuously for at least 2 years immediately preceding their  application for admission.  The act established a limit of 5,000 on the  number of special immigrant religious workers and religious professionals  that can be admitted in any one year.   Although the special immigrant  provisions for religious workers and religious professionals were to expire  on October 1, 1994, they have been amended twice and extended to  October 1, 2000.", "Applying for an immigrant religious worker visa is a two-step process.   First, a petition must be filed with INS.  A petition is the form the  sponsoring individual or organization must file on behalf of an alien to  demonstrate that the alien meets the requirements of a specific  immigration category.  The petition must include supporting  documentation showing that the religious worker will be working for a  religious organization and how the religious worker will be paid or  remunerated.  The documentation should also clearly indicate that the  religious worker will not be solely dependent on supplemental employment  or solicitation of funds for support.  INS reviewers examine the petitions  and supporting documentation to determine if the alien meets the program  requirements.  If INS approves the petition, the alien files an application for  an adjustment of status with INS if he or she is already in the United States  or an application for a visa with a State overseas post if he or she is abroad.   If the alien does not meet the requirements, INS denies the petition.  About  85 percent of those admitted for permanent residence as religious workers  in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 were already in the United States.", "Nonimmigrant religious workers can be admitted under the same  conditions as special immigrant religious workers, except that there is no  requirement for prior religious work experience, and the maximum period  of stay for nonimmigrant religious workers is 5 years.  The authorization  for admission of nonimmigrant religious workers did not contain sunset  restrictions nor any limit on the number that can be admitted.  To obtain a  nonimmigrant visa, the alien files an application, but no petition is required.   Documentation required in support of the visa application must establish  the arrangements made, if any, for remuneration, including the amount and  source of any salary, a description of any other type of remuneration, and a  statement indicating whether the remuneration will be in exchange for  services rendered.  The majority of nonimmigrant religious workers applies  and receives their visas abroad through State's overseas posts. (See app. I  for more information on immigrant and nonimmigrant religious worker  visa issuance.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Extent and Nature of Fraud", "paragraphs": ["Both INS and State have expressed concern about fraud in the religious  worker visa program, but they do not have data or analysis to firmly  establish the extent of the problem.  Their knowledge of program fraud is  based on information developed primarily from fraud investigations and  through the visa screening process.  INS has conducted several fraud  investigations since 1994 involving hundreds of applicants.  In addition,  fraud has been identified through INS' and State's visa screening processes.   The agencies' reviewers generally deny petitions and visas to unqualified  applicants, but according to the agencies' officials, it is difficult to prove  willful intent to commit fraud.  The types of fraud the agencies have  encountered often involved petitioners making false statements about the  length of time that the applicant was a member of the religious organization  and the nature of the qualifying work experience.   Some of the  investigations involved religious organizations petitioning for more  workers than they can reasonably support.  Evidence uncovered by INS  suggests that some of these organizations exist solely as a means to carry  out immigration fraud."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Extent of Fraud Not Known", "paragraphs": ["INS and State have uncovered incidents of fraud in the religious worker  visa program, but they do not routinely investigate questionable visa  petitions and applications or report fraud information by type of visa.   State's Bureau of Diplomatic Security, the office responsible for  investigating the use of counterfeit U.S. passports and visas, has not  conducted any investigations of religious worker visa fraud.  State's  antifraud units at overseas posts sometimes review suspicious applications  to screen out ineligible applicants, but they do not routinely report the  results to State's headquarters.  Individual cases of suspected fraud are  generally not investigated, unless the suspected fraud is part of a larger  scheme to systematically circumvent immigration laws.  Moreover, INS  does not routinely follow up on recipients of employment-based visas,  including religious visas, to determine whether they comply with the law.", "The agencies generally deny questionable visa petitions and applications  they receive.  Most are not denied for fraud, but for other reasons, such as  failing to comply with statutory requirements and regulations, including  failure to provide requested documents.  They give fraud as the reason for  the denial when they have sufficient evidence that the applicant or  petitioner willfully misrepresented a material fact.  An INS workload report  on immigrant petitions received, approved, and denied, showed that of the  approximately 8,400 petitions for religious workers processed in fiscal year  1998, 3 percent were denied for suspected fraud.  The reported 3-percent  fraud denial rate for religious worker petitions was the third highest fraud  denial rate among the 44 different immigrant petition categories listed.  The  fraud denial rate for most of the other categories was less than 1 percent.   State Department statistics on visa denials do not identify denials by type  of visa.  However, a 1998 State survey of 83 overseas posts identified  instances of fraud uncovered during visa processing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Investigations Illustrate Schemes Used to Circumvent Immigration Laws", "paragraphs": ["At our request, the Fraud Branch at INS' Office of Investigations in  Washington, D.C., surveyed fraud units in INS' district and suboffices to  identify the number of active and closed fraud investigations involving  religious worker visas since 1994.  The units identified 54 such  investigations involving about 1,700 petitions during the 5-year period.   The 54 INS investigations, of which about 40 are closed, ranged from cases  involving individual fraud schemes to organized fraud rings.  For  example, the fraud unit in the Chicago District Office investigated 30 cases  involving individuals who failed to meet the 2-year experience requirement.   At least five investigations performed by INS since 1994 have involved  individuals or organizations filing petitions for hundreds of religious  workers.   For example, in 1995, INS investigated a pastor who filed 450  immigrant religious worker petitions covering over 900 individuals,  falsifying the number of years the aliens had been a member of the church.   The pastor died of natural causes before an indictment could be returned,  and the petitions were denied or allowed to expire.  INS recently completed  an investigation it started in 1994 involving suspects who provided false  supporting documents to INS to show that the aliens met the 2-year work  experience requirement.  This investigation, which involved over 400  petitions, ultimately led to the arrests of six individuals, guilty pleas to  charges of conspiracy to commit visa fraud, and additional investigations  of several similar schemes.  In another recent case, reviewers at INS'  Vermont Service Center became suspicious when one organization, which  had filed about 100 petitions for immigrant visas the previous 2 years  combined, filed over 200 petitions the third year.  The reviewers doubted  that the organization could support so many full-time workers and referred  the case to an INS district office fraud unit where it is currently under  investigation.", "Some investigations were initiated because of suspicious activity identified  by State Department consular officials.  For example, consular officers at  the U.S. embassy in Suva, Fiji, became suspicious of a church that filed  petitions on behalf of 30 individuals from Fiji who were in the United States  on expired visitors' visas.  The information was forwarded to INS for  investigation.  The investigation revealed that only 1 of the 30 petitions met  the requirements for a religious worker visa.  The post suspected that this  scheme was related to a larger one involving petitions on behalf of Tonga  residents to stay in the United States illegally.  Also, the U.S. embassy in  Bogota uncovered a fraud scheme in which the local church was providing  applicants with false documents to demonstrate that the applicants had  been members of the church for the required 2-year period.  The embassy's  antifraud unit discovered that in some cases the applicants had recently  joined the church, and in other cases, they had no membership affiliation at  all."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Changes to the Visa Screening Process", "paragraphs": ["INS and State reviewers stated that they are not confident that the  agencies' screening process is identifying all unqualified applicants and  sponsoring organizations.

The reviewer can deny the  application or petition pending the receipt of additional information, but  such actions take more time.  The INS reviewers stated that more specific  information about the applicant's training and qualifications and the exact  nature of the position to be filled, including the number of petitions  previously filed, should be provided up front, similar to other employment-based visa categories.  In addition, unlike most other  employment-based visas, the applicant can file a petition on his or her own  behalf and, although supporting documentation from the sponsoring  organization is still required, all of it can be submitted by the applicant.  For  most other employment-based visa categories, the petition and supporting  documentation must be submitted by the potential employer.  The  reviewers believe INS should require information from independently  verifiable sources. The reviewers also stated that the documents should be  current.  They said that sometimes the sponsoring organizations submit  copies of their original tax-exemption form, which may no longer be valid.", "A related issue raised by State's overseas posts concerns the definition of a  \"religious worker.\"  They believe that the definition of religious worker is  too broad, making the religious worker visa program an attractive vehicle  for fraud and abuse.  According to the survey, posts sometimes struggled  with what they considered to be the \"marginal\" nature of some of the  religious positions used by the applicants.  A common sentiment was that  almost anyone involved with a church, aside from those occupations that  were not intended to be covered by the 1990 religious worker visa  legislation, for example, maintenance and cleaning staff, could qualify as a  religious worker."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "INS Is Considering Steps to Address the Problems", "paragraphs": ["INS is developing a number of initiatives to improve its visa screening  process and to detect and deter fraud.  Most of these initiatives are focused  on requiring petitions to include more comprehensive information to allow  reviewers to make better informed decisions.  Some of the service centers  are using the capabilities of commercial software to enhance their ability to  identify patterns and trends that may indicate fraud.  State officials said  they would support INS' efforts to increase evidentiary standards.

The proposed rule  also states that the documentation supporting an applicant's petition must  indicate that the religious worker will be working for the religious  organization in the United States on a full-time basis.  INS officials stated  that INS is changing the regulation to address the problem of individuals  doing part-time voluntary work for a religious organization while working  full-time in a secular occupation.  They said an applicant's ability to  demonstrate 2 years of prior full-time, paid religious work experience is a  good indication that the individual is a committed religious worker.  They  also believe such experience is a good indicator that the individual will be  doing full-time religious work for which the organization will pay a salary.

Such  documents could include pay stubs to show that the worker was  compensated for full-time work and bank statements to demonstrate that  the organizations have sufficient financial resources to support their  worker or workers.  INS has the authority to ask for additional evidence to  verify information in the petitions, and some INS reviewers will defer  making a final decision until the organization furnishes this type of  supplemental information.  The suggested change involving additional  documentation would increase the amount of information that all  organizations must initially submit and that all adjudicators would use to  review petitions.  By initially requiring more specific documents and by  clarifying the full-time religious work requirements, INS may also reduce  the number of filings by unqualified applicants.", "INS has no timetable for implementing the changes to the requirements for  supporting documents.  However, INS officials stated that they might revise  the documentary requirements after the agency redrafts or finalizes its  proposed rule change on the full-time work experience requirement.

However,  until a pattern had been identified, the reviewers could not know if the  petitions were potentially fraudulent.  For example, one organization  currently under investigation had 37 petitions approved in fiscal year 1996  and 76 petitions approved in fiscal year 1997 before the pattern was  detected.  While all service centers now have the capability to identify  multiple filers, the California and Vermont Service Centers have developed  their own systems using commercial off-the-shelf software  (Microsoft SQL  for California and Oracle and Access for Vermont), which they believe  provides more efficient inquiry and reporting capability than the system  provided by INS headquarters.

The religious organizations generally believed that  the program met their needs.  For example, several of the organizations use  the program to meet the needs of growing ethnic congregations.  One  church with 7,000 members uses the program to provide workers to  minister to its separate Filipino, Korean, Hispanic, and French- and  English-speaking African congregations.  A religious organization with a  worldwide membership uses the program to recruit native speakers  familiar with the religion to serve as religious translators and broadcasters.   Another religious organization with 3 million members in more than 120  countries uses nonimmigrant religious workers to participate in church-sponsored community service programs.", "We asked representatives of the organizations for their opinions of INS'  proposed changes to the program.  Of the seven commenting on the full-time work experience requirement, four stated that the proposal would  not negatively affect their organization, because the majority of the  applicants they sponsor for immigrant religious worker visas have already  been serving in full-time capacities.  However, three expressed  reservations.   For example, the representative of one religious  organization stated that the requirement might adversely affect applicants  who work for congregations in which ministerial duties are shared.  The  representative of another organization stated that the full-time work  experience requirement could be problematic for those engaged in  religious vocations if proof of paid full-time work was required, because  some individuals are often not paid a salary.  He said the requirement could  also cause problems for some individuals who perform their religious  duties part-time while studying for the priesthood or ministry.", "Three of the four religious organizations commenting on the proposed  change in documentary evidence requirements stated that the change  would not pose a problem.  However, the one opposed to the proposed  change pointed out that INS already has the discretion to ask for additional  documents when required and does not believe that religious employers  and applicants should routinely be required to assume additional  documentary burdens.  Some representatives also stated that INS should  avoid the appearance of deciding for a religious organization what  constitutes religious work.", "In addition to asking for their opinions on the potential modifications  proposed by INS, we also asked the religious organizations for their  suggestions for improving the program.  Three of the organizations  suggested making the special immigrant religious worker visa category  permanent.  The representative of one of the religious organizations said  this would eliminate the glut of petitions that are filed before the \"sunset\"  date.  One organization that was familiar with student visas suggested that  a sponsoring organization could submit to INS an annual status report on  each of its nonimmigrant religious workers, much like academic  institutions that must annually certify the status of foreign students.
