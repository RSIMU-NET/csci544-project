Prescription products are available only in licensed pharmacies, whereas other products are available over the counter in a wide variety of settings. OTC products are generally for conditions where users can recognize their own symptoms and levels of relief.", "VA allows its physicians to prescribe OTC products primarily because VA physicians and others are concerned that veterans who need such products may lack sufficient resources to purchase them and, as a result, not use them. VA requires prescriptions as a way to control veterans\u2019 access to OTC products in VA pharmacies. Last year, VA physicians provided veterans with over 34 million prescriptions for pharmaceuticals, including OTC products, to be used on an outpatient basis. VA\u2019s 165 pharmacies filled prescriptions more than 65 million times, at a cost of almost $1 billion.", "In recent years, VA officials have testified that resources are not sufficient to serve all veterans seeking care and that they expect such shortages to worsen in future years.

First, VA physicians generally provide veterans more prescriptions for medications than supplies, thereby causing pharmacies to handle medications more often. Second, ingredient costs of medications are generally significantly lower than the cost of medical supplies.", "VA recovered an estimated $7 million of these costs through veterans\u2019 copayments.

Copayments collected cover a relatively small portion of these costs, for several reasons. First, the $2 copayment collected for a 30-day supply represents only a portion of the ingredient, dispensing, and collection costs of most OTC medications and dietary supplements. Second, copayments are not required for medical supplies. Third, most veterans receiving medications and dietary supplements are exempted, and some nonexempt veterans do not pay copayments owed.", "For individual OTC products, veterans\u2019 medication copayments ranged between 4 percent to more than 100 percent of VA\u2019s costs, depending on the type of OTC product and the quantities dispensed.

For example, veterans received OTC products, such as phosphate enemas, magnesium citrate, and prep kits needed for barium enemas in preparation for colonoscopies and other diagnostic tests.

For example, diabetic veterans use insulin to control their blood sugar, spinal cord and Parkinson\u2019s patients use stool softeners to alleviate fecal impaction, veterans suffering renal failure use sodium bicarbonate tablets to balance their electrolytes, and veterans who have suffered heart attacks or strokes use aspirin to prevent secondary occurrences.", "However, whether many veterans\u2019 conditions would require hospitalization in the immediate future without the use of other OTC products is not clear. Such products include antacids for heartburn, skin preparation products for dry skin, acetaminophen for arthritis pain, and cough medications for common colds.

By law, VA has the option of not providing OTC products if a veteran refuses to make a medication copayment at the time the product is dispensed. VA officials, however, told us that it is not their policy to withhold OTC products from nonpayers for this reason.", "Administrative costs are significant in relation to the total copayment collections. A VA-sponsored study estimated that VA facilities spend about 38 cents for every $1 collected to prepare medication copayment bills, mail them, and resolve questions. If the Baltimore facility\u2019s costs approximate this rate, it incurred an estimated $26,000 to collect $67,000 for OTC products in fiscal year 1995.

The Baltimore pharmacy has already shifted most of its dispensing of dietary supplements to the store.", "VA Canteen Service stores do not use federal funds to operate and generally provide items at a discount, in large part because they do not have the expense of advertising. By allowing these stores to dispense OTC products, VA may reduce both dispensing and ingredient costs for its pharmacies.

Toward this end, VA may need to provide better guidance to facilities to achieve an effective and consistent use of OTC products within its existing statutory authority.", "VA should be commended for instructing network directors to consolidate formularies. This action, which is currently in progress, has not yet achieved an adequate level of consistency or cost-containment systemwide because the networks current formularies approximate the more generous coverage of OTC products. Moreover, some networks are allowing facilities to have less generous coverage of OTC products than these networks\u2019 formularies. This will likely maintain the uneven availability of OTC products.", "Given the disagreement among networks and facilities regarding the provision of OTC products, additional guidance may be needed to ensure that veterans have a consistent level of access to OTC products systemwide. In light of concerns about potential resource shortages at some facilities, tailoring the availability of OTC products to be more in line with those less generous facilities would seem desirable. This would essentially limit OTC products to those most directly related to VA hospitalizations or those considered most essential to obviate the need for hospitalization, such as insulin for diabetic veterans.", "VA facilities could also reduce their costs if they restructured OTC product dispensing and copayment collection processes. In general, most facilities handle OTC products too many times, mail products too often, and allow veterans to delay copayments too frequently.
