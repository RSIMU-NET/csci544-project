This  provision amended 31 U.S.C. 732(c)\u2014which required employees\u2019 pay to be  adjusted at the same time and to the same extent as the General Schedule.  Under section 3(b) the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to establish the  annual pay adjustment is also applicable to employees in the Senior  Executive Service (SES) and in Senior Level (SL) positions. Under both  sections 3(a) and 3(b) an employee must be performing at a satisfactory  level in order to receive an annual pay adjustment  In January 2006, we issued regulations addressing the satisfactory  performance requirement for GAO\u2019s analysts and attorneys. Pursuant to the  regulation, GAO analysts and attorneys had to be performing at \u201cMeets  Expectations\u201d in all competencies to be considered satisfactory. In addition,  most Band IIB and Band III analysts, had to have a performance appraisal  that was in the top 50 percent or 80 percent, respectively, of their band and  team. In subsequent years this added condition was not required. Since the  annual adjustment is a significant component of employees\u2019 annual  compensation, limiting its applicability to satisfactory performers is critical  to the integrity of GAO\u2019s overall pay for performance system.", "For calendar years 2006 through 2009, consistent with section 31 U.S.C.  732 (c)(3), the Comptroller General considered various data to determine  the amount of GAO\u2019s annual adjustments, including    salary planning data reported by the professional services, public  administration, and general industry organizations;  the General Schedule adjustment;  the amount of Performance Based Compensation (PBC) and the appropriate  distribution of funds between the annual adjustment and PBC. and    GAO\u2019s funding levels.", "The Comptroller General provided an annual adjustment in 2006 and 2007 of  2.6 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively, to those who were performing at a  satisfactory level and who were paid within applicable competitive  compensation limits, except for wage-grade employees, and GAO Personnel  Appeals Board employees. In addition to the annual adjustment, GAO  employees were eligible for PBC based on their performance appraisal  ratings. PBC was calculated using a budget factor of 2.15 percent for both  2006 and 2007. Under section 3(b), the Comptroller General is required to  consider the statutory criteria set out in section 3(a) in determining an annual  increase for members of the GAO SES and SL employees. The Comptroller  General considered these criteria and determined that each member  performing at a satisfactory level would receive in 2006 and 2007 a 1.9 percent  and 1.7 percent increase, respectively\u2014the same increase that was provided  to the Executive Schedule for calendar years 2006 and 2007, respectively. In  2007, SES and SL members were also eligible for PBC using a budget factor of  2.25 percent.", "In 2008, after the Comptroller General made preliminary determinations  regarding pay adjustments as had been done in 2006 and 2007, GAO  management negotiated with representatives of the newly established  GAO Employees Association, International Federation of Professional and  Technical Engineers (IFPTE) Local 1921 to reach final agreement  regarding salary adjustments. In addition to the annual adjustment, GAO  employees were eligible for PBC based on their performance appraisal  ratings. Pay adjustments for GAO staff included an annual adjustment of  3.5 percent as well as performance based compensation using a budget  factor of 2.75 percent.", "In 2008, for the first time, GAO implemented a \u201cfloor guarantee.\u201d The 2008  floor guarantee provided that if the total increase from the annual  adjustment and PBC did not equal at least 4.49 percent of salary, the  employee would receive an additional increase to base pay to equal this  amount regardless of geographic location. For example, in Washington,  D.C., the floor guarantee ensured that all staff received a base pay increase  of at least 4.49 percent and was provided without regard to pay range  maximums limited only by the GS-15, step 10, statutory maximum rate. In  providing the floor guarantee to staff, the additional amount required to  bring the base pay adjustment to 4.49 percent of salary was deducted from  any PBC bonus. Overall, the average total dollar amount resulting from  employees\u2019 annual adjustments, PBC base pay increases and bonuses, and  floor guarantees was approximately 6.12 percent of salary.", "GAO employees participating in one of GAO\u2019s development programs  (Professional Development Program, Attorney Development Program,  Communication Analysts Pay Process, Program and Technical  Development Program, and Administrative Pay Process) received the   3.5 percent annual adjustment, not to exceed the maximum rate of their  bands. These employees were not eligible for the floor guarantee because  they received additional performance-based salary increases every   6 months for the 2-year duration of the development program.", "GAO\u2019s SES and SL employees were provided the same 2.5 percent increase  authorized for the executive branch. SES and SL members were also eligible  for PBC using a budget factor of 2.25 percent.

In response to continuing differences between  African American and Caucasian analyst performance appraisal averages, the  Ivy Planning Group conducted an independent assessment of the factors that  may influence these differences, and was also tasked with identifying what  additional steps GAO could take.

GAO established its Management Improvement Priorities  Action Plan that includes five areas of concentration: recognizing and  valuing diversity; reassessing the performance appraisal system; managing  workload, sustaining quality, and streamlining processes; enhancing  staffing practices and developing the workforce; and, finally, strengthening  recruitment and retention incentives. Projects within these five areas  originated from multiple sources, including the Ivy Planning Group's  recommendations, CG Special Projects, and suggestions received over  time from GAO staff at all levels throughout the agency. These areas also  reflect the ongoing efforts of the Office of Opportunity and Inclusiveness,  QCI, the Human Capital Office, and the Chief Administrative Office.", "GAO completed one of the key management improvement projects\u2014a full,  systematic, and inclusive review of the performance appraisal system.

Data collected included a comprehensive  content analysis of existing data, the results of 28 focus groups of  employees, and 53 semistructured interviews with managing directors and  a random sample of SES/SL, Band III, and field office managers. In  addition, GAO conducted an agencywide, Web-based survey of employees,  with an overall survey response rate of 67 percent.
