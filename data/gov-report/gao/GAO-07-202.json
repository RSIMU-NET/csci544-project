In 2000, Congress passed the Long-Term Care Security Act, requiring the federal government to offer long-term care insurance. To do so, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) contracted with Long Term Care Partners LLC (Partners) to create the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program. This is the second of two reports required by the act on the competitiveness of the federal program. GAO's March 31, 2006, report, Long-Term Care Insurance: Federal Program Compared Favorably with Other Products, and Analysis of Claims Trend Could Inform Future Decisions (GAO-06-401), found that the federal program's benefits and premiums compared favorably with other plans, but enrollment and claims experience--the amount and number of claims payments--were lower than Partners expected. In this report, GAO compared the federal program's profit structure and marketing efforts with those of other plans and updated its analysis of the program's claims experience. GAO reviewed the contract between OPM and Partners and interviewed OPM, Partners, and insurance carrier officials, as well as actuaries and industry experts. GAO also analyzed data on claim payments for the federal program since it began in 2002."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program has a unique profit structure that is explicitly defined in the contract between OPM and Partners. This profit structure consists of three distinct annual payments to Partners: (1) a guaranteed payment of 3.5 percent of the year's collected premiums, (2) a payment linked to OPM's evaluation of Partners' performance of up to 3 percent of the year's collected premiums, and (3) a guaranteed payment of 0.3 percent of the average annual assets of the program. These payments are separate from other payments made to cover the program's expenses. In contrast to the federal program, profits realized by carriers offering other long-term care insurance plans generally are not based on explicit profit structures, but rather on the experience of the programs they insure. The federal program's marketing efforts were generally similar to those used for other plans sold in the group market, but faced a significant challenge in sending information directly to eligible individuals. The federal program and other plans sold in the group market used such marketing efforts as mailing information to the homes of eligible individuals and hosting employee and retiree seminars. Of these efforts, carrier officials GAO spoke with explained that mailing to the homes of eligible individuals was critical to their marketing strategy. The federal program faced a significant challenge in mailing information to the homes of those eligible for the program because it initially did not have the home addresses for nearly all active federal civilian employees. Because of this challenge, the federal program relied heavily on marketing efforts that were less direct and less personalized, such as sending information to federal employees through agency benefits officers. The federal program's claims experience increased in the program's fourth year, but remained lower than the expectations established by Partners in its contract with OPM. This increase was generally consistent with trends since the federal program began in 2002. Overall, the federal program has paid 44 percent of the expected amount of claim payments per enrollee and 41 percent of the expected number of claims per enrollee. As of August 2006, Partners officials had not determined why the claims experience was lower than Partners' expectations. While it is generally expected that the number of claims submitted in the first few years of a long-term care insurance program will be a small portion of the total number of claims submitted over time, a program's claims experience is one of several factors that may affect its long-term financial outlook. The results of this analysis underscore GAO's prior recommendations that OPM analyze the claims experience and assumptions affecting premiums to inform forthcoming contract negotiations. In commenting on a draft of this report, OPM generally agreed with the report's findings."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, about $193 billion was spent nationwide on long-term care  services, including nursing home care and other assisted-living services.  Most of this care was financed by government programs, primarily by  Medicaid, a joint federal-state program that finances health insurance for  certain low-income adults and children. Elderly people\u2014those aged 65 or  older\u2014consume about two-thirds of all long-term care services. As the  elderly population continues to grow, particularly with the aging of the  baby boom generation, the increasing demand for long-term care services  will likely strain federal and state resources. Some policymakers propose  that increased use of long-term care insurance may be a means of reducing  the future financial burden on public programs. In 2000, Congress passed  the Long-Term Care Security Act, requiring the federal government to offer  long-term care insurance to its employees, their families, and others.  Congressional committee reports accompanying the act indicated that a  federal long-term care insurance program could encourage people to  purchase long-term care insurance, serve as a model for other employer- sponsored programs across the nation, and encourage private payment  sources to assume some of the insurance risk.", "In December 2001, at the conclusion of a competitive bidding process, the  Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\u2014the federal agency responsible  for administering governmentwide compensation and benefit systems\u2014 entered into a 7-year contract with Long Term Care Partners LLC (referred  to as Partners) that allows certain eligible individuals affiliated with the  federal government to apply for long-term care insurance. Individuals  eligible for the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program include federal  and Postal Service employees and retirees; active and retired members of  the uniformed services; qualified relatives of these individuals, such as  spouses of employees and retirees; and certain others. Partners is a joint  venture formed by two large insurance carriers that sell long-term care  insurance products in the private market\u2014John Hancock Life Insurance  Company and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The contract  between OPM and Partners outlines the roles and responsibilities of all  parties with respect to the program, including how payments for program  expenses and profits are determined. Partners began marketing the  Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program in February 2002, and the  program began accepting enrollment applications on March 25, 2002. As of  September 30, 2006, the federal program had 214,034 current enrollees,  making it the largest private long-term care insurance program in the  nation.", "This report is the second of two reports required by the Long-Term Care  Security Act on the competitiveness of the federal program compared with  group and individual plans generally available in the private insurance  market. Our first report found that the program compared favorably with  other group and individual plans we reviewed in terms of benefits offered  and premiums. However, in its first 3 years, from April 1, 2002, through  March 31, 2005, the federal program\u2019s enrollment and claims experience\u2014 that is, the number of paid claims and the amount paid for those claims\u2014 were lower than the expectations established by Partners. We  recommended that the Director of OPM analyze the reasons for the lower- than-expected claims experience and, as appropriate, use the results to  modify assumptions about the expected claims experience. We also  recommended that the Director of OPM analyze the projections for the  amount of premiums collected to pay for claims. In response to these  recommendations, OPM indicated that it intended to provide updated  information on claims experience and premium setting in its written  recommendation to Congress before entering into a new contract for the  administration of the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program.  Partners\u2019 current contract with OPM ends December 31, 2008.", "In this report, as discussed with the committees of jurisdiction, we  examined the following questions regarding other aspects of  competitiveness:  1.  How does the profit structure of the Federal Long Term Care  Insurance Program as defined by the contract compare with that of  other long-term care insurance plans?  2.  How do the marketing efforts for the Federal Long Term Care  Insurance Program compare with those for other long-term care  insurance plans?  3.  How does the Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program\u2019s claims  experience, updated to reflect the program\u2019s fourth year, compare with  initial expectations?", "To obtain information on the profit structure of the Federal Long Term  Care Insurance Program, we interviewed officials at OPM and Partners  and reviewed relevant documents, including the contract between OPM  and Partners.

While  the long-term care insurance industry experienced 18 percent annual  growth in the number of policies sold from 1987 through 2002, the  industry has experienced a downturn in more recent years, according to  industry experts. Specifically, carriers faced several challenges, including  higher-than-expected administrative expenses relative to premiums; lower- than-expected lapse rates, which increased the number of people likely to  submit claims; low interest rates, which reduced the actual return on  investments below what had been assumed; and new state regulations that  limited direct marketing by telephone. As a result, beginning in 2003, for  example, many carriers in the individual market raised premiums, left the  marketplace, or consolidated to form larger companies.

These three payments are allowed only if  premiums are sufficient to cover the federal program\u2019s current claims and  expenses. In contrast to the federal program, profits realized by carriers  offering other long-term care insurance plans generally are not based on  explicit profit structures.

This payment can equal up to  3 percent of the premiums collected in a year. Under an agreement which  amended the contract between OPM and Partners and became effective  beginning fiscal year 2006, OPM evaluates Partners\u2019 performance each  year on 21 short-term performance measures across 4 categories:  administrative expense savings, customer service, enrollment experience,  and responsiveness to OPM. Each performance measure has a  corresponding payment equivalent to a percentage of the total  performance-based payment of 3 percent of premiums. If Partners\u2019  performance does not meet stated expectations in a measure, the payment  corresponding to that measure is placed into a retained profit account. In  addition, every 3 years, OPM evaluates Partners\u2019 performance in two long- term performance measures: return on investment and claims experience.  If Partners meets expectations in one measure and funds are present in the  retained profit account, one-half of the amount present in the retained  profit account is paid to Partners. If Partners meets expectations in both  measures and funds are present in the retained profit account, the total  amount present in the retained profit account is paid to Partners.

Carrier  officials estimated that about 10 percent to 20 percent of employers  required their long-term care insurance carrier to relinquish a certain  percentage (for example, 2 percent to 4 percent) of premiums if their  performance did not meet agreed-upon expectations. However,  employers may require carriers to guarantee a certain level of performance  in their contracts to ensure that enrollees are provided with standard  levels of service, according to state officials. These performance  measures and guarantees may include those related to the timeliness of  underwriting decisions and call center performance.

This annual payment\u20140.3 percent  of the average annual assets of the federal program\u2014is defined in the  contract between OPM and Partners as a profit payment. The federal  program developed this payment to recognize that insurers in general are  required to hold risk-based capital. Risk-based capital is the capital that an  insurance carrier is required to hold in reserve, separate from any other  funds used to back insurance liabilities or other lines of business, to  protect the carrier from insolvency. OPM does not require Partners to use  the third payment to fund risk-based capital and both OPM and Partners  consider this payment another form of profit for administering the  program.

For example, Partners relies on agency benefits officers to send e-mails  about the federal program. While Partners officials may be notified by  agency benefits officers when they send program information, Partners is  unable to determine whether all eligible federal employees receive this  information. In addition, Partners has worked with several affinity groups,  such as Federally Employed Women and the National Active and Retired  Federal Employees Association, to educate their members about the need  for long-term care insurance and to advertise in publications and at  sponsored events.

Specifically, our initial report found that the federal program offered  benefits similar to those of other long-term care insurance products,  usually at lower premiums for comparable benefits. In this, our second  report, we examined other components of the federal program\u2019s  competitiveness, including the federal program\u2019s profit structure and  marketing efforts. We found that the federal program has a unique profit  structure, created to compensate Partners for the risks it assumed for the  program. The risks borne by Partners, however, are not as great as those  assumed by carriers selling other plans because, unlike with other plans,  the federal program\u2019s assets are owned by the program, not by the insurer.  Because of this structure, the program does not link Partners\u2019 profits to  the overall experience of the program. Rather, the program guarantees  some profit payments, links some profit payments to OPM\u2019s evaluation of  Partners\u2019 performance, and requires Partners to assume a potentially time- limited risk, after which all program assets and enrollees may be  transferred to another carrier. Insurance carriers\u2019 profits are linked to the  amount of risk they bear, and Partners assumes less risk for insuring the  federal program than do carriers for insuring other long-term care  insurance plans. Therefore, the federal program\u2019s profit payments would  likely be lower than the profits realized by carriers selling other plans. In  addition, while the federal program used marketing efforts that were  generally similar to those used for other plans sold in the group market,  the program faced a significant challenge in providing personalized  marketing communications directly to eligible individuals and instead  relied heavily on other marketing efforts.", "In our initial report we found that the federal program\u2019s claims  experience\u2014the amount and number of claims payments per enrollee\u2014 was lower than expected in the first 3 years of the program. While it is  generally expected that the number of claims submitted in the first few  years of a long-term care insurance program will be a small portion of the  total number of claims submitted over time, a program\u2019s claims experience  is one of several factors that may affect the long-term financial outlook of  the program. In response to our recommendation in the initial report that  OPM analyze the claims experience and assumptions affecting premiums  to inform forthcoming contract negotiations, OPM indicated that it  intended to provide updated information on claims experience and  premium setting in its written recommendation to Congress before  entering into the next contract for the administration of the Federal Long  Term Care Insurance Program. Partners\u2019 current contract with OPM for  the administration of the federal program ends December 31, 2008. After  reviewing a fourth year of claims data, we note that the program\u2019s claims  experience increased from that of the program\u2019s third year, but still  remains lower than Partners\u2019 expectations. These results underscore the  importance of our prior recommendations that OPM analyze the claims  experience and assumptions as it considers its recommendations to  Congress regarding a future contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to OPM and Partners. In its written  comments, OPM generally agreed with our findings. OPM\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix II.", "With regard to the program\u2019s unique profit structure, OPM stated that now  that it has more operating experience with the program, it plans to  reexamine the profit structure as it renegotiates or rebids the contract for  the administration of the program. OPM agreed that the marketing efforts  for the federal program are more challenging for Partners than for other  insurers because, among other reasons, home addresses for federal  employees are generally not available. OPM noted that this will continue  to be a constraint for the program in the future. In addition, OPM  highlighted, as we noted in our draft report, that the ratio of actual to  expected claims experience has narrowed and stated that it would  continue to closely monitor the claims experience of the program. We  support this effort and continue to encourage OPM to analyze the  program\u2019s claims experience and ensure that premiums and actuarial  assumptions about future claims reflect the experience of the program.", "In its comments, Partners highlighted certain distinct aspects of its profit  structure that we noted in our draft report, including that Partners does  not own federal program assets and that a profit payment is contingent on  meeting specific performance standards that Partners characterized as  exceptionally high for the insurance industry in general. Partners also  stated that profit payments are paid only if the federal program\u2019s assets are  sufficient to cover the risks incurred by the program, as our draft report  noted. Regarding the marketing efforts used for the federal program,  Partners noted that the terrorist attacks of 2001 and the anthrax scare,  which caused heightened security at federal buildings, added to the  marketing challenge acknowledged in the report. We revised the report to  reflect these circumstances. Finally, Partners commented, and as we noted  in our draft report, that in addition to a program\u2019s claims experience,  premium rates are affected by a number of factors, including lapse rates  and interest rates.", "OPM and Partners provided technical comments and clarifications, which  we incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Director of OPM and interested  congressional committees.
