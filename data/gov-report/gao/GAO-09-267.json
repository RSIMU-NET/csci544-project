GAO estimates USASAC and CSTC-A did not maintain complete records for about 87,000, or 36 percent, of the 242,000 U.S.-procured weapons shipped to Afghanistan. For about 46,000 weapons, USASAC could not provide serial numbers, and GAO estimates CSTC-A did not maintain records on the location or disposition of about 41,000 weapons with recorded serial numbers. CSTC-A also did not maintain reliable records for about 135,000 weapons it obtained for ANSF from 21 other countries. Accountability lapses occurred throughout the supply chain and were primarily due to a lack of clear direction and staffing shortages. During our review, CSTC-A began correcting some shortcomings, but indicated that its continuation of these efforts depends on staffing and other factors. Despite CSTC-A's training efforts, ANSF units cannot fully safeguard and account for weapons and sensitive equipment. Defense and State have deployed hundreds of trainers and mentors to help ANSF establish accountability practices. CSTC-A's policy is not to issue equipment without verifying that appropriate supply and accountability procedures are in place. Although CSTC-A has not consistently assessed ANSF units' ability to account for weapons, mentors have reported major accountability weaknesses, which CSTC-A officials and mentors attribute to a variety of cultural and institutional problems, including illiteracy, corruption, and unclear guidance.

We traveled to Afghanistan in August 2008 to examine records and meet  with officials at CSTC-A headquarters, visit the two central depots where  the weapons provided for ANSF are stored, and meet with staff at an  Afghan National Army unit that had received weapons. While in  Afghanistan we attempted to determine the location or disposition of a  random sample of weapons in order to reach general conclusions about  CSTC-A\u2019s ability to account for weapons purchased by the United States  for ANSF. We also discussed equipment accountability with cognizant  officials from the Afghan Ministries of Defense and Interior, the U.S.  Embassy, and contractors involved in building ANSF\u2019s capacity to account  for and manage its weapons inventory.

State and Defense officials told us they will  request over $5.7 billion to train and equip the Afghan army and police in  fiscal year 2009. The goal of these efforts is to transfer responsibility for  the security of Afghanistan from the international community to the  Afghan government. As part of this effort, from June 2002 through June  2008, CSTC-A obtained about 380,000 small arms and light weapons from  the United States and other countries for the Afghan army and police. The  United States purchased over 240,000 of these weapons for about  $120 million and shipped them to Afghanistan beginning in December  2004. Also, CSTC-A reported that it coordinated the donation of about  135,000 additional weapons from 21 countries, which valued their  donations at about $103 million (see app. II). Figure 1 illustrates the  number of weapons obtained for ANSF by USASAC, Navy IPO, and  international donors since June 2002.", "The United States and international donors have provided rifles, pistols,  machine guns, grenade launchers, shotguns, rocket-propelled grenade  launchers, and other weapons. About 80 percent of the U.S.-procured  weapons were \u201cnon-standard\u201d weapons, which are not typically supplied  by Defense. Many non-standard weapons, including about 79,000 AK-47  rifles, were received from former Warsaw Pact countries or were  obtained from vendors in those countries. (See fig. 2 for details on U.S.- procured weapons shipped to Afghanistan for ANSF.)", "USASAC and Navy IPO procured most of the 242,000 weapons for ANSF  through an adaptation of the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program  referred to by Defense as \u201cpseudo-FMS.\u201d As in traditional FMS,  pseudo-FMS procurements are overseen by DSCA. However, in contrast to  traditional FMS procurements, for Afghanistan, Defense primarily used  funds appropriated by the Congress for the Afghanistan Security Forces  Fund to purchase weapons to train and equip ANSF. USASAC procured  about 205,000 (85 percent) of these weapons, including about  135,000 non-standard weapons purchased from four U.S.-based  contractors. Navy IPO provided the remaining 37,000 (15 percent) M-16  rifles for the Afghan National Army.", "After procuring weapons for ANSF, Defense or its contractors transported  them to Afghanistan by air, and CSTC-A received the weapons at Kabul  International Airport. The Afghan National Army transported the  weapons from the airport to one of two central storage depots in Kabul\u2014 one for the Afghan National Army and another for the Afghan National  Police. Due to the limited operational capacity of the Afghan army and  police and the extremely hostile environment in which they operate,  CSTC-A retains control and custody of the weapons provided by the  United States and international donors during storage at the central depots  until the weapons are issued to ANSF units. In addition to maintaining the  security and control of weapons stored at the central depots, CSTC-A  trains ANSF in inventory management and weapons accountability. To this  end, the central depots are staffed by U.S. and coalition military personnel,  U.S. contractors, contract Afghan staff, and ANSF personnel.", "According to DSCA officials, equipment provided to ANSF is subject to  end use monitoring, which is meant to provide reasonable assurances  that the ANSF is using the equipment for its intended purposes.

For non-sensitive equipment provided to a  trusted partner, DSCA guidance calls for SAOs to conduct routine  monitoring in conjunction with other required security assistance duties.  As such, according to DSCA officials, DSCA expects SAOs to record  relevant end use monitoring observations made during interactions with  host country military and defense officials, such as visits to defense  facilities, meetings or telephone conversations, military ceremonies, and  dignitary visits.", "Enhanced end use monitoring. For sensitive defense articles and  technology transfers made within sensitive political situations, DSCA  guidance calls for more intensive and formal monitoring.

First, when  USASAC and CSTC-A initially obtained weapons for ANSF, they did not  record all the corresponding serial numbers. Second, USASAC and  CSTC-A did not maintain control or visibility over U.S.-procured weapons  during transport to the two ANSF central storage depots in Kabul. Third,  CSTC-A did not maintain complete and accurate inventory records or  perform physical inventories of weapons stored at the central depots.  Finally, inadequate U.S. and ANSF staffing at the central depots along with  poor security and persistent management challenges have contributed to  the vulnerability of stored weapons to theft or misuse. These lapses have  hampered CSTC-A\u2019s ability to detect weapons theft or other losses.

The Inspector General recommended, among other  things, that U.S. Central Command issue formal guidance directing the  commands and forces in its area of responsibility, including CSTC-A, to  apply existing Defense weapons accountability procedures. U.S. Central  Command and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Intelligence concurred with this recommendation. Nonetheless, U.S.  Central Command officials we spoke to in December 2008 did not have a  common understanding of when formal transfer of the weapons to ANSF  is considered to have occurred, and hence up to what point to apply  Defense accountability procedures, if at all.

Since no Afghan officers were present at the depots to take  possession of the weapons, CSTC-A personnel received the weapons and  processed them into inventory for storage. Although Defense did not  provide direction to CSTC-A on how and when to transfer title to ANSF,  CSTC-A officials told us they considered title transfer to have occurred,  without any formal documentation, when information about the weapons  was typed into computer inventory systems at the central depots. In  February 2008, a revision to DSCA\u2019s Security Assistance Management  Manual called for U.S. government officials delivering equipment to a  foreign nation under pseudo-FMS to keep documentation showing when,  where, and to whom delivery was made and report this information to the  military organization responsible for procurement. CSTC-A officials told  us that they were not certain whether this revised guidance applied to  ANSF weapons and therefore have not provided any title transfer  documentation to USASAC or Navy IPO, the procuring organizations.

Specific gaps in accountability controls include  the following:  Incomplete serial number recording. For over 5 years, CSTC-A stored  weapons in the central depots and distributed them to ANSF units without  recording their serial numbers. In August 2007, nearly 10 months after  CSTC-A\u2019s Commanding General mandated serial number control, CSTC-A  began registering weapons by serial number as they were issued to ANSF  units.

The assessment category in the checklist  most relevant to equipment accountability was a rating on whether a unit  \u201cunderstands the  logistical process and utilizes it  with reasonable effectiveness.\u201d Another checklist we reviewed addressed  15 dimensions of \u201csustainment operations\u201d and was used to assess units\u2019  overall demonstration of logistics management capacity and \u201cability to  effectively receive, store, and issue supplies.\u201d However, the checklist did  not address weapons or equipment accountability specifically.  Furthermore, more detailed notes accompanying the completed checklists  we reviewed provided virtually no information on equipment  accountability as a factor in the logistics ratings the CSTC-A training team  assigned to the unit.", "Afghan National Police. CSTC-A has also introduced a monthly  assessment tool to be used by its mentors to evaluate Afghan National  Police capability and identify strengths and weaknesses. Prior to June  2008, CSTC-A did not specifically evaluate the capacity of police units to  account for weapons and other equipment. CSTC-A changed the format of  its police assessment checklist to specifically address four dimensions of  equipment accountability. According to the reformatted assessments we  reviewed, as of September 30, 2008, some trained and equipped Afghan  National Police units had not yet implemented accountability procedures  required by the Afghan Ministry of Interior. These assessments indicated  that of the first seven police districts to receive intensive training and  weapons under CSTC-A\u2019s Focused District Development Program, which  began in November 2007, two districts were not maintaining property  accountability, including property books, and one was not conducting  audits and physical inventories periodically or when directed.", "Contract mentors employed by CSTC-A and State have reported  extensively on weaknesses they observed in ANSF units\u2019 capacity to  safeguard and account for weapons and other equipment. Reports we  reviewed, prepared by MPRI and DynCorp mentors between October 2007  and August 2008, indicated that ANSF units throughout Afghanistan had  not implemented the basic property accountability procedures required by  the Afghan Ministries of Defense and Interior. Although these reports did  not address accountability capacities in a consistent manner that would  allow a systematic or comprehensive assessment of all units, they did  highlight common problems relating to weapons accountability, including  a lack of functioning property book operations and poor physical security.", "Lack of functioning property book operations. Mentors reported that  many Afghan army and police units did not properly maintain property  books, which are fundamental tools used to establish equipment  accountability and are required by Afghan ministerial decrees. In a report  dated March 2008, a MPRI mentor to the property book officer for one  Afghan National Army unit stated, \u201cfor 3 years, the unit property books  have not been established properly\u201d and that \u201ca lack of functionality  existed in every property book operation.\u201d Another report, from March  2008, concluded, \u201cequipment accountability and equipment maintainability  is a big concern; equipment is often lost, damaged, or stolen, and the  proper procedures are not followed to properly document and/or account  for equipment.\u201d In a 2008 MPRI quarterly progress report on Afghan  National Police in Kandahar, a mentor noted that property book items  were issued but not posted to any records, because personnel did not  know their duties and responsibilities. The report further states that \u201cat  present the property managers are not tracking any classes of supplies at  all levels\u201d and that \u201cANSF is very basic in its day to day function,\u201d  exhibiting no consideration for property accountability.", "Poor security. MPRI reports also indicated that some Afghan National  Police units did not have facilities adequate to ensure the physical security  of weapons and protect them against theft in a high-risk environment. For  example, a March 2008 MPRI report on Afghan National Police in one  northern province stated that the arms room of the police district office  was behind a wooden door and had only a miniature padlock, and that this  represented \u201cbasically the same austere conditions as in the other  districts.\u201d", "Defense and State contractor reports identified various causes of ANSF  accountability weaknesses, including illiteracy, corruption, desertion, and  unclear guidance from Afghan ministries.", "Illiteracy. Mentors reported that widespread illiteracy among Afghan army  and police personnel had substantially impaired equipment accountability.  For instance, a March 2008 MPRI report on an Afghan National Army unit  noted that illiteracy was directly interfering with the ability of supply  section personnel to implement property accountability processes and  procedures, despite repeated training efforts. In July 2008, a police mentor  in the Zari district of Balkh province stated that, \u201ca lack of personnel [at  the district headquarters] who can read and write is hampering efficient  operations,\u201d and added that there is currently one literate person being  mentored to take charge of logistics. In addition, an August 2008 DynCorp  report on the Afghan National Police noted that in Kandahar, \u201cconcerns   expressed over  maintaining control over  the storage facility keys. He cannot read or write, does not record anything  that is being given out or have a request form for supplies filled out.  is  the same individual that was handing out automatic weapons to civilians  the previous week.\u201d", "Corruption. Reports of alleged theft and unauthorized resale of weapons  are common. During 2008, DynCorp mentors reported multiple instances  of Afghan National Police personnel, including an Afghan Border Police  battalion commander in Khost province, allegedly selling weapons to  anti-coalition forces. In a March 2008 report, mentors noted that despite  repeated requests, the Afghan National Police Chief Logistical Officer for  Paktika province would not produce a list of serial numbers for weapons  on hand. The DynCorp mentors suggested this reluctance to share  information could be part of an attempt to conceal inventory  discrepancies. In addition, a May 2008 DynCorp report on police cited  corruption in Helmand as that province\u2019s most significant problem, noting  that the logistics officer had been named in all allegations of theft,  extortion, and deceit reported to mentors by their Afghan National Police  contacts.", "Desertion. DynCorp mentors also reported cases of desertion in the  Afghan National Police, which resulted in the loss of weapons. For  instance, in July 2008, mentors reported that when Afghan Border Police  officers at a Faryab province checkpoint deserted to ally themselves with  anti-coalition forces, they took all their weapons and two vehicles with  them. Another DynCorp mentor team training police in Ghazni province  reported in July 2008 that 65 Afghan National Police personnel had  deserted and would not be coming to the base to be processed. The police  officers that did arrive came without their issued weapons.", "Unclear guidance. MPRI mentors reported that Afghan ministry logistics  policies were not always clear to Afghan army and police property  managers. A MPRI report dated April 2008 stated that approved Ministry of  Interior policies outlining material accountability procedures were not  widely disseminated and many logistics officers did not recognize any of  the logistical policies as rule. Additionally, a MPRI mentor to the Afghan  National Army told us that despite the new decrees, Afghan National Army  logistics officers often carried out property accountability functions using  Soviet-style accounting methods and that the Ministry of Defense was still  auditing army accounts against those defunct standards.", "Senior Afghan Ministry of Defense officials we met with also described  similar accountability weaknesses. In a written statement provided in  response to our questions about Afghan National Army weapons  accountability, the ministry officials indicated that soldiers deserting with  their weapons had a negative effect on the Afghan National Army and  reduced supplies on hand in units. They also indicated that Afghan  National Army units in the provinces of Helmand, Kandahar, and Paktika  have been particularly vulnerable to equipment theft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CSTC-A Has Recently Begun Conducting End Use Monitoring of Weapons and Sensitive Night Vision Devices", "paragraphs": ["According to DSCA officials, U.S.-procured weapons and sensitive  equipment provided to ANSF are subject to end use monitoring, which is  meant to provide reasonable assurances that ANSF is using the equipment  for intended purposes. Under DSCA guidance, weapons are subject to  routine end use monitoring, which, according to DSCA officials, entails  making and recording observations on weapons usage in conjunction with  other duties and during interactions with local defense officials. For  specified sensitive defense items, such as night vision devices, DSCA  guidance calls for additional controls and enhanced end use monitoring.  This includes providing equipment delivery records with serial numbers to  DSCA, conducting routine physical inventories, and reporting on quarterly  inventory results. For night vision devices this also includes the  establishment of a physical security and accountability control plan.", "In July 2007, CSTC-A began issuing 2,410 night vision devices to Afghan  National Army units without establishing the appropriate controls or  conducting enhanced end use monitoring. According to U.S. Central  Command, these devices pose a special danger to the public and U.S.  forces if in the wrong hands. DSCA did not ensure that CSTC-A followed  the end use monitoring guidance because CSTC-A purchased these devices  directly and without the knowledge or involvement of DSCA officials. To  address this, DSCA and CSTC-A established procedures in April 2008 to  prohibit CSTC-A\u2019s procurement of weapons and sensitive equipment in- country without DSCA involvement.", "In May 2008, CSTC-A first developed an end use monitoring plan that  established both routine and enhanced monitoring procedures. The plan  calls for the use of U.S. trainers and mentors embedded in ANSF units to  provide reasonable assurances that the recipients are complying with U.S.  requirements on the use, transfer, and security of the items. CSTC-A  informed us that it began implementing the plan in July 2008, but noted it  did not have sufficient staff or mentors to conduct the monitoring  envisioned. CSTC-A officials told us they started to conduct and document  routine end use monitoring for weapons provided to the Afghan police in  31 of Afghanistan\u2019s 365 police districts. CSTC-A had not been able to  undertake any monitoring in the remaining 334 police districts due to  security constraints.", "During the course of our review, CSTC-A began following DSCA\u2019s  enhanced end use monitoring guidance for the night vision devices it had  issued. CSTC-A started conducting inventories of these devices in October  2008, about 15 months after it began issuing them, and plans to conduct  full physical inventories by serial number quarterly. As of December 2008,  CSTC-A had accounted for all but 10 of the devices it had issued.", "DSCA and CSTC-A attributed this limited end use monitoring to a shortage  of security assistance staff and expertise at CSTC-A, exacerbated by  frequent CSTC-A staff rotations. Defense\u2019s Inspector General similarly  reported in October 2008 that CSTC-A did not have sufficient personnel  with the necessary security assistance skills and experience and that short  tours of duty and different rotation policies among the military services  hindered the execution of security assistance activities. We also noted  these problems in 2004, when we reported that the Office of Military  Organization-Afghanistan, CSTC-A\u2019s predecessor, did not have adequate  personnel trained in security assistance procedures to support its efforts  and that frequent personnel rotations were limiting Defense\u2019s efforts to  train key personnel in defense security assistance procedures and  preserve institutional knowledge. CSTC-A officials told us that the  addition of a USASAC liaison to the CSTC-A staff in Kabul had helped to  offset some of these challenges, as the liaison was knowledgeable in  security assistance procedures and had been able to provide some basic  training for CSTC-A staff."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Oversight and accountability for weapons is critical in high-threat  environments, especially in Afghanistan, where potential theft and misuse  of lethal equipment pose a significant danger to U.S. and coalition forces  involved in security, stabilization, and reconstruction efforts. Because  Defense organizations throughout the weapons supply chain have not had  a common understanding of what procedures are necessary to safeguard  and account for weapons, inventory records, including serial numbers, are  not complete and accurate. As a result, Defense cannot be certain that  weapons intended for ANSF have reached those forces. Further, weapons  stored in poorly secured central depots are significantly vulnerable, and  the United States has limited ability to detect the loss of these weapons  without conducting routine inventories. Although CSTC-A established new  weapons accountability procedures during the course of our review, it is  not yet clear that, without a mandate from Defense and sufficient  resources, CSTC-A will consistently implement these procedures. Because  Afghan army and police units face significant challenges in controlling and  accounting for weapons, it is essential that Defense enhance its efforts in  working with ANSF units in this area. Systematically assessing ANSF\u2019s  ability to implement required weapons accountability procedures is  particularly important for gaining reasonable assurances that ANSF units  are prepared to receive and safeguard weapons as well as for evaluating  overall progress in developing ANSF\u2019s accountability capacity. Moreover,  adequately monitoring night vision devices and other sensitive equipment  after it is transferred to ANSF will help to ensure that such equipment is  used for its intended purposes.

However, Defense went on to state that DSCA, in  conjunction with U.S. Central Command, has been directed to implement  in Afghanistan congressionally-mandated controls that Defense is  implementing in Iraq. These include (a) the registration of serial numbers  of all small arms, (b) an end-use monitoring program for all lethal  assistance, and (c) the maintenance of detailed records for all defense  articles transferred to Afghanistan.

To ensure we had a  complete record of all weapons ordered and shipped during this time  period, we checked USASAC and Navy shipment details against line-item  details in Letters of Offer and Acceptance provided to us by DSCA. For  each shipment of weapons we isolated in the USASAC and Navy  International Programs Office (IPO) files, we compiled lists of serial  numbers or determined the total number of weapons for which no serial  number records were available. We identified 195,671 weapons for which  USASAC and Navy IPO could provide serial numbers and 46,532 for which  they could not. In some cases, quantities of weapons required by the Letter  of Offer and Acceptance differed from those recorded as shipped; we  followed up on these discrepancies with officials at USASAC, who  explained that such differences were due to changes in market pricing  between the time of the request and the time of purchase. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To assess Defense\u2019s ability to account for the location or disposition of  weapons, we selected a stratified random probability sample of 245  weapons from the population of 196,671 U.S.-procured weapons for which  Defense could provide serial numbers. The sample population of weapons  included all years in which U.S.-procured weapons had been shipped to  ANSF and seven specific categories of weapons obtained. Our random  sample did not include certain miscellaneous weapon types, which we  categorized as \u201cother.\u201d Each weapon in the population had a known  probability of being included in our probability sample. We divided the  weapons into two strata, based on the format of the weapons lists we  obtained. About half of the serial numbers were available to us in  electronic databases, allowing us to select a simple random sample of 96  weapons from those records. The remaining 98,462 serial numbers were  provided to us in paper lists or electronic scans of paper files. From those  records we selected a random systematic sample of 149 weapons by  choosing a random start and selecting every subsequent 679th serial  number. Each weapon selected in the sample was weighted in the analysis  to account statistically for all the weapons in the population, including  those that were not selected. In Afghanistan, we attempted either to  physically locate each weapon in our sample or obtain documentation  confirming that CSTC-A had recorded its issuance to ANSF or otherwise  disposed of it. We used the results of our work to generalize to the  universe of weapons from which we drew our sample and derive an  estimated number of weapons for which CSTC-A cannot provide  information on location or disposition. Because we followed a probability  procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one of a large  number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could  have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of our results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g. plus or  minus 5 percentage points). This is the interval that would contain the  actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we could have  drawn. As a result, we are 95 percent confident that each of the confidence  intervals we have reported will include the true values in the study.", "We compiled detailed information on the approximately 135,000 weapons  CSTC-A obtained for ANSF from international donors.
