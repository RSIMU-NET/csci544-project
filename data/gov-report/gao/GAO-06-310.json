At the conclusion of GAO's review, the RMO also provided a high-level plan that includes milestones for completing these policies. Since critical BSM projects continue to be pursued and completion of the policies and procedures is not expected until March 2007, it is critical that BSM immediately implement the draft policies and continue to develop the final policies. As a result of the lack of policies and procedures, the one ongoing project--Modernized e-File (MeF)--and the two completed projects--Filing and Payment Compliance (F&PC) and Customer Account Data Engine (CADE)--GAO reviewed did not consistently follow disciplined practices for systems development and management. For example, all three projects had a key element of managing requirements--a change management process that requires approvals and impact assessments to be completed when there are changes to requirements--but none met all of the practices needed for effective requirements management. In addition, two projects did not have a clear, consistent way to elicit (gather) requirements, two did not have fully documented requirements, and two could not produce fully traceable requirements (i.e., the requirements could not be tracked through development and testing), which is another key element of managing requirements. Unless IRS takes the steps needed to develop and institutionalize disciplined requirements development and management processes and implements draft policies in the interim to cover key areas of requirements development and management, it will continue to face risks, including cost overruns, schedule delays, and performance shortfalls."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has long relied on obsolete automated  systems for key operational and management functions; its attempts to  modernize these systems span several decades.

Congress and IRS designed the BSM program to bring  IRS tax administration systems to a level equivalent to private and public  sector best practices, while managing the risks inherent in one of the  largest, most visible, and sensitive modernization programs under way.  Over the past 7 years, IRS has been appropriated approximately $1.9 billion  for BSM (see fig. 1).", "BSM is critical to supporting IRS\u2019s taxpayer service and enforcement goals.  For example, BSM includes projects to allow taxpayers to file and retrieve  information electronically and to help reduce the backlog of collection  cases. It also provides IRS with the reliable and timely financial  management information it routinely needs to account for the nation\u2019s  largest revenue stream.", "BSM has had some recent successes with its modernization efforts. During  2004, IRS implemented initial versions of (1) Modernized e-File (MeF),  which provides electronic filing for large corporations and tax-exempt  organizations; (2) e-Services, which created a Web portal and other  electronic services to promote the goal of conducting most IRS  transactions with taxpayers and tax practitioners electronically; (3)  Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), which will replace the current  system that contains the agency\u2019s repository of taxpayer information; and  (4) the Integrated Financial System, which replaced aspects of IRS\u2019s core  financial systems and is ultimately intended to operate as its new  accounting system of record.", "However, despite these successes, IRS has had difficulty developing and  managing requirements for its modernization efforts over the years. We  reported in 1995 that IRS did not have the requisite software development  capability to successfully complete a major modernization effort and that  the success of modernization would depend on whether IRS would  promptly address the weaknesses in several software development areas,  including requirements management. In 1998, we assessed IRS\u2019s systems  life cycle document and reported a lack of sufficient information to  document how business requirements were to be specified. More recently,  in February and November of 2004, we reported in testimony and a report  that cost overruns in various BSM projects, including CADE, MeF, and  e-Services, were due in part to inadequate definition of requirements for  their new systems, leading to incorporation of additional requirements late  in the system\u2019s life cycle and at a higher cost than if they had been included  in the initial requirements baseline. We continue to highlight management  control weaknesses such as these in our annual expenditure plan reviews.", "Other organizations that have assessed BSM projects have also found that  IRS has not developed and managed requirements sufficiently on various  projects. In 2001, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration  (TIGTA) reviewed key systems development practices of four BSM  projects and reported that weaknesses in several process areas, including  requirements management, were responsible for cost increases and  schedule delays. TIGTA noted that these weaknesses raised the risk that  systems would be developed that would not meet the needs of the  businesses they were intended to support and recommended that BSM  strengthen and/or implement aspects of these key systems development  practices. In 2003, an independent technical assessment of CADE noted  significant breakdowns in developing and managing requirements, which  resulted in the inability of CADE to meet its original schedule. The  assessment further stated that IRS focused primarily on the high-level  business requirements and paid less attention to the development of  specific, testable requirements developed later in the development life  cycle and that responsibility for developing and managing the requirements  was distributed among their various organizational component, instead of  being concentrated in a centralized authority.", "BSM has acknowledged that it has weaknesses in developing and managing  requirements; since 2004, requirements management has been one of its  high-priority initiatives. To demonstrate their commitment to improving  the development and management of requirements, it created an RMO in  October 2004. This office is to address issues related to (1) lack of quality  and completeness of modernization requirements, (2) lack of alignment of  modernization requirements with business strategy and needs, (3) risks  incurred by projects transitioning to development without a sufficient  requirements baseline, and (4) lack of visibility into a fully traceable set of  modernization requirements. During 2005, the RMO created a Concept of  Operations that showed, at a high level, the RMO\u2019s plans to address  requirements practices, and, in November 2005, it obtained contractor  support to develop new policies and procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Requirements Development and Management", "paragraphs": ["According to the Software Engineering Institute\u2019s (SEI) Capability Maturity  Model Integration (CMMIsm), the requirements for a system describe the  functionality needed to meet user needs and perform as intended in the  operational environment.

A well-defined and managed requirements baseline can,  in addition, improve understanding among stakeholders and increase  stakeholder buy-in and acceptance of the resulting system. The practices  underlying requirements development and management include eliciting,  documenting, verifying and validating, and managing the requirements  through the systems life cycle (see fig. 2).

Since the usefulness of the system  to its users and stakeholders is critically dependent on the accuracy and  completeness of the requirements, all user groups and stakeholders should  be identified and involved in defining requirements. In addition to gathering  requirements from users and other stakeholders, analysis and/or research  can be used to identify additional requirements that balance stakeholder  needs against constraints and ensure that the requirements can be met in  the proposed operational environment.", "After requirements have been elicited, they are analyzed in detail;  documented as the business, or high-level, requirements; and agreed to by  all stakeholders. Stakeholder agreement is an important part of this activity  and is needed to demonstrate that the requirements accurately define  intended uses. The business requirements should then be decomposed into  detailed system requirements, which are analyzed to ensure that they can  be implemented in the expected operational environment and that they can  satisfy the objectives of higher-level requirements. The final requirements  are approved by all stakeholders and documented as the requirements  baseline. Once the baseline is established, it is placed under configuration  management (CM) control.", "Once the requirements baseline has been developed, the requirements are  analyzed and broken down into more specific system-level requirements  and eventually into the code that makes up the system. The verification  process ensures that the system-level requirements and the resulting code  are an accurate representation of stakeholder needs. This process includes  checking selected work products, such as software code, against the initial  baseline requirements to ensure that the lower-level items fully satisfy the  higher-level requirements. It is an inherently incremental process,  occurring throughout the development of the product. This agreement  between work products, such as code and baseline requirements, is  verified by conducting peer reviews. Peer reviews can also be used to  identify action items that need to be addressed. Without such reviews, an  organization is taking a risk that substantial defects will not be detected  until late in the development and/or testing phases, or even after the system  is implemented.", "While the system is being developed, each component must be tested to  ensure that its outputs are accurate. Testing (e.g., unit, system integration,  and user acceptance) is the process of executing a program with the intent  of finding errors. Clear, complete, and well-documented requirements are  needed in order to design and implement an effective testing program.  Linking the testing activities back to the requirements assures the  organization that, once testing activities are successfully completed, all  requirements have been addressed and will be met by the system. Without  such assurance, it is possible for a requirement to be missed in  development and the resulting lack of functionality not noticed until late in  testing, or even after deployment.", "Requirements, once developed and approved, also need to be managed  throughout the system life cycle. Two key areas of requirements  management are addressing changes to requirements and establishing and  maintaining bidirectional traceability from high-level requirements through  detailed work products to test cases and scenarios. As mentioned earlier,  once a set of high-level requirements is documented, verified, and  approved, it is placed under configuration control. From this point,  changes to the requirements are evaluated and validated as part of the change control process. Change control includes reviewing and assessing  proposed changes to the requirements to determine the reasons for the  changes, determining if these changes are occurring due to flaws in the  requirements development process, and ensuring that any effects of the  change on other requirements as well as on the cost, schedule, and  performance goals of the project are determined and assessed.", "Establishing and maintaining traceability from initial requirements to work  products and the resulting system is also important.
