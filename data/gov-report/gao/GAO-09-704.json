Responsibility for their oversight is shared among three enforcement agencies--the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and Department of Justice (DOJ)--and five depository institution regulators--the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS). This report examines (1) data used by agencies and the public to detect potential violations and options to enhance the data, (2) federal oversight of lenders that are identified as at heightened risk of violating the fair lending laws, and (3) recent cases involving fair lending laws and associated enforcement challenges. GAO analyzed fair lending laws, relevant research, and interviewed agency officials, lenders, and consumer groups. GAO also reviewed 152 depository institution fair lending examination files.

Enforcement agencies and depository institution regulators use HMDA data to identify outliers--lenders that may have violated fair lending laws--and focus their investigations and examinations accordingly. But, HMDA data also have limitations; they do not include information on the credit risks of mortgage borrowers, which may limit regulators' and the public's capacity to identify lenders most likely to be engaged in discriminatory practices without first conducting labor-intensive reviews. Another data limitation is that lenders are not required to report data on the race, ethnicity, and sex of nonmortgage loan borrowers--such as small businesses, which limits oversight of such lending. While requiring lenders to report additional data would impose costs on them, particularly smaller institutions, options exist to mitigate such costs to some degree, such as limiting the reporting requirements to larger institutions. Without additional data, agencies' and regulators' capacity to identify potential lending discrimination is limited. GAO identified the following limitations in the consistency and effectiveness of fair lending oversight that are largely attributable to the fragmented U.S. financial regulatory system: (1) Federal oversight of lenders that may represent heightened risks of fair lending law violations is limited. For example, the enforcement agencies are responsible for monitoring independent mortgage lenders' compliance with the fair lending laws. Such lenders have been large originators of subprime mortgage loans in recent years and have more frequently been identified through analysis of HMDA data as outliers than depository institutions, such as banks. Depository institution regulators are more likely to assess the activities of outliers and, unlike enforcement agencies, they routinely assess the compliance of lenders that are not outliers. As a result, many fair lending violations at independent lenders may go undetected, and efforts to deter potential violations may be ineffective. (2) Although depository institution regulators' fair lending oversight efforts may be more comprehensive, the division of responsibility among multiple agencies raises questions about the consistency and effectiveness of their efforts. For example, each regulator uses a different approach to analyze HMDA data to identify outliers and examination documentation varies. Moreover, since 2005, OTS, the Federal Reserve, and FDIC have referred more than 100 lenders to DOJ for further investigations of potential fair lending violations, as required by ECOA, while OCC made one referral and NCUA none. Enforcement agencies have settled relatively few (eight) fair lending cases since 2005. Agencies identified several enforcement challenges, including the complexity of fair lending cases, difficulties in recruiting and retaining staff, and the constraints of ECOA's 2-year statute of limitations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act (FHA)  (collectively, fair lending laws) prohibit discrimination in making credit  decisions.

FHA  prohibits discrimination by direct providers of housing, as well as other  entities whose discriminatory practices, among other things, make housing  unavailable to persons because of race or color, religion, sex, national  origin, familial status, or disability. Under one or both of the fair lending  laws, a lender may not, because of a prohibited basis:  fail to provide information or services or provide different information or  services regarding any aspect of the lending process, including credit  availability, application procedures, or lending standards;   discourage or selectively encourage applicants with respect to inquiries  about or applications for credit; refuse to extend credit or use different standards in determining whether  to extend credit;   vary the terms of credit offered, including the amount, interest rate,  duration, or type of loan;   use different standards to evaluate collateral;  treat a borrower differently in servicing a loan or invoking default  remedies; or    use different standards for pooling or packaging a loan in the secondary  market or for purchasing loans.", "Eight federal agencies\u2014the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD); the Federal Trade Commission (FTC); the  Department of Justice (DOJ)\u2014and the regulators of insured depository  institutions\u2014the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the  National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the Office of the  Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision  (OTS)\u2014principally share oversight and enforcement responsibility for the  fair lending laws. The enforcement agencies, HUD, FTC, and DOJ,  generally have jurisdiction over nondepository mortgage lenders,  including independent mortgage lenders that are not affiliated with  federally insured depository institutions or owned by federally regulated  lenders. The depository institution regulators oversee federally insured  banks, thrifts, and credit unions and, as appropriate, certain subsidiaries,  affiliates, and service providers of these institutions. While the  enforcement agencies can pursue investigations, file complaints, and  participate in litigation against lenders in administrative or federal district  courts for potential fair lending violations under their independent  investigative and enforcement authorities, depository institution  regulators are required to refer lenders under their supervision to DOJ for  further investigation whenever one has reason to believe a lender has  engaged in a pattern or practice of discouraging or denying applications  for credit in violations of ECOA. Furthermore, the depository institution  regulators must provide notice to HUD and the alleged injured parties  whenever they have reason to believe that an FHA violation occurred that  did not also constitute a pattern or practice violation of ECOA and thus  did not trigger a referral to DOJ.

These concerns have been heightened in  recent years because of the availability of mortgage pricing data published  by the Federal Reserve, which many lenders are required to submit under  the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, as amended (HMDA).  According to the Federal Reserve, researchers, and others, their analyses  of HMDA data indicate that on average, African-American and Hispanic  mortgage borrowers may pay substantially higher interest rates and fees  than similarly situated non-Hispanic white borrowers. Since 2005, the  Federal Reserve annually has used HMDA data to identify approximately  200 lenders with statistically significant pricing disparities based on  ethnicity or race and distributed this screening or outlier list to other  enforcement agencies, depository institution regulators, and state  regulators for their review and potential follow-up. Many of these entities  were independent lenders that specialized in subprime loans, which  appear to have been disproportionately offered to minority borrowers.  Critics argue that enforcement agencies and depository institution  regulators have not adequately pursued potential fair lending violations;  for example, in recent years few enforcement actions have been brought  against lenders alleging discrimination.", "Federal enforcement agencies and depository institution regulators have  stated that they have processes to ensure effective oversight and  enforcement of the fair lending laws. In particular, enforcement agencies  and depository institution regulators said that they use the lists of  institutions that have statistically significant pricing disparities provided  by the Federal Reserve and/or develop their own screening or outlier lists  through independent analysis of HMDA data or consumer complaints and  focus investigative and examination resources on those institutions.  Federal agency and depository institution regulatory officials also stated  that limitations in HMDA data, particularly the lack of underwriting  information such as borrowers\u2019 credit scores, explain why many  investigations and examinations are a result of false positives and thus do  not result in enforcement actions. In addition, as discussed in this report,  FTC officials said that HMDA data do not allow for assessing mortgage  pricing discrimination at all lenders. However, federal officials also stated  that they vigorously pursue cases where the inclusion of underwriting data  does not explain differences in denials and mortgage interest rates  between borrowers who fall into different protected groups based on  national origin, race, or sex and initiate enforcement actions where  appropriate.", "This report responds to your request that we provide an overview of  federal oversight and enforcement of the fair lending laws and addresses a  range of relevant issues.

For the  Federal Reserve, FDIC, and OTS, we reviewed summary documentation of  completed examinations for each lender based on their 2005 and 2006  HMDA data outlier lists. For OCC and NCUA, we reviewed randomly  selected samples of their outlier examination reports, largely due to the  time that it took these agencies to provide requested documentation. We  generally limited the scope of our examination file review to compliance  (that is, if such examinations were initiated on schedule and if they  contained key elements for which the depository institution regulators\u2019  Interagency Fair Lending Examination Procedures call for, such as a  review of HMDA and underwriting and pricing data, reviews of loan  policies and files, and interviews with lending officials). Making  judgments on how well the depository institution regulators conducted  examinations (for example, if they selected a sufficient sample of loan files  to review or if they used an appropriate examination methodology) was  beyond the scope of this review. However, we did compare the depository  institution regulators\u2019 overall outlier examination findings and assessed  the extent to which the interagency examination procedures allowed for  assessments of all phases of the mortgage loan application process. We  also reviewed agency referrals to DOJ since 2005, reviewed DOJ\u2019s  investigative activities and settlements, and consulted with all agencies on  some of the challenges they encountered in enforcing fair lending laws.", "Finally, we interviewed officials from each federal enforcement and  depository institution regulator\u2014including senior officials, policy analysts,  economists, statisticians, attorneys, examiners, and compliance  specialists\u2014state financial regulatory entities, lenders, and researchers.

FHA requires  HUD to seek conciliation between the parties to any complaint. If  conciliation discussions are unsuccessful, and HUD determines after an  investigation that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory  housing practice has occurred, or is about to occur, HUD must issue a  Charge of Discrimination against those responsible for the violation and  prosecute the claim before an administrative law judge. However, after a  charge has been issued, any party may elect to litigate the case instead in  federal district court, in which case DOJ assumes responsibility from HUD  for pursuing litigation. A HUD administrative law judge or federal judge   may order lenders to change their policies, compensate borrowers  affected by the violation, and take steps to prevent future violations, in  addition to imposing civil penalties.", "FTC also may conduct investigations and file ECOA complaints against  nonbank mortgage lenders or brokers\u2014including but not limited to  nonbank subsidiaries of banks and bank holding companies\u2014that may be  violating ECOA.

In 2002, the Federal  Reserve, pursuant to its regulatory authority under HMDA, required  financial institutions to collect certain mortgage loan pricing data for  higher priced loans in response to the growth of subprime lending and to  address concerns that minority and other targeted groups were being  charged excessively high interest rates for mortgage loans. This  requirement was effective on January 1, 2004.

First,  HMDA data lack key underwriting data or information, such as borrowers\u2019  credit scores or loan-to-value ratios, which may help explain why lenders  may charge relatively higher interest rates or higher fees to some  borrowers compared with others. Second, limited data are available on the  premortgage loan application process to help determine if loan officers  engage in discriminatory practices, such as steering minority applicants to  high-cost loans, before a loan application is filed. Third, Regulation B, the  regulation that implements the ECOA, generally prohibits lenders from  collecting personal characteristic data, such as applicants\u2019 race, ethnicity  and sex, for nonmortgage loans, such as small business and credit card  loans, which also impedes federal oversight efforts. Requiring lenders to  collect and publicly report additional data could benefit federal oversight  efforts as well as independent research into potential discrimination in  lending, but also would impose additional costs, particularly on smaller  institutions with limited recordkeeping systems.

Second, using statistical analysis, the Federal Reserve matches  loans made to minorities with loans made to non-Hispanic whites for each  HMDA reporting lender, based on the limited information available in  HMDA (such as property type, loan purpose, loan amount, location, date,  and borrower income). Third, the Federal Reserve calculates disparities by  race and ethnicity for rate spreads (among those loans for which rate  spreads were reported) and the proportion of loans that are higher priced  (the incidence of higher priced lending).

For example, all of the enforcement agencies said that they  incorporate the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual screening list into their own  ongoing screening process to identify targets for fair lending  investigations.

Other depository regulators, such as the FDIC and the Federal Reserve  generally focus on independent analysis of HMDA data and other  information to develop outlier lists that are based on statistically  significant pricing disparities, although they also may assess other risk  factors, including approval and denial decisions and redlining, in assessing  fair lending compliance at other lenders under their jurisdiction. FDIC and  the Federal Reserve use this analysis to plan and scope their routine fair  lending compliance examinations.

As we have reported previously, quantifying such costs in  a meaningful way can be difficult for a variety of reasons, such as  challenges associated with obtaining reliable data from potentially  thousands of lenders that have different cost accounting systems and  underwriting policies. According to representatives from a banking trade  group and a large lender, the additional costs likely would include  expenses associated with (1) establishing information systems or upgrades  to collect the data in the proper format, (2) training costs for staff who  would be responsible for collecting and reporting the data, and (3) legal  and auditing costs to help ensure that the data were accurate and in  compliance with established standards. The representative from the large  lender said that costs also would be associated with electronically storing  and securing additional types of sensitive data that eventually would be  made public. Additionally, the official said thousands of employees, who  currently look at underwriting, but are not associated with reporting  HMDA data, would have to receive fair lending compliance training.  Additionally, the official said ensuring compliance with additional public  reporting requirements would require additional legal support to certify  the accuracy of the additional data. Finally, the costs may be relatively  higher for smaller institutions because they may be less likely than larger  lenders to collect and store underwriting and pricing data electronically or  may not currently retain any pricing data.", "While certain key underwriting data, such as borrower credit scores, DTI  ratios, and LTV ratios, generally would benefit regulatory screening efforts  and independent research, advocacy, and private enforcement, they may  not be sufficient to resolve questions about potential heightened risk for  discrimination by individual lenders or in the industry generally. As part of  fair lending investigations and examinations, enforcement agencies and  depository institution regulators may request a range of additional  underwriting data from lenders, such as detailed product information,  mortgage-rate lock dates, overages, additional fees paid, and counteroffer  information to help assess the basis for mortgage rate disparities identified  through initial analysis of HMDA data. However, according to  representatives from a banking trade group and a large lender, requiring  them to collect and publicly report such additional underwriting data as  part of their annual HMDA data submissions likely would involve  additional training, software, compliance, and other associated costs. In  addition, according to FTC, overage data may be closely guarded  proprietary information, which lenders likely would object to reporting  publicly on the grounds that they would represent disclosures to their  competitors.", "Several options could reduce the potential costs associated with requiring  lenders to collect and report certain underwriting variables as part of their  HMDA data submissions. For example, these options include    Large lender requirement\u2014requiring only the largest lenders to provide  expanded reporting. According to officials, many of these lenders already  collect and store such information electronically. According to published  reports, the top 25 mortgage originators accounted for 92 percent of total  mortgage loan volume in 2008. Thus, such a requirement would focus on  lenders that constitute the vast majority of mortgage lending and minimize  costs on smaller lenders, which may not record underwriting in electronic  form as most larger lenders reportedly do;   Regulatory (nonpublic) reporting of expanded data\u2014requiring all  HMDA filers to routinely report underwriting data only to the  depository institution regulators in conjunction with HMDA data (as  OCC is requiring six large lenders in its pilot study). In so doing, lenders  may facilitate depository institution regulators\u2019 efforts to identify potential  outliers while minimizing concerns about potential public reporting and  compliance costs; and   Nonpublic reporting limited to large lenders\u2014requiring only the largest  lenders to report expanded data to the depository institution regulators in  conjunction with their HMDA data filings.", "While all of these options would help mitigate additional costs to some  degree compared with a general requirement that lenders collect and  report publicly underwriting data, each would result in limited or no  additional information available to researchers and the public\u2014one of the  purposes of the act. In addition, according to DOJ, it is not clear whether  the enforcement agencies would have access to the expanded data under  the second or third options described above. Nevertheless, any of these  options could help enhance depository institution regulators\u2019 ability to  oversee and enforce fair lending laws. Without additional routinely  provided underwriting data, agencies and depository institution regulators  will continue to expend limited resources collecting such information on a  per institution basis as they initiate investigations and examinations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Data during the Preapplication Phase of Mortgage Lending May Result in a Gap in Fair Lending Oversight, and Addressing This Gap Has Been Challenging", "paragraphs": ["Another data limitation that might affect federal efforts to enforce the fair  lending laws is the lack of information about the preapplication process  for mortgage loans. HMDA data only capture information after a mortgage  loan application has been filed and a loan approved or denied. However,  fair lending laws apply to the entire loan process. The preapplication  process involves lenders\u2019 treatment of potential borrowers before an  application is filed, which could affect whether the potential borrower  applies for a loan and the type of loan. In a 1996 report on federal  enforcement of fair lending laws, we reported that discrimination could  occur in the treatment of customers before they actually applied for a  mortgage loan. This type of discrimination, which also would be a  violation under ECOA, could include spending less time with minority  customers when explaining the application process, giving them different  information on the variety of products available, or quoting different rates.", "Subsequent studies by researchers and fair housing organizations have  continued to raise concerns about the potential risk for discrimination in  mortgage lending during the preapplication phase. The methodology  used in these studies often included a technique known as matched pair  testing. In matched pair testing, individuals or couples of different  ethnicity, race, or sex pose as mortgage loan applicants, visit lenders at  different times, and meet with loan officers. The testers, or mystery  shoppers, usually present comparable financial backgrounds in terms of  assets, income, debt, and credit history, and are asked to request  information about similar loan products. For example, in a 2006 study th utilized testers who posed as low-income, first-time home buyers in  approximately 250 matched pair tests, researchers found evidence of  adverse treatment during the preapplication phase of African-Americans  at  and Hispanics in the Chicago metropolitan area. Specifically, the study found that African-American and Hispanic testers were less likely than  their white counterparts to be given detailed information about re or additional loan products and received less coaching and follow-up  communication. However, the authors of the study found that in Los  Angeles the treatment of white, African-American, and Hispanic testers  generally was similar.", "Agency officials we contacted said that the use of testers may have certain  advantages in terms of identifying potential risks for discrimination by  loan officers and other lending officials, but it also has a number of  challenges and limitations. For example, officials from FTC, NCUA, and  OTS said that testers require specialized skills and training, which results  in additional costs. In the early 1990s, FTC officials said that they used  testers as a part of their fair lending oversight activities and found the  effort not only to be costly but also inconclusive because matching  similarly situated borrowers and training the testers was difficult. OCC  indicated that it conducted a pilot testing program from 1994 through 1995  and found that indications of differing treatment were weak and involved  primarily unverifiable subjective perceptions, such as how friendly the  loan officer was to the tester. FTC officials said that current  technological advances have made the use of testers even more difficult  because loan officers can check a potential loan applicant\u2019s credit scores  during the initial meeting. Therefore, these officials said that loan officers  may suspect testers are not who they claim to be, thereby raising  questions about potential fraud that could affect the loan officer\u2019s  interactions with the testers and make any results unreliable. FTC officials  also noted that it also was difficult to script identical scenarios because  testers often would ask questions, react, and respond differently, which  can make test results unreliable. DOJ officials said that they only  occasionally used testers in the context of fair lending enforcement due to  the difficulties described above and the complexities involved in analyzing  lender treatment of testers during the mortgage preapplication process.  However, FDIC officials said they were in the early stages of analyzing the  costs of using testers and considering whether it would be beneficial to  use them in conjunction with their fair lending reviews.", "While the agencies and depository institution regulators\u2019 generally do not  use testers to assess the potential risk for discrimination during the  preapplication phase, the alternative strategies that are used have  limitations. In general, officials said that they encourage lenders to  voluntarily test for fair lending compliance, which may include the use of  testers. Officials said that they would review any available analysis when  conducting fair lending examinations. However, according to Federal  Reserve and OCC officials, this information provided by the use of in- house testers may be protected by the ECOA self-testing privilege, which  limits their ability to use it for examination purposes. Federal Reserve  officials also noted that few lenders conduct such testing. Depository  institution regulators also said that they review customer complaint data;  compare the number of applications filed by mortgage loan applicants of  different ethnicity, race, or sex and investigate any potential disparities;  and review HMDA and additional data to help determine the extent to  which minority mortgage loan applicants may have been steered into  relatively high-cost loans although they might have qualified for less- expensive alternatives. However, these alternative sources share the same  limitations as the use of testers, including the information may provide  only an inferential basis for determining if discrimination occurred during  the preapplication process and may not be reliable. The depository  institution regulators have yet to identify robust data or means of  assessing potential discrimination during this critical phase of the  mortgage lending process. In a recent report on the financial regulatory  system, the Department of the Treasury suggested that surveys of  borrowers and loan applicants may be an alternative means of assessing  compliance with consumer protection laws, such as the fair lending laws.  Without adequate data from the preapplication phase such as through the  use of testers, surveys, or alternative means, any fair lending oversight and  enforcement will be incomplete because it will include only information  on the borrowers that apply for credit and not the larger universe of  potential borrowers who sought it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Personal Characteristic Data for Nonmortgage Lending Limits Effectiveness of Efforts to Detect Potential Risk for Fair Lending Law Violations", "paragraphs": ["A final data limitation is that depository institution regulators generally do  not have access to personal characteristic data (for example, race,  ethnicity, and sex) for nonmortgage loans, such as business, credit card,  and automobile loans. In a 2008 report, we reported that Federal Reserve  Regulation B generally prohibits lenders from requesting and collecting  such personal characteristic data from applicants for nonmortgage loans.  The Federal Reserve concluded in 2003 that lifting Regulation B\u2019s general  prohibition and permitting voluntary collection of data on personal  characteristic data for nonmortgage loan applicants, without any  limitations or standards, could create some risk that the information  would be used for discriminatory purposes. The Federal Reserve also  argued that amending Regulation B and permitting lenders to collect such  data on a voluntary basis would result in inconsistent and noncomparable  data. In the absence of personal characteristic data for nonmortgage loans,  we found that agencies tended to focus their oversight activities more on  mortgage lending rather than on areas such as automobile, credit card, and  business lending that are also subject to fair lending laws.", "While the interagency procedures that depository institution regulators  use to conduct fair lending examinations provide for assessing the  potential risk for discrimination in nonmortgage lending, our 2008 report  concluded that such procedures had a high potential for error and were  time-consuming and costly. Under the interagency procedures, examiners  may make use of established \u201csurrogates\u201d to deduce nonmortgage loan  applicants\u2019 race, ethnicity, or sex. For example, after consulting with their  agency\u2019s supervisory staff, the procedures allow examiners to assume that  an applicant is Hispanic based on the last name, female based on the first  name, or likely to be an African-American based on the census tract of the  address. However, there is the potential for error in the use of such  surrogates (for example, certain first names are gender neutral, and not all  residents of particular census tract may be African-American).  Furthermore, using such surrogates may require examiners to cull through  individual nonmortgage loan files. In contrast, HMDA data allow  enforcement agencies and depository institution regulators to identify  potential outliers through statistical analysis.", "As we reported, requiring lenders to collect personal characteristic data  for nonmortgage loans to facilitate the regulatory supervision and  independent research into the potential risk for discrimination would  involve additional costs for lenders. These potential costs included  information system integration, employee training, and compliance costs.  A requirement that lenders collect and publicly report such personal  characteristic data likely would need to be accompanied by a requirement  that they provide underwriting data to better inform assessments of their  lending practices. However, because certain types of nonmortgage  lending, such as small business lending, generally are more complicated  than mortgage lending, the amount of underwriting data that would need  to be reported to allow for informed assessments likely would be  comparatively higher as would the associated reporting costs. Similar to  the options for expanding HMDA data, several options could facilitate  depository institution regulators\u2019 efforts to assess the potential risk for  discrimination in nonmortgage lending while mitigating potential lender  costs. In particular, lenders could be required to collect such data for  certain types of loans, such as small business loans, and make the data  available to depository institution regulators rather than publicly report it."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Lenders That May Pose Relatively Greater Risks of Violating Fair Lending Laws Generally Are Subject to Less Comprehensive Federal Oversight Due to the Fragmented Regulatory Structure and Other Factors", "paragraphs": ["Lenders that may represent heightened risks of fair lending violations are  subject to relatively less comprehensive federal review of their activities  than other lenders.

To assess lender compliance, each  of the depository institution regulators is to follow the Interagency Fair  Lending Examination Procedures, which were established jointly by the depository institution regulators in 1999.

According to agency officials, if loan officers have substantial discretion  under lender policies, the risk of discriminatory lending decisions is  higher. DOJ, HUD and FTC officials also may request raw HMDA data  from lenders and test their accuracy and request loan underwriting or  overage data.

The Federal Reserve interprets its authority as  permitting it to conduct consumer compliance oversight of nonbank  subsidiaries when there is evidence of potentially heightened risks for  violations, such as through annual analysis of HMDA data or other sources  of information such as previous examinations or consumer complaints.  However, pursuant to a 1998 policy, Federal Reserve examiners are  prohibited from conducting routine consumer compliance examinations of  nonbank subsidiaries. According to FTC, while the agency also has  authority over nonbank subsidiaries, its capacity to oversee them is  limited due to resource limitations as discussed earlier. Due to the risks  associated with nonbank subsidiaries, in 2004, we suggested that Congress  consider (1) providing the Federal Reserve with the authority to routinely  monitor and, as necessary, examine nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding  companies to ensure compliance with federal consumer protection laws  and (2) giving the Federal Reserve specific authority to initiate  enforcement actions under those laws against these nonbank  subsidiaries.", "While Congress has not yet acted on our 2004 suggestion, Federal Reserve  officials said that they have implemented a variety of steps within their  authority to strengthen consumer compliance supervision, including fair  lending supervision of nonbank subsidiaries since our 2004 report.

Based on these risk  assessments, the officials said examiners may conduct a targeted  examination on a case-by-case basis. Furthermore, when a nonbank  subsidiary has been identified as a potential outlier, Federal Reserve  officials said similar to oversight practices for state member banks, they  assess the entity for risk of pricing discrimination and may conduct  additional statistical pricing reviews through the use of HMDA data and  other information to better understand its potential risks. During such  reviews, Federal Reserve officials said that examiners closely review the  lender\u2019s policies and procedures and with the approval of the Director of  Consumer Compliance also may conduct loan file reviews if there is  potential evidence of a fair lending violation.

OCC officials told us that part of the  reason for this was because OCC conducts continuous supervision of large  banks, and the database for large banks does not contain a field for  examination start and end dates. Also, the documentation of outlier  examination methodologies and findings and recommendations was not  readily available or necessarily summarized in memorandums for  management\u2019s review.

DOJ officials said that referrals typically  were based on a single examination, which may cover a limited period  (such as potential discrimination based on an analysis of HMDA data for a  particular year).

DOJ officials said that to determine  if a referred pattern or practice of discrimination warrants federal court  litigation, they may request additional HMDA and underwriting data for  additional years and analyze them. Furthermore, they said that lenders  often hire law firms that specialize in fair lending to assist the lender in its  response to the department\u2019s investigation. DOJ officials said that these  firms may conduct their own analysis of the HMDA and underwriting and  pricing data and, as part of the investigation process, offer their views  about why any apparent disparities may be explained. Depending on the  circumstances, this process can be lengthy. According to a 2008 report by  FDIC\u2019s Inspector General, fair lending referrals that are not sent back to  the referring agency for further review may be at DOJ for years before  they are resolved. Additionally, HUD officials said that their initial  investigations into evidence of potential fair lending violations may detect  additional evidence of discrimination that also must be collected and  reviewed.", "According to officials from an enforcement agency and available research,  another challenge that complicates fair lending investigations involves  lending discrimination based on disparate impact, which we also raised as  an enforcement challenge in our 1996 report. As discussed in the  Interagency Policy Statement on Discrimination in Lending, issued in 1994,  fair lending violations may include allegations of disparate treatment or  disparate impact. It is illegal for a lender to treat borrowers from  protected classes differently, such as intentionally charging  disproportionately higher interest rates based on race, sex, or national  origin that are not related to creditworthiness or other legitimate  considerations. It also is illegal for a lender to maintain a facially neutral  policy or practice that has a disproportionately adverse effect on members  of a protected group for which there is no business necessity that could  not be met by a less discriminatory alternative. For example, a lender  might have a blanket prohibition on originating loans below a certain  dollar threshold because smaller loans might be more appealing to  borrowers with limited financial resources and therefore represent higher  default risks. While such a policy might help protect a lender against credit  losses, it also could affect minority borrowers disproportionately.  Furthermore, alternatives other than a blanket prohibition might mitigate  potential losses, such as reviewing applicant credit data. It may be difficult  for enforcement agencies or depository institution regulators to evaluate  lender claims that they have a business necessity for particular policies  and identify viable alternatives that would not have a disparate impact on  targeted groups. However, an official from the Federal Reserve told us that  the potential for disparate impact can be assessed through its examination  and other oversight processes. The official said the Federal Reserve has  evaluated lenders\u2019 policies to assess the potential disparate impact and has  referred at least one lender to DOJ based on the disparate impact theory.", "DOJ and FTC officials also said that recruiting and retaining staff with  specialized expertise in fair lending laws can be challenging. Both DOJ and  FTC officials said that recruiting attorneys with expertise in fair lending  investigations and litigation was difficult, and employees who develop  such expertise may leave for other positions, including at other federal  depository institution regulators or quasi-governmental agencies that offer  higher compensation. Additionally, DOJ and FTC officials said that  recruiting and retaining economists who have expertise in analyzing  HMDA data and underwriting data to detect potential disparities in  mortgage lending can be difficult.

Currently, ECOA\u2019s statute of limitations for  referrals to DOJ from the depository institution regulators and for actions  brought on DOJ\u2019s own authority requires that no legal actions in federal  court be initiated more than 2 years after the alleged violation occurred.  According to federal officials, the ECOA statute of limitations may limit  their activities because HMDA data generally are not available for a year or  more after a potential lending violation has occurred. Consequently,  federal agencies and regulators may have less than a year to schedule an  investigation or examination, collect and review additional HMDA and  underwriting and pricing data, and pursue other approaches to determine  if a referral to DOJ would be warranted. According to OTS officials, an  extension of the statue of limitations beyond its current 2-year period  would provide valuable additional time to conduct the detailed analyses  that is necessary in fair lending cases. Accordingly, FDIC has  recommended that Congress extend ECOA\u2019s statute of limitations to 5  years. DOJ officials noted that they would not be averse to the statute of  limitations being extended.", "While federal officials said that there are options to manage the challenges  associated with the ECOA statutes of limitations, these options have  limitations.

Specifically, under FHA, DOJ may bring an FHA action  based on a pattern or practice or for general public importance within 5  years for civil penalties and within 3 years for damages; there is no  limitation period for injunctive relief. However, not all ECOA violations  necessarily constitute FHA violations as well. Enforcement agency  officials also said that in some cases they may be able to obtain tolling  agreements as a means to manage the ECOA and FHA statutes of  limitations. Tolling agreements are written agreements between  enforcement agencies, or private litigants, and potential respondents, such  as lenders subject to investigations or examinations for potential fair  lending violations, in which the respondent agrees to extend the relevant  statute of limitations so that investigations and examinations may  continue. Enforcement agency officials said that lenders often agree to  tolling agreements and work with the agencies to explain potential fair  lending law violations, such as disparities in mortgage pricing. The  officials said that the lenders have an incentive to agree to tolling  agreements because the enforcement agencies otherwise may file wide- ranging complaints against them on the basis of available information  shortly before the relevant statute of limitations expires. However,  enforcement officials said it is not always possible to obtain lenders\u2019  consent to enter into tolling agreements, and our review of fair lending  examination files confirmed this assessment. We found several instances  in which depository institution regulators had difficulty obtaining tolling  agreements. Because federal enforcement efforts to manage ECOA\u2019s 2- year statute of limitations may not always be successful, the agencies\u2019  capacity to thoroughly investigate potential fair lending violations and take  appropriate corrective action in certain cases may be compromised."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal enforcement agencies and depository institution regulators face  challenges in consistently, efficiently, and effectively overseeing and  enforcing fair lending laws due in part to data limitations and the  fragmented U.S. financial regulatory structure. HMDA data, while useful in  screening for potentially heightened risks of fair lending violations in  mortgage lending, are limited because they currently lack the underwriting  data needed to perform a robust analysis. While requiring lenders to  collect and report such data would impose additional costs on them,  particularly for smaller institutions, the lack of this information  compromises the depository institution regulators\u2019 ability to effectively  and efficiently oversee and enforce fair lending laws. Such data also could  facilitate independent research into the potential risk for discrimination in  mortgage lending as well as better inform Congress and the public about  this critical issue. A variety of options could mitigate costs associated with  additional HMDA reporting, including limiting the reporting to larger  lenders or restricting its use for regulatory purposes. While these  alternatives would limit or restrict additional publicly available  information on the potential risk for mortgage discrimination compared to  a general data collection and reporting requirement, these are tradeoffs  that merit consideration because additional data would facilitate the  consistent, efficient, and effective oversight and enforcement of fair  lending laws.", "The limited data available about potentially heightened risks for  discrimination during the preapplication process also affects federal  oversight of the fair lending laws for mortgage lending. Currently,  enforcement agencies and depository institution regulators lack a direct  and reliable source of data to help determine if lending officials may have  engaged in discriminatory practices in their initial interactions with  mortgage loan applicants. While researchers and consumer groups have  conducted studies using testers that suggest that discrimination does take  place during the preapplication process and federal officials generally  agree that testers offer certain benefits, federal officials also have raised  several concerns about their use. For example, they have questioned the  costs of using testers and the reliability of data obtained in using them.  Nevertheless, the lack of a reliable means to assess the potential risk for  discrimination during the preapplication phase compromises depository  institution regulators\u2019 capacity to ensure lender compliance with the fair  lending law in all phases of the mortgage lending process. In this regard,  FDIC\u2019s possible incorporation of testers into its examination process,  depository institution regulators\u2019 ongoing efforts to update the interagency  fair lending examination guidance, or the Interagency Task Force on Fair  Lending may offer opportunities to identify improved means of assessing  discrimination in the preapplication phase. Moreover, the potential use of  consumer surveys as suggested by the Department of the Treasury in its  recent report on regulatory restructuring may represent another approach  to assessing the potential risk for discrimination during the preapplication  phase.", "Data limitations may have even more significant impacts on depository  institution regulators\u2019 and enforcement agencies\u2019 capacity to assess fair  lending risk in nonmortgage lending (such as small business, credit card,  and automobile lending). Because Federal Reserve Regulation B generally  prohibits lenders from collecting personal characteristic data for  nonmortgage loans, agencies generally cannot target lenders for  investigations or examinations as they can for mortgage loans.  Consequently, federal agencies have limited tools to investigate potentially  heightened risks of violations in types of lending that affect most U.S.  consumers. While depository institution regulators and enforcement  agencies have tried to develop ways to provide oversight in this area, the  existing data limitations have affected the focus of oversight and  enforcement efforts. While requiring lenders to collect and report personal  characteristic data for nonmortgage loans as well as associated  underwriting data as may be appropriate raises important cost and  complexity concerns, the absence of such data represents a critical  limitation in federal fair lending oversight efforts.", "There also are a number of larger challenges to fair lending oversight and  enforcement stemming from the fragmented U.S. regulatory structure and  other factors such as mission focus and resource constraints. Specifically,  Independent lenders, which were the predominant originators of subprime  and other questionable mortgages that often were made to minority  borrowers in recent years, generally are subject to less comprehensive  oversight than federally insured depository institutions and represent  significant fair lending risks. In particular, enforcement agencies do not  conduct investigations of many independent lenders that are identified as  outliers through the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual analysis of HMDA data to  determine if these disparities represent fair lending law violations. The  potential exists that additional instances of discrimination against  borrowers could be taking place at such firms without being detected.  Such limited oversight could undermine enforcement agencies\u2019 efforts to  deter violations. While depository institution regulators\u2019 outlier  examinations differ in important respects from enforcement agency  investigations, depository institution regulators generally conduct  examinations of all lenders identified as outliers to assess the potential  risk for discrimination, which likely contributes to efforts at deterrence.  Moreover, enforcement agencies, unlike most depository institution  regulators, generally do not initiate fair lending investigations of  independent lenders on a routine basis that are not viewed as outliers,  which represents an important gap in fair lending oversight.", "The Federal Reserve lacks clear authority to assess fair lending  compliance by nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies, which  also have originated large numbers of subprime mortgages, in the same  way that it oversees the activities of state-chartered depository institutions  under its jurisdiction. The lack of clear authority to conduct routine  consumer compliance examinations of nonbank subsidiaries is important  because the Federal Reserve identifies many potential fair lending  violations at state-chartered banks through such routine examinations.  Without similar authority for nonbank subsidiaries, the Federal Reserve\u2019s  capacity to identify potential risks for fair lending violations is limited.", "Despite the joint interagency fair lending examination guidance and  various coordination efforts, we also found that having multiple  depository institution regulators resulted in variations in screening  techniques, the management of the outlier examination process,  examination documentation standards, and the number of referrals and  types of examination findings. While differences in these areas may not be  unexpected given the varied types of lenders under each depository  institution regulator\u2019s jurisdiction, these differences raise questions about  the consistency and effectiveness of regulatory oversight. For example,  the evidence suggests that lenders regulated by FDIC, the Federal Reserve,  and OTS are more likely than lenders regulated by OCC and NCUA to be  the subject of referrals to DOJ for being at potentially heightened risk of  fair lending violations. Our current work did not fully evaluate the reasons  and effects of identified differences and additional work in this area could  help provide additional clarity.", "Finally, federal depository institution regulators and enforcement agencies  also face some challenges associated with the 2-year statute of limitations  under ECOA applicable to federal district court actions brought by DOJ.  Because it takes about 6 months for the Federal Reserve to reconcile and  review HMDA data, depository institution regulators and enforcement  agencies typically review the HMDA data almost one year after the  underlying loan decisions occurred, and may have a limited opportunity to  conduct thorough examinations and investigations in some cases. While  strategies may be available to manage the ECOA 2-year statute of  limitations, such as obtaining tolling agreements, they are not always  effective. Therefore, ECOA\u2019s statute of limitations may work against the  act\u2019s general objective, which is to penalize and deter lending  discrimination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate the capacity of federal enforcement agencies and depository  institution regulators as well as independent researchers to identify  lenders that may be engaged in discriminatory practices in violation of the  fair lending laws, Congress should consider the merits of additional data  collection and reporting options. These varying options pertain to  obtaining key underwriting data for mortgage loans, such as credit scores  as well as LTV and DTI ratios, and personal characteristic (such as race,  ethnicity and sex) and relevant underwriting data for nonmortgage loans.", "To help ensure that all potential risks for fair lending violations are  thoroughly investigated and sufficient time is available to do so, Congress  should consider extending the statute of limitations on ECOA violations.", "As Congress debates the reform of the financial regulatory system, it also  should take steps to help ensure that consumers are adequately protected,  that laws such as the fair lending laws are comprehensive and consistently  applied, and that oversight is efficient and effective. Any new structure  should address gaps and inconsistencies in the oversight of independent  mortgage brokers and nonbank subsidiaries, as well as address the  potentially inconsistent oversight provided by depository institution  regulators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help strengthen fair lending oversight and enforcement, we recommend  that DOJ, FDIC, Federal Reserve, FTC, HUD, NCUA, OCC, and OTS work  collaboratively to identify approaches to better assess the potential risk  for discrimination during the preapplication phase of mortgage lending.

We received written  comments from FTC, FDIC, NCUA, the Federal Reserve, OCC, and OTS,  which are summarized below and reprinted in appendixes III through VIII.   HUD provided its comments in an e-mail which is summarized below.   DOJ did not provide written comments.  All of the agencies and regulators,  including DOJ, also provided technical comments, which we incorporated  into the report where appropriate. We also provided excerpts of the draft  report to two researchers whose studies we cited to help ensure the  accuracy of our analysis.  One of the researchers responded and said that  the draft report accurately described his research, while the other did not  respond.", "In the written comments provided by FDIC, the Federal Reserve, NCUA,  OCC, and OTS, they agreed with our recommendation to work  collaboratively regarding the potential use of testers or other means to  better assess the risk of discriminatory practices during the premortgage  loan application process, and generally described their fair lending  oversight programs and, in some cases, planned enhancements to these  programs. In particular, the Federal Reserve stated that it would be  pleased to provide technical assistance to Congress regarding potential  enhancements to HMDA data to better identify lenders at heightened risk  of potential fair lending violations and described its existing approaches to  fair lending oversight, including for the nonbank subsidiaries of bank  holding companies.  Further, the Federal Reserve stated that it is  developing a framework for increased risk-based supervision for these  entities.  While such enhancements could strengthen the Federal Reserve\u2019s  oversight of nonbank subsidiaries, the lack of clear authority for it to  conduct routine examinations continues to be an important limitation in  fair lending oversight and enforcement.", "OCC also described its fair lending oversight program and planned  revisions. First, OCC stated that it planned to enhance its procedures by  formalizing headquarters involvement in the oversight process. For  example, senior OCC headquarters officials will receive reports on at least  a quarterly basis on scheduled, pending, and completed fair lending  examinations to facilitate oversight of the examination process.  Second,  OCC plans to strengthen its fair lending examination documentation  through, for example, changes in its centralized data systems so that the  systems contain, in standardized form: relevant examination dates, the risk  factors that were identified through the screening and other processes for  each lender, the focal points of the examination, the reasons for any  differences between the focal points and the areas identified through the  risk screening processes, and the key findings of the examinations. OCC  also noted that it (1) plans to expand its \u201cHMDA-plus\u201d pilot program to  collect underwriting data from large banks at an earlier stage to facilitate  screening efforts, (2) views working with other regulators to enhance the  effectiveness and consistency of screening efforts as appropriate, and (3)  will undertake work with other regulators and DOJ to address variations  in referral practices.", "NCUA\u2019s Chairman generally concurred with the draft report\u2019s analysis and  recommendations and offered additional information.  First, the Chairman  stated that additional study is needed to assess the depository institution  regulators\u2019 varying referral practices, but that such study should be  conducted before drawing any conclusions about the effectiveness of  NCUA\u2019s fair lending oversight.  The Chairman stated that NCUA has not  made any referrals to DOJ because the agency did not identify any  potential violations during the period covered by the report.  Further, the  Chairman stated NCUA uses the same examination procedures as the  other depository institution regulators and offered reasons as to why  violations may not exist at credit unions.  For example, the Chairman said  that credit unions have a specified mission of meeting the credit and  savings needs of their members, especially persons of modest means (who  typically are the target of discriminatory actions).  We have not evaluated  the Chairman\u2019s analysis as to why fair lending violations may not exist at  credit unions, but note that there is a potential for discrimination in any  credit decision and that all federal agencies and regulators have a  responsibility to identify and punish such violations as well as deter  similar activity.  The Chairman also (1) concurred that additional data  collection under HMDA could enhance efforts to detect lenders at  heightened risk of violations, but believes that such requirements should  pertain to all lenders rather than a subset; (2) agreed that ECOA\u2019s statute  of limitations should be extended; and (3) concurred with the  recommendation that NCUA work collaboratively with other regulators  and agencies to better assess the potential for discrimination during the  preapplication phase of mortgage lending.", "In an e-mail, HUD said that improved communication and cooperation  among the federal agencies responsible for overseeing federal fair lending  laws could improve federal compliance and enforcement efforts.  HUD  also concurred with the draft report\u2019s analysis that expanding the range of  data reported, by mortgage lenders pursuant to HMDA would significantly  expand the department\u2019s ability to identify new cases of potential lending  discrimination.  In particular, HUD stated that requiring lenders to report  underwriting data, such as borrowers\u2019 credit scores, would allow the  department to more accurately assess lenders\u2019 compliance with the Fair  Housing Act.  However, HUD urged careful consideration be paid to any  proposal to limit the range of lenders subject to new reporting  requirements under HMDA.  HUD stated that, in its experience, smaller  lenders, no less than larger lenders, may exhibit disparities in lending that  warrant investigation for compliance with federal law.  In addition, HUD  stated that many smaller lenders may already collect and maintain for  other business purposes the same data, which may be sought through  expanded HMDA reporting requirements.", "FTC\u2019s Director, Bureau of Consumer Protection, stated that the draft  report appropriately drew attention to limitations in HMDA data as a  means to identify lenders at heightened risk of fair lending violations.  The  Director also highlighted two conclusions in the draft report and noted  that limitations of the data warranted collecting additional data before any  conclusions about discrimination could be drawn.  First, the Director  stated that the report concluded that independent lenders have a  heightened risk of potential violations compared to depository institutions.   The Director said that many lenders make very few or no high-priced loans  and thus cannot be evaluated by an analysis of HMDA pricing data  whereas independent lenders disproportionately make such loans.   Therefore, the Director said it is not possible to draw conclusions as to  which types of lenders are more likely to have committed violations solely  on the basis of HMDA data or the outlier lists and that such a conclusion  about independent lenders is especially tenuous.  The Director also stated  that the report recommends that additional underwriting data be collected  to supplement current mortgage data but does not address the importance  of discretionary pricing data.  The Director stated that lender discretion in  granting or pricing credit represents a significant fair lending risk, and that  the agency collects such information, in addition to underwriting  information, as part of its investigations.  In sum, the Director stated that  while HMDA data is useful, additional data must be collected from lenders  before any conclusions about discrimination can meaningfully be drawn.", "We have revised the draft to more fully reflect the Director\u2019s views  regarding limitations in HMDA data and its capacity to identify lenders at  heightened risk of fair lending violations and draw conclusions about  potential discrimination in mortgage lending. However, HMDA data may  have limitations with respect to identifying mortgage pricing disparities as  the Director noted. We do not concur that statements in the draft report  suggesting that independent lenders may represent relatively heightened  risks of fair lending violations are especially tenuous.  As stated in the  draft report, subprime loans and similar high cost mortgages, which are  largely originated by independent lenders and nonbank subsidiaries of  holding companies, appear to have been made to borrowers with limited  or poor credit histories and subsequently resulted in significant  foreclosure rates for such borrowers. Further, our 2007 report noted that  subprime lending grew rapidly in areas with higher concentrations of  minorities. While the scope or our work did not involve an analysis of the  feasibility and costs of incorporating discretionary pricing data into HMDA  data collection and reporting requirements, we acknowledge that the lack  of such information may challenge oversight and enforcement efforts.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from report  date.

We gathered information on how  enforcement agencies\u2014the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and the  Department of Justice (DOJ)\u2014and depository institution regulators\u2014the  Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Federal Deposit  Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the National Credit Union Administration  (NCUA), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS)\u2014use data sources  such as HMDA data to screen for high-risk lenders. HMDA requires many  mortgage lenders to collect and report data on mortgage applicants and  borrowers. In 2004, HMDA was amended to require lenders to report  certain mortgage loan pricing data. To assess the strengths and limitations  of these data, we reviewed academic research, studies from consumer  advocacy groups, Inspectors General reports, Congressional testimonies,  and prior GAO work on the strengths and limitations of HMDA data and  the limited availability of data for nonmortgage lending. We also reviewed  available information on current initiatives to gather enhanced HMDA data  (adding underwriting information such as loan-to-value ratios and credit  scores) earlier in the screening and examination process, such as OCC\u2019s  pilot project. In addition, we interviewed officials from the enforcement  agencies and depository institution regulators listed above\u2014including  senior officials, examiners, policy analysts, economists, statisticians,  attorneys, and compliance specialists\u2014to discuss how they use various  data sources to screen for high-risk lenders, gather their perspectives on  the strengths and limitations of available data sources, and obtain  information on the costs of reporting HMDA data. We did not interview  NCUA economists or attorneys and NCUA does not have statisticians. We  did interview senior officials, examiners, policy analysts and compliance  specialists. We also discussed current initiatives to address screening  during the preapplication phase of lending, and the potential benefits and  limitations of using testers during this phase. We evaluated the depository  institution regulators\u2019 examination guidance and approaches for the  preapplication phase. We interviewed researchers, lenders,  representatives from community and fair housing groups, and independent  software vendors to gather perspectives on the strengths and limitations of  HMDA data in the fair lending screening process and the benefits and  costs of requiring the collection of additional or enhanced HMDA data.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed and analyzed enforcement  agency and depository institution regulator documents. More specifically,  we reviewed and analyzed internal fair lending examination and  investigation guidance, policies, and procedures; federal statutes and  information provided by the agencies on their authority, mission and  jurisdiction; the Federal Reserve\u2019s annual HMDA outlier lists; information  on staffing resources; documentation on the number of fair lending  enforcement actions initiated and settled; and other agency documents to  compare and contrast the agencies\u2019 and depository institution regulators\u2019  authority and efforts to oversee the fair lending laws, including  enforcement and investigative practices. We also obtained information on  depository institution regulators\u2019 outlier examination programs from  internal agency documents and our file review of examinations of outlier  institutions, as discussed below. Furthermore, we interviewed key agency  officials from the eight enforcement agencies and depository institution  regulators that oversee the fair lending laws to gather information on their  regulatory and enforcement activities and compare their approaches. To  gather information on state coordination of fair lending oversight with  federal agencies, as well as to compare and contrast fair lending  examination policies and practices, we also interviewed state banking  regulatory officials and community groups.", "We also evaluated certain aspects of depository institution regulators\u2019  compliance with fair lending outlier examination schedules and  procedures. Specifically, we conducted a systematic review of 152 fair  lending examination summary files derived from each depository  institution regulator\u2019s annual list of institutions identified to be at higher  risk for fair lending violations (that is, their outlier lists). We examined  outlier lists based on 2005 and 2006 HMDA data because they fully  incorporated pricing data (first introduced in 2004 HMDA data), and  because the examinations based on these lists had a higher likelihood of  being completed. We systematically collected information and evaluated  each examination\u2019s compliance with key agency regulations and  interagency and internal fair lending guidance. For instance, we reviewed  the files to determine if outlier examinations had been initiated in a timely  fashion; if examination scoping, focal points, and findings had been  documented; and if recommendations were made to correct any  deficiencies. We limited our focus to assessing regulatory compliance with  applicable laws, regulations, and internal guidance and did not make  judgments on how well agencies conducted the examinations. For three of  the depository institution regulators\u2014the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and  OTS\u2014we reviewed summary documentation (such as reports of  examination, scope and methodology memorandums, exit and closing  memorandums, and referral documentation to DOJ) of completed  examinations for every institution on their 2005 and 2006 HMDA data  outlier lists when relevant.  This amounted to 32 examinations for the  Federal Reserve, 38 for FDIC, and 40 for OTS.  Because NCUA (1) does not  have a centralized process for identifying outliers, (2) was unable to  respond to our document request in a timely manner, and (3) had a  relatively low number of credit unions identified as outliers by the Federal  Reserve, we randomly selected and reviewed summary documentation for  a sample of 10 examinations conducted in 2007 to capture examinations  that analyzed loans made in 2005 and 2006 (out of 25 examinations).", "We also reviewed a random sample of national banks due to limitations in  OCC\u2019s fair lending examination documentation and the need to conduct  our analysis in a timely manner. We randomly selected a simple sample of  27 examinations of institutions from a population of 231 institution  examinations derived from OCC\u2019s annual outlier lists for 2005 and 2006  HMDA data. Because OCC also randomly selects a sample of banks (both  HMDA and non-HMDA filing) to receive comprehensive fair lending  examinations, we also reviewed examination files from 2005 for five of  these institutions (out of a population of 31). Thus, our sample totaled 32  lender examinations and we requested that OCC provide all fair lending  oversight materials for each of these lenders from 2005 through 2008 so  that we could discern the extent to which OCC was complying with  regulations and guidance for its outlier examination program. We  collected the same information for these examinations as from the other  depository institution regulators.", "In addition, we reviewed guidance, policies, procedures, relevant statutes,  and other documents from the Federal Reserve to assess the extent of fair  lending oversight conducted for nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding  companies. We also reviewed past GAO reports on the history of oversight  of nonbank subsidiaries of bank and thrift holding companies. We  interviewed agency officials and consumer advocacy groups to gather  their perspectives on the extent of current oversight for nonbank  subsidiaries of bank holding companies. We also spoke with agency  officials to gather information on a current interagency pilot program  between the Federal Reserve, OTS, FTC, and the Conference of State Bank  Supervisors to monitor the activities of nonbank subsidiaries of holding  companies.", "For the third objective, in addition to reviewing our analysis of depository  institution regulators\u2019 compliance with fair lending examination policies as  described above, we (1) conducted further comparisons of their outlier  examination screening processes, (2) reviewed documentation and reports  related to their management of the outlier examination process and  documentation and reporting of examination findings; and (3) reviewed  documentation related to their referral practices and outlier examination  findings. We also reviewed relevant federal internal control standards for  documentation and reporting and compared them to the depository  institution regulators\u2019 practices as appropriate. We also discussed these  issues with senior officials from the depository institution regulators and  state financial regulatory officials from New York, Washington, and  Massachusetts. In addition, we discussed their efforts to coordinate fair  lending oversight programs through the development of interagency  examination guidance and participation in meetings of the Interagency  Task Force on Fair Lending and related forums.", "To address the fourth objective, we reviewed agencies\u2019 internal policies,  procedures, and guidance as well as federal statutory requirements that  depository institution regulators use when making referrals or  notifications to HUD or DOJ for potential violations of the Equal Credit  Opportunity Act (ECOA) and the Fair Housing Act. We also analyzed  information on enforcement agencies\u2019 and depository institution  regulators\u2019 staff resources and any time constraints they might face related  to ECOA\u2019s 2-year statute of limitations for making referrals to DOJ for  follow-up investigations and potential enforcement actions. To obtain  information on the enforcement activities of federal agencies, we  conducted an analysis of the number of fair lending investigations  initiated, complaints filed, and settlements reached by each enforcement  agency. We also interviewed officials from each depository institution  regulator and enforcement agency to gather information on investigative  practices that enforcement agencies use when deciding whether to pursue  a fair lending investigation or complaint against an institution and possible  challenges that enforcement agencies and depository institution regulators  face in enforcing the fair lending laws, specifically ECOA\u2019s 2-year statute  of limitations.", "For all the objectives, we interviewed representatives from financial  institutions and several consumer advocacy groups and trade associations  such as the Center for Responsible Lending, the National Community  Reinvestment Coalition, and the National Fair Housing Alliance,  Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, a large commercial bank, and  Consumer Bankers\u2019 Association. We obtained their perspectives on  regulatory efforts to enforce fair lending laws, which include screening  lenders for potential violations, conducting examinations, and enforcing  the laws through referrals, investigations, or other means, and any  collaborative activities between depository institution regulators and state  entities.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2008 to July 2009 in  Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.
