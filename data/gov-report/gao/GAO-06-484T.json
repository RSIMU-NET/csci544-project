With unemployed workers at a greater risk of long-term unemployment than in the past, it is increasingly important to understand how individual workers are being served by UI. This testimony draws upon the results of three GAO reports providing new information about (1) the extent to which individual workers ever receive UI benefits or receive benefits multiple times, (2) the types of workers who are more likely to receive UI, and (3) what is known about the extent to which UI beneficiaries receive reemployment services and their reemployment outcomes. GAO is not making new recommendations at this time. The Department of Labor (Labor) generally agreed with the findings from each of the three reports on UI, but took issue with GAO's recommendation that the Secretary work with states to consider collecting more comprehensive information on UI claimants' services and outcomes.

The UI program is a federal-state  partnership designed to partially replace lost earnings of individuals who  become unemployed through no fault of their own and to stabilize the  economy in times of economic downturn. In fiscal year 2004, the UI  program covered about 129 million wage and salary workers and paid  about $41 billion in benefits to nearly 9 million workers who lost their  jobs. Despite the size and scope of this program, there has been only  limited information about how often the program is accessed by individual  workers over time, the types of workers who are most likely to receive  benefits, or the extent to which claimants are receiving services that help  them to become reemployed.", "Today, I will draw upon the results of three recent reports we have  completed that provide new information about the extent to which  individual workers are being served by the UI program. In particular, I will  discuss (1) the extent to which individual workers ever receive UI  benefits, including the extent to which they receive benefits multiple  times, (2) the types of workers who are more likely to receive UI benefits,  and (3) what is known about the extent to which UI beneficiaries receive  reemployment services and their reemployment outcomes.", "To address the first and second questions, we analyzed data from the  Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS) National Longitudinal Survey of Youth  1979 (NLSY79). The dataset contains very detailed information about the  work and life experiences of a nationally representative sample of  individuals who were born between 1957 and 1964. At the time of our  analysis, the database contained over two decades\u2019 worth of information  gathered from interviews conducted between 1979 and 2002, and covered  a range of experiences, such as individuals\u2019 work histories, incomes,  family composition, and education. To address the third question, we  conducted telephone interviews with UI and workforce development  officials in 50 states, sent a follow-up questionnaire to gather information  on the strategies states use to collect data on UI claimants who receive  reemployment services, interviewed state and local program officials in  Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, and Washington, and interviewed Labor  officials and other experts in the area of UI and reemployment services.", "In summary, we estimate that while 76 percent of workers born between  1957 and 1964 experienced at least one period of unemployment during  the first half of their working lives in which they would likely have been  eligible for UI benefits, about 38 percent actually received UI. Of those  who received UI benefits, 44 percent received them more than once.  Among workers who are eligible to receive UI benefits, those who are  more likely to actually receive these benefits are younger, have higher  earnings before becoming unemployed, have completed more years of  education, or have already received UI benefits in the past than otherwise  similar workers. The last factor\u2014past experience with the UI program\u2014 has a particularly strong effect on the likelihood of receiving UI benefits.

UI-eligible workers from certain industries\u2014such as mining and  manufacturing\u2014are more likely than other workers to receive UI benefits.  In the area of helping UI claimants return to work, we found that across  states, UI claimants have access to a variety of reemployment services,  and although most states accept UI claims remotely by telephone or  Internet, states make use of UI program requirements to connect  claimants with available services at various points in their claim. However,  federal reporting requirements for states\u2019 UI programs and for federally  funded employment and training programs do not provide a full picture of  the services received or the outcomes obtained by all UI claimants, and  few states monitor the extent to which claimants are receiving these  services or outcomes for these claimants, in part because states\u2019  information systems have limited capabilities. GAO recommended that  Labor, working with the states, consider collecting more comprehensive  information on UI claimants\u2019 services and outcomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The UI program was established by Title III of the Social Security Act in  1935 and is a key component in ensuring the financial security of  America\u2019s workforce. The program serves two primary objectives: (1) to  temporarily replace a portion of earnings for workers who become  unemployed through no fault of their own and (2) to help stabilize the  economy during recessions by providing an infusion of consumer dollars  into the economy. UI is made up of 53 state-administered programs that  are subject to broad federal guidelines and oversight. In fiscal year 2004,  these programs covered about 129 million wage and salary workers and  paid benefits totaling $41.3 billion to about 8.8 million workers.", "Federal law provides minimum guidelines for state programs and  authorizes grants to states for program administration. States design their  own programs, within the guidelines of federal law, and determine key  elements of these programs, including who is eligible to receive state UI  benefits, how much they receive, and the amount of taxes that employers  must pay to help provide these benefits. State unemployment tax revenues  are held in trust by Labor and are used by the states to pay for regular  weekly UI benefits, which typically can be received for up to 26 weeks.", "To receive UI benefits, an unemployed worker must file a claim and satisfy  the eligibility requirements of the state in which the worker\u2019s wages were  paid. Generally, states require that workers must have a minimum amount  of wages and employment over a defined base period, typically, about a  year before becoming unemployed, and have not already exhausted the  maximum amount of benefits or benefit weeks to which they would be  entitled because of other recent unemployment. In addition workers must  have become unemployed for reasons other than quitting a job or being  fired for work-related misconduct, and be able and available to work. In  order to demonstrate that they are able to work and available for work and  are still unemployed, claimants must submit a certification of continuing  eligibility\u2014by mail, telephone, or Internet, depending on the state\u2014 throughout the benefit period. This practice is usually done weekly or  biweekly. States may continue to monitor claimant eligibility through an  eligibility review program, in which certain claimants are periodically  contacted to review their eligibility for benefits, work search activities,  and reemployment needs.", "Since UI was established, there have been two major changes in the  nation\u2019s workforce development system that have directly affected states\u2019  UI programs. Specifically, in November 1993, Congress enacted legislation  amending the Social Security Act to require that each state establish a  Worker Profiling and Reemployment Services (WPRS) system and  implement a process typically referred to as claimant profiling. The  claimant profiling process uses a statistical model or characteristics  screen to identify claimants who are likely to exhaust their UI benefits  before finding work. Claimants identified through this process are then  referred to reemployment services while they are still early in their claim.", "For profiled claimants, participation in designated reemployment services  becomes an additional requirement for continuing eligibility for UI  benefits. The second major change was the enactment of the Workforce  Investment Act of 1998, which requires states and localities to bring  together about 17 federally funded employment and training services into  a single system\u2014the one-stop system. State UI programs are mandatory  partners in the one-stop system. Another mandatory partner is the federal  Employment Service, established by the Wagner-Peyser Act in 1933 to link  job seekers with job opportunities. The Employment Service has  historically been colocated with state UI offices to facilitate UI claimants\u2019  access to federally funded labor exchanges, job search assistance, job  referral, placement assistance, assessment, counseling, and testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Workers Experience Unemployment and Over a Third Receive UI at Least Once", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of our analysis of data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019  National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), covering the 23- year period from 1979 through 2002, we found that 85 percent of a  nationally representative sample of late baby boom workers\u2014workers  born between 1957 and 1964\u2014had experienced unemployment at least  once between 1979 and 2002. Workers who experienced unemployment  were unemployed an average of five times over this 23-year period.  Moreover, we found that of the 76 percent who were eligible for UI  benefits at least once, 38 percent had ever received UI. (See fig. 1.) Of  those who received UI benefits, 44 percent received them more than once;  this represents about 17 percent of all of the workers in this age group."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some UI-Eligible Workers are More Likely to Receive UI Benefits than Others, or to Have Longer Periods of Unemployment", "paragraphs": ["When all other worker characteristics have been controlled for,  unemployed workers who are eligible for UI benefits are more likely to  receive UI if they had higher earnings before they became unemployed,  are younger, have completed more years of education, or if they have a  history of past UI benefit receipt. In addition, we found that unemployed  workers tend to have longer periods of unemployment if they receive UI  benefits, have completed fewer years of education, had lower earnings  before they became unemployed, or if they do not belong to unions. We  also found that UI-eligible workers from certain industries are more likely  than other workers to receive UI benefits, and that the strength of the  relationship between previous UI benefit receipt and current UI receipt  also varies by industry."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Certain Characteristics of UI-Eligible Workers Are Associated with Greater Likelihood of UI Receipt", "paragraphs": ["We found that UI-eligible workers with certain characteristics are more  likely to receive UI than otherwise similar UI-eligible workers. In  particular, the likelihood of receiving UI tends to increase as the amount  earned in the year before a worker became unemployed increases. (See  fig. 2.) For example, a UI-eligible worker with earnings ranging from  $10,000 to just under $12,000 in the year before becoming unemployed has  a 36 percent likelihood of receiving UI, whereas a worker who earned  roughly twice as much has a 45 percent likelihood of receiving UI. The  relationship between higher earnings and a higher likelihood of receiving  UI benefits is also consistent with economic theory that predicts that  workers with higher earnings prior to becoming unemployed will be more  reluctant to accept lower reemployment wages and are therefore more  likely to take advantage of UI benefits as a way to subsidize their job  search efforts.", "We also found that the likelihood of receiving UI benefits among UI- eligible workers tends to be higher for younger workers, and lower for  older workers. Specifically, simulations based on our analysis results show  that the likelihood of receiving UI peaks at about age 25 and decreases  thereafter. In fact, a 25-year-old unemployed worker who is eligible for UI  is more than twice as likely to receive UI as an otherwise similar 40-year- old. This finding is contrary to previous studies that reported that younger  workers are less likely to receive UI benefits than older workers.", "However, these previous studies did not include as much information  about workers\u2019 past unemployment and UI benefit receipt histories as our  analysis. Therefore, because older workers have more previous  unemployment and UI benefit receipt experience than younger workers, it  is possible that our analysis controlled for the effect of these experiences  more completely than previous studies, resulting in a more precise  estimate of the effect of age. Although we are unable to explain why  younger workers are more likely to receive UI benefits, it is possible that  older workers, who have had more time to accumulate financial assets,  may have more private resources available to help them cope with  unemployment than younger workers. Or it may simply be the case that  younger workers are less optimistic than older workers about how long it  will take for them to become reemployed.", "Another characteristic associated with a greater likelihood of receiving UI  benefits is education. We found that UI-eligible workers who have  completed more years of education are more likely to receive UI benefits  than otherwise similar workers with fewer years of education. For  example, a UI-eligible worker with the equivalent of a college education  (16 years of schooling) when he or she becomes unemployed is almost  one-fifth more likely to receive UI than a UI-eligible worker with a high  school education (12 years of schooling). Although the effect of education  on the likelihood of receiving UI benefits has been analyzed in other  research, no significant education effect was found. Still, our result seems  logical. That is, to the extent that workers with more education are also  better able to obtain UI program information and to understand their  states\u2019 requirements for filing claims and remaining eligible for benefits,  they are also more likely to have successful benefit claims.", "Other factors, including a worker\u2019s gender, marital status, job tenure, and  the local unemployment rate, are also associated with UI benefit receipt.  Controlling for all other characteristics among UI-eligible workers, we  found that    a woman is 29 percent more likely to receive UI benefits than a man,    a married worker is 13 percent more likely to receive UI than an    a longer-tenured worker is more likely to receive UI\u2014for example, a  worker with 4 years of tenure at his or her most recent job is 12  percent more likely to receive UI than a worker with 1 year of job  tenure, and   being in an area with high unemployment raises the likelihood that an  unemployed worker will receive UI\u2014for example, a worker living in an  area with an unemployment rate of 9 percent is 10 percent more likely  to receive UI than a worker living in an area with an unemployment  rate of 5 percent.", "Our finding that women are more likely to receive UI benefits than  otherwise similar men differs from the results of previous research, which  generally found no statistically significant differences in the likelihood of  receiving UI benefits for men and women. However, our analysis controls  for more worker characteristics than these previous studies, and it is likely  that we have more carefully isolated the effect of gender from that of other  characteristics that are related to gender, such as workers\u2019 occupations  and industries. Still, it is not immediately clear why women are more likely  to receive UI benefits than men who are similar with respect to other  observed characteristics. We are also unable to explain why married  workers are more likely to receive UI benefits than otherwise similar  unmarried workers. Our finding that workers with longer job tenure are  more likely to receive UI benefits is consistent with previous research.  This result seems logical if we consider that workers with longer job  tenures are more likely to have acquired more employer-specific skills  than workers with shorter job tenures. Because such specialized skills are  not as easy to transfer to a new employer as less specialized skills,  workers with more job tenure may expect to take longer to find a job  where these skills would be needed than a worker who has more  generalized skills. Finally, our finding that workers living in areas with  higher unemployment are more likely to receive UI benefits is probably  due to the higher number of unemployed workers relative to available  jobs, which may make workers more willing to apply for UI benefits as  they engage in what are likely to be longer job searches.", "In contrast to the findings already discussed, we found that a key UI  program element, the weekly UI benefit amount that unemployed workers  are entitled to, is not associated with a greater likelihood of receiving UI  benefits. Specifically, we used our model estimates to simulate benefit  increases of 10 percent and 25 percent, and a decrease of 10 percent, and  found that these changes did not affect the likelihood of UI benefit receipt  among eligible workers. This finding is also consistent with the work of  others, who have found that increases in the weekly benefit amount have  mixed, but generally small, effects on UI benefit receipt, after controlling  for other factors. Taken together, these results suggest that UI benefit  levels have modest effects on individuals\u2019 decisions about whether or not  to receive UI benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Unemployed Workers Who Received UI in the Past Are More Likely to Receive UI during Subsequent Unemployment", "paragraphs": ["Of all the characteristics associated with UI benefit receipt, we found that  one\u2014past UI receipt\u2014had a particularly strong effect on the likelihood of  receiving UI benefits. (See fig. 3.) For example, when workers experience  their first UI-eligible period of unemployment, their likelihood of receiving  UI is 33 percent. During a second UI-eligible period of unemployment, the  likelihood of receiving UI is 48 percent for workers who received UI  during the first unemployment period, but only 30 percent for workers  who did not receive UI. Furthermore, the likelihood that these UI-eligible  workers will receive UI benefits during successive periods of  unemployment increases each time that they receive UI benefits and  decreases each time that they do not.", "This finding suggests that a worker\u2019s first unemployment experience has a  lasting and self-reinforcing effect. To the extent that all workers know  about the UI program and whether or not they are eligible to receive  benefits, receiving or not receiving UI may be a personal choice. Such a  choice might be based on workers\u2019 individual preferences, or may be  related to other characteristics that were not captured in the NLSY79 data.  On the other hand, if workers do not all have good information about UI,  those who receive UI benefits may simply know more about the program  than those who do not receive UI benefits, and their knowledge about the  program may be improving each time they receive UI benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Receiving UI Benefits, along with Other Factors, Is Associated with Unemployment Duration", "paragraphs": ["We found that, overall, unemployed workers who receive UI benefits have  longer unemployment duration than otherwise similar workers who do not  receive UI benefits. Several other characteristics are also associated with  unemployment duration. In particular, UI-eligible workers are more likely  to experience longer unemployment duration if they have lower earnings  before becoming unemployed or if they have completed fewer years of  education. Other characteristics associated with longer unemployment  duration include being African-American, or female, or not belonging to a  union.", "Our results with respect to unemployment duration are generally  consistent with the results of other research. In particular, researchers  have suggested that the association between higher earnings and shorter  periods of unemployment may be due, in part, to the higher cost of  unemployment for workers with higher earnings, when compared to the  cost for workers with lower earnings. For example, the cost of  unemployment can be measured in terms of lost wages. This cost is  greater for workers with higher earnings, because they forego a higher  amount of potential earnings in exchange for the time they can spend on  unpaid activities, such as job search, home improvement, or recreation.  Researchers have also suggested that the association between less  education and longer periods of unemployment may be a result of workers  with less education having fewer work-related skills. Two possible  explanations for the differences in employment outcomes for African- American workers include labor market discrimination, and limited access  to social networks that may enable these workers to find jobs more  quickly. Likewise, longer unemployment duration among female workers  may be due to labor market discrimination, or to differences in how  women value paid work versus nonemployment activities, relative to  men.", "The associations between shorter unemployment duration and union  membership, and to longer job tenure, may reflect the greater access that  these workers may have to reemployment opportunities, through union  hiring halls or through informal peer networks. It may also reflect a  greater likelihood of being recalled to previous jobs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UI-Eligible Workers from Certain Industries Are More Likely to Receive UI and to Have Longer Periods of Unemployment", "paragraphs": ["We found that first-time unemployed workers from mining and  manufacturing are more likely to receive UI than workers from other  industries. (See table 1.) For example, first-time unemployed workers from  the manufacturing industry are about two-thirds more likely to receive UI  benefits than workers from the professional and related services industry.  We also found that the association between past and current UI benefit  varies across industries. This effect is strongest for UI-eligible workers  from the public administration sector, and weakest for workers from  agriculture and construction.", "These results show that although UI-eligible workers in some industries  are more likely to receive UI benefits when they experience  unemployment for the first time, their likelihood of receiving UI benefits  again when they become unemployed a second or third time is not  necessarily higher than it is for workers from other industries. (See fig. 4.)  For example, the likelihood of receiving UI benefits for workers from the  manufacturing industry who are unemployed for the first time is relatively  high\u2014about 40 percent. This likelihood increases to 52 percent during a  second period of unemployment for workers who have already received  UI benefits, and 65 percent during a third period of unemployment for  workers who received UI each previous time they were unemployed. By  comparison, the increase in the likelihood of receiving UI between the first  and third periods of unemployment is higher for most other industries,  especially public administration. Specifically, the likelihood of receiving  UI benefits for public administration workers who are unemployed for the  first time is 37 percent. This likelihood increases to 69 percent during a  second period of unemployment for workers who received have already  received UI, and to 91 percent during a third period of unemployment for  workers who received UI each previous time they were unemployed.", "Administrative unemployment insurance data have shown that repeat UI  recipients tend to be from industries that are seasonal, such as  manufacturing and construction. Our results, however, suggest that this is  not because workers with past UI receipt from these industries are more  likely to receive UI benefits when they are unemployed than otherwise  similar workers from other industries. Rather, it may be that workers from  such seasonal industries are unemployed more often on average than  workers from other industries, or that a larger proportion of unemployed  workers from such industries have collected UI previously.", "In light of the strong association we found between UI receipt and  unemployment duration, it is important that unemployed workers who  become UI claimants have access to reemployment services that will help  facilitate their quick return to work. However, the shift towards states\u2019  accepting UI claims remotely has raised concerns that some UI claimants  may not be receiving enough information on reemployment services or  timely assistance to help them find a job, and little is known about  whether states have policies in place to help unemployed workers quickly  become reemployed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Variety of Reemployment Services Are Available to Help UI Claimants Get Jobs, but Little Information Exists to Determine the Extent to Which Workers Use Them", "paragraphs": ["In our review of states\u2019 efforts to facilitate reemployment of UI claimants,  we found that across states, UI claimants have access to a variety of  reemployment services, and although most states accept UI claims  remotely by telephone or Internet, states make use of UI program  requirements to connect claimants with available services at various  points in their claims.

However, these reports only contain information on individuals  who are registered with the Employment Service, and although anyone  who receives services funded by Wagner-Peyser must be registered with  the Employment Service, not all UI claimants receive Wagner-Peyser  funded services.", "WIA and TAA reporting requirements also do not provide a complete  picture of claimant services and outcomes. Although WIA tracks several  performance measures directly related to outcomes for Adults and  Dislocated Workers, including job placement, job retention, and wage gain  or wage replacement, these records do not contain information for UI  claimants who are not registered under WIA. Furthermore, many  individuals served under WIA\u2014particularly those who receive only self- directed services\u2014are not registered or tracked for performance and are,  therefore, not reflected in any of the WIA data. Similarly, for the TAA  program, Labor requires states to submit participant data files on all who  exit the program each quarter, but the reports are limited to those  claimants served by TAA.", "Having data that show the degree to which reemployment services are  reaching UI claimants is key to good program management and provides a  first step toward understanding the impact of these programs. However,  knowing how many claimants may be accessing reemployment services  and the type of outcomes they may be achieving has proven difficult for  state and local officials.", "We found that only 14 states go beyond the federal reporting requirements  to routinely track the extent to which claimants receive services from the  broad array of federally funded programs that are designed to assist them.  Of the remaining 36 states that do not routinely track claimant services, 4  told us it would not be possible for them to do so. In addition, 37 states  reported that tracking UI claimants who receive reemployment services  was somewhat or very difficult, while only 6 states said it was not at all  difficult. States most often told us that tracking claimant services across  multiple programs was made difficult by the fact that reemployment  services and UI claimant data were maintained in separate data systems\u2014 systems that were either incompatible or difficult to link.", "While relatively few states routinely track claimants\u2019 services, even fewer  track outcomes. Only 6 states go beyond the federal reporting  requirements to routinely monitor any outcomes for UI claimants who  receive reemployment services\u2014outcomes such as reemployment rate,  average benefit duration, and UI exhaustion rate. Eleven states reported  that it would not be possible to calculate any of the outcomes for these  claimants. The issues states cited in tracking outcomes across programs  for UI claimants were similar to those for tracking use of services.  Officials from 35 states told us that tracking one or more outcome  measures was made difficult by the fact that reemployment services and  UI claimant data were maintained in different systems that were either  incompatible or difficult to link.", "Labor has some initiatives that may begin to shed light on claimant  services and outcomes, including modifying its performance measures to  require states to track a reemployment rate for their UI claimants\u2014 defined as the percentage of UI claimants who are reemployed within the  quarter following their first UI payment. Labor is also developing a system  to consolidate reporting on performance for Labor\u2019s Employment and  Training Administration (ETA) programs. This system\u2014ETA\u2019s  Management Information and Longitudinal Evaluation (EMILE) system\u2014 would consolidate performance reporting across a range of Labor  programs including WIA, Employment Service, and TAA. Current plans do  not include incorporating UI reporting into EMILE.", "Last year, we recommended that the Department of Labor work with  states to consider the feasibility of collecting more comprehensive  information on UI claimants\u2019 services and outcomes. Although Labor  generally agreed with our findings, Labor commented that current and  planned data collection efforts would provide sufficient information to  policy makers. While Labor\u2019s new initiatives, in combination with current  reporting requirements, will provide valuable information on the  reemployment activities of some UI claimants, these efforts will not allow  for a comprehensive, nationwide understanding of claimants\u2019 participation  in the broad range of reemployment services designed to assist them.  Furthermore, these efforts will not move states in the direction of having  the data they need to better manage their systems.", "Mr. Chairman, this completes my prepared statement.
