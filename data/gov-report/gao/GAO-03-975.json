In 2002, HUD provided $31 million for capacitybuilding activities.

The four organizations (grantees) use Section 4 funding to provide a variety of capacity-building support to their subrecipients. These subrecipients are nonprofit organizations that undertake locally targeted initiatives in areas such as economic development, low-income housing construction, and job training. The Section 4 funds that the grantees receive help leverage private sector funding and in-kind contributions such as land and equipment, pro bono legal services, office space, and voluntary labor. Since the four grantees became eligible for Section 4 funding, they have leveraged nearly $800 million in cash and in-kind contributions from the private sector. HUD is responsible for ensuring that Section 4 funds are used according to federal law and regulations and that grantees are utilizing funds efficiently and effectively. However, HUD relies on grantees to oversee their subrecipients. The grantees had far-reaching organizational structures and processes in place to monitor and control their subrecipients. But we found that one of the seven subrecipients we tested for monitoring and control procedures had reimbursed a subrecipient for an item that was prohibited by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). While HUD has the overall responsibility to prevent such internal control failures, the cost-effectiveness of adding additional federal controls must be weighed against the amount of the federal dollars involved. We believe that as long as HUD and the grantees remain vigilant, additional controls are not necessary at this time. HUD is taking steps to develop a framework for assessing the effectiveness of its technical assistance programs and will take part in an OMB Program Assessment Rating Tool review."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal years 1997 through 2002, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s (HUD) budget for 20 capacity-building and technical  assistance programs was over $860 million.

To date, NCDI has had four phases (rounds) of funding. In the  first phase (1991-93), NCDI funders pledged $62.9 million (see table 1).  With the enactment of Section 4, HUD joined phase II of NCDI, which also  included 12 private foundations and financial institutions, as an equal  partner.

HUD\u2019s  involvement resulted in some changes to the way funds were disbursed.  While the foundations provided funding through Living Cities (NCDI),  which in turn distributed grant funds to LISC and Enterprise, HUD  distributed its funding directly to LISC and Enterprise.

HFHI has  provided grants to affiliates on a 3-year diminishing basis to hire new staff  or establish warehouse facilities, with an expectation of increasing house  production by at least 15 percent. In addition, HFHI has established  regional support centers to bring technical assistance closer to affiliates.  YBUSA uses Section 4 funds to provide a variety of grants to its affiliated  network, such as operating grants, program enhancement grants, special  assistance grants, and scholarships to staff and students.

For example, a new  organization might receive Section 4 funds to pay for a portion of the  salary of the executive director, whereas more established CDCs might  receive funding to upgrade their financial management software. All  grantees stressed that because capacity building takes time, they provide  multiyear support to subrecipients. However, three of the four grantees  indicated that they generally fund subrecipients in ways that encourage  the organizations to become financially independent. Officials from LISC  and Enterprise explained that although some subrecipients receive  multiple grants for several years, the grants are small enough to keep  subrecipients from becoming dependent on Section 4 funds for daily  operations. As noted earlier, HFHI\u2019s grants, which are provided to hire  new staff, diminish over a 3-year period. According to HFHI, the affiliates\u2019  gradual absorption of staff costs leads to independence from\u2014rather than  dependence on\u2014federal funding.

For example, one senior executive from a major lending  institution indicated that federal participation in NCDI provided funders  with a symbolic and financial incentive to join the NCDI consortium.  Symbolically, federal funding provides a sense of credibility to NCDI, as  funders see federal participation as a sign of good housekeeping and  reduced risk. Financially, federal participation adds more money to NCDI  capacity-building initiatives, in turn enabling subrecipients to raise more  private funding.

This subrecipient was  the grantee\u2019s second-largest in terms of Section 4 funding, receiving 10  grants that totaled almost $1 million over a 7-year period. One grant for  $143,000 paid for several activities, one of which was a bad debt\u2014an  ineligible expenditure according to OMB Circular A-122. Since HUD  officials do not receive and review subrecipient grant agreements and  payment vouchers, HUD was not aware of the ineligible cost. The grantee  has since taken several steps to ensure that similar problems do not occur,  including having a staff member perform increased subrecipient  monitoring to verify that sufficient management controls are in place to  ensure that grant funds are used appropriately and effectively. This  monitoring includes a full review of the grant request and award  documents, followed by a review of supporting documentation to verify  compliance with allowable expenses and consistency with the work plan.

However, HUD requires its  grantees to submit annual work plans that include specific details of how  federal and private resources will be used and to identify performance  goals and objectives that should be attained during the grant period. In  addition, OMB is currently requiring HUD and the NCDI grantees to  conduct a PART review. PART assessments are used for making budgeting  decisions, supporting management, identifying design problems, and  promoting performance measurement and accountability. The assessment  includes questions on a program\u2019s purpose and design, strategic planning,  management, and results. Furthermore, in response to a GAO report  recommendation that HUD require program offices to determine the  practicability of measuring the impact of technical assistance and  establishing objective, quantifiable, and measurable performance goals,  HUD is working with a group of national technical assistance providers to  develop a framework to assess the effectiveness of its technical assistance  programs.", "Living Cities has also contracted with a consultant to develop impact  measurements for the 23 NCDI cities.

HUD is responsible for ensuring that  grantees are utilizing Section 4 funds according to federal law and  regulations and has several controls in place to ensure that they do.  However, HUD relies primarily on its grantees to make certain that this  responsibility is carried out at the subrecipient level. We found that  grantees generally had good management systems and controls in place to  monitor their subrecipients and to ensure that they carried out their work  plans, met their objectives, and used federal funds legally and responsibly.  However, even with good controls, problems can still occur, as we found  at one CDC. While HUD has overarching responsibility for detecting such  internal control failures, the cost-effectiveness of adding additional federal  controls at the subrecipient level must be weighed against the size of the  program and the amount of federal funding involved. Given the relative  size of the Section 4 program and the fact that similar problems should not  recur if HUD and the grantees remain vigilant, we do not believe that  additional controls are necessary at this time.", "Recommendation for \t We recommend that the Secretary of HUD take steps to recover the grant  Executive Action  funds that one Section 4 grantee used to cover a bad debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In an e-mail dated August 7, 2003, HUD provided technical comments,  which we incorporated into this report as appropriate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To accomplish our objectives, we reviewed public laws, federal  regulations, HUD directives, budget documents and other material that  described the Section 4 program, grantees\u2019 missions and organizational  structures, and authorized and appropriated funding.

We collected data from LISC, Enterprise, and  YouthBuild USA showing the number of multiple grants and amounts  provided to CDCs or affiliates. We selected five CDCs/affiliates from three  grantees. For LISC and Enterprise, we chose the CDCs that had received  the greatest number of grants and analyzed the purpose of each grant. For  YBUSA, we selected the affiliates that had received the highest dollar  amounts. To create the maps of subrecipients and cities that received  Section 4 funding, we obtained city data from NCDI, LISC, Enterprise,  YBUSA, HFHI, and CHAPA and used geographical information software  (GIS) to create the maps. We used the same software to create the rural  county maps with data obtained from LISC and Enterprise that listed each  CDC categorized as rural and the counties they served.", "To determine the importance of Section 4 funding to private sector  involvement in community development initiatives, we reviewed public  laws, federal regulations, HUD directives, budget documents, and other  materials.
