Recently, industry groups developed the \u201cKnow Before You Go\u201d campaign that calls for greater transparency of FBO prices. Some of the FBOs GAO interviewed list their fees online; however, others do not.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed\u2013\u2013including general aviation pilots, airports, FBOs, and industry groups\u2013\u2013said FBOs' costs to build and maintain facilities\u2014such as hangars and fueling facilities\u2014as well as operating expenses such as labor and fuel\u2013\u2013influence their prices. Stakeholders also said that demand for FBOs' services can influence prices, such as when seasonal demand affects operations at an airport near a ski resort. Finally, they also said that competition affects FBO's prices. GAO's statistical model confirmed a correlation between many cost and demand factors and aviation fuel prices and found higher prices at airports with higher costs and demand. This model also found that on-airport competition is associated with lower prices at the country's busiest airports: Prices for aviation fuels were lower at such airports with more than one FBO. However, not all airports can support more than one FBO due to, for example, the amount of business each gets.", "Airports receiving Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grants must meet \u201cgrant assurances\u201d such as charging reasonable and not unjustly discriminatory prices for services, including prices charged by FBOs. FAA officials said FAA oversight relies on (1) airports' consent to adhere to grant assurances; (2) training and outreach; and (3) complaints. Since 2013, in complaints received by FAA, GAO found few complaints about FBOs' prices. GAO found each regional office independently records additional inquiries. FAA is moving to collect regional inquires centrally, and by 2020 that step may allow FAA to stay abreast of apparent nationwide trends or issues with any grant assurance concerns."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2007, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) through the Airport  Improvement Program (AIP), has provided more than $37 billion in  federal grants to fund airport capital development and is responsible for  overseeing airports\u2019 compliance with the federal requirements related to  these grants, called airport grant assurances. Airports receiving grants  agree to meet 39 grant assurances, and one such requirement is that the  airport must provide users equal access to airport facilities. Recently  some general aviation pilots along with the Aircraft Owners and Pilots  Association (AOPA) expressed concerns about the cost and transparency  of certain services\u2014primarily aircraft fuel and parking\u2014provided by fixed  base operators (FBO) at airports. An FBO usually operates on site as a  business providing not only fuel and parking but also, depending on the  airport, flight training and, aircraft rental and maintenance, among other  things.

We also reviewed two websites that list fuel prices for many  FBOs as well as individual websites for the 16 FBOs we interviewed, to  understand the extent to which prices for FBO services are posted  publicly. To add stakeholder perspectives, we selected a non-probability  sample of 26 airports and interviewed the airports\u2019 officials to discuss their  operations and grant oversight process. We selected these airports to  obtain a geographic dispersion, aircraft traffic levels, and the number and  type of FBOs at the airport, among other factors. We also interviewed 16  FBOs at these airports to discuss their operations, relationship with the  airport, and prices. See appendix I for a list of the selected airports and  FBOs. We also selected a non-probability sample of 18 general aviation  pilots to obtain perspectives on how they view the FBO market and how  they choose FBOs to patronize.

In addition, we met with the Department of Justice (DOJ) to  discuss competition and a recent FBO merger. We also discussed our  approach for analyzing fuel price information with DOJ officials.

In addition, FBOs sometimes manage parking ramps for  transient aircraft at the airport. FBOs may charge a fee for parking, as  they also maintain the ramp areas for the airport. According to FAA,  airports, within certain parameters, have the ability to charge or not to  charge users for access to airport ramp space. FBOs generally serve  pilots who operate general aviation aircraft, but can also support  commercial flights. The type of amenities and services any one FBO  provides varies. For example, representatives of one FBO said that it  provides high-level customer service and offers more services such as  catering, pilot lounges, concierge services, and aircraft maintenance and  repair facilities for its clients. See figure 1 for an illustration of FBO  services.", "As of March 2019, we identified 3,070 FBOs operating at 3,016 airports  located in the contiguous United States; these airports are included in  FAA\u2019s National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems (NPIAS). FBOs can  be run by the airport, an independent operator, or a network chain with  multiple locations. The Transportation Research Board estimated in 2016  that 47 percent of all FBO locations were airport-operated.", "Most stakeholders with whom we spoke agreed that there are fewer  FBOs today than in the past, although estimates vary on the extent of the  decline in FBO numbers. Stakeholders we interviewed said that this  decline is due to factors such as a drop in general aviation activity that  resulted in a reduction in fuel sales. More recent innovations, such as  more fuel-efficient aircraft and decision-making software that provides  information to pilots on where to purchase fuel to fly more efficiently, also  contributed to the decline."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airport and Federal Oversight of FBO Activities", "paragraphs": ["Airports that receive federal AIP grants contractually agree to FAA \u201cgrant  assurances\u201d that require those airports to adhere to certain  requirements. One of those key grant assurances is a prohibition of  unjust economic discrimination. This assurance requires airports to  provide to users equal access to airport facilities. Likewise, tenant  businesses (e.g. FBOs) operating at airports are required to make  services available and price those services not in an unduly  discriminatory fashion. Although FAA is required to ensure that airports,  as a condition for accepting federal grants, provide fair and equal access  to services and nondiscriminatory pricing, FAA does not regulate prices in  the FBO industry. As a condition of accepting federal grants, airports  have a responsibility to ensure that they and their contractors and  concessionaires abide by the grant assurances. FAA\u2019s Airport  Compliance Office oversees airports\u2019 adherence to grant assurances by  taking and responding to inquiries and complaints, developing and  circulating advisories and guidance documents, and coordinating with  airports and industry to conduct compliance training and airport land use  inspections.", "The Department of Justice (DOJ) also plays a role in overseeing the FBO  industry under its antitrust responsibilities to preserve competition. For  example, in the Final Judgement entered by a federal court in the DOJ\u2019s  case regarding the acquisition by BBA Aviation (Signature Flight Support)  acquisition of Landmark Aviation, BBA was required to divest FBO  facilities in six locations where the transaction would have created a  monopoly or duopoly for FBO services. In addition, the court order  required BBA to provide advance notice of certain future acquisitions for  the 10-year duration of the final judgment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Transparency of FBO Fees Varies by Service", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of FBO and third party websites, we found that fuel  prices at FBOs are readily available to anyone on the internet. Nearly all  of the pilots we spoke with told us they use these resources for making  flight plans. For example, current prices for fuel are readily available on  third party websites such as AirNav and Sky Vector, among others, and  on about a third of the websites for FBOs we visited. See figure 2 for a  representation of a website providing FBO information.", "However, fees for other services such as for parking and aircraft handling  are less transparent. Our review of FBO and third-party websites found  that such fees are not always available online, and that fees may vary by  type of aircraft, are sometimes waived, and are called by different terms.  According to FBO staff we spoke with, fees for services other than fueling  can be lengthy and unwieldy to post on their websites for multiple  reasons. First, some fees will vary based on the size and approved  weight of the aircraft. For example, the price sheet for services other than  fuel at one FBO showed fees varying by the aircraft\u2019s approved weight, so  there were 11 different prices for each of those services. The same  pricing sheet also included prices for dozens of incidental services, such  as aircraft towing and lavatory service that are not based on aircraft  weight. Additionally, customers may be eligible for discounts on fuel  purchases either by volume or through a membership program. FBOs  may also waive fees in some cases\u2014for example, with a qualifying fuel  purchase an FBO might waive a parking, ramp, or handling fee. Further, a  few stakeholders and pilots we spoke to indicated that FBOs don\u2019t always  use the same terms for a fee. For example, a landing fee or a ramp fee  might be a fee for doing essentially the same thing. Consequently, to find  out how much an FBO visit will cost, 16 of the 18 pilots we interviewed  told us they call the FBO in advance. Based on information such as their  type of aircraft, length of stay, and other services they might require, the  FBO provides an estimate of their total cost.", "Recently, some industry stakeholders have called for increased price  transparency and consistency among FBOs regarding how they  characterize their fees, and have taken some actions to increase the  transparency of fees. A campaign called, \u201cKnow Before You Go,\u201d  developed through the cooperation of six aviation associations,  encourages FBOs to communicate and expeditiously provide available  services and a listing of currently applicable posted fuel prices, as well as  fees and charges for other available services. Further, the campaign  suggests that these fees and charges should be made accessible to  aircraft operators online in a user friendly manner and with sufficient  clarity. Additionally, it encourages customers to contact the FBO to ask  questions so pilots can make informed decisions. In response, one large- chain FBO began posting fees online for piston aircraft at its locations and  another FBO company created a trip calculator on its web site for pilots to  calculate the cost of their visit (see fig 3). We also found that a third party  company recently began a web site that provides FBO parking ramp fees  similar to those providing fuel prices. In addition, AOPA invited FBOs to  include their fees in the association\u2019s online airport directory. The  association also indicated it categorizes the variety of fees into basic  types of fees such as landing, using a hanger, or using lavatory service to  help clarify what pilots could be expected to pay. In October 2019, AOPA  officials indicated that FBOs\u2019 posting of fees had not increased as much  as they hoped."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Cost and Demand Factors and the Extent of Competition Are Associated with FBO Prices", "paragraphs": ["Selected stakeholders we interviewed\u2014including officials from 26  airports, 16 FBOs, as well as 18 general aviation pilots\u2014highlighted key  factors that may influence FBO prices at airports across the country. Our  statistical model confirmed a correlation between certain key factors  identified by stakeholders and FBO prices. Consistent with general  economic theory, these factors fall into three groups: (1) an FBO\u2019s costs,  (2) demand for an FBO\u2019s services, and (3) competition among FBOs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stakeholders Reported That Cost Factors May Influence Prices", "paragraphs": ["Selected stakeholders we interviewed highlighted cost factors such as  airport leases, infrastructure investment, fuel, labor, and security as  influencing FBO prices. They cited the following examples:", "Airport Leases. Airport leases dictate terms and conditions of  contracts between an FBO and an airport and include provisions  related to the services an FBO must provide for pilots. Depending on  the specific requirements or minimum standards developed at a given  airport, FBO lease requirements vary and can affect an FBO\u2019s costs.  For example, at one airport we visited, the FBO is required to offer an  after-hours self-service fueling option, which necessitates the  acquisition and maintenance of additional equipment. In another case,  the manager at an FBO we spoke to said that its overhead costs are  relatively high because it is required to offer flight training and aircraft  maintenance as part of its lease. To offer these services the FBO  needs additional hangar space and must pay qualified skilled  employees.", "Infrastructure Investment. As with leasing costs, the greater the  investment an FBO makes at an airport, the higher its prices to users  may be. According to airport and interest group officials we spoke  with, FBOs typically have 20 to 30 year leases during which they may  make infrastructure investments such as building hangars or lounges,  based on FBO\u2019s assessment of customer demand for its services. For  example, according to airport and FBO officials we spoke to, an FBO  will choose to invest in high-end facilities and amenities if it  determines there is sufficient demand and revenues earned are  expected to be sufficient to recoup the costs over the term of the  lease.", "Fuel Transportation Costs. FBOs generally sell two types of aviation  fuel for general aviation aircraft: Jet A and 100 low lead (100LL). Jet A  is generally delivered over long distances via pipeline. According to  one petroleum company, 100LL is generally moved by truck, rail, or  barge\u2014less cost-effective methods of transport than pipeline\u2014due to  the smaller volumes being produced. Further, there are parts of the  United States, specifically on the East Coast, where little or no 100LL  is produced and, as a result, transportation costs can significantly  affect the cost of fuel to the FBO.", "Labor costs. FBOs compete in the local labor market for staff. The  cost of labor for FBOs may vary across local labor markets around the  country. Further, a particular FBO may need specialized skills to  provide the services they offer, and this factor can affect the FBO\u2019s  costs. For example, some FBOs offer maintenance services, so will  have trained mechanics on staff to perform such services.", "State taxes. Aviation fuel excise taxes on 100LL vary considerably  from state to state and may also affect the costs to a consumer. For  example, both Oregon and Idaho have a lower state aviation fuel tax  compared to neighboring Washington State. An FBO manager told us  that in some cases, a pilot will fly over to Idaho to obtain less  expensive fuel, even though he or she may base the aircraft in  Washington.", "Security. Some airports\u2014particularly those with commercial  service\u2014are responsible for implementing security requirements in  accordance with their Transportation Security Administration (TSA)- approved security programs, notably the security of perimeters and  access controls protecting restricted areas of the airport, such as  ramps and taxiways. We found that some FBOs are responsible for  security and access controls on their leased property based on our  review of individual lease requirements and the airport security plan.  These FBOs might require staff on site 24 hours a day to maintain  airfield and perimeter security, a requirement that can increase FBO  costs. For example, an FBO operating at an airport with commercial  service told us that it is responsible for perimeter security on the land  it leases from the airport. In addition, it is subject to unannounced  security checks by TSA. In contrast, smaller general aviation airports  without commercial service are not required to have as many security  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Said Demand Factors May Influence Prices", "paragraphs": ["Selected stakeholders told us that the location of an airport may influence  demand for FBO services. Economic theory indicates that increased  demand for a service will generally result in increased prices, all else  equal. In particular, stakeholders cited the following examples of demand  factors that may influence prices:", "Busy and congested airports may have higher prices for FBO services  due to greater demand.", "Prices may be higher during part of the year in locations with  significant seasonal traffic, such as beach resorts with a summer high  season and ski resorts with a winter high season. The increased  demand at FBOs during high seasons results in higher prices than  during the off season.", "An airport\u2019s proximity to the central business district may be  associated with higher demand and higher prices in such locations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Described How the Extent of Competition May Influence FBO Prices", "paragraphs": ["In addition to cost and demand factors, the extent to which the market for  FBO services is competitive may also influence prices. According to the  stakeholders we interviewed, competition among FBOs may lead to lower  prices than would be the case when only one FBO provides the service at  that airport. In our analysis of FAA airport and FBO data, however, we  found that nearly 90 percent of NPIAS airports that offer FBO services are  served by only one FBO (see table 1). According to a Transportation  Research Board report, a strong indicator of the number of FBOs that can  be financially viable at an airport can be the amount of fuel sales. For  example, two airport managers we spoke to said that there was an  insufficient volume of fuel sold at their airports to support more than one  FBO.", "While the majority of NPIAS airports in the contiguous United States have  only one FBO, pilots we spoke to said that competition from FBOs at  nearby airports can also affect prices. For example, within 30 miles of  Spokane International Airport, there are five other airports, each of which  is served by an FBO that may compete with the services provided at  Spokane International. (See fig. 4)", "We asked selected managers of FBOs and airports and selected general  aviation pilots to describe how off-airport competition may influence FBO  pricing. FBO and airport managers told us that they view nearby airports  as competitors and monitor the FBO prices at these locations. For  example, an FBO manager in Maine told us he regularly checks the  prices at the larger international airport that is nearby. This finding  suggests that when an FBO sets its prices, it takes into account the  extent to which nearby airports may compete for its services. On the  buyer\u2019s side of the market, 11 of the 18 general aviation pilots we  interviewed told us that they generally \u201cprice shop\u201d for aviation fuel.  Further, most general aviation pilots we spoke with told us they use online  flight-planning tools to map their route and consider the fuel cost and  service fees of the airports along that route. Further, four pilots and an  FBO manager indicated that on longer trips that require refueling before  reaching a destination, pilots may have options that are hundreds of miles  from each other. For example, when flying from California to Texas, a  pilot could choose to stop either in New Mexico or Arizona to obtain fuel.  In this scenario, a pilot would compare prices of many FBOs in those two  states and likely choose one with lower fuel prices. Likewise, an FBO  manager in Kansas indicated that for these types of customers, he  competes with FBOs at airports more than 100 miles away.", "However, we interviewed some pilots who said that they do not consider  every nearby airport as a substitute. To be a true substitute the airport  must meet the pilot\u2019s needs to be a viable option. For example, the  airport\u2019s runway must be of sufficient length for the aircraft, and some  runways may be too short for certain aircraft. Also, pilots take into  account the type of fuel offered at an FBO. The pilot of a piston-driven  aircraft will be unable to refuel at an FBO that offers only jet fuel. Finally,  some pilots said the price differential would need to be sufficiently large to  compensate them for any inconvenience. Some mentioned that the price  of 100LL would have to be 30 to 40 cents per gallon lower to affect their  flight plan, while others put that threshold at a lower point, 25 to 30 cents  per gallon. Pilots also told us they take travel time into account. For  example, some pilots said that they would consider landing at an  alternative airport with lower prices if it were no more than 20 to 30 miles  out of their way and if the change in destination were to add no more than  10 to 20 minutes to their trip.", "As a first step in examining the relationship of FBO competition with  pricing, we examined differences in the average posted prices for 100LL  and Jet A across NPIAS airports in the contiguous United States where  only one FBO sold a fuel type compared to airports at which more than  one FBO sold that fuel, without controlling for other factors that might also  be correlated with prices. We also calculated the average prices at  airports with one FBO and airports with multiple FBOs for a subset of  airports with an air traffic control tower. We examined this subset of  towered-airports, as they generally have more operations, and thus more  demand. As shown in table 2 below, the average price per gallon of  aviation fuel was lower at airports with only one FBO than at airports with  on-airport competition. For example, at airports with only one FBO, the  average price posted for full-service 100LL was $5.01 per gallon, while  the average price posted at airports with more than one FBO was about  73 cents higher.", "However, examining average differences in price fails to control for other  factors that might be correlated with prices. In particular, airports that  have more than one FBO are likely to be those that have higher traffic  volumes and that are located in areas with larger populations and higher  per-capita incomes\u2014all factors likely correlated with higher prices.  Therefore, to more fully assess the issue, we developed a statistical  model that examines how fuel prices may be correlated with measures of  competition when controlling for other factors, such as demand, that also  may be correlated with prices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Statistical Model Indicates Several Factors Are Correlated with FBO Fuel Prices", "paragraphs": ["Our statistical model confirmed a correlation between selected cost and  demand factors and FBO-posted pricing of full-service 100LL and Jet A. It  also confirmed a correlation between some of the competition factors  described by stakeholders and the price of aviation fuel. Our analysis  included information on posted prices for both 100LL as well as Jet A. In  addition to running the model for NPIAS airports in the contiguous United  States for which posted prices were available (all-airports), we also ran  the model for a subset of these airports that have air traffic control towers  (towered-airports). See appendix II for a more detailed discussion of the  model structure and findings.", "As we have noted, we expected fuel prices to be correlated with a variety  of cost, demand, and competition factors that pertain to characteristics of  airports and their locations, as well as characteristics of FBOs operating  at airports. We found the following correlations:", "Airport Characteristics. Our model found that the size of an  airport\u2014measured as the total number of operations\u2014was associated  with higher prices for both 100LL and Jet A. The operational size of an  airport is likely associated with higher demand for airport services and  also is likely related to higher costs of providing those services.  Specifically, we found that an increase of 10,000 airport operations  per year was associated with higher prices of about 2 cents per gallon  for both 100LL and Jet A in both the all-airports and towered-airports  datasets. The length of the longest runway available at an airport was  also correlated with higher fuel prices. The length of the runway is an  indicator of the types of aircraft an airport can support. In particular,  longer runways are able to accommodate larger and heavier aircraft\u2014 aircraft that generally use more fuel and thus may indicate higher  demand for fuel at the airport. Specifically, we found that a 1,000-foot  increase in runway length was associated with a higher price of about  7 to 8 cents per gallon for both fuels.", "Demographic Characteristics of Airport Location. Our analysis  found that FBOs\u2019 fuel prices were generally higher at airports in areas  with higher incomes, but not always at airports in areas with larger  population. We found that prices for both types of fuel were higher at  airports located in counties with higher per-capita incomes. Where  incomes are higher, we would expect the demand for travel to be  greater. Moreover, where there are higher incomes, the cost of  providing FBO services\u2014particularly labor costs\u2014are likely higher.  We found income correlated with fuel prices for both the 100LL and  Jet A in the all-airports datasets and for 100LL in the towered-only  airport dataset. We also found that 100LL aviation fuel prices were  higher at airports located in counties with larger populations. This was  expected due to the likely greater demand for air travel in more  populous areas. However, county population was not statistically  significant in relation to the price of Jet A.", "Geographic Characteristics of Airport. Our model found that  airports located in states on the East Coast tend to have higher 100LL  prices. Specifically, the model suggests that 100LL prices are  between 22 to 26 cents higher per gallon on average in these  states. We expected FBOs operating in East Coast states to have  higher 100LL prices due to higher transportation costs, as we found  that there is no production of 100LL in these states. As mentioned  earlier, 100LL is generally moved by truck, rail or barge due to the  smaller volumes being produced\u2014a less cost-effective means of  transport than pipeline. Jet A, on the other hand, is transported by  pipeline over long distances. We thus expected higher prices for  100LL at airports in these states. We found this geographic differential  in all specifications for the 100LL model.", "Large-Chain FBOs. Our model found that both types of fuel tend to  have higher posted prices at airports that have a large-chain FBO  operating on the premises, regardless of whether or not there was  another competitor on the premises. Specifically we found that when  a large-chain FBO operates at an airport, fuel at the airport tends to  be more expensive on average\u2014on the order of 60 cents more per  gallon for 100LL, and an even greater differential for Jet A, more than  $1.20 per gallon.", "Availability of Self-Serve 100LL fuel. Our model found that when  self-serve 100LL is available at an airport, the prices for full-serve  100LL tend to be lower than at airports with no self-serve 100LL  available. Specifically, we found that if a self-serve 100LL option is  available at an airport, the price of full-service 100LL will be about  10.5 cents per gallon lower, on average, compared to FBOs at  airports without self-service 100LL. We expected a self-service option  might be correlated with somewhat lower prices for full service  100LL\u2014even if the full service option is provided by the same FBO\u2014 because pilots are presented with a lower price option may constrain  the prices that FBOs will charge for a full-service option.", "Competition. Within our statistical model, we examined whether the  extent of competition among FBOs had a correlation with fuel pricing  in two ways.", "On-airport competition. On-airport competition occurs when two or  more FBOs at an airport sell the same kind of fuel.", "We estimated that the price of Jet A is lower, on average, at an  airport when two or more FBOs provided that fuel at an airport.  Specifically, for the all-airports dataset, we found that, on average,  the posted price of Jet A was 35 cents per gallon higher if only  one FBO sold the fuel at an airport compared to the case when at  least one additional competitor also served the airport.

The finding of no  correlation between on-airport competition and 100LL prices may  be linked to the rarity of airports with more than one FBO selling  100LL in the all-airports dataset. In fact, in the all-airports dataset,  only 13 percent of FBOs faced on-airport competition in the sale of  100LL while in the towered-airports dataset about one-third of  FBOs faced competition in the sale of 100LL.

Our model also tested whether the availability  of additional FBOs at airports within a 30-mile distance from a  given airport had any correlation to prices for 100LL. We included  this factor because many of the stakeholders we spoke to noted  that general aviation pilots will consider using an airport near their  preferred airport if prices were more favorable at the alternative  location.

Additionally, FAA responds to phone and email inquiries and  informal and formal complaints, and conducts periodic airport land use  inspections, as discussed below, but none of these efforts has identified  FBO pricing as a widespread area of concern.", "Training and Outreach. According to FAA, compliance staff conducts  periodic training and outreach to the airport community on a variety of  compliance issues. FAA headquarters annually conducts recurrent  compliance training\u2014which includes overseeing airport grant  assurances\u2014with regional and other FAA offices. FAA officials told us  they use these sessions to address concerns brought up by regional  compliance officials and airport compliance staff. One example of FAA\u2019s  outreach efforts occurred in December 2017 after AOPA raised questions  about FBO pricing earlier that year. To bring clarity to the issue of FBO  pricing and the role of FAA, the agency released questions and answers  that emphasized: (1) FAA does not regulate FBO prices; and (2) airports  are responsible for ensuring FBO prices are reasonable and applied in a  non-unjustly discriminatory manner. Furthermore, FAA stated that  whether an FBO\u2019s fees are reasonable (i.e., higher than average than  other FBOs) involves a number of economic, business, and other factors  that vary widely from airport to airport and FBO to FBO and may include  underlying costs, market conditions, quality of service, and other factors.", "Inquiries and Complaints. According to FAA, airport compliance staff  respond to (1) phone and e-mail inquiries, (2) informal complaints, and (3)  formal complaints. FAA officials told us that, while FAA does not regulate  FBO prices, if someone contacts them with inquiries or a concern about a  potential grant assurance violation, such as one involving FBO prices,  they first refer the issue to the local airport to resolve. If the issue is not  resolved, the complainant may file an informal complaint with an FAA  regional office. According to FAA guidance, each FAA regional office  will review the complaint and issue a letter indicating whether FAA sees a  grant violation that the airport should fix or not. If the complainant is  dissatisfied with the regional office\u2019s letter, the complainant may then file  a formal complaint about a violation of grant assurances with  headquarters. Headquarters will then review the circumstances of the  complaint and make a formal determination as to whether a grant  violation occurred and work with the airport to address the violation.", "Data on informal and formal complaints filed with FAA headquarters and  regional offices indicate FAA has not received many complaints on FBO  pricing. Specifically, we reviewed informal complaint data from 2013  through 2018 from each FAA region, and found a total of 142 informal  complaints about potential grant violations. Seven of these complaints  related to FBO prices, and FAA found one violation later resolved by the  airport by providing space for aircraft to do routine maintenance. In  addition, we obtained and reviewed FAA\u2019s responses to formal  complaints from 2013 through 2018, and found that none of these formal  complaint responses dealt with FBO prices. While FAA received few  complaints related to FBO prices, there are limitations in relying on  complaint data to understand the magnitude of an issue. For example,  some pilots we spoke with stated if they have an issue with an FBO, they  will use an alternative FBO rather than submit a complaint to FAA.", "We found that in addition to informal and formal complaints, each FAA  regional office independently records inquiries about airport grant  assurance issues ranging from inappropriate hanger use to noise  complaints to FBO lease arrangements. Further, each region varies in the  way it captures airport compliance information such as airport location,  dates, and description of an inquiry or concern. For example, some  regions indicate the specific grant assurance that was potentially violated  while others simply describe the nature of the concern. To help see if  there is a pattern of concerns across the country, FAA\u2019s Office of Airport  Compliance in headquarters has an initiative to centralize information on  inquiries and concerns about grant assurances, including any that may be  related to FBO prices. As envisioned, this \u201cEnhanced Information Sharing  Initiative\u201d will provide FAA compliance staff with the ability to record and  track inquires and complaints in comparable systems and should facilitate  information sharing among regions and between regions and  headquarters. According to FAA officials, centralizing this information will  help identify issues that may be of a concern to airport users. According  to FAA officials, this initiative, originally planned to be completed in  August 2019, has faced delays due to a government shutdown earlier this  year and information technology security difficulties. However, FAA has  hired a new contractor and anticipates completion sometime in fiscal year  2020. According to an FAA compliance manager, problems that arise in  the regions are brought to the attention of the airport compliance offices  and discussed, and whether additional actions should be taken.", "Airport Land-Use Inspections.

To  examine the correlation between these factors and the price of both  100LL and Jet A fuel sold by FBOs, we developed an econometric model.

In  addition, we ran the analysis not only on the full dataset of all of the  airports for which we were able to obtain fuel-pricing information (which  we refer to as the all-airports dataset), but also on a subset of airports  limited to those with an air traffic control tower (towered-airports dataset)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Dependent Variable", "paragraphs": ["For each type of aviation fuel, the dependent variable\u2014or the variable to  be explained in the model\u2014is the average price of that fuel at an airport,  net of state taxes.

At an airport where two or more FBOs compete to sell  the same type of fuel, the average price of the fuel is calculated as a  simple (unweighted) average across all of the FBOs that sell the fuel at  the airport. For 100LL, about 87 percent of airports in the all-airports  dataset are served by only one FBO, and for Jet A, the share is lower, at  about 84 percent.

Longer runways can accommodate  larger and heavier aircraft, which may increase demand of such  traffic. Because larger and heavier aircraft require more fuel, a longer  runway may be indicative of greater demand for fuel at the airport. At  the same time, longer runways are more costly to construct and  maintain. Thus both demand and supply factors related to having a  longer runway would suggest that fuel prices could be higher at such  airports.
