This report examines (1) the impacts of climate change on roads and bridges, wastewater systems, and NASA centers; (2) the extent to which climate change is incorporated into infrastructure planning; (3) factors that enabled some decision makers to implement adaptive measures; and (4) federal efforts to address local adaptation needs, as well as potential opportunities for improvement.", "GAO reviewed climate change assessments; analyzed relevant reports; interviewed stakeholders from professional associations and federal agencies; and visited infrastructure projects and interviewed local decision makers at seven sites where adaptive measures have been implemented."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["According to the National Research Council (NRC) and others, infrastructure such as roads and bridges, wastewater systems, and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) centers are vulnerable to changes in the climate. Changes in precipitation and sea levels, as well as increased intensity and frequency of extreme events, are projected by NRC and others to impact infrastructure in a variety of ways. When the climate changes, infrastructure-- typically designed to operate within past climate conditions--may not operate as well or for as long as planned, leading to economic, environmental, and social impacts. For example, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that, within 15 years, segments of Louisiana State Highway 1-- providing the only road access to a port servicing 18 percent of the nation's oil supply--will be inundated by tides an average of 30 times annually due to relative sea level rise. Flooding of this road effectively closes the port.", "Decision makers have not systematically considered climate change in infrastructure planning for various reasons, according to representatives of professional associations and agency officials who work with these decision makers. For example, more immediate priorities--such as managing aging infrastructure--consume time and resources, limiting decision makers' ability to consider and implement climate adaptation measures. Difficulties in obtaining and using information needed to understand vulnerabilities and inform adaptation decisions pose additional challenges.", "Key factors enabled some local decision makers to integrate climate change into infrastructure planning. As illustrated by GAO's site visits and relevant studies, these factors included (1) having local circumstances such as weather-related crises that spurred action, (2) learning how to use available information, (3) having access to local expertise, and (4) considering climate impacts within existing planning processes. As one example, the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District managed risks associated with more frequent extreme rainfall events by enhancing its natural systems' ability to absorb runoff by, for instance, preserving wetlands. This effort simultaneously expanded the sewer system's capacity while providing other community and environmental benefits. District leaders enabled these changes by prioritizing adaptation, using available locallevel climate projections, and utilizing local experts for assistance.", "GAO's report identifies several emerging federal efforts under way to facilitate more informed adaptation decisions, but these efforts could better support the needs of local infrastructure decision makers in the future, according to studies, local decision makers at the sites GAO visited, and other stakeholders. For example, among its key efforts, the federal government plays a critical role in producing the information needed to facilitate more informed local infrastructure adaptation decisions. However, as noted by NRC studies, this information exists in an uncoordinated confederation of networks and institutions, and the end result of it not being easily accessible is that people may make decisions--or choose not to act--without it. Accordingly, a range of studies and local decision makers GAO interviewed cited the need for the federal government to improve local decision makers' access to the best available information to use in infrastructure planning."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that a federal entity designated by the Executive Office of the President (EOP) work with agencies to identify for local infrastructure decision makers the best available climaterelated information for planning, and also to update this information over time.

Wastewater infrastructure is particularly vulnerable to  climate change impacts because it is commonly built in low-lying areas  near a body of water and because it is designed for historically observed  hydrologic conditions that may not be as relevant for future scenarios.", "Some locations could experience other, less direct, climate change  impacts from higher temperatures or drought conditions that alter the  characteristics of the wastewater flowing into a treatment plant\u2014for  example, by concentrating pollutants or increasing water temperatures\u2014 thereby reducing the effectiveness of a system\u2019s treatment processes that  were designed for different characteristics. In addition, treatment plants  may need to adopt alternative strategies to managing discharge of treated  or partially treated effluent if the condition of receiving water is altered by  climate impacts, according to technical comments from EPA. For  example, according to EPA\u2019s comments, the flow of the receiving water  body may be too low to dilute discharge enough to meet water quality  standards. Climate change impacts to wastewater management systems  can increase treatment costs, increase maintenance and replacement  costs, and compromise biological treatment systems resulting in impaired  water quality. In the worst cases, according to EPA officials, climate  change impacts could cause a system to fail, creating risks to public  health.", "Potential climate change impacts on wastewater management systems  are not limited to coastal areas, since changes in precipitation and  extreme events could affect wastewater management systems across the  country. According to USGCRP\u2019s 2009 National Climate Assessment, the  amount of rain falling in the heaviest downpours has increased  approximately 20 percent on average in the past century, and this trend is  very likely to continue, with the largest increases in the wettest places.  During the past 50 years, the greatest increases in heavy precipitation  occurred in the Northeast and the Midwest. Besides flooding and related  storm damage at treatment plants, increased precipitation creates  problems for combined and separate sewer systems that collect and carry  sewage to treatment facilities. Specifically, these precipitation changes  can increase the amount of runoff, which by design combines with  sewage in a combined sewer system, and can lead to increased  infiltration and inflow into aging separated systems. These increases can  overwhelm the capacity of sewer systems, causing overflows that bypass  treatment and result in the discharge of untreated wastewater into  receiving water bodies.", "Wastewater management systems are typically designed to provide a  specific level of service based on a number of design factors that include  a particular storm frequency, duration, and intensity. For example,  according to one set of commonly used design standards, treatment plant  components are typically designed for 25-, 50-, or 100-year storms.  Changes in characteristics of strong storms\u2014for instance, a storm that  historically occurred once every 100 years may occur every 50 years in  the future\u2014could cause wastewater management systems to be  overwhelmed more frequently. Climate change impacts have added to  existing stresses\u2014including aging infrastructure and urbanization\u2014that  already tax the capacities of many of the country\u2019s wastewater  management systems and challenge communities\u2019 ability to pay for them.  Specific impacts that have been observed in the two locations we visited  are discussed in the following sections.", "As EPA states on its combined sewer overflow web page (see here), combined sewer  systems are sewers that are designed to collect rainwater runoff, domestic sewage, and  industrial wastewater in the same pipe.

These  tide height scenarios were combined with the elevations of King County\u2019s  system facilities to identify those at risk of onsite flooding.

In recent years, the Milwaukee region  has experienced several extreme precipitation events and, in 2011,  scientists at the University of Wisconsin projected that these types of  storms will become more common in the future. Specifically, the  scientists projected that storm frequency and intensity will increase in  early spring, a time during which the sewers are more vulnerable to  overflows due to frozen ground conditions that limit infiltration and cause  more runoff.

Three of these programs, shown in figure 14, include (1) bio-swales,  which are depressed catchment areas planted with vegetation to capture  and infiltrate stormwater runoff; (2) green roofs either partially or  completely planted with vegetation to hold rainwater; and (3) the  purchase of undeveloped property to preserve targeted land areas to  store and drain stormwater runoff into the ground naturally.", "Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District officials emphasized the co- benefits of green infrastructure programs, including flood management,  improved air and water quality, increased property values, reduction of  urban heat island effect, and additional recreational amenities.", "NASA Johnson Space Center  (Houston, TX) and NASA  Langley Research Center  (Hampton, VA)", "Storm surge and relative sea level rise pose significant climate threats to  Johnson Space Center and Langley Research Center. As previously  discussed, these centers hosted adaptation workshops to identify risks to  assets and capabilities from current and future changes in the climate.  We attended these workshops and observed that they involved a broad  range of stakeholders\u2014including NASA climate scientists, headquarters  officials, and center staff; local government and industry officials; and  experts from local academic institutions\u2014in a comprehensive evaluation  of center vulnerability. The workshops are organized to help each center  (1) obtain information on historic, current, and projected climate hazards  specific to the region; (2) characterize the risk of current and future  climate on center systems, assets, and capabilities; (3) start to build  capacity to execute a continuous adaptation process; and (4) begin to  plan for the future and integrate climate considerations into existing  management plans and processes. These workshops were held in late  2011 and 2012, so it is too early to fully evaluate the progress of NASA  centers in incorporating climate change into their planning processes.", "NASA officials have begun to conduct follow-up activities and analyze  lessons learned from the workshops. An important outcome of the  workshops has been increasing NASA collaboration and partnership with  surrounding communities, federal neighbors, and academia, according to  NASA officials. Additionally, some centers are supporting local tidal  marsh restoration projects or implementing their own protective measures  of vulnerable mission-critical areas. Low impact development has been  implemented as one way of slowing water runoff and allowing more  infiltration. For example, the Langley Research Center has identified high- priority areas for wetland development to act as buffer zones for future  storm surge events, and it planned to harden or elevate vulnerable  infrastructure elements (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning, as well  as electrical transformers) as it rehabilitates, repairs, and maintains its  assets over time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Factors Enabled Decision Makers to Consider Climate Change in Project Planning", "paragraphs": ["The adaptive measures described above did not necessarily require  decision makers to undertake major changes to project plans or  infrastructure systems but often did involve a commitment of financial  resources and, importantly, a change in mind-set toward addressing  longer-term and uncertain risks that many decision makers are not yet in  a position to consider. Key factors that enabled these decision makers to  undertake such measures and overcome the challenges that have  deterred others from integrating climate change into infrastructure  planning were that (1) their local circumstances were conducive to  addressing climate-related risks, (2) they learned to use available climate  information, (3) they had access to local assistance, or (4) they  considered climate impacts within existing planning processes in the  same context as other potential risks.", "At the sites we visited, local circumstances were conducive to addressing  climate-related risks because these sites: (1) were in regions that recently  experienced a natural disaster or that had discernible climate-related  impacts, providing a stronger basis for engaging in adaptation efforts; (2)  had strong community leadership to help spur action; and (3) had  executive orders or other formal policy documents to help justify and  encourage taking adaptive actions.", "Recent extreme weather events triggered a response. In some cases,  decision makers were compelled to account for future climate conditions  by a triggering event that demanded a response or created a policy  window for action. For example, Hurricane Katrina exacted a heavy toll on  the old Twin Span Bridge, necessitating a rebuild and prioritizing the  construction of a new, more resilient bridge. As noted in the 2009 NRC  report on climate-related decision support, recent firsthand experience  with a natural disaster, such as a heat wave, drought, storm, or flood, can  dramatically increase decision makers\u2019 desire for, and openness to, new  information and action. For example, according to stakeholders from the  American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials  (AASHTO), the sense of urgency of climate change adaptation is  generally higher in coastal states and in areas that have experienced  recent events affecting their transportation infrastructure. Similarly, EPA  officials told us that the likelihood that a wastewater utility would consider  climate change in infrastructure planning depends largely on, among  other things, where it was located geographically and, in some cases,  whether it had already experienced a weather event that might increase  with a changing climate. This point was evident during our visit to  Milwaukee, where extreme rainfall events in 2008, 2009, and 2010 each  exceeded the magnitude of a 100-year storm, making the public aware of  the need to prepare for the impacts of climate change. Also, according  to NASA officials, the impact of extreme events on the two NASA centers  we visited helped drive the creation of the adaptation workshops.", "NRC, America\u2019s Climate Choices: Panel on Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change,  Adapting to the Impacts of Climate Change (Washington, D.C.: 2010).", "Director outlining how they will start to incorporate consideration of  climate risks and adaptation strategies into their plans and processes.", "Policy documents helped justify action. As shown by our site visits,  executive orders or other formal policy documents can help justify and  encourage adaptive efforts at the state and federal levels. For example,  Washington State Executive Order 07-02, issued in 2007, directed the  development of a climate change initiative to determine the specific steps  that should be taken to prepare for the impact of global warming on  infrastructure, among other things. Since then, state transportation  officials considered climate change adaptation during the environmental  review of Washington State Route 522, and the Washington State  Department of Transportation has directed all project teams to consider  climate change in their national and state environmental review  documents. Similarly, King County\u2019s 2007 Climate Action Plan provided  the impetus to move forward on adaptation activities, according to  Wastewater Treatment Division officials. At the federal level, the October  5, 2009, Executive Order 13514 on Federal Leadership in Environmental,  Energy, and Economic Performance directs federal agencies to evaluate  their climate change risks and vulnerabilities and manage the effects of  climate change on the agency\u2019s operations and mission in both the short-  and long-term. NASA officials at the Johnson Space Center and Langley  Research Center workshops cited the executive order as a reason to take  the workshops seriously.", "The examples from our site visits show that it is possible to use many  types of climate-related data to make more informed decisions about  climate change in project-level infrastructure planning. Importantly, the  decision makers at the sites we visited did not wait for perfect information  to take action, and they learned to manage the uncertainty associated  with climate-related data. As stated to us by an official from Seattle Public  Utilities, \u201cuncertainty should not be an excuse for inaction on climate  change adaptation. Decision makers have to get smarter and find ways to  incorporate whatever climate information they have.\u201dchallenges that decision makers reported in identifying and applying  available information about climate change, decision makers at the sites  we visited learned to use a range of information sources, including (1)  site-specific projections of future climate conditions, (2) qualitative  information based on state or regional scale climate projections, and (3)  observed climate data.", "Site-specific projections of future climate conditions. In some cases,  decision makers learned to use site-specific projections of future climate  conditions when determining how to take adaptive measures. For  example, NASA climate scientists prepared downscaled climate variable  projections for the Johnson Space Center and Langley Research Center  workshops. Table 5 shows projected quantitative climate changes for  Johnson Space Center.", "Furthermore, Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District officials used  site-specific climate change projections prepared by the Wisconsin  Initiative on Climate Change Impacts as a foundation for planning green  infrastructure components that may have a beneficial impact to their  system. More specifically, the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District  contracted with researchers at a local academic institution to use these  projections to provide an analysis of how climate change could impact the  sewer system and cause sewer overflows. The King County Wastewater  Treatment Division similarly used sea level rise projections from the  University of Washington\u2019s Climate Impacts Group in its facilities  vulnerability study.", "Qualitative information. Not all decision makers have access to quantified  site-specific projections of future climate changes. In the absence of such  projections, some infrastructure decision makers from our site visits used  qualitative evaluations of state or regional scale climate projections to  help make more informed decisions. For example, site-specific climate  projection data were not available when Washington State Department of  Transportation officials evaluated adaptation measures for Washington  State Route 522. For this reason, the project team conducted a qualitative  evaluation of climate variability based on available information, such as  information from the region\u2019s transportation planning organization and  studies reflecting how climate change impacts may manifest themselves  within the region. Similarly, when Seattle Public Utilities officials assessed  their adaptation options, site-specific climate change projection data were  not adequate to be useful for planning purposes. As a result, according to  a 2011 EPA report, utility officials used their general understanding of  climate trends to apply a safety factor to new infrastructure construction  so that that new investments would more likely perform their intended  function over their useful lives. This is a practical approach that can be  generalized to a wide range of adaptation situations, according to  technical comments from CEQ, OSTP, and USGCRP.", "Observed historical climate data. According to a NOAA workshop report  on climate adaptation, observed climate records help to overcome  barriers that may be associated with discussions of climate change.  Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District officials told us they  emphasize data on observed changes when the public inquires about the  district\u2019s climate change adaptation actions. Similarly, officials from the  Wisconsin Initiative on Climate Change Impacts stated that while it is  difficult to ask a planning board for money to make design changes based  on uncertain projections, observations can show that the climate is  changing and that stakeholders are often more compelled by historical  data than by model projections. As we observed, NASA kicked off each  workshop by presenting observed climate data for the local area and  discussing participants\u2019 personal experiences with weather events to  make the potentially abstract notion of climate vulnerability \u201creal.\u201d Figure  15 shows the observed historical sea level and temperature data that  NASA used in its Langley Research Center workshop.", "Some decision makers at the sites we visited said that they used historic  climate data to inform engineering decisions. For example, when  designing the new Twin Span Bridge, Louisiana Department of  Transportation and Development engineers wanted to design the bridge  to resist storm surge and wave action from the worst-case storm  scenario. However, they had no detailed information about Lake  Pontchartrain\u2019s wave characteristics or guidance from the AASHTO on  how to design a bridge to withstand extreme weather events in coastal  areas. To obtain this information, these officials hired experts in the area  of wave mechanics to conduct a storm analysis. The experts used historic  storm surge data to develop hypothetical scenarios regarding wave crest  elevations and hurricane tracks. While reviewing historic data, the experts  discovered that Lake Pontchartrain is very susceptible to storm surge. To  determine the worst-case scenario for the Twin Span Bridge, they  modeled a storm with properties similar to Hurricane Katrina along  different storm tracks. The storm surge and waves created by a Katrina- like hurricane located west of the bridge became the basis of their design.", "Access to local assistance was instrumental to decision makers\u2019 ability to  undertake climate adaptation efforts at the sites we visited. Decision  makers used this assistance to (1) translate available climate information  into a meaningful and usable form and (2) help communicate to the local  community the risks associated with climate change and the importance  of taking action.", "Translating available information. At most of our site visits, local experts  helped decision makers bridge the gap between the information they  needed and the science that was available. Decision makers at the sites  we visited told us that local experts were instrumental because they  understood the local context. In one example, the Milwaukee Metropolitan  Sewerage District sought the expertise of local scientists and planners  who were familiar with its sewer system and local considerations because  available climate change information could not be used \u201coff the shelf\u201d for  wastewater planning. These experts translated region-specific climate  model data into a form that could be plugged into existing sewer system  models used by the Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District for system  planning and evaluation. This enabled the district\u2019s decision makers to  understand the projected impacts of climate change on its sewer system  and appropriately tailor their adaptation efforts. In another example,  NASA developed a Climate Adaptation Science Investigator working  group with members at each of its centers to partner NASA climate  scientists with local infrastructure managers, thereby developing local  expertise that decision makers could use to tailor center-specific  adaptation solutions.", "Communicating to the public. In addition to helping translate climate  change information, decision makers at our site visits noted the  importance of having local experts to help communicate local climate  change information to the public and help the community understand the  need for adaptation. For example, several decision makers in King  County said that experts from the Climate Impacts Group at the University  of Washington, through outreach programs, were effective in focusing the  community\u2019s attention on climate change issues and the importance of  investing in climate preparedness. According to one of the decision  makers, when King County officials are \u201cable to stand shoulder-to- shoulder\u201d with local scientists known in the community, they do not have  to defend the underlying climate science to customers who could  potentially face increased rates. Similarly, several decision makers in  Milwaukee noted that having local experts helps the agency more  effectively convey to the community the need for and importance of  climate preparation. They noted, \u201cthe response you get from people when  talking about climate change often depends on who is delivering the  message.\u201d", "Some decision makers stated during our site visits that a key factor in  their success was an ability to consider potential climate change impacts  within their existing infrastructure planning processes so that they were  viewed in the same context with other potential risks. As NRC reported in  2010, incorporating adaptation considerations into existing processes\u2014a  concept known as \u201cmainstreaming\u201d\u2014can reduce costs and provide  incentives to adapt.", "The value of mainstreaming adaptation into normal planning processes  was illustrated by several of our site visits. In Milwaukee, for example,  sewerage district officials noted that efforts to consider climate change in  sewer infrastructure planning were successful because climate change  information could be integrated into existing planning processes and  analyses. In one such effort, an engineer at the Milwaukee Metropolitan  Sewerage District told us that the agency builds new water conveyance  structures taller because it \u201cmakes sense\u201d given the known vulnerabilities  to increased flooding in the region. Additionally, in the Washington State  Route 522 example, project planners incorporated climate change  considerations during the project\u2019s environmental review process, which  provided the opportunity to explain how the elements of the project  helped to improve climate resiliency and reduce potential for damage  from extreme storm events. According to Washington State Department  of Transportation officials, climate adaptation measures were integrated  with decisions about how to minimize environmental effects and comply  with regulations, permits, and approvals.", "Some of the decision makers from our site visits envision more formally  integrating potential climate change impacts into planning processes. For  example, wastewater officials from King County said that they will likely  include climate change risk in a field of the county\u2019s asset management  database that is maintained to track the status and condition of  infrastructure components. Therefore, when a particular component is  due for rehabilitation or replacement, information will be readily available  for planners and designers to make the component more resilient to  climate change as it is being modified anyway. Similarly, NASA\u2019s Climate  Change Adaptation Policy Statement notes that the agency plans to start  building the capacity to execute a continuous adaptation process and will  require that climate considerations be incorporated into existing  management plans and processes.

This, according to OSTP, yields a broader  challenge of tying climate-related efforts together into a coherent  governmentwide strategy since interagency coordinating programs like  USGCRP generally do not have direct control over agency budgets.  According to a 2009 NRC report, the absence of centralized budget  authority limits the ability of the USGCRP to influence the priorities of  participating agencies or implement new research directions that fall  outside or across agency missions.", "In technical comments, CEQ, OSTP, and USGCRP noted that the  absence of centralized budget authority remains the most important  impediment to USGCRP\u2019s ability to meet its mandate to provide the  information needed to support adaptation planning and implementation.  However, according to the technical comments, agencies\u2019 enabling  legislation and subsequent reauthorizations generally require that they  advance initiatives that promote or serve their agency missions, and the  appropriations process supports and reinforces separate budget  authorities, particularly where agencies are covered by different  Congressional committees. The technical comments also noted the  difficulty in finding mechanisms to facilitate joint federal funding of  projects makes collaboration and implementation of joint priorities more  challenging.", "While coordinating available climate-related data is a first step in making  more informed adaptation decisions, another key step is to ensure  decision makers have access to the best available data.

As  stated by AASHTO officials, the most important role that the federal  government could play in the transportation sector with respect to  adaptation would be to provide a central repository for state transportation  officials to go to for data. Similarly, stakeholders at a recent NOAA- sponsored workshop on transportation infrastructure adaptation  highlighted the importance of clear guidance on where to look for  information, including the need for a central clearinghouse for climate and  weather information relevant to transportation officials.", "Efforts to provide infrastructure decision makers with access to climate- related information are an emerging priority across the federal  government. For example, on June 6, 2012, both the Acting Director of  OMB and the Director of OSTP signed the Science and Technology  Priorities for the Fiscal Year 2014 Budget memorandum, which states that  agencies should give priority to research and development that  strengthens the scientific basis for decision making.

According to EPA officials, the agency  has other projects under way focused on providing additional information  and alternative approaches for communities. These projects include work  on a decision-making framework to help decision makers select among  different adaptation approaches, development of case studies to promote  peer-to-peer learning on preparing for impacts, and development of a tool  for users to evaluate options in a range of potential future water quality  scenarios.", "The Department of Transportation supports a range of technical  assistance efforts focused on helping road and bridge infrastructure  decision makers incorporate climate change information into planning  processes.

The officials said that the states and metropolitan planning organizations  participating in pilot programs have used the agency\u2019s draft adaptation  framework. In addition, federal officials track and collect feedback from  the state and local agencies that have participated in the workshops and  peer exchanges that the Federal Highway Administration has sponsored,  according to agency officials. Importantly, a 2010 NRC report on  informing decisions in a changing climate found it difficult to identify good  reviews and clear unbiased discussions of the full range of decision  support tools, their appropriate uses and limitations, and concluded that  there could be a stronger role for the federal government to provide  guidance on tools to support climate decisions, perhaps through a climate  tools database, network, and best practice examples."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accessing Local Assistance", "paragraphs": ["At the locations we visited, having access to local assistance was a key  variable that enabled decision makers to incorporate climate change into  project level infrastructure planning.

These efforts relate to (1) design standards  specifying how to consider climate change in infrastructure projects; (2)  guidance specifying how certain types of federal infrastructure  investments should account for climate change when meeting the  requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA):  and (3) agency adaptation plans describing, among other things, how  climate change will be considered in federal planning processes that  influence local actions.", "Professional associations like AASHTO\u2014not federal agencies\u2014generally  develop the design standards that specify how weather and climate- related data are to be considered in project-level design and planning  processes for roads and bridges, wastewater management systems, and  NASA centers. OMB Circular A-119 directs agencies to use these  voluntary consensus standards in lieu of government-unique standards  except where inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical. According  to Federal Highway Administration officials, for highway infrastructure  these design standards are in turn modified and adopted by state  governments and then approved by the federal government agency, in  this case the Federal Highway Administration, before they can be applied  to federally funded projects. Thus, federal agencies rely on professional  associations to provide initial input to determine how and when climate- related data are included within design standards that specify how  infrastructure is to be built.", "Decision makers from the sites we visited, other infrastructure  stakeholders, and relevant studies emphasized the importance of better  employing design standards as a tool for incorporating climate change in  infrastructure planning. For example, experts from the University of  Washington who work with the King County Wastewater Treatment  Division stated that it would be helpful to have (1) protocols for developing  and maintaining design standards that incorporate climate change  projections and (2) established methods for using this information in  actual design processes via well-documented case studies; because,  according to these experts, not having a formal process for incorporating  climate change information in design standards effectively ensures that  most of the design community cannot act without unacceptable  professional risks. Similarly, officials from the American Society of Civil  Engineers with whom we spoke acknowledged that incorporating climate  science in design standards is critical for translating adaptation into  engineering practice. Building on this point, a recent report on adaptation  policy noted that updating design standards can also spur innovation in  materials science, engineering, and construction.", "Professional associations are beginning to take interest in climate change  adaptation. For example, AASHTO maintains a web-based  Transportation and Climate Change Resource Center with a climate  adaptation page and a list of educational webinars on topics such as  adapting infrastructure to extreme events. Society of Civil Engineers developed a Committee on Adaptation to  Climate Change to, in part, translate climate science into engineering  practice. In addition, some private infrastructure development and  construction companies are beginning to develop methods to compare  the costs and benefits of engineering alternatives considering different  climate futures.

As CEQ noted in this guidance, the environmental analysis and documents produced in the NEPA process could consider  the relationship of climate change effects to a proposed action, such as  an infrastructure project that was a major federal action, or alternatives,  including proposal design and adaptation measures.", "CEQ\u2019s draft NEPA guidance states that climate change effects should be  considered in the analysis of projects that are designed for long-term  utility and located in areas that are considered vulnerable to specific  effects of climate change (e.g., increasing sea level or ecological change)  within the project\u2019s time frame. For example, a proposal for long-term  development of transportation infrastructure on a coastal barrier island  will likely need to consider whether environmental effects or design  parameters may be changed by the projected increase in the rate of sea  level rise. Given the length of time involved in present sea level  projections, such considerations typically would not be relevant to an  action with only short-term considerations. The guidance further states  that this is not intended as a new component of NEPA analysis but rather  as a potentially important factor to be considered within the existing  NEPA framework.", "The draft guidance also noted that, after consideration of public comment,  CEQ intended to expeditiously issue the guidance in final form. CEQ  received public comments on the draft guidance following its release on  February 18, 2010.

Agencies are to consider how they will include climate change  within their existing programs and planning processes, some of which can  influence state and local actions on infrastructure investment. For  example, on September 24 2012, the Federal Highway Administration\u2019s  Associate Administrators for Infrastructure; Planning, Environment, and  Realty; and Federal Lands Highway issued a memorandum to Federal  Highway Administration staff clarifying the eligibility of adaptation  activities for federal highway funding.
