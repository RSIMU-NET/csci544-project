Key principles that GAO derived from federal budget guidance stress the importance of including all relevant funding estimates in the plan, as well as documenting methodological assumptions and potential limitations. However, DOD did not specifically direct the Air Force to include a range of potential budget estimates in the report for developing a new intercontinental missile or bomber, where a firm estimate was unavailable. DOD also did not direct that key assumptions and limitations be documented in the report for preparing its NC3 estimates. GAO reported in December 2013 that DOE's nuclear stockpile and infrastructure estimates did not include a range of preliminary budget estimates to account for known future expenses. GAO recommended that DOE include a range of potential budget estimates for preliminary projects and programs in future funding plans, and DOE generally agreed with this recommendation.

Further, we reported that for activities  where NNSA expected a change to the level of effort\u2014such as life- extension programs\u2014NNSA instead used available planning data. In the  case of life-extension programs, these data included cost estimates  based on an improved cost model that, according to NNSA officials, is  more likely to be accurate than estimates generated using the previous  approach because they are based on the costs of a life-extension  program that is in progress, rather than a program that was never  executed.", "While DOE took steps to ensure that its total budget estimates for each  life-extension program would cover the programs\u2019 costs to achieve their  first production units, in December 2013 we found that NNSA\u2019s funding  plans included in the FYNSP are less than what will be needed to meet  schedules reflected in the joint report.

For example, at the time the joint  report was published, the Air Force had not yet completed its analysis of  alternatives for replacing the Minuteman III. As we reported in September  2013, the Air Force expects a wide range of costs for replacing the  Minuteman III ICBM, depending on the replacement option that DOD  selects. In contrast, the Navy\u2019s Ohio Replacement Program included  $27.8 billion in research, development, test, and evaluation and ship  construction estimates over the 10-year period for a new SSBN.  However, the Navy\u2019s submarine-replacement program is further along in  the acquisition process than either the Air Force\u2019s ICBM-replacement  effort, or its new bomber program. DOD officials told us that it would be  highly speculative to include potential costs for replacing the Minuteman  III ICBM because that program is not yet defined. An Air Force official  added that specific estimates for the new bomber were considered too  sensitive to include in the report. Moreover, in its guidance for preparing  the joint report, provided in various e-mails and a briefing to DOD officials,  the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy sought  consistency with the President\u2019s budget submission and DOD\u2019s funding  plans, without specifically directing the Air Force or the Navy to project  potential budget estimates that would be required to bring such efforts to  completion. However, as we concluded in December 2013, departments  and agencies could include at least a range of potential budget estimates  in their funding plans for preliminary projects, based on available cost  information.

Under such circumstances, accurate and complete budget  estimates over the long term are needed to help decision makers assess  affordability when making tradeoffs among requirements.", "Under a separate statutory mandate, we reported on DOE\u2019s plans and  25-year budget estimates for sustaining and modernizing the nuclear  stockpile and nuclear security enterprise in December 2013. As we  reported at that time, DOE\u2019s estimates do not represent the total funding  needed for nuclear weapons life-extension programs or infrastructure- modernization efforts. In that report we recommended that DOE should  include at least a range of potential budget estimates for future projects  and programs that it knows are needed. DOE generally concurred with  our recommendation.", "In reviewing DOD\u2019s plans and estimates for sustaining and modernizing  nuclear delivery systems, we found that DOD\u2019s guidance for preparing the  joint report sought consistency between the report\u2019s estimates and the  fiscal year 2014 budget submission and 5-year funding plans. However,  this resulted in a missed opportunity to identify the potential long-term  costs for these efforts. Unless the Secretary of Defense directs the  Secretary of the Air Force and Secretary of the Navy to include in future  reports at least a range of potential budget estimates for key  modernization programs based on preliminary cost information, its  estimates in subsequent annual joint reports will be incomplete and  understated.", "Finally, estimating the costs for sustaining and modernizing the NC3  system is perhaps the most difficult and challenging task that DOD faced  in preparing its contributions to the report. The DOD CIO was able to  simplify the complexity of the NC3 system in its estimates to some  degree, but it did not describe the assumptions behind its analysis, nor  did it characterize its potential limitations in the joint report. Unless the  Secretary of Defense directs that key assumptions and limitations are  documented in future reports, the basis for its NC3 estimates may not be  adequately transparent for Congress to determine reasonable resource  allocations, and Congress may not be able to identify changes in the  estimates from one annual report to the next."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making two recommendations to the Secretary of Defense to  improve subsequent joint reports to Congress on plans for sustaining and  modernizing U.S nuclear weapons capabilities:", "To ensure the accuracy and completeness of DOD\u2019s estimates for  sustaining and modernizing strategic delivery systems over the 10- year period covered in subsequent joint reports, we recommend the  Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Air Force and  Secretary of the Navy, as appropriate, to include at least a range of  potential budget estimates for projects and programs in future  modernization plans that extend beyond the period covered by their 5- year internal funding plans, based on preliminary cost information.", "To improve the transparency of the joint report\u2019s methodologies,  thereby assisting Congress in understanding the basis for DOD\u2019s NC3  estimates in subsequent joint reports, we recommend the Secretary of  Defense direct the DOD CIO to document in the report the  methodological assumptions and limitations affecting the report\u2019s  estimates for sustaining and modernizing the NC3 system.", "We are not making recommendations to the Secretary of Energy because  in our December 2013 report reviewing NNSA\u2019s nuclear security budget  materials we recommended that the Administrator of NNSA should  include in future modernization plans at least a range of potential budget  estimates for projects and programs that the agency knows are needed,  based on available information about these projects\u2019 and programs\u2019 future  costs.

To address our objective, we  obtained and analyzed the DOE and DOD plans and estimates from the  July 15, 2013, joint report, and analyzed the DOE and DOD data and  methodologies used to prepare their 10-year budget estimates. We  compared their plans and estimates from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal  year 2018 with their fiscal year 2014 budget-justification materials and  each department\u2019s internal funding plans.", "We performed our review at both DOE and DOD. For our review of DOE\u2019s  plans and estimates, we drew upon our December 2013 report. We  compared DOE\u2019s estimates in the joint report with the NNSA\u2019s funding  plans in the Future Years Nuclear Security Program (FYNSP) and the  Fiscal Year 2014 Stockpile Stewardship and Management Plan, which  includes estimated funding requirements for NNSA modernization that  cover the time required for the joint report and beyond. For our review of  DOD\u2019s plans and estimates for nuclear delivery systems and the nuclear  command and control system, we used DOD\u2019s fiscal 2014 budget- justification submission and its funding plans in its Future Years Defense  Program (FYDP). Because DOD has not prepared internal funding plans  used to project estimated budget requests beyond fiscal year 2018, we  reviewed Air Force, Navy, and defense-wide plans, including the Air  Force\u2019s Core Function Master Plan for Nuclear Deterrence, the Navy\u2019s  long-range shipbuilding plan, DOD\u2019s 30-year aviation inventory plan, and  the Defense Information Systems Agency\u2019s (DISA) Nuclear Command,  Control, and Communications (C We did not assess the overall reliability  of DOE\u2019s and DOD\u2019s internal funding plans themselves, or the  departments\u2019 underlying budget-estimating processes because such  analysis exceeded the scope of our mandate. We also did not  independently verify the reliability of DOD\u2019s or DOE\u2019s specific budget  estimates, but rather determined the estimates to be sufficiently accurate  and complete if the budget estimates in the joint report were consistent  with their funding plans, including their respective budget-justification  materials, FYNSP, and FYDP.

At DOD, we obtained Air Force, Navy,  and DOD CIO documentation of their methodologies used to create  DOD\u2019s 10-year estimates for sustaining and modernizing nuclear delivery  systems and the nuclear command and control system. We also obtained  guidance in the form of e-mails and a briefing from the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Policy, and interviewed officials from those  offices and from U.S. Strategic Command. We then compared DOE\u2019s  information and DOD\u2019s guidance and methodologies with the key  principles for developing and preparing long-term funding plans that we  derived by reviewing key federal and departmental guidance, standards,  and practices for cost-estimating, budget preparation, financial planning,  and public reporting.
