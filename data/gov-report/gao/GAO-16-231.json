GAO was asked to examine the provision and oversight of medical care in immigration detention facilities. This report examines the extent to which DHS (1) has processes for administering detainee medical care and maintaining cost information for care, (2) monitors and assesses compliance with medical care standards, and (3) oversees processes to obtain and address complaints about detainee medical care.", "GAO reviewed ICE data and information on costs, detention population, standards, and oversight for 165 facilities that held detainees for more than 72 hours in fiscal year 2015. GAO also reviewed complaint processes, interviewed DHS and ICE officials, and visited 12 facilities selected based on detainee population and facility type, among other factors. The visit results are not generalizable, but provided insight to the provision of medical care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) oversees basic on-site medical care at all facilities, as required by ICE detention standards, but does not maintain complete information about medical care costs. The ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC) provided direct care to detainees at 19 over-72-hour facilities and oversaw care at the remaining 146 non-IHSC-staffed facilities in fiscal year 2015. At all facilities, IHSC uses an electronic system, the Medical Payment Authorization (MedPAR) system, to approve or deny off-site care requests for detainees; such requests could include dental visits or surgical needs. IHSC uses a system different from MedPAR to track costs or amounts paid for off-site care. The use of separate systems limits ICE's ability to link approvals and payments. For example, the number of claims paid for fiscal years 2012 through 2014 did not correspond to the number of IHSC MedPAR approvals for requested services for the same time period. While there are valid reasons for these differences, such as that approvals and claims could be made in different fiscal years, establishing a mechanism to more fully ensure that payments for off-site care are supported by the appropriate authorizations could help ICE monitor medical care costs and better validate payments.", "ICE conducts medical care compliance inspections at individual facilities, but conducts limited analyses of inspection data across facilities and over time. ICE uses seven oversight mechanisms to monitor facilities' compliance with medical care detention standards, such as facility inspections and on-site detention monitors. The combined use of these oversight mechanisms resulted in more than 99 percent of ICE's average daily population (ADP) of approximately 28,000 detainees being covered by two or more mechanisms in fiscal year 2015. ICE's priority has been to focus on local, facility-specific issues rather than perform overarching analyses. For example, ICE does not utilize the data gathered through these mechanisms in a way that examines overall trends in medical care deficiencies. Conducting analysis of oversight data over time, by detention standards, and across facilities, consistent with internal control standards, could strengthen ICE's ability to manage and oversee the provision of medical care across facility types.", "DHS has various processes to obtain and address the hundreds of medical care complaints it receives annually. Specifically, detainees can submit complaints regarding medical care directly to facilities or to one of various DHS entities, including the Office of Inspector General and Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. These entities generally determine whether to take their own action on the complaints or forward them to ICE for resolution. These entities maintain complaint data in various ways, and IHSC, which is ultimately responsible for addressing medical complaints received, is developing and piloting a new system for managing tasks, including addressing complaints. However, internal control standards call for evaluation of performance over time, and it is unclear whether IHSC's new system will capture all medical complaints received by DHS or facilitate analyses of complaints over time and across facilities. Ensuring that a new tasking system would capture all complaints and facilitate analysis could improve DHS's decision-making for detainee medical care."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS, among other things, ensure payments for medical care are supported by authorizations, conduct trend analyses of oversight data, and track all medical complaints received by DHS entities.

ICE detained an average daily population (ADP) of approximately  38,000 detainees in fiscal year 2014 and approximately 32,000 detainees  in fiscal year 2015. ICE addresses the medical needs of the detained  population through a range of medical care services\u2014from routine exams  and tuberculosis screenings to off-site emergency room visits and chronic  disease interventions. Non-governmental organizations and immigration  advocacy groups have expressed concerns with the provision, quality,  and oversight of medical care for detainees in ICE custody.

ERO\u2019s Custody Management  Division (CMD) manages the planning and acquisition of detention  facilities and oversees the regular monitoring and inspection of facilities  for standards compliance. The ICE Health Service Corps (IHSC), within  ERO, oversees the administration and costs of medical care at all  detention facilities and directly provides care to approximately 40 percent  of detainees. IHSC also addresses complaints regarding detainee  medical care received by other DHS components. The Office of Detention  Oversight (ODO), within ICE\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility  (OPR), serves as an oversight body for ERO and conducts periodic  inspections of a sample of detention facilities. The Joint Intake Center  (JIC), operated by OPR and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  Internal Affairs, receives allegations of misconduct involving ICE and CBP  employees and contractors and assigns the information for appropriate  action or investigation. The JIC also receives complaints from detainees,  as does the ICE Detention and Reporting Information Line (DRIL)  helpline.

Specifically, we found  that, while ICE had various mechanisms to collect and assess data on  detention costs, it did not have complete data for the tracking and  managing of costs across facilities and facility types. Errors in the  recording of data by ICE field operators produced limitations that made it  difficult for ICE to accurately record expenditures for all facilities, including  those for medical care. We also found that ICE\u2019s oversight mechanisms  resulted in differing inspection results, and that ICE offices did not have  sufficient communication about inspection results to determine whether  the oversight mechanisms functioned as intended. We recommended that  ICE assess the extent to which it has appropriate internal controls for  tracking and managing detention facility costs and develop additional  controls as necessary, and that ICE review the reasons for differences  between inspection results and assess the extent to which differences  reflect broader issues with the inspection mechanisms themselves to help  ensure that the mechanisms work as intended.

This report  focuses on over-72-hour facilities because detainees are more likely to  need medical attention when held for longer periods of time. We visited a  purposive, non-generalizable sample of 12 detention facilities in Arizona,  California, Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Texas, and Wisconsin. We  selected these facilities to reflect a mix of factors, such as facility type,  detention standards governing the facility, the ICE Field Office Area of  Responsibility, ADP, and recommendations made by DHS and non- governmental organizations that work with immigration detainees. We  interviewed ERO field office officials, facility personnel, and detainees  about medical care at facilities. The information we obtained from our  facility visits cannot be generalized to all facilities or detainees, but offers  insight into the processes used by DHS to provide and oversee detainee  medical care.", "To determine the processes of administering medical care to detainees,  we reviewed ICE documents, including the IHSC Policy Manual, a July  2015 IHSC Operational Memorandum, and other documentation related  to its mission of overseeing and providing medical care to detainees. In  addition, we interviewed relevant ICE headquarters and regional officials,  as well as ICE and detention facility officials associated with visits to 12  facilities about the processes of providing medical care. To determine the  extent to which DHS maintains information on the costs associated with  medical care, we reviewed information about authorizations and  payments for off-site care for over-72-hour facilities operating in fiscal  years 2012 through 2014. To determine the reliability of medical claims  and expenditure data, we reviewed documentation and a prior GAO  report, and interviewed agency officials. We determined that some of  these data were sufficiently reliable to provide a general indication of  approximate costs for some, but not all, medical care expenditures. We  discuss these data in more detail later in the report. We assessed ICE  practices for administering off-site medical care and the agency efforts to  track and utilize cost data against Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government.", "To determine the extent to which DHS monitors compliance with medical  care standards, we analyzed the percentage of ADP covered by each of  ICE\u2019s oversight mechanisms in 2015, the year for which the most recent  data were available.

To determine the reliability of  these data, we reviewed ICE documentation and interviewed officials  knowledgeable about the creation, use, and storage of the data. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also identified overlapping oversight mechanisms to determine the  percentage of ADP covered by multiple forms of oversight. We reviewed  ICE documents and interviewed agency officials to determine how each  oversight mechanism is intended to function. To determine the extent to  which DHS assesses medical care compliance at facilities, we reviewed  ICE documents and interviewed agency officials to determine use of  inspection results, and assessed whether DHS uses results in  accordance with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government.", "To determine the extent to which DHS oversees immigration detention  medical care complaint mechanisms, we analyzed and compared CRCL,  DRIL, IHSC, JIC, and OIG processes for obtaining and addressing  complaints; analyzed fiscal year 2014 complaint data\u2014the most recent  data maintained by these DHS entities\u2019 data systems at the time of our  review; and reviewed ICE detention and family residential standards that  govern facility grievance systems. We also reviewed and analyzed CMD,  ODO, and Operational Review Self-Assessment (ORSA) grievance  standard inspection data for calendar and fiscal year 2014 to assess the  extent to which inspections found deficiencies in grievance standards. To  determine the reliability of the complaint and inspection results data, we  reviewed documentation, interviewed agency officials, and conducted  testing. We determined that CRCL, DRIL, JIC, and OIG complaint data,  and CMD, ODO, and ORSA inspection data were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. We chose not to use IHSC\u2019s data on complaints because  IHSC\u2019s system did not include all complaints IHSC addressed in fiscal  year 2014. Specifically, DRIL complaints addressed by IHSC were not  included in IHSC\u2019s data system until fiscal year 2015.

The applicable set of standards used at each facility is included in the  facility\u2019s contract or agreement. Facilities of the same type, therefore, may  follow different sets of detention standards depending on the applicable  set of standards specified in the facility\u2019s contract or agreement. Table 2  provides information about each set of standards used by ICE, as well as  the number of facilities following those standards and the percentage of  the over-72-hour ADP covered by each set of standards during fiscal year  2015. For a discussion about how these standards have evolved over  time, see appendix II.", "During the entire fiscal year 2015 period, IHSC was responsible for  providing direct medical care to detainees in 19 over-72-hour facilities  used by ICE, comprising approximately 48 percent of the over-72-hour  ADP. Facilities serviced by IHSC included service processing centers,  contract detention facilities, dedicated intergovernmental service  agreement facilities, and family residential centers. IHSC medical  personnel are to provide medical, dental, mental health care, and public  health services to detainees at these facilities. Similar services are to be  provided by local government staff or private contractors at the remaining  facilities, which are not directly operated by ICE. Although ICE delegates  the on-site provision of medical care to other entities at these non- dedicated facilities, multiple ICE offices exercise oversight of medical care  provided to all detainees, as discussed in more detail later in this report.  In addition to on-site care, facilities may send detainees for emergency or  specialty care to an off-site provider. In non-emergency situations, IHSC  officials are to utilize a data system to review and approve off-site care  requests prior to appointments. For emergency off-site visits, information  is to be recorded in the same data system after care is provided.", "Numerous DHS components are responsible for obtaining and  addressing detainee complaints, and multiple ICE offices manage the  oversight of detention standards.

ICE also has data on requests for off-site medical care, including whether  those requests were approved or denied, but could improve the  mechanisms and processes associated with linking data on approved  requests to costs paid for off-site services.", "On-site medical care costs. The amount and type of information that  ICE maintains on costs for medical care provided on-site varies by facility  type. For example, at the 19 over-72-hour facilities where IHSC provided  direct medical care to detainees in fiscal year 2015, ICE maintained  medical expenditure data in its accounting system of record, the Federal  Financial Management System. Based on these data, the total cost of  providing medical care to detainees at IHSC-staffed facilities was about  $150 million in fiscal year 2013, $212 million in fiscal year 2014, and $206  million in fiscal year 2015. At the other approximately 140 facilities utilized  in fiscal year 2015 where IHSC did not directly employ medical staff,  costs for medical care are typically included in each facility\u2019s per diem  rate for housing detainees. In these instances, ICE pays a set fee per day  per detainee. As we noted in our October 2014 report on immigration  detention costs and standards, however, limitations in ICE\u2019s data on  overall facility costs, including costs for medical care, preclude using the  data to track and manage costs across individual facilities and facility  types. Furthermore, our 2014 report found significant coding errors in  cost data entered to the Federal Financial Management System, raising  questions about the reliability of the medical care expenditures figures  cited above. In our 2014 report, we recommended that ICE assess the  extent to which it has appropriate internal controls for tracking and  managing detention facility costs and develop additional controls as  necessary. ICE concurred and subsequently reported on actions taken to  address these recommendations. For example, DHS reported in February  2015 that ICE had created a tool to help track costs for each detention  facility, but as of January 2016, ICE had not fully assessed the extent to  which the tool is an appropriate internal control for tracking and managing  detention facilities costs and whether additional controls are necessary. In  addition, ICE reported that it is planning upgrades to the Federal Financial  Management System that could mitigate data reliability issues, but ICE  had not yet completed these updates as of January 2016. We continue to  believe that ICE should take efforts to better track and maintain reliable  overall detention cost information, including medical care expenditures.", "Off-site medical care process and costs. ICE has established  processes and uses an electronic system to manage off-site care  provided to detainees, and through this system, ICE maintains data on  requests for off-site medical care and approvals or denials of those  requests. ICE also uses a separate data system to maintain information  on costs for approved services. However, ICE\u2019s system for managing the  provision of off-site medical care does not provide ICE with the  information needed to identify and assess trends across the types of off- site care requested or approved over time or across facility types, and  ICE could better link data on approvals and amounts paid to improve ICE  oversight of the costs of providing off-site medical care to detainees. First,  with regard to ICE\u2019s system for managing off-site care provided to  detainees, IHSC officials utilize the Medical Payment Authorization  Request (MedPAR) system to approve or deny all individual detainee  visits to off-site medical providers. This basic process is used for all  detainees housed in all facility types. Figure 4 depicts the general process  by which an on-site facility provider requests off-site care from IHSC  approving officials.", "According to IHSC officials, the majority of requests for off-site medical  care are adjudicated by IHSC Field Medical Coordinators (FMC), who are  responsible for coordinating medical services for ICE detainees.  However, in some instances a higher level of review is needed, such as  for surgical procedures, and requests are adjudicated by an IHSC  Regional Clinical Director or Regional Dentist. ICE has developed and  issued various guidance documents related to the provision of off-site  medical care for detainees. For example, IHSC issued a July 2015  Operations Memorandum that outlines the MedPAR request process.  Moreover, the IHSC Detainee Covered Services guidance, issued in 2010  and under revision in fiscal year 2016, provides information about the  MedPAR process and states that ICE \u201cmust provide medically appropriate  treatment to ICE detainees who have identified any serious medical  needs.\u201d The guidance goes on to define \u201cserious medical need\u201d as a  condition that when left untreated could result in further significant injury  or unnecessary pain. According to IHSC data, from fiscal years 2012  through 2014, IHSC approved an average of about 45,000 MedPAR  requests per year for ICE detainees to receive off-site care or services.", "Although ICE uses the MedPAR system for recording requests for off-site  medical care and approval or denial of those requests, limitations in the  MedPAR system hinder ICE\u2019s ability to use data in the system for  identifying and assessing trends in off-site medical care for detainees,  including emergency care. Specifically, the MedPAR system does not  allow IHSC officials to search for or identify types of procedures or off-site  medical care visits that were requested, approved, or denied, which limits  ICE\u2019s ability to analyze trends across types of care and facilities and  make decisions about resource allocations for outside medical care.  Thus, IHSC officials have visibility over individual MedPAR requests, but  cannot sort or examine data by procedure or facility type. IHSC officials  noted that in response to specific information requests, they sometimes  manually search through MedPAR data, and acknowledged that more  systematic, regular analysis would be useful for decision-makers. For  example, a robust analysis of off-site care could better ensure that off-site  care requests are adjudicated consistently across ICE areas of  responsibility and facility types. This is important because MedPAR  approvals and denials are primarily based on the professional judgment  of the reviewer\u2014there is currently no specific written clinical guidance on  which to base approval decisions, according to IHSC officials. Although  approval decisions are made on a case-by-case basis and dependent on  the specific circumstances of the individual seeking care, representatives  from two immigration advocacy groups cited cases of surgical  procedures, such as hernia operations, being approved in some  instances but not in others, which they said was problematic.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government notes that  internal controls are an integral part of each system that management  uses to regulate and guide its operations. The standards also state that  control activities and communication of information are integral parts of an  entity\u2019s planning, implementing, review, and accountability for  stewardship of government resources and achieving effective results.  Furthermore, the standards state that control activities, which include a  wide range of diverse actions and maintenance of related records, need  to be clearly documented and help to ensure that all transactions are  completely and accurately recorded. Developing and implementing a  mechanism to identify and assess trends in off-site medical care  procedures across types of procedures and facilities would better position  ICE to oversee off-site medical care provided to detainees and help  ensure consistent decisions regarding such care are made.", "Second, with regard to the linking of data on off-site medical care  approvals with payments made to off-site providers, ICE detainee medical  claims and payments to outside providers are managed by the Veterans  Affairs Financial Services Center (VAFSC), but this system is not linked to  IHSC\u2019s MedPAR system, according to IHSC officials. The VA system  tracks monetary amounts for all payments to outside medical providers  for services rendered to detainees\u2014thus providing ICE with information  for these costs. According to IHSC officials, from fiscal years 2012  through 2014, approximately 93,000 claims per year were paid to off-site  providers for ICE detainee medical care. The total amount paid for this  time period was approximately $27 million per year, according to IHSC  officials. However, the number of claims paid for fiscal years 2012  through 2014 did not correspond to the number of IHSC MedPAR  authorizations, or approvals for requested services, for the same time  period. Overall, there were approximately 144,000 more claims paid in  VAFSC than approvals in MedPAR. Comparing figures for individual  facilities during this period, in some cases VAFSC claims exceeded  MedPAR approvals, and in some cases the MedPAR approvals were  greater than VA claims. For example, in fiscal year 2012, 2,187 MedPAR  requests were approved for detainees in a county jail facility and 63  claims were paid. At one IHSC-staffed facility, 326 MedPAR requests  were approved in fiscal year 2012, and 9,675 claims were paid. In  explaining these apparent discrepancies, IHSC officials noted differences  in provider billing practices and that some claims may not be paid in the  same fiscal year that they were authorized. Officials also stated that  multiple claims could be associated with individual authorizations. For  example, an emergency room visit may require one MedPAR approval,  but claims may be paid to multiple providers associated with the visit. We  acknowledge these reasons for different numbers of claims and  approvals; however, a mechanism to ensure that payments for off-site  care are supported by the appropriate authorizations could provide DHS  better assurance that the amount paid for claims corresponds to  authorized services. In addition, by not connecting the types and  frequency of authorized services with their actual costs, ICE is not well  positioned to analyze larger trends related to off-site care and make  resource allocation decisions.", "IHSC officials acknowledged that the MedPAR system does not enable  IHSC to track off-site care requests by procedure type, which could  provide useful information about the magnitude and types of services  needed across detention facilities and regions, and thus impact resource  decisions. IHSC officials also noted that ICE does not routinely audit or  systematically cross-check MedPAR authorizations and claims paid due  to data system limitations. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government notes that internal controls are an integral part of each  system that management uses to regulate and guide its operations, and  that communication of information and control activities are an integral  part of an entity\u2019s planning, implementing, review, and accountability for  stewardship of government resources and achieving effective results.  Furthermore, the standards state that control activities, which include a  wide range of diverse actions and maintenance of related records, need  to be clearly documented and help to ensure that all transactions are  completely and accurately recorded.

These inspections covered approximately  74 percent of over-72-hour facilities used by ICE and more than 99  percent of ADP in fiscal year 2015. In accordance with ICE policy, in  most cases, a contractor with CMD assesses the conditions in a facility by  inspecting a list of items that correspond with detention standards. The  contractor identifies deficiencies to monitor the facility\u2019s compliance with  an overall detention standard. For instance, a facility may be found  deficient for the line item requirement concerning the storage of medical  records, as seen in table 4 below, but still be found compliant with the  overall Medical Care standard.

Table 5 shows  each mechanism that ICE uses, including a description of required  frequency, where the mechanisms are used, and the type of oversight  conducted. For a more detailed description of each mechanism, including  recent results, see appendix IV.", "The use of these oversight mechanisms helps to ensure that more than  99 percent of the over-72-hour ADP is annually subject to at least two  forms of medical care oversight\u2014typically a detention standards  inspection and a medical inspection. Small facilities, those with an ADP of  fewer than 10 detainees, are to complete an annual Operational Review  Self-Assessment (ORSA), and FMCs may visit the facilities approximately  every six months for medical care inspections. The remaining adult and  family residential facilities also are to have periodic checklist inspections,  and IHSC staff are to conduct either FMC site visits or quality  improvement audits for medical care. DSMs assess compliance at larger  facilities in an effort to use their limited resources to oversee the  conditions of confinement for more detainees than they could at small  facilities, according to CMD officials. ODO prioritizes inspection sites  based on facility risk factors, such as number and type of allegations,  previous inspection deficiencies, and ADP, according to officials  Figure 5 shows the percentage of ADP covered by the various ICE  oversight mechanisms in fiscal year 2015 and how those mechanisms  overlapped. As seen in the figure, more than 99 percent of the fiscal year  2015 ADP was covered by two or more oversight mechanisms.  Approximately 65 percent of the ADP was covered by a detention  standards inspection, a medical care inspection, and a third mechanism,  either ODO inspection or DSM presence. An additional 22 percent of the  ADP was covered by four mechanisms\u2014detention standards inspection,  medical care inspection, ODO inspection, and DSM presence\u2014so that  approximately 87 percent of the ADP was covered by three or four  different oversight mechanisms during fiscal year 2015.", "ICE can gain a comprehensive view of the conditions of confinement at  individual facilities, including the provision of detainee medical care, by  examining the combined results of multiple oversight mechanisms,  according to CMD officials. For example, ODO inspectors use weekly  DSM reports to gain a situational awareness of facility conditions before  an inspection. Similarly, DSMs collaborate with FMCs at  intergovernmental service agreement facilities to resolve medical-related  issues because DSMs are not medical experts, and DSMs may review  FMC site visit results to better understand the medical care issues at a  facility. At IHSC-staffed facilities, DSMs collaborate with health service  administrators to resolve medical-related issues. When medical care  deficiencies are found through CMD or ODO inspections, action plans to  resolve those deficiencies are to be sent to IHSC to help ensure that the  action plan will sufficiently address the issue. In this way, IHSC may know  of the medical care deficiencies found through other oversight  mechanisms. Rather than using the results of oversight mechanisms in a  punitive manner, ICE offers facilities opportunities to resolve deficiencies  before the issuance of results or reports. For instance, inspectors at the  family residential facilities can offer technical guidance to facilities for on- the-spot corrections to deficiencies. Similarly, ODO is to share its  preliminary results with the facility at the conclusion of each inspection so  that corrections can be initiated before the issuance of the final report.  IHSC\u2019s quarterly quality improvement audits identify local issues at the  facility level, and IHSC can use the results to coach individual facilities  about ways to improve their medical care. In these ways, facilities can  resolve issues and improve the conditions of confinement for detainees in  a timely manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ICE Conducts Some Analysis of Oversight Data across Facilities, but Could Benefit from Expanded Analysis", "paragraphs": ["ICE collects medical care compliance data through its various oversight  mechanisms; however, ICE does not utilize this information in a way that  facilitates decision-making across all detention facilities. ODO and the  IHSC Medical Quality Management Unit both conduct analyses across  facilities to identify systemic issues or leading practices, but their  analyses do not cover all facilities. ODO inspects select facilities and  IHSC conducts quality improvement audits only in the 19 IHSC-staffed  facilities; these inspections and audits covered approximately 57 percent  of the ADP in fiscal year 2015. ODO provides ICE leadership with  narrative annual reports that describe trends in deficiencies and identify  leading practices that may assist in the decision-making process  regarding facilities. Decisions made using ODO reports could include  contractual issues, as well as additional training for ICE officers or facility  staff, according to ODO officials. ODO reports trends in deficiencies by  detention standards, by facility type, and over time. IHSC conducts  analyses of quality improvement audit results across the 19 IHSC-staffed  facilities in order to identify levels of low compliance among clinics. If  compliance rates fall below 90 percent across the 19 clinics, each clinic is  required to conduct a study about the issue. These studies help IHSC  determine whether a specific administrative process change or medical  care intervention could improve the quality of care at clinics.", "According to ICE officials, ICE uses its oversight mechanisms to help  obtain a more complete picture of compliance at individual facilities at a  given point in time, but ICE has not fully assessed the results of these  oversight mechanisms across facilities. For instance, FMC site visit  inspection results are stored and tracked, but FMCs\u2019 numerous  responsibilities limit their ability to perform overarching analyses of the  data, and the Medical Case Management Unit of IHSC, which manages  the FMC program, does not have the resources necessary to perform  additional analyses of the data, according to an IHSC official. The official  also noted that FMCs are more focused on resolving local, facility-specific  medical care issues than looking at issues across facilities. Similarly,  CMD officials stated that their priority has been to address issues at  individual facilities rather than to conduct analyses of data across  facilities. The officials acknowledged the benefit of conducting such  analyses, and stated that they planned to explore the possibility of doing  so in future inspection cycles but did not have any specific plans for  analysis.", "Moreover, ICE has not assessed ORSA and DSM compliance results  across facility types. Though small facilities began conducting annual  ORSAs in 2012, ICE has not used the information gathered to conduct an  analysis of results over time or across facilities. For example, unlike  inspection results for larger adult facilities, ORSA results are not stored in  a database, and staff members do not conduct additional analysis or  follow-up after a corrective action plan is completed for deficiencies,  according to CMD officials. That is, ORSA inspection worksheets are  scanned and stored electronically, but the format does not facilitate  tracking or analysis. Additionally, the ORSA form contains sections in  which the inspector can identify any repeat findings from previous years,  but CMD officials stated that they do not currently track any repeat  findings noted on ORSA forms. CMD officials did not provide specific  plans to improve the tracking of ORSA results. Similarly, CMD officials  noted that DSMs had difficulty documenting their daily oversight  interactions with facility staff because they happen so frequently, though  efforts to do so began in fiscal year 2016. Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government calls for the assessment of agency  performance over time, but without tracking the results of its oversight,  ICE cannot conduct analyses of information over time or across  facilities. Without such analysis, ICE management is not well-positioned  to assess the medical care performance of facilities over time, by  contracted standards, or by facility type; thereby, limiting ICE\u2019s ability to  plan and manage overarching changes to detainee medical care.  Expanding analysis of oversight data across facilities would strengthen  ICE\u2019s ability to manage and oversee the provision of medical care across  facility types."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Headquarter Offices and ICE Detention Facilities Have Various Processes to Obtain and Address Medical Care Complaints; However, DHS Has Limited Oversight over the Universe of Complaints", "paragraphs": ["DHS provides detainees with multiple avenues for filing medical care  complaints related to immigration detention. First, detainees can file  complaints directly at immigration detention facilities. ICE detention  standards call for detention facilities to have both informal and formal  processes for obtaining and addressing detainee complaints and for  complaints to be addressed at the lowest level possible. ICE and facility  officials we spoke with told us that detainees are informed of the  complaint processes through detainee handbooks and orientation  sessions. In addition, ICE Detention and Reporting Information Line  (DRIL) helpline and OIG hotline information posters provide contact  information for reporting concerns. ICE detention standards and guidance  call for informal resolution of detainee complaints through oral  communication with ICE facility or contractor staff or medical personnel  as appropriate. ICE detention standards further state that detainees may  be able to more expediently resolve complaints through informal  procedures. Unlike formal complaints, informal complaints do not require  detainees be provided a written response, as they are typically resolved  immediately; if not satisfied with an informal response, detainees can  submit formal, written complaints to facility officials. ICE detention  standards call for facilities to maintain grievance logs to document  complaints filed and their resolution\u2014both formal and informal\u2014and  inspectors are to review these grievance logs during facility inspections.", "CMD and ODO help oversee the complaint processes at the facility level  by conducting inspections and determining whether processes are in  place and functioning as intended. Our analysis of CMD inspection data  showed that during fiscal years 2011 through 2014, approximately 12  percent of CMD over-72-hour facility inspections (58 of 496) identified 76  detainee grievance standard deficiencies. However, in fiscal year 2014,  two detainee grievance standard deficiencies were noted in the 96  inspections conducted. In addition, of the 32 inspections conducted by  ODO during fiscal year 2014, 22 facilities had a total of 48 grievance  standard deficiencies. In calendar year 2014, 31 over-72-hour facilities  completed ORSA inspections, which resulted in two detainee grievance  standard deficiencies reported at two ORSA facilities. Similar to medical  standard deficiencies, grievance standard deficiencies found through  CMD and ODO inspections may go through a corrective action plan  process to help insure that deficiencies are corrected.", "Second, detainees can file complaints through various DHS entities  including CRCL, JIC, the OIG hotline, and the DRIL helpline. Complaints  can be submitted by phone, e-mail, mail, or fax. Each DHS entity has a  different focus and process for obtaining and addressing the complaints.  For example, the OIG\u2019s responsibility is to investigate DHS employee and  contractor misconduct, including civil rights abuses, while the DRIL  helpline\u2019s focus is on addressing immigration detention related questions  and concerns, including conditions of confinement. According to DHS  officials, complaints can be reported through any of these entities, and the  same complaint can be reported through the various options. Medical  complaints obtained by each DHS entity in fiscal year 2014 ranged from  about 100 by CRCL to approximately 550 by OIG. Examples of  complaints obtained by the different entities include medical treatment not  timely; request for medical care refused; scheduled for but not taken to  doctor visit; and inadequate dental care, among others. Table 6 shows  the different DHS entities through which detainees and others can file  complaints, including their primary focus, process for obtaining and  addressing complaints, and medical complaints obtained and addressed  in fiscal year 2014.", "As shown in figure 6, various DHS entities obtain complaints, and IHSC  ultimately receives and is responsible for addressing medical complaints  obtained by those entities. DRIL sends medical-care-related complaints it  obtains to field deportation officers and the officers forward the complaints  to IHSC to be addressed. CRCL, JIC, and Hotline complaints declined for  review by OIG are forwarded to IHSC through other ICE units. CRCL  forwards medical-care-related immigration detention complaints to ICE\u2019s  Office of Diversity and Civil Rights for vetting, which assigns a tier level to  help prioritize complaints by level of urgency\u2014from emergent (Tier 1) to  important but less urgent (Tier 3). JIC, and Hotline complaints involving  ICE that are passed through JIC, are sent to ERO\u2019s Administrative Inquiry  Unit. This unit vets and submits medical-care-related complaints to IHSC  for review and resolution.", "CRCL, DRIL, and JIC maintain complaint data in their respective data  systems; however the data, in most cases, is not tracked or analyzed for  trending purposes. Only CRCL is required to review and report on the  number of complaints it receives and their disposition. For example,  CRCL tracks data in its data management system and can report on the  number of complaints it obtains, including medical care complaints related  to immigration detention. DRIL and JIC maintain their data in a  SharePoint System and automated case management system,  respectively. Both can determine the number of medical complaints  received and forwarded to IHSC for resolution. A JIC official told us that  the system is not designed for trend analysis. While the DRIL system can  be used to perform trend analysis, ICE officials do not currently use DRIL  to analyze medical care complaints because these complaints represent  a small number of the total DRIL complaints received each year. OIG\u2019s  database includes CRCL and JIC complaints that are passed through  OIG for a determination of whether or not to investigate. Consequently,  OIG\u2019s database contains numerous complaints, including medical-related  complaints. The OIG database, however, is essentially a repository of  data and is not designed for tracking medical care related complaints.  Further, it would be difficult to readily identify medical complaints from  among all the types of complaints OIG receives because, according to  OIG officials, complaint descriptions are captured in narrative format. To  identify possible medical complaints, a key word search of the complaint  narratives\u2019 medical related terms would be needed. Such searches are  typically done on request by officials. While OIG maintains a database  that collects complaint data, according to OIG officials it is difficult to use  the database for determining the volume of medical complaints and  conducting analysis of complaint data.", "According to IHSC officials, IHSC employs a tasking system to document  receipt of medical care related immigration complaints obtained from  other entities and the tasking of those complaints to IHSC personnel for  review and resolution. IHSC officials stated that, by practice, these  entities that receive complaints\u2014DHS OIG, JIC, and CRCL\u2014do not send  complaints directly to IHSC, but notify IHSC, through ERO or another ICE  entity, of medical care-related immigration complaints. IHSC maintains  records of these notifications in an IHSC tasking e-mail inbox, and the  notifications are saved in specific folders. IHSC officials told us that all  complaints received are processed through this tasking system. IHSC  officials also told us that in fiscal year 2014, their tasking system included  CRCL and JIC complaints, but not DRIL complaints; however, in fiscal  year 2015, IHSC began including DRIL complaints in the tasking  process.", "As the entity ultimately responsible for addressing medical-care-related  complaints, IHSC officials acknowledged the need to have a more robust  task management system and to maintain more comprehensive data on  complaints. IHSC officials also told us that in cases when a count of  complaints received is needed, IHSC tasking staff transfer the  notifications maintained in the e-mail folders located in the tasking  mailbox to an Excel spreadsheet and generate a count or list of the  complaints. While IHSC officials can generate a count of complaints, they  told us it is very cumbersome to review all message notifications to  generate such counts. IHSC officials told us that this process for  maintaining data on medical-care-related complaints is not  comprehensive. They further told us that they are uncertain how many  complaints come from different sources, such as NGOs, attorneys,  detainees, and others, without going through complaint message  notifications to determine the sources.", "IHSC officials acknowledged that having the ability to identify information  such as complaint volume and source, among other complaint  information, would be useful for conducting various analyses. ERO and  IHSC officials informed us they plan to have a new tasking system in  place in 2016 and expect the new system will allow IHSC to monitor  tasks, such as addressing CRCL, DRIL, and JIC complaints, and maintain  a history of IHSC responses to the tasks. Further, they told us that the  task management system intends to help streamline, centralize, and  organize the current tasking system, including complaint resolution. IHSC  officials provided us with a draft operations memorandum that discusses  the planned system. Specifically, the draft memorandum lays out policies  and procedures for receiving, initiating, and responding to tasks\u2014from  task origination to task closure. The memorandum also states that  maintaining tasks in the new system would allow IHSC management to  monitor compliance with tasking due dates, have visibility over tasking  workloads, and provide the ability to obtain task status reports. The  system is currently being piloted in an ICE ERO area of responsibility and  a guide for system use is being developed.", "While changes to IHSC\u2019s current tasking process should provide greater  tasking management capabilities, including keeping track of its complete  tasking workload, the operations memorandum for the new management  system has not been finalized, a user guide is still in development, and  the pilot program is underway. It is therefore too early to tell the extent to  which this task management system will provide all of the desired tasking  capabilities. The draft memorandum also does not specify whether all  complaints obtained by IHSC will be included in the new tasking system,  such as those that do not require action by IHSC. Further, it does not  state whether a comprehensive set of complaint data will be  systematically captured in the system, such as volume of complaints  obtained and addressed, sources of complaints, and facilities where  complaints originate. This information could enable ICE to conduct broad  analyses of medical care complaints and potentially inform operational  decision making. However, the draft memorandum and IHSC officials did  not indicate that data in the new task management system would be used  for such analyses. Rather, the planned task system would function  primarily as a tool for assigning and monitoring the progress of internally  generated tasks, including medical complaints requiring IHSC action.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for there to  be procedures in place to monitor performance of regular operations over  time and that there be clearly defined roles and responsibilities for  carrying out operating activities as well as effective communication within  and across agencies to help ensure appropriate decisions are made.

While DHS provides various avenues for detainees to file  complaints, DHS does not have a mechanism to readily determine the  overall volume of complaints it receives, their status, or outcome.  Developing a system that would allow IHSC to have data readily available  to conduct trend analyses, including analysis of complaint volume,  facilities where complaints are filed, and differences across facility type,  and one that can monitor IHSC responses, and amount of time to resolve  complaints, could be useful for management decision making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Ensuring that the tens of thousands of men, women, and children that are  held in ICE detention facilities are provided with appropriate and timely  medical care is an important responsibility of ICE. Because of this  importance, DHS and ICE have implemented multiple levels of oversight  as well as mechanisms for detainees and others to report medical  grievances. In addition, ICE has established processes to provide  detainees with medical treatment outside the detention facilities, such as  in cases of emergencies or when specialty treatment is needed.  Regarding these areas\u2014off-site medical care, oversight mechanisms,  and complaint mechanisms\u2014ICE collects data and other information.  However, ICE does not systematically utilize these data to analyze larger  trends. For example, ICE has a data system that allows officials to review  and approve requests for off-site care, but the system does not allow  officials to track the number of requests and approvals or denials by  procedure type. Furthermore, the authorizations for off-site care in this  data system are not fully linked to claims paid to off-site providers. In  terms of oversight, ICE uses seven different mechanisms that employ a  variety of techniques to help ensure medical policies are followed and  detention standards are met. Although these different mechanisms are  effective for addressing specific medical issues at individual facilities, ICE  does not systematically connect and use oversight results to examine any  overarching medical issues over time and across all facilities. Similarly,  there are multiple avenues for detainees or others to file medical  complaints, such as toll-free telephone hotlines or formal written  complaints, and all medical complaints eventually are received by IHSC  for resolution. However, IHSC has limited oversight and tracking  capability over the universe of complaints, making it difficult for DHS to  analyze trends in medical care complaints and assess the extent to which  changes to medical care may be needed across facilities.

We visited a purposive,  non-generalizable sample of 12 detention facilities in Arizona, California,  Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, Texas, and Wisconsin. We selected these  facilities to reflect a range of several factors, including facility type,  detention standards governing the facility, the ICE Field Office Area of  Responsibility, average daily population (ADP) of detainees, and  recommendations made by DHS and organizations that work with  immigration detainees. Data regarding facility type, detention standards,  and ADP were obtained from ICE. To determine the reliability of these  data, we reviewed ICE documentation and interviewed agency officials  about the data systems, and determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes. For our site visits, we selected detention  facilities in five Areas of Responsibility (AOR) that provided diversity  across facility types, standards in use, and ADP. We interviewed ICE  Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) field office officials, ICE  Health Service Corps (IHSC) Field Medical Coordinators (FMC), facility  administrators, medical personnel, and detainees about medical care at  facilities. We interviewed a non-generalizable sample of 120 detainees to  determine their perception of medical care at each facility and their  knowledge of filing medical care grievances, among other things. We  randomly selected detainees to interview at each of the 12 facilities, and  we interviewed between 6 and 12 detainees per visit depending on the  time allotted for interviews. Since detainees speak various languages,  and not all are proficient in English, we interviewed detainees in both  English and Spanish, and we used a translation service for interviews  conducted in other languages, such as Punjabi or Burmese. We also  observed facilities\u2019 practices regarding medical care and grievance  systems, such as the posting of required DHS hotline information, the  placement of grievance boxes, and the layout of medical care areas. The  information we obtained from our facility visits cannot be generalized to all  facilities or detainees, but offers insight into the operational settings at  facilities, such as how medical care standards are applied and assessed  and the management of medical care grievance processes. Prior to each  site visit, we spoke with at least one local or non-governmental  organization in each ICE Field Office Area of Responsibility to understand  their impressions of detainee medical care at each facility that we visited.  We identified these organizations through recommendations provided by  two national organizations\u2014the American Civil Liberties Union and the  National Immigrant Justice Center.

In  addition, we interviewed relevant ICE headquarters and regional officials,  as well as ICE and detention facility officials associated with visits to 12  facilities about the processes of providing medical care. To determine the  extent to which DHS maintains information on the costs associated with  medical care, we reviewed information about authorizations and  payments for off-site care for over-72-hour facilities operating in fiscal  years 2012 through 2014. To determine the reliability of medical claims  and expenditure data, we reviewed documentation and a prior GAO  report, and interviewed agency officials.

We interviewed a non-generalizable sample of  120 detainees to determine their perception of medical care at each  facility and their knowledge of filing medical care complaints, among other  things. We randomly selected detainees to interview at each of the 12  facilities, and we interviewed between 6 and 12 detainees per visit  depending on the time allotted for interviews. Detainees spoke various  languages, and some detainees were not proficient in English. We  interviewed detainees in both English and Spanish, and we used a  translation service for interviews conducted in other languages, such as  Punjabi and Burmese. We did not require each detainee to answer every  question during the interviews. We did not verify detainees\u2019 claims  following interviews. For instance, we did not conduct reviews of  detainees\u2019 medical files to determine whether they had received medical  screenings upon arrival at a facility.
