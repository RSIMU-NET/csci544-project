Of State's contribution of approximately $193 million, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) estimated that about $187 million was provided for its education assistance. State provided the remaining approximately $6 million for non-UNRWA education projects. UNRWA purchased English language textbooks used in UNRWA schools with funds that consist of contributions from donor countries, including the United States. The U.S. government and UNRWA did not fund textbooks published by the Palestinian Authority because the Palestinian Authority provided these textbooks free of charge, according to agency officials.", "UNRWA and State have taken steps to identify and address potentially problematic content of textbooks used in UNRWA schools, such as maps that exclude Israel. UNRWA reviewed textbooks, including English language textbooks, and took actions to address content it deemed as not aligned with UN values. For example, UNRWA created complementary teaching materials, such as alternate photos, examples, and guidance for teachers to use with the textbooks in UNRWA schools. However, due to financial shortfalls and other constraints, UNRWA officials told GAO that UNRWA did not train teachers or distribute the complementary teaching materials to classrooms. As a result, these materials were not used in UNRWA classrooms. To address textbook content deemed problematic, State examined nongovernmental organizations' studies, encouraged Palestinian Authority officials to address the issue, and monitored UNRWA's efforts.", "The annual appropriations acts for fiscal years 2015 through 2017 require State to report to Congress on several topics, including steps UNRWA has taken to ensure that the content of all educational materials taught in UNRWA schools is consistent with the values of human rights, dignity, and tolerance, and do not induce incitement. Although State submitted its required reports to Congress on time, State included inaccurate information in the 2017 report and omitted potentially useful information in all three reports. In its 2017 report, State noted incorrectly that UNRWA had completed training teachers and distributed complementary teaching materials to address textbook content that UNRWA deemed as not complying with UN values. In all three of the reports, State omitted information concerning whether UNRWA found that any educational materials used in its schools do not comply with two of four elements, dignity and not inducing incitement. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should use quality information to achieve the entity's objectives and communicate it in a way that is useful to users.

We then examined how  UNRWA and State have implemented their policies and procedures. We  reviewed State\u2019s cables and agencies\u2019 policy documents and reports and  met with officials from State, UNRWA, and USAID in Washington, D.C.,  and overseas.

State contributes funds to and manages the institutional  relationship with UNRWA on behalf of the U.S. government, while  recognizing UNRWA\u2019s independence and commitment to upholding  humanitarian principles, including neutrality. This relationship is guided  by the U.S.-UNRWA Framework for Cooperation, annually negotiated  between State/PRM and UNRWA.

The Palestinian Authority developed its first curriculum in the  mid-1990s in cooperation with the United Nations Educational, Scientific  and Cultural Organization. Since then, the Palestinian Authority has  developed multi-year strategies to improve its educational system,  including by modernizing its curriculum and improving its textbooks. The  Palestinian Authority worked to implement its early strategies but could  not fully do so because responding to other events took priority, according  to Palestinian Authority documents. These events included the second  Palestinian Intifada (uprising) that began in 2000, the government of  Israel\u2019s subsequent tightening of security, the rise of Hamas to power in  the Palestinian government in 2006, and the resulting delays in donor  funding. After donors resumed their support, the Palestinian Authority  developed an education strategy for 2008 through 2012. This strategy\u2019s  stated goals include improving the quality of education by reviewing the  curriculum and revising textbooks, among other things. Beginning in 2013  the Palestinian Authority undertook a multi-year effort to revise its  curriculum and issue new textbooks to provide students with skills such  as problem solving and analysis. As a result, the Palestinian Authority  Ministry of Education and Higher Education issued new pilot textbooks for  grades 1 through 4 in 2016 and 2017. The Palestinian Authority issued  textbooks for the first semester of these grades in summer 2016 and  textbooks for the second semester later in the year with the start of that  semester.

UNRWA also developed training guides and presentations to support  training on the complementary teaching materials for each of the reviews.  According to UNRWA, it developed these materials to ensure that the  lessons taught in UNRWA schools adhere to UN core values, such as  neutrality.

However, UNRWA officials told  us that UNRWA was not able to deliver the training for school staff,  including principals or teachers, or disseminate these materials to  classrooms before the end of the first semester of the 2016-2017 school  year. They noted that this was due to collective employment actions  between August 2016 and January 2017, including staff walkouts and a  refusal to attend training and workshops, that were unrelated to the  curriculum reform and having to complete the school exam period  immediately following the resolution of these collective employment  actions.", "For similar reasons, UNRWA was unable to distribute materials or train  teachers after the second rapid review of pilot textbooks for the second  semester of the 2016-2017 school year.

However, UNRWA officials told us that UNRWA halted the  training following a Palestinian Authority announcement of suspension of  ties with UNRWA in response to UNRWA\u2019s use of complementary  teaching materials, and the UNRWA staff union reactions.

In addition, UNRWA officials reported sharing the complementary teaching materials  in PDF format with field education staff in the West Bank and Gaza for  distribution to all teachers. However, in commenting on a draft report,  UNRWA officials told us in April 2018 that they did not disseminate the  training or the complementary teaching materials for the third rapid review  for various reasons. For example, some UNRWA staff opposed the use of  these materials in classrooms while other staff boycotted the training. In  addition, UNRWA faced deteriorating operational and political  environments during that time period, such as financial shortfalls, as  well as an increased number of violent confrontations between  Palestinians and Israeli Security forces in the West Bank and Gaza.

We  examined actual funding where it was available and estimated funding  where it was not. We obtained and analyzed financial data from State and  USAID and expenditure data from UNRWA for education assistance to  the West Bank and Gaza in fiscal years 2015 through 2017. We used  these data to describe how much and for what types of activities State  contributed funds to UNRWA. We also obtained and analyzed  expenditure and contributions data from State and obligations data from  USAID to describe non-UNRWA education programs that they  administered in the West Bank and Gaza. We reported the amount of  funds UNRWA expended in general on education in the West Bank and  Gaza, including the amounts that UNRWA expended on educational  materials and specifically on textbooks. We define educational materials  to primarily include curriculum, textbooks, select videos and web-based  tools, and any complementary teaching materials, including those  developed by UNRWA that aim to supplement, replace, or mitigate  materials that UNRWA deems not aligned with UN values. We exclude  posters, library books, educational technology, education administration  materials, extracurricular materials, handouts and worksheets, and  teacher training materials, with limited exceptions, from materials  produced by UNRWA and used to mitigate material that UNRWA deemed  not aligned with UN values or to supplement the curriculum. According to  UNRWA officials, the financial information they provided pertains to  educational materials, including textbooks, complementary teaching  materials, and costs related to an interactive learning portal in Gaza and  UNRWA TV. Finally, we reported the amount of funds USAID obligated  for education programs in the West Bank and Gaza during this timeframe.", "To analyze these data, we reviewed State-UNRWA contribution  agreements, State reports on UNRWA emergency appeals expenditures,  and USAID award documents. We examined the two types of funding that  State contributed to UNRWA\u2014program budget funding and emergency  appeals. We also examined the three ways in which UNRWA expends  that funding\u2014through program budget expenditures, emergency appeals  expenditures, and special project expenditures. We supplemented these  data by interviewing State, UNRWA, and USAID officials about funding.  While the majority of UNRWA data are actual expenditures, some  UNRWA data are estimates. According to UNRWA officials, they  estimated all UNRWA expenditure data for fiscal year 2017 because, as  of December 2017, when we finished collecting data, UNRWA\u2019s 2017  fiscal year was ongoing. In addition, UNRWA estimated its education  expenditures provided by the United States because U.S. contributions to  UNRWA are generally not earmarked. Rather, UNRWA\u2019s core budget, its  program budget, pools funding from all UNRWA donors. For this reason,  we reported all UNRWA expenditure data on education assistance based  on information UNRWA officials provided us. To make these estimates,  UNRWA officials informed us that they calculated U.S. funding as a  proportion of all UNRWA funding, and applied that proportion to their  educational expenditures. Data on State\u2019s contributions to UNRWA and  USAID\u2019s funding to education programs in the West Bank and Gaza  active between fiscal years 2015 and 2017 are obligations; according to  State, all funds disbursed to UNRWA were through contributions.

In addition, State and USAID awarded several  grants for additional years not included in our scope. For example, the  USAID\u2019s first obligation to the Leadership and Teacher Development  program occurred in fiscal year 2011 and the latest obligation to that  program occurred in fiscal year 2017. As a result, the data presented in  this report may include additional contributions of funds beyond what  State and USAID obligated for fiscal years 2015 through 2017.", "To determine the reliability of the obligations and expenditure data, we  requested information from State, UNRWA, and USAID officials regarding  the processes they used to collect and verify data, and we checked the  data for reasonableness and completeness. When we found  discrepancies or missing data fields, we worked with relevant agency  officials to correct the discrepancies and missing fields. We compared  State\u2019s contribution data with UNRWA\u2019s expenditure data to ensure  consistency. We discussed UNRWA\u2019s financial data for educational  expenditures with knowledgeable officials, reviewed audited financial  statements for confirmation, and reviewed vouchers they  provided. However, we did not independently audit their financial  data. To ensure completeness of the data, we reviewed initial grant  documents or contribution agreements and all associated amendments  for the (1) six education projects USAID funded in the West Bank and  Gaza, and (2) annual UNRWA contributions State made between fiscal  years 2015 and 2017. We discussed UNRWA\u2019s procedures for estimating  the proportion of U.S. funds that went to educational expenditures with  knowledgeable officials. Based on our initial assessments of the data, we  determined that the State and USAID funding data we collected were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. In addition, we  determined that the actual expenditure data we collected from UNRWA  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes, and that the estimated  expenditures it provided were reasonable for the purposes of this review.  (To examine how UNRWA and State have identified and addressed  potentially problematic content in educational materials used by schools  in the West Bank and Gaza, we reviewed the policies and procedures  that UNRWA and State have established and implemented. We focused  on actions agencies took in response to the (1) pilot textbooks for grades  1 through 4 that the Palestinian Authority issued in 2016 and that  UNRWA used during the 2016-2017 school year; (2) final textbooks for  grades 1 through 4, and pilot textbooks for grades 5 through 10 the  Palestinian Authority issued in in 2017 and used during the first semester  of the 2017-2018 school year; and (3) English language textbooks that  UNRWA and the Palestinian Authority purchased for grades 1 through 10  published in 2011 through 2014 and used during the 2017-2018 school  year. According to UNRWA officials, these textbooks do not include the  second semester Palestinian Authority textbooks for the 2017-2018  school year (released in late 2017) and the second semester English  language textbooks, and therefore do not cover all the textbooks used in  UNRWA and Palestinian Authority schools for grades 1 through 10. We  examined how UNRWA and State have implemented their policies and  procedures. We reviewed State\u2019s cables and agencies\u2019 policy documents  and reports and met with officials from State, UNRWA, and USAID in  Washington, D.C., and overseas. In addition, we interviewed international  donors overseas and officials from the government of Israel, the  Palestinian Authority, and Jerusalem municipality. We only interviewed  official government entities and public international organizations and did  not meet with non-governmental interest groups. We followed up with  relevant officials on multiple occasions to assess the progress of textbook  review and the status of implementation of other policies and procedures.", "We interviewed UNRWA officials about the methods they used to conduct  the rapid reviews of textbook content and reviewed documents they  provided that outline their procedures. While the methods and procedures  described seemed generally reasonable, we did not independently review  UNWRA\u2019s underlying documents to fully assess the reliability of the rapid  review results it reported because UNRWA is an international  organization. Moreover, it was beyond the scope of our review to examine  the underlying documents and textbooks themselves, most of which are  written in Arabic. There can be a number of challenges to analyzing and  coding content as UNRWA did in its rapid reviews, such as the need for  those performing the review to exercise judgment, and while the overall  process officials outlined generally appeared reasonable, we cannot  comment on the extent to which it successfully overcame all of the  potential challenges. We are presenting the results of the textbook  reviews, attributed to UNRWA, to help support our finding that the agency  has developed procedures to review textbooks, and that it found some  concerns in its recent reviews. In addition, we are providing details about  these reviews for context because the State Department summarized the  results of the first two reviews in its May 2017 report to Congress, which  we discuss in the third section of this report. This report is a public version  of a classified report that we issued in April 2018. The Department of  State deemed some of the information in our April 2018 report to be  classified, which must be protected from loss, compromise, or inadvertent  disclosure. Therefore, this report omits classified information about  neutrality/bias, gender issues, and other textbook content identified in  English language textbooks by UNRWA as not aligned with UN values.  Although the information provided in this report is more limited, the report  addresses the same objectives as the classified report and uses the  same methodology.", "To examine whether State has submitted required annual reports to  congressional committees, including information on whether UNRWA is  taking steps to ensure that the content of all educational materials  currently taught is consistent with the UN values of human rights, dignity,  and tolerance, and do not induce incitement, we took the following steps.  We reviewed the legal requirements for State to report on the steps  UNRWA is taking to ensure that the content of all educational materials  currently taught is consistent with the UN values. These requirements are  found in the annual appropriations acts; for fiscal year 2017, the  requirement is located in Section 7048(d)(5) of the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2017. We reviewed State\u2019s reports to Congress in  2015, 2016, and 2017, and compared data State reported regarding  education assistance with data we gathered through meetings with State  and UNRWA officials in in Washington, D.C., and overseas. We also  reviewed UNRWA documents.", "The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted  from January 2017 to April 2018 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We  subsequently worked with State from February 2019 to June 2019 to  prepare this unclassified version of the original classified report for public  release. This public version was also prepared in accordance with these  standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Overview of UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East\u2019s (UNRWA) Curriculum Framework Review and Rapid Review Processes", "paragraphs": ["UNRWA\u2019s Framework for Analysis and Quality Implementation of the  Curriculum (Curriculum Framework) provides the overarching structure  for the review and enrichment of educational materials used in UNRWA  schools in all of its fields of operation, including the West Bank and Gaza.  The Curriculum Framework, developed as part of UNRWA\u2019s education  reform process, aims to ensure that the curricula taught in its schools  support the development of skills and competencies that are considered  important for individual development in the 21st century.
