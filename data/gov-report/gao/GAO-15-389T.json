These issues impede Indian Affairs' ability to effectively track and address school facility problems. While national information is limited, GAO's ongoing work has found that BIE schools in three states faced a variety of facility-related challenges, including problems with the quality of new construction, limited funding, remote locations, and aging buildings and infrastructure (see figure below).", "GAO's ongoing work also indicates that several key challenges at Indian Affairs are impeding effective management of school facilities. Specifically, GAO found declines in staffing levels and gaps in technical expertise among facility personnel in Indian Affairs. Further, GAO found that Indian Affairs did not provide consistent oversight of some school construction projects. At a school GAO visited, Indian Affairs managed a $3.5 million project to replace school roofs. Yet the replacement roofs have leaked since they were installed in 2010, causing mold and ceiling damage in classrooms. Indian Affairs has monitored this situation but has not addressed problems with the roofs. Indian Affairs' facility management is also hindered by poor communication with schools and tribes and confusion about whom to contact to address facility problems. Poor communication has led to some school facility needs not being met. For example, school officials submitted a request for funding to address their school's lack of hot water almost a year before GAO visited the school, but Indian Affairs facility officials were unaware of this until notified by GAO. GAO's preliminary results indicate that these persistent challenges diminish Indian Affairs' capability to oversee and support facilities and provide technical assistance to schools.

Of these 185 schools, about two-thirds are operated by tribes  (tribally-operated), primarily through federal grants, and about one-third  are operated directly by BIE (BIE-operated). In 2014, Interior\u2019s Office of  the Assistant Secretary-Indian Affairs (Indian Affairs) funded the  operations, maintenance, construction, and repair of about 1,785 school  buildings, worth an estimated $4.2 billion. Recent reports have raised  concerns about the physical condition of these school facilities and the  effect these conditions may have on the educational outcomes of Indian  students who attend them. Furthermore, our 2009 review of several  research studies found that better school facilities are generally  associated with better student outcomes. In other work, we have  reported that students in BIE schools perform consistently below Indian  students in public schools on national and state assessments. In  addition, these students have relatively low high school graduation rates  and experience higher levels of poverty than non-Indian students.

We  also interviewed officials in Indian Affairs, including the Office of the  Deputy Assistant Secretary for Management, and in the Bureaus of Indian  Education and Indian Affairs. Our work was supported by a licensed  engineer, having relevant, related experience in federal facilities  construction and management. In addition, we conducted site visits,  accompanied by the engineer, to 12 BIE-operated and tribally-operated  schools in three states: New Mexico, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.  These locations were selected to reflect a mix of BIE-operated and  tribally-operated schools, geographic diversity, and variations in school  facility conditions. Our site visits were not designed as independent  facility inspections. We plan to conduct an additional site visit in the spring  of this year to complete our work. We will issue a final report later this  year that will provide our complete results on the conditions of BIE school  facilities as well as Indian Affairs\u2019 accountability for school construction  and repair.

Some line offices have their own facility managers, and many schools\u2014both BIE-operated and  tribally operated\u2014also have their own facility managers or other staff  who perform routine maintenance and repairs.", "Indian Affairs collects and tracks school condition data related to facility  deficiencies, capital improvements, or construction for specific inventory  items, such as classrooms, sidewalks, or utility systems. It also includes  information on school facility repair needs\u2014commonly referred to as the  facilities deferred maintenance backlog\u2014which are entered into an  automated information system known as the Facilities Management  Information System (FMIS). Responsibility for data entry into FMIS is  shared by Indian Affairs staff, school personnel, and an Indian Affairs\u2019  contractor who conducts inspections of school facilities.", "Indian Affairs uses a multilevel review process to examine the accuracy  and completeness of backlog information in FMIS. In this process, each  entry that school facility managers propose to add to the backlog list is  reviewed and approved by several levels within Indian Affairs, including  BIA agencies and regional offices, the Indian Affairs\u2019 facility condition  assessment contractor, and with final approval by the Division of Facilities  Management and Construction. Indian Affairs uses approved backlog  information to make funding decisions regarding school facilities. Backlog  repair projects are prioritized based on health and safety risks, among  other factors. Indian Affairs also has various funding categories, including  emergencies and minor improvements. Once funding for school  construction and repair is approved, Indian Affairs offers three main  project management options. Tribes and/or schools may choose to (1)  have Indian Affairs manage the project, (2) manage the project based on  a contract received from Indian Affairs, or (3) in the case of tribally- operated schools, manage the project based on a grant received from  Indian Affairs.", "Over the past four decades, we have conducted a body of work on  challenges related to Indian education, including longstanding issues  regarding Indian Affairs\u2019 management of school facilities. Our work on BIE  school facilities conducted in 1997 and 2003 highlighted the poor  conditions of Indian schools and the need for more reliable national data  to assess the condition of school facilities. Interior\u2019s Inspector General  and others have also reported similar issues, including health and safety  hazards at BIE schools."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Indian Affairs Does Not Effectively Track School Conditions, and Persistent Challenges Affect Facilities at Selected Schools Indian Affairs\u2019 Information on School Conditions Continues to Be Incomplete or Inaccurate, Which Reduces Its Effectiveness in Identifying Problems and Targeting Limited Funds", "paragraphs": ["Our past work and other research pointed to a variety of persistent  challenges Indian Affairs has encountered in maintaining complete and  accurate data on the condition of BIE school facilities. For example, in  2003 we reported on inaccurate and incomplete data entry by school  officials, ineffective agency guidance, limited training in using FMIS, and  agency staff not being held accountable for ensuring data integrity.  Similarly, in 2011, the No Child Left Behind School Facilities and  Construction Negotiated Rulemaking Committee, which the Secretary of  the Interior was required to establish under the No Child Left Behind Act  of 2001 (NCLBA), also identified problems with the quality of FMIS data  on BIE school facilities.of school-level expertise in using FMIS, inadequate training, unreliable  access to FMIS, and infrequent data validation of deficiencies by Indian  Affairs\u2019 contractor, among other issues. Further, the Committee reported  that no Indian Affairs staff were tasked with monitoring schools\u2019 use of  FMIS to ensure that school officials were entering backlog items and, if  not, to provide them with technical assistance. As a result, the Committee  reported that problems using FMIS at many BIE schools were unresolved,  schools did not know where to turn for assistance, and data entry across  schools was inconsistent.", "The Committee attributed the problems to a lack  Our ongoing work suggests that issues with the quality of data on school  conditions\u2014such as inconsistent data entry by schools and insufficient  quality controls\u2014continues to make it difficult to determine the actual  number of schools in poor condition, which impedes Indian Affairs\u2019 ability  to effectively track and address school facility problems. For example,  while Indian Affairs has a multilevel review process for examining the  accuracy and completeness of backlog entries, we found that it does not  routinely monitor whether schools are entering complete data on their  facilities. For instance, an Indian Affairs internal control review of FMIS in  2010 identified inadequate controls for determining if and when all  identified safety deficiencies are addressed by schools because no Indian  Affairs office takes responsibility to ensure that such deficiencies are  addressed by schools. According to the 2010 review, without this  information Indian Affairs cannot identify and prioritize for funding for  these critical deficiencies. Indian Affairs officials told us that this issue  continues to be a significant challenge to FMIS data quality. We also  found that some schools we visited encountered obstacles to data entry.  For example, officials at one BIE-operated school noted that they did not  routinely enter information into FMIS because staff lacked expertise and  Indian Affairs did not provide them adequate training. As a result, they  said existing information on their facilities in FMIS significantly  understates their actual repair needs. According to a BIA regional officer,  frequent turnover among facility staff, especially at tribally-operated  schools, can exacerbate this gap in FMIS expertise. Schools can also  face difficulties gaining or maintaining access to FMIS. For example,  officials with one tribally operated school told us they encountered  persistent problems with connecting and maintaining access to FMIS,  sometimes limiting their use of the system to about 5 minutes at a time.  Interior\u2019s Inspector General has recently found similar challenges with  data entry at several other schools, and it continues to monitor this issue.  According to Indian Affairs officials, the last centralized training on using  FMIS was held in 2012.", "While Indian Affairs uses a contractor to address some data quality  issues by validating deficiencies on schools\u2019 deferred maintenance  backlogs and facility inventories, our ongoing work has found that the  scope and frequency of their assessments are limited. According to  Indian Affairs officials, the contractor is supposed to assess the conditions  of schools by performing a visual inspection of each school once over a  3-year cycle, and inspections are grouped by region. One BIA regional  official told us that in his region one field inspector was sent to conduct an  onsite inspection and noted that a single inspector may not be capable of  assessing a school\u2019s facilities because they may contain multiple  systems\u2014such as heating/cooling, and fire alarm and suppression  systems\u2014that require specialized expertise to assess. Officials also  reported that Indian Affairs policy is for the contractor not to assess  schools in a particular 3-year cycle if they are about to be replaced or  undergoing major construction. At one school we visited, which had not  been assessed in 5 years because of ongoing construction, we found  problems with both older and newly constructed buildings, such as  leaking roofs. Also, Indian Affairs\u2019 contractor is responsible for reviewing  and updating information on school facility inventories during onsite  inspections. However, one school facility manager suggested that the  contractor\u2019s inspections may be too short for a thorough and accurate  inventory of all buildings and systems.", "In 2012, Indian Affairs began an effort to identify and correct inaccuracies  in schools\u2019 backlog and inventory data to respond to the findings and  recommendations of the No Child Left Behind Negotiated Rulemaking  Committee\u2019s 2011 report. Further, Interior is currently moving all school  facility data from FMIS to a new Indian Affairs facility information  management system based on Maximo, which is required by the agency   Officials said that through this data cleanup  for all departmental offices.effort, they have identified and eliminated duplicate backlog deficiencies  in FMIS, and they noted that Maximo will simplify data entry. However,  these officials also noted FMIS constitutes a one-stop shop for managing  school facility data, and that Maximo lacks several key functions that exist  in FMIS, such as project management and budget execution, among  others. They said they plan to add new applications to Maximo to work  around some of these limitations. Additionally, one BIA regional official  said that Maximo could be cumbersome to use and will require schools to  use multiple new systems. Indian Affairs has provided some training on  Maximo for schools, but officials indicated that there are currently few  active users in part because of frequent turnover among school staff, and  requests for facility funding are not yet able to be made in Maximo.", "Our preliminary results suggest that Indian Affairs\u2019 data cleanup efforts  and shift to Maximo will not address key challenges with school facility  data, including barriers to data entry at some schools and inadequate  data quality controls. As we have previously stated, incorrect and  inconsistent data undermines management of the federal government\u2019s  real property assets. Federal agencies should improve the quality of their  data to document performance and support decision making. Further,  the National Forum on Education Statistics has stated that quality data  are important for making informed decisions about school facilities. We  believe that inaccurate and incomplete data will continue to hinder Indian  Affairs\u2019 ability to identify and prioritize schools\u2019 repair and improvement  needs and effectively target limited funds.

For example, at one school built  in 1959 we observed extensive cracks in concrete block walls and  supports, which a local BIA agency official said resulted from soft marsh  soil and a shifting foundation. According to school officials, two of their  boilers are old, unreliable, and costly to maintain, and sometimes it is  necessary to close the school when they fail to provide enough heat.  According to school officials, these systems also reflect 1950s  technology, so the costs to maintain them are high. Staff told us they also  have difficulty acquiring parts for these systems and, in some cases,  fabricate work-around parts to replace outmoded parts that wear out or  break. School and regional BIA officials considered the boilers to be safe,  but a BIE school safety specialist reported that the conditions of the  school\u2019s boilers were a major health and safety concern. (See fig.2.)", "At another school, we observed a dormitory for elementary school  students built in 1941 with cramped conditions, no space for desks, poor  ventilation, and inadequate clearance between top bunks and sprinkler  pipes in sleeping areas. School officials noted that students had received  head injuries from bumping their heads on the pipes and some students  had attempted suicide by hanging from them. (See fig. 3.)", "In some cases, we found that schools with older buildings did not have  adequate systems for ensuring student health and safety. For example,  facility staff at one tribally operated school showed us an aging  telecommunications relay panel that they said did not allow phone calls  between dormitory floors and other buildings, making communication  difficult in the event of a campus-wide emergency, such as a fire or  security issue.", "At another school, staff showed us exterior doors to campus buildings  that did not lock properly, and as a result, needed to be chained during  school lock downs. According to officials at the school, about 90 percent  of building entrances also lacked exterior security cameras, and some  buildings, such as student dormitories, had none. These challenges were  highlighted during our visit when the school had to perform a lock down  when a student made a Columbine-type threat."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding for Facility Operations", "paragraphs": ["During our ongoing work, some school officials told us that they receive  less than their current estimated funding needs for facility operations,  which include fixed-cost items like fuel and electricity. For example, one  school official told us that facility operations were funded at about 50  percent of the school\u2019s need. Such shortfalls in operations funds can  require a school to draw from its maintenance funds to keep the lights on  and buildings warm in the winter, leaving less money for building  maintenance. For example, officials with one school told us they may  defer maintenance or cut back maintenance staff if they do not have  enough funds for their operations and maintenance. Officials with several  schools noted using funds for educational purposes on facility operations.  Deferring maintenance can lead to bigger problems with school facilities.  For example, an official with a BIE education line office pointed out that  the poorly maintained rain spouts on one building of a BIE-operated  school led to water collecting behind the retaining wall, resulting in  separation between the sidewalk and the building. Over time, this water  intrusion may undermine the foundation. (See fig. 4.)", "In 2008, we reported that federal agencies\u2019 backlogs represent a fiscal  exposure that may have a significant effect on future budget resources.Further, the 2011 Negotiated Rulemaking Committee report observed that  without enough maintenance funds, schools\u2019 maintenance needs go  unmet, deferred maintenance grows, the quality of the physical plant  deteriorates far more rapidly than it should, and the cost of repairs  increases. According to the 2011 report, over decades, shortchanging  spending on building maintenance degrades learning environments,  shortens the overall life of school buildings, and results in increased costs  for the federal government to fix these schools. (See fig. 5.)", "During our ongoing review, several of the schools we visited reported  encountering problems with new construction. For example, officials at  three schools said they encountered leaks with roofs installed within the  past 11 years. According to officials at one school, despite two  replacements, the roof of their gymnasium\u2014completed in 2004\u2014 continues to leak. Officials said the company that built the gymnasium  has since filed for bankruptcy. Other construction problems at the school  included systems inside buildings as well as building materials. For  example, in the cafeteria\u2019s kitchen at this BIE-operated school, a high  voltage electrical panel was installed next to the dishwashing machine,  which posed a potential electrocution hazard. School facility staff told us  that although the building inspector and project manager for construction  approved this configuration before the building opened, safety inspectors  later noted that it was a safety hazard. (See fig. 6.)", "Officials at an elementary school we visited also reported problems with  new construction. School officials noted that the heat pumps in their new  school facility did not have the capacity to adequately heat the building,  leading to cold classrooms and frequent pump failures in the winter  months. They also noted that the construction did not include a backup  generator, creating a risk of freezing pipes during winter power failures.

In addition,  our prior work and other studies have cited the lack of capacity of Indian  Affairs\u2019 facility staff as a longstanding agency challenge.", "BIA Regions. Staff in certain regions told us that they have  experienced declining staffing levels for over a decade, despite key  responsibilities in overseeing BIE school construction and repair  projects as well as supporting schools with technical assistance. Our  preliminary analysis of Indian Affairs data shows that about 40 percent  of regional facility positions are currently vacant, including regional  facility managers, architects, and engineers who typically serve as  project managers for school construction. In one BIA region serving  over 15 BIE schools\u2014 along with additional Indian Affairs\u2019 facilities  such as detention centers\u2014the regional facility staff has decreased by  about half in the past 15 years, according to the regional facility  manager. As of December 2014, two project managers were tasked  with overseeing a growing workload of construction projects, among  other duties, and only one was a licensed professional, according to  the regional facility manager. The regional facility manager also noted  gaps in internal staff expertise, such as not having a mechanical  engineer on staff to review designs or external engineers\u2019  assessments of systems such as heating and air conditioning.  Regional staff said that hiring an in-house boiler inspector would allow  them to conduct more frequent inspections and may cost less than  hiring contractors to do so. Without staff with particular construction  expertise, several Indian Affairs officials said that they have  increasingly relied on outside contractors. As we have previously  reported, risks to the federal government of extensive reliance on  contractors include not building institutional expertise as well as a  reduced federal capacity to manage the costs of contractors and to  ensure achievement of program outcomes.", "Schools. Officials at several schools we visited said they face similar  capacity challenges. For example, we visited an elementary school  with one full-time employee for facility maintenance, along with one  part-time assistant. A decade ago, the school had about six  maintenance employees, according to school officials. As a result of  the staffing decrease, school officials said that facility maintenance  staff may sometimes defer needed maintenance.", "Leading facility management practices emphasize the importance of  having managers with sufficient technical expertise. Staff capacity is  important because the appropriate geographic and organizational  deployment of employees can further support organizational goals and  strategies and enable an organization to have the right people, with the  right skills, doing the right jobs, in the right place, at the right time.  However, we have previously reported that limited staff capacity at Indian  Affairs impedes its oversight and support of BIE schools and that this runs  counter to effective human capital practices. recommended that Indian Affairs revise its strategic workforce plan.  Specifically, we recommended that Indian Affairs revise its strategic  workforce plan to ensure that employees providing administrative support  to BIE have the requisite knowledge and skills to help BIE achieve its  mission and are placed in the appropriate offices.

According to  Indian Affairs and school officials we interviewed, some recent  construction projects, including new roofs and buildings, have gone  relatively well, while others have faced numerous problems. The  problems we found with construction projects at some schools suggest  that Indian Affairs is not fully or consistently applying management  practices to ensure contractors perform as intended. For example, at one  BIE-operated school we visited, Indian Affairs managed a project in which  a contractor completed a $3.5 million project to replace roofs in 2010, but  the roofs have leaked since their installation, according to agency  documents. These leaks have led to mold in some classrooms and  numerous ceiling tiles having to be removed throughout the school. (See  fig.7.) In 2011, this project was elevated to a senior official within Indian  Affairs, who was responsible for facilities and construction. He stated that  the situation was unacceptable and called for more forceful action by  Indian Affairs. Despite numerous subsequent repairs of roofs, school  officials and regional BIA officials told us in late 2014 that the leaks  continue. They also said that they were not sure what further steps, if any,  Indian Affairs would take to resolve the leaks or hold the contractors or  suppliers accountable, such as filing legal claims against the contractor or  supplier if appropriate.", "Indian Affairs and school officials identified another recent construction  project that has faced problems. At a tribally-operated school we visited in  South Dakota, the school managed a project to construct a $1.5 million  building for maintenance and bus storage. According to these officials,  although the project was nearly finished at the time of our visit, Indian  Affairs, the school, and the contractor still had not resolved various  issues, including drainage and heating problems. Further, part of the new  building for bus maintenance has one hydraulic lift, but the size of the  building does not allow a large school bus to fit on the lift when the  exterior door is closed because the bus is too long. Thus, staff using the  lift would need to maintain or repair a large bus with the door open, which  is not practical in the cold South Dakota winters. (See fig. 8.)", "According to Indian Affairs officials, part of the difficulty with this project  resulted from the tribally-operated school\u2019s use of a contractor  responsible for both the design and construction of the project, which  limited Indian Affairs\u2019 ability to oversee it. Indian Affairs officials said that  this arrangement, known as \u201cdesign-build,\u201d may sometimes have potential  advantages such as faster project completion, but may also give greater  discretion to the contractor responsible for both the design and  construction of the building. For example, Indian Affairs initially raised  questions about the size of the building to store and maintain buses.  However, agency officials noted that the contractor was not required to  incorporate Indian Affairs\u2019 comments on the building\u2019s design or obtain its  approval for the project\u2019s design, partly because Indian Affairs\u2019 policy  does not appear to address approval of the design in a \u201cdesign-build\u201d  project. Further, neither the school nor Indian Affairs used particular  financial incentives to ensure satisfactory performance by the contractor.  Specifically, the school already paid the firm nearly the full amount of the  project before final completion according to school officials, leaving it little  financial leverage over the contractor.", "If problems persist with building construction, one accountability  mechanism is to retain a portion of a project payment. However, certain  Indian Affairs officials held conflicting views on whether withholding  project payments\u2014known in the industry as retainage\u2014is suitable to hold  contractors accountable for satisfactory completion of school construction  projects. For example, officials with the Division of Facilities Management  and Construction told us they usually retain 10 percent of payments until  an independent inspection of a construction project has been conducted.  However, officials in one BIA region said that the region tends not to use  this mechanism for school construction, due partly to past practice. In  prior work, we have found that retainage can be a strong motivator to  encourage contractor and subcontractor performance. Although the  applicability of such project accountability mechanisms may vary in  amount and may depend on the particular situation or project, we have  found that the federal government can be protected from poor quality  construction if it appropriately uses the various tools at its disposal to  manage and address problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Poor Communication with Schools Regarding Roles and Responsibilities of Different Indian Affairs Offices", "paragraphs": ["Our preliminary results also suggest that unclear lines of communication  and confusion among BIE schools about the roles and responsibilities of  the various Indian Affairs\u2019 offices responsible for facility issues hamper  efforts to address school facility needs.

BIE and tribal officials at some  schools we visited said they were unclear about what office they should  contact about facility problems or to elevate problems that are not  addressed.", "At one school we visited, a BIE school facility manager submitted a  request for funding by February 2014 for a needed repair in the Facilities  Management Information System (FMIS) to replace a water heater so that  students and staff would have hot water in the elementary school.", "However, the school did not designate this repair as an emergency.", "Therefore, BIA facility officials told us that they were not aware of this  request until we brought it to their attention during our site visit in  December 2014. Even after we did so, it took BIE and BIA officials over a  month to approve the purchase of a new water heater, which cost about  $7,500. As a result, students and staff at the elementary school went  without hot water for about a year.", "Another communication challenge that our ongoing work has identified for  all BIE schools and BIA regions is that BIE last updated its directory in  2011, which contains contact information for BIE and school officials. This  may impair communications, especially given significant turnover of BIE  and school staff. As a result, we believe that school and BIA officials may  not be able to share timely information with one another, which would  affect schools\u2019 funding levels and priorities for repairs. For example, in  one BIA region we visited, officials have experienced difficulty reaching  certain schools by email and sometimes rely on sending messages by fax  to obtain schools\u2019 priorities for repairs. This situation is inconsistent with  federal internal control standards that call for effective internal  communication throughout an agency.", "These preliminary findings are consistent with findings from our past work  in 2013, when we testified and reported on communication challenges  impeding effective operation of BIE schools. Specifically, at that time we  found that several officials at schools and BIE seemed confused about  whom to consult or make requests for assistance about school facilities.In addition, we found that unclear communication undermined other  aspects of school operations, such as annual testing of students. Thus, at  that time we recommended that Indian Affairs develop a communication  strategy for BIE to inform its schools and key stakeholders of critical  developments that impact instruction in a timely and consistent manner to  ensure that BIE school officials receive information that is important for  the operation of their schools. In early 2014, BIE developed a draft  communication plan, but it has not yet been finalized, and it does not  specifically address communication about school facility issues. More  recently, Indian Affairs officials indicated to us that it does not plan to  finalize its communication strategy until mid-2016 given that the  organizational changes resulting from the two re-organizations since 2013  have not been fully implemented. While we recognize that the re- organizations have led to substantial changes in the roles and  responsibilities of offices within Indian Affairs, we continue to believe that  Indian Affairs needs a strategy to improve communication with BIE  schools, especially given schools\u2019 confusion about which offices to  contact about facilities, and other issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "One Alternative Program Developed by Schools in Response to Challenges with Indian Affairs", "paragraphs": ["During our ongoing work, we identified an alternative program that some  schools developed to ensure their facility needs were met given Indian  Affairs\u2019 facilities management challenges. Four tribally-operated schools  in one region created their own facilities management program because  according to program officials, they were dissatisfied with the amount of  time it took BIA to complete facilities-related projects, including a building  project that officials said took about 7 years to complete. They also said  that they were frustrated that their input was not always solicited on  proposed improvements to their facilities. Consequently, in 1997, the four  schools\u2014in conjunction with their tribal stakeholders\u2014formed the Eastern  Oklahoma Tribal Schools Facilities Management Program, a non-profit  consortium of tribally-operated schools in Eastern Oklahoma, to meet  their facility needs. According to program officials, its operations are  financed primarily through administrative fees for project management  services added to the schools\u2019 backlog items, which are reimbursed by  Indian Affairs. Currently, the program is comprised of three professional  staff\u2014two architects and a production technician\u2014who maintain in-house  technical expertise and manage construction, project design and  oversight for the schools. In addition, program officials said that they  routinely enter backlog data in FMIS because schools typically do not  have the time, technical expertise, or capacity to do it themselves. An  official with Indian Affairs\u2019 Division of Facility Management and  Construction told us that Eastern Oklahoma Tribal Schools Facilities  Management Program reflects a promising approach to managing  facilities, but Indian Affairs has not taken steps to disseminate information  on this approach among schools. In our ongoing work, we plan to further  review this approach and any others to determine how and whether  Indian Affairs can leverage any promising practices to help address  systematic school facility management challenges.  - - - - -  In conclusion, the federal government, through the Department of the  Interior, has a trust responsibility for the education of Indian students,  including building and maintaining school facilities. High quality school  facilities are extremely important to ensure that Indian students are  educated in a safe environment that is conducive to learning. However,  for decades, Indian Affairs has been hampered by fundamental  challenges in managing school facilities. In our previous work, we have  also found significant weaknesses with Indian Affairs\u2019 oversight of BIE  schools in general. In addition, our preliminary work shows that Indian  Affairs continues to face challenges in ensuring that critical school facility  data are collected, staffing levels and technical expertise are  strengthened, construction projects are appropriately designed and  managed, and roles and responsibilities are clearly defined and  communicated. Unless these issues are addressed, some students will  continue to be educated in poor facilities that do not support their long- term success. We will continue to monitor these issues as we complete  our ongoing work and consider any recommendations that may be  needed to address these issues.", "Chairman Calvert, Ranking Member McCollum, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
