Together with extension and education, agricultural research has helped transform U.S. agriculture into a productive, technology-based operation. While each of the three functions has its own purpose, they are interwoven and, hence, are often referred to jointly as the agricultural research, education, and extension system.", "The research component of the system, devoted to discovering new solutions for food- and agriculture-related problems, is carried out through several agencies in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)\u2014including over 100 USDA laboratory locations; 74 land grant colleges and universities; other institutions of higher education; and numerous private research facilities. The system\u2019s extension component, which disseminates agricultural research results and related educational information to the public, is implemented by thousands of state and county extension specialists and agents. Land grant colleges and other universities bear the primary responsibility for implementing the education component of the system, which involves providing formal education to future farmers and others who will be employed in the food and agricultural sector.", "Because of the vast number of participants in the system and the proprietary nature of some of the information, composite funding information for the entire system is difficult to obtain. In fiscal year 1992 (the most recent year for which private sector data were available), agricultural research expenditures totaled about $6.3 billion. The private sector spent about $3.8 billion on agricultural research\u2014about 60 percent of the combined federal, state, and private expenditures for that year. Information on total funding for higher education to support the agricultural sector is not readily available; however, USDA allocated about $12.8 million for higher education in fiscal year 1994. For extension activities, federal, state, and county governments allocated about $1.4 billion in fiscal year 1994."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Changing Nature of the Agricultural Research, Education, and Extension System", "paragraphs": ["Agricultural research and extension historically have focused on increasing agricultural productivity and improving the economic well-being of a largely rural U.S. population. Initially, research concentrated on (1) mechanical innovations for planting and harvesting that would remove much of the physical labor from farming and (2) improving the output and productivity of crop and animal production on farms. Today, much agricultural research continues to focus on increasing production through ways to better protect crops and livestock from insects, disease, and other hazards. However, along with farmers and producers, users of agricultural research now include consumers, as well as groups interested in the environment, sustainable agriculture, and rural development. Decreasing the use of chemicals in agricultural production, creating sustainable agricultural systems, improving food safety and nutrition, and enhancing the viability of small farms and rural communities are some of the newer research areas being addressed in response to this broadened customer base.", "The 1914 Smith Lever Act established extension services nationwide to disseminate the knowledge generated by agricultural colleges to farmers and consumers. \u201cUniversity extension\u201d is based on the concept that education and research developments achieved through public funding should be more readily available to those not attending universities. Today, agricultural extension specialists are often located at land grant universities. University-based extension specialists interact with scientists and relay scientific learning and other knowledge to farmers and other research customers. They also serve as the university\u2019s link to county extension agents. As in agricultural research, the customer base for extension services currently includes urban populations as well as farmers. In addition to providing agricultural information, extension programs are aimed at the development of communities, families, youth, and leadership and include diverse programs such as nutrition, 4-H organizations, and youth and families at risk.", "Education is almost entirely a nonfederal function, but USDA has the responsibility for strengthening higher education in food and agricultural sciences through programs to enhance university teaching programs in agriculture. The origins of higher education in the agricultural sciences date back to the Morrill Act of 1862, which gave the states public lands for use in establishing colleges to teach agriculture and the mechanical arts. Initially, the purpose of these land grant colleges was to meet the educational needs of the nation\u2019s largely rural population and farm-based economy. However, most land grant colleges of agriculture are now full-fledged universities, having expanded well beyond the teaching of agriculture. In addition, legislative actions expanded the system of agricultural colleges to include schools of veterinary medicine and forestry programs.", "The agricultural research, education, and extension system is supported by numerous federal, state, county, and private sector activities. Many of the participants in the system (particularly those associated with land grant universities), have multiple responsibilities for teaching, conducting research, and providing extension services. While the system\u2019s components (e.g., USDA, the land grant universities and other institutions, and private companies) are autonomous and have no central governing authority, there is some collaboration. For example, USDA scientists and land grant university scientists sometimes work together on research projects. Similarly, land grant universities in states with common interests form consortiums that bring together specialized expertise to address problems relating to commodities or problems common to those states. Furthermore, USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service (ARS) has established formal arrangements with private companies aimed at developing and commercializing new technologies through the use of Cooperative Research and Development Agreements. Finally, private companies and commodity groups provide funding to land grant universities and, to a lesser extent, to USDA to conduct research."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USDA\u2019s Involvement in the Research, Education, and Extension System", "paragraphs": ["USDA is involved in the research, education, and extension system primarily through ARS and the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES). ARS conducts research at its 107 laboratory locations and 35 worksites throughout the United States, Puerto Rico, and in four foreign countries, while CSREES administers funding for research at the land grant universities and other research institutions. CSREES is also the primary federal agency supporting agricultural education and extension activities.", "Figure 1.1 shows the location of the ARS facilities, land grant universities established under the Morrill Act of 1862, and universities established under the Second Morrill Act of 1890 (historically black land grant colleges)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ARS Performs Most Federal In-House Agricultural Research", "paragraphs": ["ARS, USDA\u2019s largest research agency, performs most federal in-house agricultural research. ARS has a broad role to develop the knowledge essential to solving technical agricultural problems that are broad in scope and have high national priority. At the end of fiscal year 1994, ARS had a staff of about 6,500 permanent employees, including over 1,900 research scientists and conducted about 1,500 research projects at 128 laboratory locations nationwide and in several foreign countries. Ten years earlier, in fiscal year 1984, 2,600 ARS scientists worked on about 2,700 projects in 140 laboratory locations.", "In addition, ARS collaborates with land grant universities and other research institutions\u2014through cooperative agreements, memorandums of understanding, and other means\u2014to address research problems of mutual concern. Finally, ARS has established Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with the private sector aimed at translating research into practical products, processes, and services. Under these agreements, ARS scientists and private companies work together to develop and commercialize new technologies. Since 1987, ARS has entered into over 500 cooperative agreements, 239 of which were active in November 1995. In addition, over 200 licenses for ARS-developed technologies have been granted to industries to make, use, and sell ARS-patented inventions.", "In addition to ARS, the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the Forest Service conduct research.

It distributes the funds for research through the formula grants program, competitive grants program, special grants program, and various other programs. Specifically:", "Formula funds are allocated to the states according to statutory formulas that were established in three separate acts. In fiscal year 1994, about 76 percent of the formula funds was distributed under the authority established by the Hatch Act to state agricultural experiment stations to conduct agricultural research. The experiment stations have wide latitude in deciding how to allocate and use these formula funds. Other acts provide formula funds for forestry research, animal health research, and agricultural research at the 1890 historically black land grant colleges and Tuskegee University.", "The competitive grants program, known as the National Research Initiative (NRI), awards funds on the basis of peer-reviewed research proposals. Each year, NRI publishes a program description and request for proposals. The program is open to scientists both inside and outside of the land grant university system. In fiscal year 1994, 833 grants were awarded to scientists at colleges and universities, other research organizations, and federal agencies. The grants are awarded for a fixed term\u2014usually 1 to 5 years.", "The special research grants program was established in 1965 as a general authority for agricultural research grants. Conference committee reports accompanying USDA\u2019s appropriations often direct USDA to fund specific research projects at designated institutions (often referred to as \u201cearmarked\u201d projects). These earmarked projects frequently address constituents\u2019 specific concerns and represent the majority of special grant funding (74 percent in fiscal year 1994). The remaining funds are for projects that CSREES designates as national or regional priorities beyond the normal emphasis of the formula grants program. These projects are in areas such as water quality, aquaculture, and integrated pest management. Some of these non-earmarked projects are awarded competitively.", "Several other grant programs fund specific research, including research on rangelands, sustainable agriculture, and crops such as canola. The Congress also adds line item appropriations for specific research projects.", "There is considerable debate in the agricultural research community about the efficacy of the various funding mechanisms. The debate often centers on two issues: whether funding mechanisms are creating inefficiencies in allocation and whether federal funds should support local priorities as well as national priorities. For example, supporters of formula funding maintain that these funds provide a steady base of support for long-term research, whereas opponents contend that formula allocations may no longer reflect the areas of greatest research need. Similarly, proponents of competitive grants believe that these grants provide a flexible means of supporting new and emerging high-priority research areas. However, some groups contend that the larger, richer colleges obtain most of the competitive grants at the expense of the land grant colleges in smaller states. Special grant funding is particularly controversial. Supporters maintain that these grants provide the funding needed to address local problems, while critics argue that the states should support issues of local importance and that federal dollars should be directed toward national priorities.", "In addition to supporting research, CSREES supports extension and technology transfer programs that are conducted in partnership with the states. Extension activities are conducted at the state and local level by extension staff at the land grant universities and about 3,150 extension offices, primarily located in counties and cities. CSREES provides funds for these activities in three areas: basic support for state and local programs; programs designated by the Congress, such as Water Quality and Youth and Families at Risk; and facility construction. The funds for extension activities are distributed to land grant universities through formula grants and competitive programs.", "CSREES also provides funding for education. Although higher education is almost entirely a state and local function, CSREES supports higher education in food and agricultural sciences through four programs to enhance college and university teaching in agriculture. These programs provide grants for graduate fellowships to attract students into agricultural research and grants that provide incentives for innovations in curriculum development.", "Finally, to support agricultural research, extension, and higher education, CSREES administers grants to construct and renovate buildings and facilities. Each year the conference committee for USDA\u2019s appropriations specifies funds for specific projects at specific institutions to carry out these activities. About $54 million was appropriated for building and facilities grants in fiscal year 1994. An additional $7.9 million was appropriated for extension facilities at the 1890 historically black land grant universities.

The private sector also provides funds for research, which include grants from industry and nonprofit organizations and revenue generated by commercial sales of products (such as college-owned livestock) and licenses. According to USDA officials, product sales are different in source and purpose from industry grants. Land grant universities can actively develop, manage, and invest in sales operations to provide steady, predictable income. Funding from industry grants, however, is less unpredictable.

To identify projects in these areas, CRIS users must judgmentally select a combination of standard categories, with no assurance that projects identified by one user will be the same as those identified by another user. As a result, USDA cannot accurately identify the extent of publicly funded research in those categories. In 1993, USDA contracted with the Colorado Agricultural Experiment Station to assess CRIS.

According to USDA officials, congressional direction and legislation drive the broad priorities of the NRI program; however, CSREES sets specific priorities for research within these broad categories. When the program was established in the 1990 Farm Bill, the Congress specified that it fund research in six broad categories, as discussed above, and, where appropriate, that grants be consistent with the goals of sustainable agriculture.

As discussed in chapter 1, Hatch Act formula funds are distributed to the states on the basis of a mandated formula. Systemwide priorities are established for these funds. However, in reality, each experiment station has considerable latitude in allocating and using formula funds to meet the needs of its respective state and local communities.", "Congressional committees\u2019 directives have also affected ARS\u2019 ability to reallocate resources. For example, two appropriations committees\u2019 reports on agriculture appropriations have stated that in complying with the committees\u2019 intentions, ARS is expected not to \u201credirect support for programs from one state to another without prior notification to and approval by the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations.\u201d", "According to a former ARS Administrator and other ARS officials, most research funds can be traced through the years as having been earmarked or targeted by congressional committees for specific commodities or states. Local economies are sometimes closely tied to a particular commodity. Thus, it is not surprising that the congressional representatives of such communities will seek to ensure that research efforts relating to that commodity are undertaken and maintained.", "Appropriations committees\u2019 directives have also made it difficult for ARS to close laboratories that are old, possibly underutilized, and perform research similar to that of other ARS locations. For example, according to an ARS official, over 60 percent of ARS\u2019 facilities are over 30 years old, and in 1995, 50 ARS laboratories had less than 10 scientists each. As of fiscal year 1993, ARS estimated that $700 million was required to repair its facilities, many of which do not meet modern building codes or the technical demands of high-technology research programs. When funds are spent on building renovation and modernization, fewer funds are available for research. Recognizing this problem, ARS proposed closing 12 laboratories in its fiscal year 1996 budget request.

For example:", "Research efforts\u2014particularly those in basic research\u2014often take many years before they yield results that are apparent as measurable impacts.", "Research outcomes are usually the result of many factors, not just one project or set of projects. Furthermore, they are often not easily quantifiable, particularly in areas such as the environment or human health.", "The costs of evaluation studies can range from under $50,000 to over $1 million, according to a 1994 study prepared by a practitioners\u2019 working group on research evaluation for the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The study adds that evaluations cannot be done competently unless they receive adequate funding.", "Comprehensive evaluations of research programs have been relatively rare, according to a RAND draft report being developed for the Office of Science and Technology Policy. Most assessments of federal research programs are descriptive\u2014far removed from the quantification of performance generally required under GPRA. However, several agencies are undertaking efforts to quantify the impacts of research. For example:", "The Advanced Technology Program at the National Institute of Standards and Technology funds projects expected to lead to new technologies that award recipients will commercialize through the use of funds from other sources. The program is attempting to track short-term results and long-term national economic impacts. Research evaluation begins with market and industry assessments to better understand the potential of proposed projects. During project implementation, the program attempts to assess the research\u2019s impact through occasional surveys of, among other things, awardees\u2019 perceptions of the program\u2019s short-term impacts. It also conducts case studies of projects to determine the rate at which new technologies are adopted and changes experienced by the participating company as a result of the project. The program is currently exploring ways to project the impact of the research across the entire economy (e.g., national employment and industrial output measures) through the use of large-scale macroeconomic models in conjunction with microeconomic project analysis.", "The Office of Energy Research at the U.S. Department of Energy conducts highly structured peer assessments of selected programs, evaluating hundreds of projects each year. Projects are rated using standard categories, which results in quantitative ratings that can be compared across projects to identify those projects needing improvement.", "While recognizing the difficulties inherent in evaluating research outcomes, USDA officials say they are committed to strengthening the evaluation of their research programs. To meet GPRA\u2019s requirements, the Research, Education, and Economics mission area plans to develop a set of quantitative and qualitative evaluations for its research programs. According to USDA officials, the quantitative assessments will measure research outcomes in a variety of ways, depending on the research being evaluated. For example, some programs may use a scored survey of customers\u2019 satisfaction, whereas others may employ a retrospective (after-the-fact) review based on benchmark data. These reviews will be used in conjunction with more subjective qualitative assessments, such as experts\u2019 reviews of research programs and anecdotal success stories.", "These evaluations will require varying amounts of resources.

The proposal would create a council of high-ranking officials from USDA\u2019s research agencies and all the Under Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries in the Department. This council is intended to help establish agencywide research priorities.", "In addition, the proposal would have USDA consolidate its three general research advisory boards into one National Research, Education, and Economics Advisory Committee, advised by four regional subcommittees. This proposal reflects the concern of USDA officials that there are more advisory groups than are needed and can be adequately supported. The membership of the proposed committee would include representatives of commodity groups, general agriculture organizations, resource conservation groups, consumers, and the land grant university community. The committee would advise USDA and the land grant universities on the priorities relating to the five outcomes outlined in the mission area\u2019s strategic plan and play a role in obtaining broader input to the plan from customers. This reorganization will require congressional approval.", "Finally, the administration called for the reauthorization of an Agriculture Research Facilities Study Commission to make recommendations for closing, consolidating, constructing, or modernizing federally funded facilities. The 1990 Farm Bill authorized a similar commission; however, the commission was never funded.
