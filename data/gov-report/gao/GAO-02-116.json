CMP debt results from deficiencies at long-term care  nursing facilities or fraud and abuse and is collected by three separate  groups.  CMS\u2019 regional offices are responsible for the long-term care debt,  and HHS OIG and DOJ are responsible for fraud and abuse debt.  DOJ fraud  debt accounted for about 88 percent of the reported $260 million  receivables balance as of September 30, 2000, while OIG fraud and abuse  debt accounted for approximately 11 percent and CMS\u2019 long-term care debt  accounted for about 1 percent of the reported balance.", "For the long-term care debt, Sections 1819 (42 U.S.C. Sections 1395i-3) and  1919 (42 U.S.C. Section 1396r) of the Social Security Act establish  requirements for surveying nursing facilities to determine whether they  meet the requirements for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid  programs.  A survey must be conducted at each nursing facility within 15  months of the previous survey by a state survey agency.  In addition, the  statewide average interval between surveys must be 12 months or less.   Remedies, of which CMP is one, may be used when a nursing facility is not  in substantial compliance with the requirements for participation in the  Medicare and Medicaid programs.", "A CMP is imposed either for the number of days ($50 to $10,000 per day) or  for each instance ($1,000 to $10,000 per instance) that a nursing facility is  not in substantial compliance with the participation requirements.  The  amount depends on the severity of the deficiency.  A written notice of the  CMP is sent to the nursing facility.  The facility has 60 days from the date of  the notice to either waive its right to an administrative hearing and receive  automatically a reduction of 35-percent in the CMP amount or request an  administrative hearing. At any time prior to an administrative hearing, the  nursing facility may enter into a settlement of the CMP amount.   Once  there is an administrative hearing decision or a settlement, the final CMP  receivable amount is determined.", "According to CMS\u2019 State Operations Manual, if a decision is made to settle,  the settlement should not be for a better term than had the nursing facility  opted for a 35-percent reduction.  To track assessments and collections,  CMS\u2019 regional offices use the Civil Monetary Penalty Tracking System for  fiscal year 1999 and later CMP cases and spreadsheets for fiscal year 1996  through fiscal year 1998 CMP cases.  In addition, CMS\u2019 regional offices use  the long-term care system to track CMP cases.", "For civil health care fraud matters, DOJ generally uses the False Claims  Act, as well as common law fraud remedies, payment by mistake, unjust  enrichment, and conversion to recover amounts from those who have  submitted false or improper claims to the United States.  Civil health care  fraud matters are referred directly from federal or state investigative  agencies, or result from filings by private persons known as \u201crelators,\u201d who  file suits on behalf of the federal government under the 1986 qui tam  amendments to the False Claims Act.  The False Claims Act (31 U.S.C.  Sections 3729-3733) provides that anyone who \u201cknowingly\u201d submits a false  claim to the government is liable for a penalty from $5,000 to $10,000 plus  up to three times the amount of damages sustained by the government.", "A court judgment or settlement establishes amounts due by violators.  DOJ  prepares a Health Care Fraud Tracking Form, which is submitted to HHS  OIG and CMS\u2019 Office of Financial Management, and establishes the debt in  a tracking system.  If the health care violator does not pay the fraud debt,  DOJ\u2019s U.S. Attorney Offices (USAO) have several options to pursue  collection, including contacting the debtor, securing or executing upon a  judgment, filing liens or garnishments, and referring the delinquent debt to  Treasury.  To track assessments and collections of civil health care fraud  cases, DOJ\u2019s USAOs use either the Tracking Assistance for the Legal Office  Network or the Collection Litigation Automated Support System, and DOJ\u2019s  Civil Division uses the Debt Collection System.", "HHS OIG also pursues fraud and abuse cases.  According to HHS OIG data,  since 1988, about 90 percent of its CMP assessments relate to the  requirements of Section 1867 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. Section  1395dd).  This statute specifies that a hospital\u2019s emergency department  must provide an appropriate medical screening examination within the  capability of the hospital\u2019s emergency department to any individual who  comes to the department with a request for examination or treatment of a  medical condition.  In addition, if the hospital determines that the  individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must either  stabilize the medical condition or transfer the individual to another medical  facility.  This statute provides for a maximum penalty of $50,000 per  violation.  According to HHS OIG data, since 1988, approximately 10  percent of its CMP assessments relate to violations of the statutory  provisions applicable to false or fraudulent claims submitted to federal  health care programs in Section 1128A of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.  Sections 1320a-7a).  This law provides that for false, fraudulent, or  otherwise improper claims, HHS may impose a penalty of not more than  $10,000 for each item or service and an assessment of no more than triple  the amount claimed for each item or service in lieu of damages.  HHS OIG  uses spreadsheets to track assessments and collections of CMP cases.", "CMS\u2019 Office of Financial Management is responsible for the accounting and  reporting of CMP receivables in the general ledger using the Financial  Accounting Control System.  This office is also responsible for determining  the allowance for uncollectible receivables.  According to CMS, an  allowance is calculated as the amount of CMP debt delinquent for 60 days  or longer that is considered to be inactive and truly delinquent based on a  case-by-case review of each receivable.", "HHS OIG\u2019s Office of Audit Services stated that due to the immateriality of  the CMP receivables balances in relation to CMS\u2019 total accounts receivable  balance, CMS\u2019 external financial statement auditors have not performed  any detailed audit work on CMP receivables.  However, these auditors have  identified various reporting, internal control, and accountability issues  related to Medicare (non-CMP) receivables.  These issues resulted in a  qualified opinion on CMS\u2019 financial statements for fiscal year 1998 and a  material weakness on non-CMP receivables during fiscal years 1998  through 2000.  The external financial statement auditors reported that  CMS\u2019 lack of an integrated financial management system continues to  impair its ability to adequately support the reported non-CMP receivables  activity and balances.  The external financial statement auditors also  identified deficiencies in the non-CMP receivables activity, including  incorrectly reported activity by non-CMP contractors and   inability of non-CMP contractors to reconcile reported ending balances  to the contractors\u2019 subsidiary records.", "The external financial statement auditors\u2019 recommendations included  establishing an integrated financial management system for use by non- CMP contractors and CMS\u2019 central and regional offices and   ensuring that all non-CMP contractors develop and implement control  procedures to provide independent checks of the validity, accuracy, and  completeness of the amounts reported to CMS, including a  reconciliation with the contractors\u2019 supporting documentation, and  periodic review of contractors\u2019 control procedures over reconciliations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increase in Fraud and Abuse Debt Is the Primary Reason for Reported Growth in CMP Debt", "paragraphs": ["The primary reason for the growth of CMS\u2019 CMP receivables was the  expansion of fraud and abuse detection activities from fiscal years 1995  through 1997 that significantly increased fraud and abuse debts in fiscal  year 1997.  This is supported by CMS\u2019 accounting records, which revealed  that about $255 million of the $260 million CMP receivables balance as of  September 30, 2000, related to fraud and abuse debts.  For the $255 million  in receivables, about $172 million remained outstanding from fiscal year  1997.", "In 1995, under authority to use trust fund money to develop or demonstrate  improved methods for investigating and prosecuting fraud, HHS launched  Project Operation Restore Trust.  The project targeted fraud and abuse in  three high-growth areas of the health care industry:  home health agencies,  nursing homes, and durable medical equipment suppliers.  In addition, the  passage of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act  (HIPAA) in 1996 expanded funding for HHS\u2019 fraud and abuse detection  activities by establishing the Fraud and Abuse Control Program, a program  designed to combat fraud and abuse committed in the health plans (both  public and private).  By January 1, 1997, HHS OIG and DOJ had jointly  implemented the Fraud and Abuse Control Program, as required by HIPAA.", "HHS reported, in fiscal year 1996, that Project Operation Restore Trust  combined with the upgraded funding provided by HIPAA would enable  HHS to more aggressively detect and prevent fraud, waste, and abuse.  In  addition, DOJ\u2019s EOUSA stated that DOJ\u2019s health care fraud activities were  expanded in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, and with the implementation of the  Health Care Fraud Tracking Forms in December 1996, DOJ began  submitting health care fraud debts to CMS during fiscal year 1997.

For  example, as of September 30, 2000, CMS\u2019 CMP receivables were reported to  be about $260 million, or 3 percent, of total reported accounts receivables  of approximately $8.1 billion, of which non-CMP Medicare receivables  totaled more than $7.7 billion.", "Our analysis of CMS\u2019 CMP receivables data revealed similar financial  accountability and reporting issues as those identified for non-CMP  receivables by CMS\u2019 external financial statement auditors.  We found that  CMS does not have formal written policies and procedures for the  reconciliation of CMP receivables, recording CMP receivables in the  general ledger, and determining the allowance for uncollectible accounts  related to CMP receivables.  As a result, we found (1) unreconciled  differences between CMP receivables amounts on HHS\u2019 accountability  reports and CMS\u2019 audited financial statements, (2) unreconciled  differences between CMP receivables amounts in CMS\u2019 general ledger and  the detailed subsidiary systems, (3) incorrect recording\u2014not removing  debts paid in full and misclassifications between delinquent and current\u2014 of CMP receivables in the general ledger, and (4) lack of an adequate  collectibility analysis for uncollectible accounts relating to CMP  receivables.", "CMS does not have policies and procedures requiring it to compare CMP  receivables reported in its audited financial statements and HHS\u2019  accountability report.  According to HHS, CMS is the only HHS  component that has CMPs.  Therefore, the CMP receivable amounts  reported in HHS\u2019 accountability report and CMS\u2019 audited financial  statements should be the same.  However, our work identified that year- end CMP receivables balances for fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year  1999, differed by tens of millions of dollars between HHS\u2019 accountability  report and CMS\u2019 audited financial statements.", "For example, CMS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 financial statements reported a CMP  receivables balance of about $243 million; however, HHS\u2019 accountability  report for fiscal year 1997 reported approximately $191 million\u2014a  difference of about $52 million.  The beginning balance for CMP  receivables in HHS\u2019 fiscal year 2000 draft accountability report was  adjusted by approximately $50 million to agree with CMS\u2019 accounting  records.  As a result of the adjustment, the fiscal year 2000 beginning  balance in HHS\u2019 fiscal year 2000 accountability report differed from the  ending balance in its fiscal year 1999 accountability report.  After we  brought this difference to HHS\u2019 attention, a statement identifying the  difference was added to HHS\u2019 fiscal year 2000 accountability report\u2019s  overview; however, the statement did not explain the cause of the  difference.", "Similar to the accountability and reporting issues reported for non-CMP  receivables by CMS\u2019 external financial statement auditors, CMS also  does not have policies or procedures for reconciling CMP receivables  balances in the general ledger to detailed support maintained in the  subsidiary systems.  As discussed above, three separate groups (CMS\u2019  long-term care, HHS OIG, and DOJ) collect CMP debt.  Each group  maintains at least one subsidiary system to track its CMP cases.  As of  September 30, 2000, the CMP receivables balance in the general ledger  and the detailed subsidiary systems differed by a net of about $22  million, with the difference for each group ranging from what appears to  be an understatement of about $35 million to a possible overstatement  of about $29 million.", "The difference between the general ledger and the subsidiary systems  for the long-term care CMP debt totaled about $17 million.  The primary  reason for the long-term care difference is that, beginning in fiscal year  1999, all new long-term care CMP receivables are no longer recorded in  the general ledger until a collection is made.  This practice is not in  accordance with SFFAS No. 1, Accounting for Selected Assets and  Liabilities, and SFFAS No. 7, Accounting for Revenue and Other  Financing Sources and Concepts for Reconciling Budgetary and  Financial Accounting.  These statements require a receivable to be  recognized once amounts that are due to the federal government are  assessed, net of an allowance for uncollectible amounts.   CMS stated  that the general ledger does not include all potentially valid long-term  care CMP receivables because of the unreliability of the long-term care  CMP accounts receivable amounts in the Civil Monetary Penalty  Tracking System.  CMS stated that the long-term care CMP receivables  would be reviewed for validity and recorded in the general ledger as part  of the planned upgrade of the subsidiary system.", "In addition, according to CMS\u2019 accounting records, of the 12 selected  delinquent debts we reviewed, 2 totaling about $24 million were the  responsibility of HHS OIG.  However, upon further research by DOJ,  these debts were actually the responsibility of DOJ and were included in  DOJ\u2019s subsidiary system on September 30, 2000, as uncollected.  This  misclassification appears to explain a portion of the difference between  the general ledger and HHS OIG\u2019s and DOJ\u2019s subsidiary systems.", "In addition to CMS\u2019 lack of policies and procedures relating to the  reconciliation of CMP information, CMS stated that Division of  Accounting staff responsible for the recording of information in the  general ledger use notes and knowledge gained during training provided  by staff previously responsible for the duties to record CMP receivables  in the general ledger.  However, these informal policies and procedures  do not (1) contain specific guidance on recording due dates for  payments being made through payment plans or recording collections  against established receivables and (2) address control procedures to  ensure the accurate recording of CMP receivables in the general ledger,  such as review and approval of transactions by a supervisor.  Our testing  identified instances, in addition to the above misclassification between  HHS OIG and DOJ receivables, in which CMP receivables were recorded  in the general ledger incorrectly.", "For the 12 selected delinquent debts with receivable balances totaling  about $70 million, 7 debts totaling approximately $32 million were  recorded incorrectly in the general ledger.  For four of the debts totaling  about $23 million, CMS failed to remove the debts from CMP receivables  even though collections of these debts were received prior to September  30, 2000.  In addition, CMS incorrectly classified three of the debts  totaling about $9 million as delinquent, instead of current, even though  collections were being received in accordance with the due dates of the  respective payment plans. Further, for the 12 selected delinquent debts,  documentation supporting one of the debts with a balance of about $3  million could not be located by DOJ.  The status of receivables\u2014 current, delinquent, or paid\u2014should be properly noted since it affects  the accuracy of the allowance for uncollectible accounts, which is  netted against gross CMP receivables reported on HHS\u2019 and CMS\u2019  financial statements.  In addition, these errors could possibly have been  avoided if there was appropriate review and approval of such  transactions.", "Lastly, CMS does not have formal written policies and procedures for  determining its allowance for uncollectible accounts.  As previously  noted, CMS stated that its allowance for uncollectible accounts  represents the balance of all CMP debt delinquent for 60 days or longer  that is considered to be inactive and truly delinquent based on a case-by- case review of each receivable.  According to SFFAS No. 1, losses due to  uncollectible amounts should be measured through a systematic  methodology with an analysis of both individual accounts and a group of  accounts as a whole.  Individual account analysis should be based on  factors such as the debtor\u2019s ability to pay and the probable recovery of  amounts from secondary sources.  Group analysis should be performed  using a method such as statistical estimation by modeling or sampling  and should take into consideration such factors as historical loss  experience and recent economic events.  However, CMS\u2019 allowance for  uncollectible accounts is not based on a systematic analysis of the  collectibility of the outstanding receivables balance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incomplete and Unreliable CMP Data Limited the Determination of Overall Adequacy of CMP Debt Collection Policies and Procedures", "paragraphs": ["CMP debt collection policies and procedures have been established by  CMS for the long-term care debt and by HHS OIG and DOJ for the fraud and  abuse debt.  However, incomplete and unreliable CMP information limited  us from determining the overall adequacy of the CMP debt collection  policies and procedures.  As a result and as agreed with your staff, we  performed limited tests of CMS\u2019 debt collection policies and procedures.   We found that debt collection policies and procedures were followed for 11  of the 12 selected delinquent debts.  We could not determine whether DOJ  followed its debt collection policies and procedures for the remaining  selected debt because DOJ was unable to locate supporting  documentation.", "In analyzing long-term care CMP cases and settlement data for fiscal years  1999 and 2000, we noted one debt collection matter in which debt  collection policies and procedures can be strengthened.  The matter relates  to CMS often settling at amounts that exceeded the 35-percent discount  threshold established by management.  At the three selected regional  offices, we found that CMS reduced the assessed long-term care CMP  amounts more than 35-percent for 89 out of 215 cases (41 percent), or  about $8.4 million out of about $11.4 million (73 percent) in assessments  settled in fiscal years 1999 and 2000.  For the 89 cases, a 35-percent  discount on approximately $8.4 million in assessments results in possible  collections of about $5.5 million. However, CMS actually discounted these  cases in total by about 69 percent, reducing potential collections by about  $2.9 million.  According to CMS officials, other matters can develop while a  hearing is pending that can affect the settlement amount, such as  unavailability of witnesses and new information related to the deficiencies.   In these cases, according to the officials, it may be in CMS\u2019 best interests to  settle for less, given the cost of litigation and the risk of not collecting  anything.  However, CMS does not have debt collection policies and  procedures for instances in which a discount greater than 35-percent is  allowed.  Of the three selected regional offices, one regional office was  maintaining documentation to support that such settlements were  warranted, while two regional offices were not maintaining documentation.   Consistent with good management practices and the Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government, when exceptions to a stated  management policy occur, typical control practices are to document,  review, and approve such exceptions to ensure that management\u2019s  objectives are being met."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OMB\u2019s and Treasury\u2019s Roles in the Oversight and Monitoring of CMP Debt", "paragraphs": ["OMB and Treasury are provided with the information useful in performing  their debt oversight roles through the agencies\u2019 reporting of CMP  receivables and referral of CMP debt to Treasury for collection.

OMB further added that it is the role of each agency to  specifically monitor and collect its civil penalty debt regardless of dollar  magnitude and the responsibility of each agency\u2019s OIG to provide oversight  through audit of the agency\u2019s debt collection activities.", "Regarding referral of CMP debt to Treasury, Treasury stated that it relies on  the agencies to determine what debt should be referred to Treasury for  collection as required by DCIA.  DCIA requires federal agencies to transfer  eligible nontax debt or claims over 180 days delinquent to Treasury for  collection actions.  DOJ stated that referral to Treasury was one type of  debt collection tool used by USAOs when pursuing collection of fraud  cases.
