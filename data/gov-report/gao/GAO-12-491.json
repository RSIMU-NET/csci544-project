GAO found that these agencies and the Department of Labor (Labor) have multiple programs that offer similar services to similar beneficiaries. Fragmentation of services and overlap in some programs is partly due to their legislative creation and partly due to programs evolving to offer services that meet the variety of needs of persons experiencing homelessness. Fragmentation and overlap can lead to inefficient use of resources. For example, both HHS and VA have programs that provide similar services, but each agency separately manages its programs under different administrative units. In addition, some local service providers told us that managing multiple applications and reporting requirements was burdensome, difficult, and costly. Moreover, according to providers, persons experiencing homelessness have difficulties navigating services that are fragmented across agencies.", "While almost all targeted programs maintain performance information (including data on the number of homeless served), few targeted programs have conducted evaluations to assess how effectively the programs are achieving their objectives. While performance information can be helpful for monitoring whether programs were achieving desired results, evaluations allow for comprehensive assessments. According to GAO\u0092s questionnaire, 2 of the 26 programs reported they had a program evaluation within the last 5 years. Information from program evaluations can help agencies fully assess what is working and how improvements can be made. Moreover, understanding program performance and effectiveness is key to determining in which programs and interventions to strategically invest limited federal funds.", "The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness (Interagency Council) is required to coordinate the federal response to homelessness and has taken several steps to coordinate efforts and promote initiatives across federal agencies. Federal coordination efforts have increased in recent years and included issuing the first federal strategic plan, increasing coordination at the state and local levels by focusing on the creation of state interagency councils on homelessness, and taking steps to develop a common vocabulary for discussing homelessness and related terms. The strategic plan serves as a useful and necessary step in increasing agency coordination and incorporates some elements of an effective strategy, but lacks key characteristics desirable in a national strategy. For example, the plan does not list priorities or milestones and does not discuss resource needs or assign clear roles and responsibilities to federal partners. In order for the Interagency Council and its members to effectively translate the goals and objectives of the plan into actions and measure their own progress in implementing them, these elements must be made transparent to help ensure accountability and measure the plan\u0092s progress."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["The Interagency Council and the Office of Management and Budget\u0096\u0096in conjunction with HHS, HUD, Labor, and VA, should further analyze the degree and effects of overlap and fragmentation.

Specifically, we found  that HUD, HHS, Labor, and VA have multiple programs that offer similar  services to similar beneficiaries. The VA offers multiple programs to  veterans that are eligible for receiving these services as a result of military  service. While there may be advantages to fragmentation and overlap, they  also entail inefficiencies that programs may not be able to afford in an era  of resource constraints and ongoing coverage gaps. Our work has shown  that fragmented and overlapping federal programs result in administrative  burdens, additional work for local service providers, and a confusing  service delivery system for beneficiaries. However, because our work  identified specific areas of fragmentation and overlap among targeted  homelessness programs, it also suggests that agencies can use this and  other information to better target their efforts and coordinate to help reduce  or eliminate inefficiencies that result from fragmentation and overlap.  Additionally, limited performance evaluations make it difficult to fully assess  what is working and how improvements can be made in programs  addressing homelessness. While such evaluations can be resource- intensive, their benefits include helping agencies identify how to better  structure or operate programs more efficiently, which in turn may help  realize cost savings.", "Since 2009, one entity\u2013\u2013the Interagency Council\u2013\u2013has had an explicit  mandate to coordinate the federal response to homelessness.

HHS, HUD, and Labor did not explicitly agree or disagree with  this recommendation. They offered additional comments, which are  reproduced in appendixes IV, VI, and VII, respectively. HHS stated there  currently are not enough federal resources to meet the needs of the  homeless population and close the services gap, especially for those with  substance use and mental health disorders. While this report identified  federal funding for homelessness programs in fiscal year 2010, we did not  assess the availability of federal funding compared to the overall need.  The identification of overlap or fragmentation in this report does not mean  that funds to existing homelessness programs should be cut or eliminated  but raises questions about whether existing funds are being used  efficiently.  HHS also commented about the importance of a \u201cno wrong  door\u201d approach that enables people to access needed services and  supports through multiple entry points. While this report suggests some  evidence of overlapping services, the report also acknowledges that  overlapping programs help ensure access to services because persons  experiencing homelessness are not steered toward one point of entry.  HUD disagreed with our assertion about the extent of fragmentation  across federal programs that serve the homeless. As a result of this  comment, we clarified in the report that evidence suggests fragmentation  and some overlap. As previously defined, fragmentation is more than one  agency involved in the same broad area of national interest (i.e.,  homelessness). This report identified multiple agencies managing several  similar homelessness programs, suggesting fragmentation. Additionally,  we acknowledge that federal agencies have taken steps to enhance  coordination, which we have previously stated is important to help  minimize inefficiencies.

However, it provided additional comments  about each. Regarding the first recommendation, the Council stated it is  not within the agency\u2019s authority to streamline overlapping services.  However, our recommendation states the Council should work in  conjunction with key agencies and as a starting point use the program  information from this report to further analyze the degree and effects of  overlap and fragmentation. Streamlining services is one of several  potential actions that agencies could take after further analyzing the  degree and effects of overlap and fragmentation. As the entity mandated  to coordinate the federal response to homelessness, the Interagency  Council has an important role in facilitating the efforts of member  agencies to address potential inefficiencies related to fragmentation and  overlap. Regarding the second recommendation, the Council stated that  in implementing the federal strategic plan it has been setting priorities,  determining how to measure progress and results, and identifying  mechanisms to hold federal and nonfederal partners accountable.  However, the council was unable to provide us with documentation that  these activities were occurring. Therefore, we did not revise our second  recommendation because these additional implementation efforts must  also be transparent to help ensure accountability and measure the plan\u2019s  progress. The Interagency Council made additional points, including commenting that our report did not reflect the strong commitment  to research and to implement innovative practices across  member agencies. Our report acknowledges that some agencies  have conducted general research on the issue of homelessness,  including specific research offices at HHS, HUD, and VA. The  focus of our work was to identify whether programs had been  evaluated and specifically whether program evaluations had  occurred in the last 5 years. questioning whether there was a specific understanding of \u201cat  risk\u201d for homelessness in determining whether two programs met  the criteria we used for targeted programs.

The council further  stated that including more programs in our review made it appear  that there is more fragmentation and overlap than actually exists  and they disagreed with our assertion about the extent of  fragmentation. As previously stated, we clarified in the report that  evidence suggests fragmentation and some overlap. This report  states that 3 of 26 targeted programs provide federal surplus  properties to eligible homelessness service providers and one  program provides excess personal property to homeless  veterans.

In developing our comprehensive list, we reviewed the Catalog  of Federal Domestic Assistance, the Interagency Council\u2019s previous  reports and information, and previous GAO and Congressional Research  Service reports on homelessness, and searched the websites of the 19  member agencies of the Interagency Council. Our initial review revealed  that 5 of the 19 member agencies did not operate any targeted or  mainstream programs. As a result, we excluded these five agencies from  our study. In total, our initial search identified more than 150 potential  programs (48 targeted and 106 mainstream) that 14 federal agencies  administered.", "Second, we excluded 4 of the 19 member agencies and their mainstream  programs because they were not deemed critical to meeting the needs of  the homeless.

For example, some programs were removed from the list because they  were not in operation in fiscal year 2011 or were part of a larger program  already listed. During the initial meetings with agency officials, we asked  officials to clarify program names, descriptions, and services offered. To  obtain program-specific information, we sent a total of 105 (35 targeted,  70 mainstream) structured questionnaires to the 10 agencies. These  questionnaires are described in detail below.

The targeted  questionnaire was lengthier and included more in-depth questions about  program information and funding levels (for example, about program  goals and objectives, target populations, services offered, performance  information and evaluations, numbers of homeless served, and funding  information). The mainstream questionnaire included questions about  services offered, target populations, whether the programs collect data on  the number of persons experiencing homelessness or at risk for  homelessness, and whether steps had been taken to increase  participation of persons experiencing homelessness in mainstream  programs. To minimize errors arising from differences in how questions  might be interpreted and to reduce variability in responses, we conducted  pretests with two different agencies in September 2011.

Each of the 26 targeted programs provided obligations data for  fiscal years 2008 through 2010, as available. A few programs were new  or had not obligated any funds in fiscal years 2008 through 2010;  therefore, they reported zero obligation dollars.

In several cases,  programs were not able to provide enacted appropriations data because  agency staff told us the program did not have a specific appropriation and  funding for the program originated in a larger appropriation line item. As a  result of not having complete enacted appropriations data, we excluded  such data from this report. We did not collect funding-level information on  mainstream programs because the programs serve the general low- income population, not solely persons experiencing homelessness, and  therefore funding for mainstream programs is not an appropriate estimate  of federal funding spent on persons experiencing homelessness.", "We used an independent contractor to keypunch the questionnaire data  and provide us with a comprehensive data file. We verified a selected  sample of keypunched records with their corresponding questionnaires  and found that less than 0.5 percent of the data items had random  keypunch errors that were not corrected during data processing. We used  standard descriptive statistics to analyze responses. We performed data  checks to identify missing fields, outliers, and inappropriate answers, and  followed up with agency staff as necessary. To assess the reliability of  data provided in the questionnaires, we incorporated questions about the  reliability of the programs\u2019 data and financial systems, conducted internal  reliability checks, and conducted follow-up as necessary. While we did  not verify all responses or have access to each agency\u2019s data and  financial systems to fully assess the reliability of the data provided or the  systems themselves, on the basis of our questionnaire design and follow- up procedures, we determined that the data used in this report were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Finally, GAO data analysts  independently verified all data analysis programs and calculations for  accuracy.", "To determine the extent of fragmentation, overlap, and duplication we  compared data from the 26 targeted programs to comprehensively look at  homelessness programs across the federal government and used the  following definitions:", "Fragmentation occurs when more than one federal agency (or more  than one organization within an agency) is involved in the same broad  area of national interest.", "Overlap occurs when multiple programs have similar goals and  activities, and offer similar services to similar target populations.", "Duplication occurs when two or more agencies or programs are  engaging in the same activities or providing the same services to the  same beneficiaries.", "We previously had reported that the wide range of homelessness  programs that federal agencies offer resulted in a fragmented service  system. To further determine the extent of fragmentation, we used the  questionnaire data to identify the number of agencies that deliver similar  or the same services. For example, five federal agencies each administer  programs that offer transitional housing assistance. To determine overlap,  we identified the number of programs with similar services (such as  housing or employment assistance) to similar populations (such as the  general homeless population, homeless veterans, or homeless children  and youth). To further determine overlap, we then used the services  offered to determine each program\u2019s \u201cprimary services\u201d and other eligible  services. We designated those services stated within a program\u2019s goals  and objectives, as reported in the Catalog of Federal Domestic  Assistance or in the questionnaire, as primary services. In instances of  overlapping primary and other eligible services to similar target  populations, we reviewed the data with agency officials and asked  clarifying questions about each program\u2019s primary and other eligible  services and obtained information about differences between programs.  However, the scope of this report did not allow us to gather enough  information to fully discuss the degree of overlap among homelessness  programs. To determine the extent of duplication, in instances when two  or more programs engaged in the same primary service to similar target  populations, we reviewed programmatic information, statutory authorities,  and held meetings with program staff to determine whether the programs  were providing the same services to the same beneficiaries."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Performance Information and Program Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["We also used the targeted questionnaire discussed above to obtain  information to answer our second objective about performance  information and program evaluations. For the 26 targeted programs, we  collected performance information and asked agency staff if a program  evaluation had been conducted in the past 5 years. For instance, the  questionnaire asked whether the programs had performance metrics,  targets for the level of performance to be achieved, reporting of actual  level of performance achieved, and what other data the agency collected  on program performance. Additionally, the questionnaire asked program  staff to describe the performance metrics, targets, reporting, or other data  and submit relevant documentation (that is, submit documents to us  describing the performance information and the program\u2019s success in  meeting any performance metrics within the last 3 years). Further, the  questionnaire asked whether targeted programs had an efficiency or  effectiveness evaluation completed within the past 5 years and to submit  documents to us about any evaluation\u2019s findings.

However, we did not independently assess  the quality of these reviews. Finally, we interviewed program staff to  obtain information on how the agency uses performance information and  program evaluation findings, as appropriate.

For instance, coordination refers to a joint activity bringing  together two or more agencies or entities. We identified actions such as  issuing and updating the federal strategic plan to end homelessness;  providing assistance to states, local governments, and nonprofit  organizations; and developing joint federal agency and other initiatives to  fulfill the goals of the Interagency Council, as coordination duties. We  interviewed Interagency Council staff and asked them to provide evidence  of actions taken to fulfill requirements of the HEARTH Act. We reviewed  relevant documents such as a report to Congress on developing a  common vocabulary, congressional budget justifications, performance  and accountability reports, guidance on creating effective state  interagency councils, and agendas for various meetings held by the  council. Additionally, our questionnaire to targeted programs asked  agency staff whether the agency or program offices coordinated or  collaborated with other federal agencies or programs to plan, facilitate, or  implement programs and examples of how this was done.

It should be noted that the partially addresses category  includes a range that varies from explicitly citing most, but not all, of the  elements to citing as few as one of the elements of a characteristic.
