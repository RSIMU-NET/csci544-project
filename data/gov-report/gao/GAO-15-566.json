In January 2014 the administration issued the Implementation Plan to the National Strategy for the Arctic Region that designated DOD as having a largely supporting role for the activities outlined in the plan. Additionally, DOD's Arctic Strategy issued in November 2013 and the Navy's Arctic Roadmap 2014-2030 issued in February 2014 emphasize that, as sea ice diminishes and the Arctic Ocean opens to more activity, the department may be called upon more frequently to support other federal agencies and work with partners to ensure a secure and stable region. To further its role, DOD participates in a number of forums focused on military security cooperation in the Arctic, including the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable, a senior-level event aimed at encouraging discussion among the security forces of Arctic and non-Arctic nations. In addition, DOD leads training exercises focused on building partner capacity in the region, including Arctic Zephyr, a multilateral scenario-based exercise. DOD continues to monitor the security environment in the region and is tracking indicators that could change its threat assessment and affect DOD's future role.", "U.S. Northern Command\u2014the DOD advocate for Arctic capabilities\u2014stated that it is in the process of updating its regional plans for the Arctic and is conducting analysis to determine future capability needs. For example, Northern Command is updating the Commander's Estimate for the Arctic, which establishes the commander's intent and missions in the Arctic and identifies near-, mid-, and long-term goals. Additionally, the command is conducting studies of various Arctic mission areas, such as maritime homeland defense and undersea surveillance, to identify future capability needs. However, according to DOD's Arctic Strategy , uncertainty remains around the pace of change and commercial activity in the region that may affect its planning timelines. Difficulty in developing accurate sea ice models, variability in the Arctic's climate, and the uncertain rate of activity in the region create challenges for DOD to balance the risk of having inadequate capabilities or insufficient capacity when required to operate in the region with the cost of making premature or unnecessary investments.

Diminishing sea ice has made some Arctic waters  navigable for longer periods and, as a result, may contribute to new  economic opportunities in commercial shipping, oil and gas exploration,  tourism, and commercial fishing. This could eventually increase the need  for a U.S. military and homeland security presence in the Arctic. While the  changing environment may create opportunities, operating in the Arctic  region will continue to provide a number of challenges, including harsh  and unpredictable weather, vast distances, and limited infrastructure.", "In November 2013, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued its Arctic  Strategy, which calls for a secure and stable region where U.S. national  interests are safeguarded, the U.S. homeland is protected, and nations  work cooperatively to address challenges. The strategy reflects the  relatively low level of military threat in the Arctic and the stated  commitment of the Arctic nations to work within a common framework of  diplomatic engagement. It also identifies a number of investments that will  need to be made over time as activity in the region increases, but the  strategy states that desired investments in Arctic capabilities may not  compete successfully against other requirements in the department\u2019s  budget priorities.", "We have previously examined emerging issues and challenges for the  United States in the Arctic. In 2012 we assessed DOD\u2019s efforts to  prioritize the capabilities needed to meet national security objectives in  the Arctic. We found that DOD had undertaken some efforts to assess  capabilities needed in the Arctic, but it was unclear whether DOD would  be in a position to provide needed capabilities in a timely and efficient  manner. We recommended that DOD develop a risk-based investment  strategy and timeline for developing Arctic capabilities needed in the near  term and establish a forum with the U.S. Coast Guard to identify  collaborative Arctic capability investments over the long term. In  response, DOD took steps to identify and prioritize near-term Arctic  capability needs, developed a timeline for addressing those needs,  updated its investment plan, and established several collaborative forums  with the Coast Guard. Additionally, in March 2014, we examined U.S.  Arctic maritime infrastructure and the actions taken by federal, state, and  local stakeholders to plan for future Arctic maritime infrastructure  investments. We found that commercial U.S. Arctic maritime activities  are expected to be limited for the next 10 years, according to industry  representatives. Although activity will likely be limited, federal, state, and  local stakeholders have taken some actions to plan for future maritime- infrastructure investments. For example, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration and the Alaska government are working to  improve mapping, charting, and weather information for the U.S. Arctic. In  2013, we added the federal government\u2019s efforts to manage its fiscal  exposure to the effects of climate change to our High-Risk List, noting  that the federal government\u2019s role as a property owner exposes it to  significant risk.

To determine what  actions, if any, DOD has taken to address near-term capability needs, we  reviewed supporting documentation and testimonial evidence from DOD  and Coast Guard officials and grouped actions initiated by DOD since our  January 2012 report into the four capability areas established in the DOD  and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Arctic Capability  Assessment Working Group White Paper. To determine what efforts  DOD has under way to update plans for the Arctic and identify future  capability needs, we reviewed Northern Command\u2019s regional plans that  cover the Arctic and interviewed officials to identify ongoing planning  activities and analysis being conducted to determine future capability  needs. Additionally, we reviewed observed sea ice levels from the  National Snow and Ice Data Center and information on Arctic sea ice  trends from various organizations and examined assessments of  commercial and military activity in the Arctic region produced by  departments and agencies with responsibilities for Arctic awareness.  We also interviewed DOD and Coast Guard officials to determine their  collaboration to align Arctic initiatives and compared these activities with  leading practices in collaboration. For all of our objectives, we  interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense; Office of  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; U.S. Northern Command and  the North American Aerospace Defense Command; U.S. European  Command, U.S. Pacific Command; and U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force,  Marine Corps, and Coast Guard offices with Arctic responsibility.

For example, most commercial ship activity in the U.S. Arctic is currently  destinational\u2014shipping into or out of the Arctic, mainly in support of  commercial activity. However, melting ice could potentially increase the  use of three trans-Arctic routes, the Northern Sea Route, Northwest  Passage, and Transpolar Route, saving several thousands of miles and  several days of sailing between major trading blocs. See figure 2 for  locations of these shipping routes. Additionally, estimates of significant  oil, gas, and mineral deposits in the Arctic have increased interest in  exploration opportunities in the region. These resources include an  estimated 13 percent of the world\u2019s undiscovered oil, 30 percent of  undiscovered gas, and some $1 trillion worth of minerals including gold,  zinc, nickel, and platinum.", "Despite the changing climate and growing interest in the region, several  enduring characteristics still provide challenges to surface navigation in  the Arctic, including large amounts of winter ice and increased movement  of ice from spring to fall.

For example, DOD may  support the Coast Guard in safety-related missions or the Federal  Emergency Management Agency in disaster relief and mitigation efforts.  The Arctic Strategy notes that DOD has seldom been tasked to execute  these missions in the Arctic, but it may be asked to do more in the coming  decades given the expected increase in activity in the region.", "DOD\u2019s determination of its supporting role in the Arctic is based on its  assessment of a low level of military threat in the region. The Arctic  Strategy states, for example, that there is a willingness and an ability  among the Arctic nations to manage and resolve disputes through an  established international framework. This framework is based on a  commitment between the five nations bordering the Arctic Ocean (the  United States, Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark on behalf of  Greenland) to the international legal framework governing the sea, and to  the orderly settlement of any possible overlapping territorial claims. Also,  the Arctic Council serves as a voluntary intergovernmental forum that  provides a means for promoting cooperation, coordination, and interaction  among stakeholders with interests in the region, although the Council  omits matters related to military security. In 2014, we assessed U.S.  involvement in the Arctic Council and provided recommendations to help  clarify the direction of future U.S. participation and to position the United  States for a successful Arctic Council chairmanship beginning in 2015.", "To further its supporting role in the Arctic, the Arctic Strategy states that  DOD plans to continue to build interagency and international partnerships  to meet security and defense commitments. The department currently  participates in a number of activities intended to prevent conflict and  enhance the region\u2019s capability and capacity for multilateral security  collaboration. For example, while the Arctic Council charter expressly  omitted matters related to military security, DOD participates in a number  of international forums focused on military security cooperation. This  includes the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable, an annual collaborative  forum cohosted by DOD and the Norwegian Ministry of Defence. This  senior-level event is aimed at building confidence and encouraging  discussion of the Arctic among the security forces of Arctic and non-Arctic  nations. The most recent event was held in May 2015 and included  representatives from 11 countries\u2014seven Arctic nations, as well as  France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

The  event is cohosted by U.S. Northern and European Commands and was  most recently held in May 2014 with participation from various Arctic  nations. Additionally, DOD participates in Arctic Shield, an annual Coast  Guard\u2013led operation in the Arctic that focuses on selected missions such  as search and rescue and includes training opportunities. For example,  DOD has provided logistical support, conducted joint planning with the  Coast Guard, and provided air support for an oil spill response exercise  during previous Arctic Shield training events. In addition to DOD, the  operation typically includes participation from a number of stakeholders  including Canada, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,  and Arctic researchers, among others. Further, DOD participates in a  number of foreign-led Arctic exercises. For example, in 2014, DOD  participated in the Norwegian-led exercise Cold Response, a field training  exercise involving maritime, land, and air forces, focused on combat  operations in cold-weather conditions. The exercise involved  approximately 660 U.S. servicemembers, and, overall, included 16,000  servicemembers from 16 nations.", "The Navy also expects to have a continued role supporting other federal  agencies and international partners as needed in the Arctic. Given that  the changes in the Arctic primarily affect the maritime environment, the  Navy has updated its strategic guidance and has conducted a number of  studies on operating in the region. In February 2014, the Navy issued its  Arctic Roadmap 2014-2030 (Roadmap), which discusses the need for the  Navy to develop strong cooperative partnerships with interagency and  international Arctic stakeholders. This includes pursuing bilateral and  multilateral agreements with Arctic nations, expanding professional  exchange programs, and increasing participation in Arctic-region  exercises. To inform its Roadmap, the Navy developed an Arctic Mission  Analysis in August 2011 that identified six anticipated mission areas and  assessed the service\u2019s role and the likelihood of these missions in the  Arctic through 2040. Based on this assessment, the Navy anticipates an  increase in the likelihood of supporting other federal agencies, specifically  around regional security cooperation, led by the Department of State, and  search and rescue missions, led by the Coast Guard.

In support of that  effort, the Office of Naval Research leads an interagency Sea Ice  Collaboration Team with officials from the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, Department of Energy, and Department of  Interior that is focused on better understanding environmental systems in  the Arctic to improve modeling and prediction of sea ice. The team has  completed a number of actions including experiments on Arctic sea ice  coverage using over 100 instruments and platforms, measuring sea ice  thickness using overhead aircraft and radar, and testing updates to sea  ice models for improved forecasting. In addition, DOD is identified as a  supporting agency for a number of other activities identified in the  implementation plan, including efforts focused on communications in the  Arctic. For example, the National Telecommunications and Information  Administration leads an effort to develop a communication infrastructure  in the Arctic, with support from DOD and other agencies. In January  2015, the administration released a status report noting progress made  by the federal government across these activities during 2014. Among  other actions, the report highlighted the establishment of an executive  steering committee in January 2015 tasked with enhancing coordination  of national efforts and identifying potential areas of overlap between and  within agencies responsible for implementation of Arctic policy and  strategic priorities, among other things.

Northern Command officials expect these studies to be  completed in July 2015.", "According to Northern Command officials, it may be too early for the  command to fully identify the supporting operational requirements given  the current state of the Arctic climate and level of activity. As conditions  change in the region, officials stated the command will need flexibility to  adjust its plans to meet any emerging threats and challenges.  Accordingly, some of the analysis that is currently being conducted on  Arctic mission areas, such as maritime mine countermeasures, will be  used to inform future iterations of its regional plans\u2014which typically cover  the steady state of operations over a 2-year period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty around the Pace of Climate Change and Commercial Activity May Affect DOD\u2019s Planning Timelines", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s Arctic Strategy states that there is uncertainty surrounding its  assumptions, particularly around the rate and extent of the effects of  climate change and the potential corresponding increase in commercial  activity in the region. The pace of these changes may affect the frequency  and timing of DOD\u2019s activities in the region. For instance, as sea ice  retreats and human activity expands, DOD could be called upon more  often or sooner to support the Coast Guard in search and rescue  operations. DOD\u2019s Arctic Strategy further states that the uncertainty  around the pace of change creates a challenge for the department to  balance the risk of having inadequate capabilities or insufficient capacity  when required to perform these operations with the cost of making  premature or unnecessary investments. According to the strategy, DOD  will mitigate this risk by monitoring the changing Arctic conditions to  determine the appropriate timing for future capability investments.", "The Navy\u2019s current Arctic sea ice projections and planning time frames  are based on analysis from a team of subject-matter experts convened for  the Navy\u2019s development of the Arctic Roadmap. Based on their analysis,  the Navy predicts that access to the Northwest Passage will continue to  remain limited in the near and mid-term with an estimated 5 weeks of  open water periods beginning in the 2030s. However, Navy officials  stated that there remains uncertainty around its predictions and continued  challenges in planning for Arctic investments due to a number of factors  including difficulty in developing accurate Arctic sea ice models and  continued seasonal variability. According to officials from the Office of  Naval Research, current Arctic sea ice models are not optimized to  predict sea ice changes in the next few decades\u2014the period DOD needs  for its Arctic planning. Additionally, limited understanding of the complex  interactions between Arctic sea ice, oceans, atmosphere, and land limits  the ability of models to predict the rate and scope of future sea ice  variations.", "Further, DOD officials stated that there remains seasonal variability in the  rate and extent of the change in Arctic sea ice. Sea ice can fluctuate  significantly from year to year. For example, the minimum sea ice extent  for 2012 was the lowest occurrence in the satellite record but it increased  47 percent in the following year. There is also significant variance in the  sea ice extent throughout the year. According to data from the National  Snow and Ice Data Center, summer sea ice is diminishing at a faster  pace than winter sea ice, around 13 percent compared to around 3  percent, as shown in figure 5. This variable rate of change can affect  DOD\u2019s ability to plan for future conditions in the region. For instance,  several relatively ice-free summers may be followed by unusually cold  years during which sea ice remains throughout the year.", "DOD also notes in its Strategy the uncertainty around future economic  conditions and the pace at which commercial activity will increase in the  region. According to a Navy study on the Arctic, economic viability of  commercial ventures in the Arctic\u2014oil and gas exploration, mineral  extraction, tourism, and fishing\u2014will be the dominant driver of the pace at  which activity increases in the region. The Navy estimates that activity  will increase gradually and unevenly, driven by existing infrastructure,  individual national policy decisions, and the self-interest of commercial  entities, among other factors. The study notes that despite the Arctic  warming trend and reduced ice cover in the summer season, navigation  in the Northwest Passage will remain hazardous. Ice melt patterns are not  uniform and ships face considerable risk. A recent report on maritime  activity in the U.S. Arctic projects that over the next 10 years traffic in the  Bering Strait and North Slope of Alaska is likely to increase from 240  vessels in 2013 to between a low of 400 and a high of 1,120 vessels in  2025. However, the report identifies several factors that may affect this  projection including economic variables such as high insurance premiums  and risk costs as well as changes in the shipping market through  variables such as the opening of the Panama Canal expansion, which  could make the Arctic routes commercially less viable."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We are not making any recommendations in this report.

We stated that DOD acknowledged  the importance of collaboration with the U.S. Coast Guard over the long  term in its 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, which states that the  department must work with the Coast Guard and DHS to develop Arctic  capabilities to support both current and future planning and operations.  We recommended that the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the  Secretary of Homeland Security, establish a collaborative forum with the  Coast Guard to fully leverage federal investments and help avoid overlap  and redundancies in addressing long-term Arctic capability needs.", "In response to our recommendation, DOD cited the establishment of a  number of collaborative forums that are intended to address a variety of  Arctic issues including Arctic strategy and policy, capabilities, and  requirements. Officials we interviewed from DOD and the Coast Guard  identified three working groups that have been established to enhance  coordination between the two organizations: the Navy/Coast Guard Arctic  Working Group, the Arctic Operational Working Group, and the Arctic  Capability Advocacy Working Group. Additionally, officials from U.S.  Northern Command told us that the Arctic Collaborative Workshop is  another forum being used to bring together Arctic stakeholders, including  the Coast Guard. Table 2 below provides a summary of the current  structure and activities of each of these collaborative forums.", "According to DOD and Coast Guard officials, there is currently no formal  mechanism for the working groups to coordinate among each other.  These officials told us that the number of people from each agency  involved in Arctic issues is currently small, and in some cases, the same  participants are involved across these working groups. Due to the  familiarity with activities of the other groups, the members are able to  share information on the activities among the working groups in order to  avoid duplicative efforts. Additionally, Navy officials stated that some of  these working groups were established in the last year and are still  determining the focus of their efforts.", "Given the small community involved in many of these Arctic working  groups and the information-sharing activities described to us by DOD and  Coast Guard officials, the current, informal process of collaboration  among the working groups may be sufficient. As our prior work on key  considerations for implementing interagency collaborative mechanisms  has shown, at times it can be helpful to document key agreements related  to collaboration. Thus, moving forward, as the Arctic community of  interest grows and the focus of the working groups are more fully defined,  considering whether the workings groups may benefit from a more formal  written agreement, such as a memorandum of understanding that is  continually revisited and updated to meet the needs of the participants,  will be important."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The objectives of this report are to determine (1) the role the Department  of Defense (DOD) expects to play in the Arctic based on recent strategic  guidance and its assessment of the security environment in the region,  (2) the actions, if any, DOD has taken to address near-term capability  needs, and (3) the efforts DOD has under way to update plans for the  Arctic and identify future capability needs.
