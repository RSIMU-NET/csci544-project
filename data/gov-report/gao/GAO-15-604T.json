Some policymakers have raised questions about the level of FECA benefits, especially compared to federal retirement benefits.

GAO found that the proposals reduced the median wage replacement rates\u2014the percentage of take-home pay replaced by FECA\u2014for total-disability beneficiaries. Specifically, according to GAO's simulation, in 2010 under the existing FECA program, the median wage replacement rates were 88 percent for U.S. Postal Service (USPS) beneficiaries and 80 percent for non-USPS beneficiaries. The proposal to use a single rate of 70 percent to compensate both those with and without dependents would reduce the beneficiaries' median wage replacement rates by 3 to 4 percentage points. The proposal to use a single rate of 66-2/3 percent would reduce the beneficiaries' median wage replacement rates by 7 to 8 percentage points.", "The simulations for GAO's 2012 reports also found that proposals to reduce FECA benefits upon reaching Social Security retirement age would reduce beneficiaries' retirement income, bringing the median FECA benefits on par with or below the median retirement incomes individuals would have received absent their injuries. In simulations comparing FECA benefits to retirement benefits\u2014both in 2010\u2014GAO found that under the existing FECA program, the median FECA benefit package for total-disability retirement-age beneficiaries was 37 and 32 percent greater than the median 2010 retirement benefit package for USPS and non-USPS beneficiaries, respectively. This analysis focused on individuals covered under the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS), which generally covers employees first hired in 1984 or later. GAO found that the proposal to reduce FECA benefits at the full Social Security retirement age would result in a median FECA package roughly equal to the median 2010 FERS retirement package. However, the median years of service for the FERS annuitants GAO analyzed were 16 to 18 years\u2014which did not constitute a mature FERS system\u2014so these simulations understated the future FERS benefit level. GAO then simulated a mature FERS system\u2014intended to reflect benefits of workers with 30-year careers\u2014and found that the median FECA benefit package under the proposed change would be 22 to 35 percent less than the median FERS retirement package.", "The potential effects of the proposed changes to FECA on partial-disability beneficiaries would vary based on individual circumstances. Partial-disability beneficiaries differ fundamentally from total-disability beneficiaries, as they receive reduced FECA benefits based on a determination of their post-injury earning capacity. GAO's seven case studies of partial-disability beneficiaries showed variation based on characteristics such as earning capacity and actual earnings. For example, beneficiaries with high earning capacities based on actual earnings might elect to retire under FERS if their potential retirement benefits were higher than their current or reduced FECA benefit levels. They would, thus, not be affected by the proposed changes. In contrast, those beneficiaries with low earning capacities who might remain on FECA past retirement age would have their benefits reduced under the proposed change."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on proposed changes  to benefit levels in the Federal Employees\u2019 Compensation Act (FECA)  program.

Some policymakers have raised questions about the level of FECA  benefits, especially compared to the retirement benefits under the Federal  Employees Retirement System (FERS), which generally covers  employees first hired in 1984 or later. As of September 30, 2013, about  89 percent of the federal workforce\u2014not including workers in the Postal  Service (USPS) or other agencies not covered by the Central Personnel  Data File\u2014was covered by FERS.", "The 2016 congressional budget justification for the Office of Workers\u2019  Compensation Programs (OWCP) includes a discussion of a legislative  proposal to reform certain aspects of the FECA program.

We projected simulated FECA benefits to 2010 and compared  these FECA benefits, supplemented by a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)  annuity, to the actual FERS benefit packages. The FERS benefit  package includes the FERS annuity, Social Security benefits, and TSP  annuities. However, FERS had only been in place 26 years in 2010, so  we did not capture a fully mature system. To capture future FECA  beneficiaries, we conducted another simulation to account for a mature  FERS.

We did not conduct the types of simulations we used for total- disability beneficiaries, in part because DOL does not keep data about  their total income (including any earnings) in an electronic database.  Instead, we reviewed partial-disability beneficiary case files to examine  how their post-injury employment outcomes varied (e.g., re-employed by  the federal government, re-employed in the private sector, or  unemployed) and changed over time and judgmentally selected 7  beneficiaries to present as case studies.

Underreporting earnings could result in overpayments of  FECA benefits. DOL did not have access to wage data to corroborate the  self-reported incomes.

These aggregate numbers do not track  individual beneficiaries\u2019 decisions to elect retirement or to continue  receiving FECA benefits past retirement age, but they suggest that there  is a substantial percentage of partial-disability beneficiaries that elects  other benefits instead of FECA at some point post-injury.", "Since those beneficiaries who elect FERS retirement would not be  affected by the proposed revisions to FECA compensation at retirement  age, the overall effects of the proposals on partial-disability beneficiaries  should be considered in the larger context of retirement options. To do so,  in our December 2012 report, we used data from the seven partial- disability case studies to simulate and compare FERS and FECA benefits  and to highlight various retirement options these partial-disability  beneficiaries may face. As shown in table 3, we found:", "The beneficiaries in case studies 2, 4, and 6 had potential FERS  benefit packages that were higher than their FECA benefits under the  current FECA program and the proposed revision\u2014they would likely  not be affected by the proposed revision.", "The beneficiaries in case studies 1, 3, and 7 had potential FERS  benefit packages that were lower than their FECA benefits under the  current FECA program and the proposed revision\u2014they would likely  face a reduction in FECA benefits in retirement under the proposed  revision.", "The beneficiary in case study 5 had a potential FERS benefit package  that was lower than his FECA benefits under the current FECA  program, but higher than his benefits under the proposed FECA  reduction\u2014he would likely face a reduction in FECA benefits in  retirement under the proposed revision.", "Based on our prior work, we have concluded that the differences in  retirement options that individual beneficiaries face stem from two key  factors: (1) OWCP\u2019s determination of their earning capacities, and (2)  their total years of federal service. Partial-disability beneficiaries with  greater potential for earnings from work receive relatively lower FECA  benefits to account for their relatively lower loss of wage earning capacity,  all else equal. In table 2, beneficiaries with:  low earning capacities post-injury (case studies 1, 3, and 5) had  FECA benefits that were more favorable than FERS benefits; high earning capacities post-injury (case studies 2 and 4) had FECA  benefits that were less favorable than FERS benefits; and mid-range earning capacities post-injury (case studies 6 and 7) had  FECA benefits whose favorability depended on their total years of  federal service. Fewer years of federal service resulted in a lower  FERS annuity and lower Social Security benefits attributable to  federal service, all else equal.", "We have also found that partial-disability beneficiaries who choose to  remain on FECA past retirement age currently face lower FECA benefits  in retirement as compared with total-disability beneficiaries, and would  experience a reduction in benefits under the proposals. Partial-disability  beneficiaries receive FECA benefits that are lower than those of  otherwise identical total-disability beneficiaries to account for their  potential for work earnings. As long as they work, their income is  comprised of their earnings and their FECA benefits. However, once they  choose to retire, partial-disability beneficiaries who choose to stay on  FECA likely no longer have any work earnings and are not eligible to  simultaneously receive their FERS annuity. Thus, we found that  because of the way FECA benefits are currently calculated, such partial- disability beneficiaries may have less income in retirement than otherwise  identical total-disability beneficiaries, and the proposals would reduce  benefits in retirement without differentiating between partial and total- disability beneficiaries. The proposed reduction may serve as a long- term incentive for partial-disability beneficiaries to return to work,particularly because their initial FECA benefits are lower than those of  total-disability beneficiaries.", "In conclusion, FECA continues to play a vital role in providing  compensation to federal employees who are unable to work because of  injuries sustained while performing their federal duties and FECA benefits  generally serve as the exclusive remedy for being injured on the job. Our  simulations of the potential effects of proposed changes to FECA benefit  levels incorporated the kinds of approaches used in the literature on  assessing benefit adequacy for workers\u2019 compensation programs, such  as accounting for missed career growth. More specifically, we assessed  the proposed changes by simulating the level of take-home pay or  retirement benefits FECA beneficiaries would have received if they had  not been injured, which provides a realistic basis for assessing how  beneficiaries may be affected. However, we did not recommend any  particular level of benefit adequacy. As policymakers assess proposed  changes to FECA benefit levels, they will implicitly be making decisions  about what constitutes an adequate level of benefits for FECA  beneficiaries before and after they reach retirement age. While our  analyses focused on how the median FECA beneficiary might be affected  by proposed changes, it also highlighted how potential effects may vary  for different subpopulations of beneficiaries, which can assist  policymakers as they consider such changes to the FECA program. Apart  from proposed changes to FECA benefit levels, the legislative proposal in  the 2016 congressional budget justification for OWCP also seeks to  strengthen FECA program integrity. As policymakers examine proposed  changes to reduce improper payments in the FECA program, they should  consider granting DOL authority to access wage data so the agency does  not have to rely on self-reported income data, as our prior work has  recommended.", "Chairman Walberg, Ranking Member Wilson, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement and I would be  happy to answer any questions that you may have at this time."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For further information regarding this testimony, please contact Andrew  Sherrill at (202) 512-7215 or sherrilla@gao.gov.
