As our society has transitioned from the industrial age to the knowledge age, organizations have come to recognize people as their most critical assets. Because people create knowledge and put it to practical use, the success or failure of federal agencies, like that of other organizations, depends on having the right number of people with the right mix of knowledge and skills. This is especially true in the information technology (IT) area, where widespread shortfalls in human capital have contributed to shortfalls in agency and program performance.", "In previous testimony, we have presented our recommended three-stage approach to human capital reform. First, in the near term, agencies can improve their human capital management by taking advantage of the authorities already available to them under current laws and regulations. Second, the Administration and the Congress should consider legislation to allow agencies more flexibility and give them new tools to attract, retain, and motivate employees\u2014both overall and in critical occupations such as those in IT.

The federal government\u2019s IT investment is conservatively estimated in fiscal year 2002 to be $44 billion\u2014an increase in federal IT spending of 8.6 percent from fiscal year 2000.", "This substantial investment should provide opportunities for increasing productivity and decreasing costs. For example, the public sector is increasingly turning to the Internet to conduct paperless acquisitions, provide interactive electronic services to the public, and tailor or personalize information. As we testified in July, there are over 1,300 electronic government initiatives throughout the federal government, covering a wide range of activities involving interaction with citizens, business, other governments, and government employees. In addition, the Government Paperwork Elimination Act (GPEA) of 1998 requires that by October 21, 2003, federal agencies provide the public (when practicable) the option of submitting, maintaining, and disclosing required information electronically.

Over 10.4 million people in the United States are IT workers, an increase of 4 percent over the 10 million reported for last year.", "Overall estimated demand for IT workers is down from last year\u2019s forecast (by 44 percent), partially because of the slowdown in the high-tech sector and the economy in general. However, the demand for IT workers remains high, as employers attempt to fill over 900,000 new IT jobs in 2001. Hiring managers reported an anticipated shortfall of 425,000 IT workers in 2001 because of a lack of applicants with the requisite technical and nontechnical skills.", "The ITAA also reported that despite softening in overall demand, skills in technical support, database development/administration, programming/ software engineering, web development/administration, and network design/administration remain most in demand by IT and non-IT companies alike. These positions represent nearly 86 percent of the demand for IT workers expected in 2001.

These evaluations focused on agency practices needed to maintain and enhance the capabilities of IT staff. These practices fall in four key areas:   Requirements\u2014assessing the knowledge and skills needed to effectively perform IT operations to support agency mission and goals   Inventory\u2014determining the knowledge and skills of current IT staff so that gaps in needed capabilities can be identified   Workforce strategies and plans\u2014developing strategies and implementing plans for hiring, training, and professional development to fill the gap between requirements and current staffing   Progress evaluation\u2014evaluating progress made in improving IT human capital capability, and using the results of these evaluations to continuously improve the organization\u2019s human capital strategies In July, we reported that agencies\u2019 progress in addressing IT human capital strategies had been sluggish. Specifically, we stated that although agencies were initiating strategies and plans to attract, retain, and/or train a skilled IT workforce, key issues in each of the four areas mentioned above were not being effectively addressed.", "In the area of requirements, several of the agencies we reviewed had begun evaluating their short and longer term IT needs. However, none of them had completed these efforts. For instance, we found that the Small Business Administration did not have any policies or procedures to identify requirements for IT skills. Also, although the U.S. Coast Guard had conducted an assessment of the knowledge and skills needed by its IT officers and enlisted personnel, it had not done so for its civilian workforce.", "Although an IT inventory identifying the knowledge and skills of current staff is essential to uncovering gaps between current staff and requirements, our work to date has revealed that none of the reviewed agencies had a complete knowledge and skills inventory. For example, the U.S. Coast Guard and the Small Business Administration maintained a limited amount of information on IT knowledge and skills, and the Social Security Administration lacked an IT-specific knowledge and skills inventory.", "In addition to establishing requirements and creating an inventory, an agency needs to develop a workforce plan that is linked to its strategic and program planning efforts. The workforce plan should identify its current and future human capital needs, including the size of the workforce, its deployment across the organization, and the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for the agency to pursue its shared vision. The workforce planning strategy should specifically outline the steps and processes that an agency should follow when hiring, training, and professionally developing staff to fill the gap between requirements and current staffing. Among the four agencies we reviewed, none had developed comprehensive IT-specific workforce strategies or plans. For example, although the Social Security Administration did have a broad workforce transition plan that includes actions to improve its processes (for projecting workforce needs, for recruiting, and for training and developing employees), these actions were not specific to IT staff.", "Finally, meaningful progress evaluation systems are necessary to determine whether agency human capital efforts are effective and to ensure that the results of these evaluations are used to make improvements. While agencies we reviewed did track various human capital efforts, such as progress in filling IT positions, none of the agencies had fully analyzed or reported on the effectiveness of their workforce strategies and plans.", "Shortcomings in IT human capital management have serious ramifications. Without complete assessments of requirements, agencies will lack assurance that they have identified the number of staff and the specific knowledge and skills needed or that they have developed strategies to fill these needs. Also, without an inventory of knowledge and skills, agencies will not have assurance that they are optimizing the use of their current IT workforce, nor will they have data on the extent of skill gaps. This information is necessary for developing effective workforce strategies and plans. If they cannot analyze and document the effectiveness of workforce strategies and plans, senior decisionmakers will lack assurance that they are effectively addressing knowledge and skill gaps."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Agency Reliance on Contracted IT Services Requires Improved Oversight Capabilities", "paragraphs": ["Judging from trends, the shortage of qualified IT professionals is likely to lead to greater reliance on contracted workers, so that agencies can supplement their existing workforces with external expertise.

We have previously reported that some procurements of services are not being done efficiently, putting taxpayer dollars at risk. In particular, agencies were not clearly defining their requirements, fully considering alternative solutions, performing vigorous price analyses, or adequately overseeing contractor performance. Also, agencies appear to be at risk of not having enough of the right people with the right skills to manage service procurements. Following a decade of downsizing and curtailed investments in human capital, federal agencies currently face skills, knowledge, and experience imbalances that, without corrective action, will worsen, especially in light of the numbers of federal workers becoming eligible to retire in the coming years. Consequently, a key question we face in the federal government is whether we have today, or will have tomorrow, the ability to acquire and manage the procurement of the increasingly sophisticated services that the government needs.", "Department of Defense (DOD) found that its workforce reductions had led to a serious shortfall in the acquisition workforce. To improve the efficiency of contracting operations\u2014and in part to help offset the effects of this shortfall\u2014the department instituted streamlined acquisition procedures. However, the DOD Inspector General reported that the efficiency gains from the streamlined procedures had not kept pace with acquisition workforce reductions. The Inspector General reported that while the workforce had been reduced by half, DOD\u2019s contracting workload had increased by about 12 percent and that senior personnel at 14 acquisition organizations believed that workforce reductions had led to such problems as less contractor oversight.", "Unless these reductions in the acquisition workforce are addressed, they could undermine the government\u2019s ability to efficiently acquire contract services, including IT services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recommendations Regarding IT Human Capital Have Been Consistent", "paragraphs": ["The challenges facing the government in maintaining a high-quality IT workforce are long-standing and widely recognized. As far back as 1994, our study of leading organizations revealed that strengthening the skills of IT professionals is a critical aspect of strategic information management.Specifically, leading organizations identify existing IT skills and needed future skills, as well as determining the right skill mix. Accordingly, we suggested that executives should systematically identify IT skill gaps and targets and integrate skill requirements into performance evaluations. In our more recent study of public and private sector efforts to build effective Chief Information Officer (CIO) organizations, we found that leading organizations develop IT human capital strategies to assess their skill bases and recruit and retain staff who can effectively implement information technology to meet business needs. capital challenges and suggest possible solutions, the CIO Council asked the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA) to study IT compensation strategies and to make recommendations on how the government can best compete for IT talent.", "NAPA\u2019s resulting study noted a number of problems inherent in the federal government\u2019s human resource management system. These problems included a pay gap with the private sector and a compensation system that is overly focused on internal equity. The study commented that current pay disparities with the private sector, overly narrow pay ranges, and the inadequacy of special pay rates hinder the government\u2019s ability to compete for IT workers. Regarding compensation, the study noted that the current system is closely aligned with internal equity by law, regulation, and practice, with little real attention paid to external equity and contribution equity. According to the study, private sector organizations typically consider and establish a strategic balance among internal, external, and contribution equity in determining pay rates and reward structures.", "NAPA\u2019s study also includes an evaluation of two alternative compensation models. The first of these makes limited changes to the current General Schedule (GS) system, such as eliminating steps and combining some grades. The second is a market-based model that introduces more comprehensive reforms, including increased emphasis on performance and competencies. NAPA\u2019s study concluded that the second model embodies the best approach to human capital reform.

The new compensation system would ensure that managers have the flexibility to pay individual workers for their respective skills and competencies as well as their contributions to the organization. The new compensation system for IT professionals needs to be linked to faster, enhanced recruitment and hiring processes. A new federal IT compensation system would provide a better balance among internal equity (that is, equity among government jobs), external equity (between jobs in the government and in other sectors), and contribution equity (among individual employees). The new system would offer a more competitive benefits package for senior technical employees as well as executives. Federal managers and human resources specialists must actively market work/life benefits and programs so that potential IT workers are aware of them. Managers must (1) actively participate in the design and implementation of agency-specific features of the new system, (2) be rewarded for effectively implementing and managing the system, and (3) be held accountable for not carrying out their management responsibilities. Agency management should design and support developmental activities such as formalized training, on-the-job training, computer-assisted learning, self- instructional guides, coaching, and other approaches. Agency budgets and management decisions must support full implementation of the new system. The new system must be reliable, meaning that it consistently conforms with policies so that the same set of circumstances always leads to a fair decision and result.", "Although we have not analyzed all aspects of these recommendations, many of them are consistent with suggestions we have made in prior testimonies, as well as with the practices that we have instituted in our own internal human capital management. For example, we have suggested that government pay systems should be based on performance and contributions rather than on longevity. Similarly, in our own human capital management at GAO, we have implemented pay for performance and are developing a competency-based evaluation system. We have also suggested that government employers use more flexible approaches to setting pay; in our own human capital management system, we have instituted broad pay bands for mission staff. More examples are given in table 2, which compares the NAPA recommendations with related suggestions we have made in previous work and practices we have adopted within GAO.", "As noted in table 2, we have identified and made use of a variety of tools and flexibilities to address our human capital challenges; some of these were made available to us through the GAO Personnel Act of 1980 and some through legislation passed by the Congress in 2000, but most are available to all federal agencies. Figure 1 shows those flexibilities that were made available to us through legislation.", "Regarding our own IT and other technical staff, we have taken a number of steps to address our workforce needs, including the following:   Using a 25-percent pay differential (equal to the OPM pay differential for executive branch IT hires) to bring aboard entry-level technical staff for our IT team.", "Offering pay bonuses in attracting and retaining workers for hard-to-fill positions, such as IT positions requiring specific technical skills.", "Making wide use of contractor resources in the IT area to supplement both the numbers and skills of government employees. Currently, about 60 percent of the staff supporting GAO internal IT operations and initiatives are contractor staff. Given staffing constraints and market conditions, we have found this arrangement to work very well. We focus our training of in-house staff on project management, contract management, and technical training to ensure sound project management and oversight of the contractors.

The report identifies strategic management of human capital as an area for governmentwide improvement. In line with suggestions we have made, OMB is expecting agencies to take full advantage of existing authorities to better acquire and develop a high quality IT workforce.

Among the most encouraging developments in this regard have been the efforts of this Subcommittee to draw attention to human capital issues.", "Congress has opportunities available through its confirmation, oversight and appropriations, and legislative roles to ensure that agencies recognize their responsibilities and have the needed tools to manage their people for results. For example, Congress can draw wider attention to the critical role of human capital in the confirmation process, during which the Senate can make clear its commitment to sound federal management and explore what prospective nominees plan to do to ensure that their agencies recognize and enhance the value of their people.", "As part of the oversight and appropriations processes, Congress can examine whether agencies are effectively managing their human capital programs. It can also encourage more agencies to use the flexibilities available to them under current law and to reexamine their approaches to strategic human capital management in the context of their individual missions, goals, and other organizational needs. needs, the constraints under which they presently operate, and the flexibilities available to them.
