Federal and state Medicaid spending on home- and community-based services was about $80 billion in 2014. Personal care services are a key component of this care. States can offer personal care services through many different types of programs, and each may be subject to different federal requirements established by statute, regulations, and guidance. The provision of personal care in beneficiaries' homes can pose safety risks, and these services have a high and growing rate of improper payments, including cases where services for which the state was billed were not provided. In recent years Congress has directed HHS to improve coordination of these programs which could harmonize requirements--that is, implement a more consistent administration of policies and procedures--and enhance oversight.", "This statement highlights key issues regarding (1) the federal program requirements to protect beneficiaries' safety and ensure that billed services are provided, and (2) the usefulness of data collected by CMS for oversight. This testimony is based on reports GAO issued in 2016 and 2017. For these reports, GAO assessed CMS data on personal care services provided to beneficiaries and state spending. GAO also reviewed federal statutes, regulations, and guidance, and interviewed CMS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In its November 2016 report, GAO found a patchwork of federal requirements related to how states must protect the safety of beneficiaries in their personal care services programs and to how states ensure that billed services are actually provided. Personal care services help beneficiaries with basic activities of daily living such as bathing and dressing, in a home- or community-based setting. For two types of programs under which personal care services can be offered, states must describe to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) how they will ensure the health and welfare of beneficiaries. Similar requirements were not in place for several other programs GAO examined. In addition, for some but not all personal care services programs that GAO reviewed, states must provide evidence to CMS that the state is paying claims for services that have actually been provided. These differing federal program requirements result in uneven beneficiary safeguards and levels of assurances regarding states' beneficiary protections and oversight of billed services. GAO recommended that CMS take steps to harmonize and achieve a more consistent application of federal requirements across programs. CMS agreed with GAO's recommendation and sought input on how to do so by publishing a request for information.", "In its January 2017 report, GAO found limitations in the data that CMS collects to monitor the provision of personal care services and to monitor state spending on services. For example:", "Data on personal care services provided were often not timely, complete or consistent. The most recent data available during GAO's review (2016) were for 2012 and included data for only 35 states. Further, 15 percent of claims lacked provider identification numbers and 34 percent lacked information on the quantity of services provided. Data were also inconsistent as more than 400 different procedure codes were used by states to identify personal care services. Without timely, complete, and consistent data, CMS is unable to effectively oversee state programs and verify who is providing personal care services or the type, amount, and dates of services provided.", "Data on states' spending on CMS's expenditure reports, the basis for states' receipt of federal matching funds, were not always accurate or complete. From 2012 through 2015, 17 percent of expenditure lines were not reported correctly by states, according to GAO's analysis. Nearly two-thirds of these errors were due to states not separately identifying personal care services expenditures, as required by CMS, from other types of expenditures. Inaccurate and incomplete data limit CMS's ability to, among other oversight functions, ensure federal matching funds are appropriate.", "GAO made several recommendations to improve the data CMS collects to monitor the provision of and expenditures on personal care services.

Medicaid is the  nation\u2019s primary payer of long-term care services and supports for  disabled and aged individuals who may need care for an extended period  of time. Personal care services are a significant and important component  of Medicaid\u2019s long-term care services and supports. Personal care  services provide assistance to beneficiaries of all ages who have limited  ability to care for themselves because of physical, developmental, or  intellectual disabilities, helping them with activities of daily living such as  bathing, dressing, and toileting. Such assistance can enable disabled and  aged beneficiaries to remain in their homes, maintain their independence,  and participate in community life to the fullest extent possible.", "Medicaid spending on long-term care services and supports is significant,  representing more than one-quarter of Medicaid spending annually. The  federal cost of Medicaid long-term care spending is expected to increase  from $75 billion in 2015 to $111 billion in 2026. Historically, Medicaid  spending for long-term care has been largely for services provided in  institutional settings, such as nursing homes. In recent years, this trend  has changed and the majority of federal and state spending has shifted  towards home- and community-based services (HCBS)\u2014that is, services  and assistance provided to beneficiaries in their homes or other settings  integrated with their communities. As a result of the aging of the nation\u2019s  population and increased opportunities for aged and disabled individuals  to live in their homes instead of institutions, the demand for and spending  on HCBS and personal care services is expected to increase.", "Although personal care services are an important support for Medicaid  beneficiaries, provision of these services is not without risk, both for  beneficiary safety and for improper Medicaid payments. Beneficiaries  receiving personal care services include aged individuals and individuals  with physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities, some of whom  can be vulnerable. Also, when personal care services are provided in a  private home, other providers or community members may not be present  to help discourage or report on questionable activities. These factors can  result in some beneficiaries being at risk of unintentional harm and  potential neglect and exploitation. A beneficiary\u2019s capacity to manage  finances and secure possessions may decline with age, onset of  dementia, or other cognitive disabilities, and put them at risk of theft or  financial exploitation from unscrupulous attendants. Moreover,  depending on the particular state and Medicaid program, personal care  attendants who provide services may not be required to have a credential  from an organization that trains workers for certain qualifications. The  provision of personal care services is also at high risk for Medicaid  improper payments, including instances where services for which the  state was billed were not provided. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), estimated that about 12 percent of all states\u2019  payments for personal care services in 2015 were improper\u2014twice the 6  percent error rate estimated for 2014\u2014and that the projected dollar  amount of payment errors was over $3.6 billion, up from $2 billion  estimated for 2014.", "As the agency overseeing Medicaid at the federal level, CMS is  responsible for overseeing state Medicaid programs, including protecting  Medicaid fiscally from improper payments, ensuring that all beneficiaries  are protected, and collecting data from states on Medicaid spending for  services, and the types and volume of services provided, to carry out its  oversight responsibilities. CMS also provides states with guidance on  federal program requirements. Personal care services can be provided  under many different authorities under Medicaid, and states have  developed many different types of programs for delivering personal care  and other home- and community-based services. In recent years,  Congress has directed HHS to improve coordination of these programs,  which could harmonize requirements\u2014that is, implement a more  consistent administration of policies and procedures.

For example, for at least some  personal care services programs, two states required beneficiaries to sign  timesheets, and two states used electronic visit verification timekeeping  systems. All four states performed quality assurance reviews for some  personal care services programs to ensure billed services are received.", "The differing federal program requirements can create complexities for  states and others in understanding federal requirements governing  different types of HCBS programs, including personal care services.  These different requirements may also result in significant differences in  beneficiary safeguards and fiscal oversight, as illustrated in the following  examples:", "Beneficiaries may experience different health and welfare safeguards  depending on the program in which they are enrolled. For example, in  one state we reviewed in 2016, the state required quarterly or  biannual monitoring of beneficiaries for most of its personal care  services programs. In contrast, for another program, the state  required only annual monitoring contacts, in part, officials told us, due  to the differing program requirements. Depending on the program  type, CMS may have fewer assurances that beneficiaries\u2019 with similar  levels of need are in programs with similar protections. For example,  three of the four states we reviewed\u2014Maryland, Oregon, and Texas\u2014 have in recent years transitioned coverage of personal care services  for beneficiaries who need an institutional level of care from personal  care services programs with relatively more stringent federal  beneficiary safety requirements to programs with relatively less  stringent requirements. Although they were not required to do so,  state officials in the three states reported that the states chose to  continue using the same quality assurance measures in the new  programs as the best way to ensure safety for beneficiaries. Without  more harmonized requirements, we concluded that CMS has no  assurance that states that transition personal care services from  HCBS Waivers to Community First Choice in the future will make the  same decisions.", "States can use different processes for each personal care services  program to ensure that billed services are actually provided, and  some programs may not be subject to federal personal care services  requirements explicitly in this regard.

Officials in selected states we  reviewed in 2012 noted the complexity of operating multiple programs.  For example, officials from one state reported that the complexity resulted  in a siloed approach, with different enrollment, oversight, and reporting  requirements for each program. The administration and understanding of  the programs available to beneficiaries was difficult for state staff and  beneficiaries, according to officials in another state. The officials indicated  that they would prefer CMS issue guidance on how states could operate  different HCBS program types together, rather than issuing guidance on  each program separately.", "In our 2016 report, we acknowledged certain efforts CMS had taken to  harmonize requirements and improve oversight of personal care services  programs. However, despite these efforts, we found that significant  differences in program requirements existed. We recommended that CMS  take additional steps to better harmonize and achieve a more consistent  application of program requirements, as appropriate, across the different  personal care services programs in a way that accounts for common risks  faced by beneficiaries and to better ensure billed services were provided.  CMS agreed with these recommendations, and has sought input by  publishing a request for information on numerous topics related to  Medicaid home and community-based services, including input on how to  ensure beneficiary health and safety and program integrity across  different types of personal care services programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data on Personal Care Services Collected by CMS were Often Not Timely, Complete, Consistent, or Accurate Claims and Encounter Data Were Not Timely, Complete, or Consistent", "paragraphs": ["In our 2017 report examining the data CMS uses to monitor the provision  of personal care services, we found that claims and encounter data  collected by CMS were not timely. Data are typically not available for  analysis and reporting by CMS or others for several years after services  are provided. We found that this happens for two reasons. First, although  states have 6 weeks following the completion of a quarter to report their  claims data, their reporting could be delayed as a result of providers and  managed care plans not submitting data in a timely manner, according to  the CMS contractor responsible for compiling data files of Medicaid  claims and encounters. For example, providers may submit claims for  fee-for-service payments to the state late and providers may need to  resubmit claims to make adjustments or corrections before they can be  paid by the state. Second, once complete MSIS data are submitted by the  states, the data must be compiled into annual person-level claims files  that are in an accessible format, checked to identify and correct data  errors, and consolidated for any claims with multiple records. This  process, for one year of data, can take several years and, as a result,  when information from claims and encounters becomes available for use  by CMS for purposes of program management and oversight it could be  several years old.", "We also found that Medicaid personal care services claims and encounter  data that CMS collects were incomplete in two ways. First, specific data  on beneficiaries\u2019 personal care services were not included in the calendar  year 2012 MSIS data for 16 states, as of 2016, when we conducted our  analysis. Nevertheless, these 16 states received federal matching funds  for the $4.2 billion in total fee-for-service payments for personal care  services that year\u2014about 33 percent of total expenditures for personal  care services reported by all states (see figure 2).", "Second, even for the 35 states for which 2012 MSIS claims and  encounter data were available, certain data elements collected by CMS  were incomplete. For example, for the records we analyzed, 20 percent  included no payment information, 15 percent included no provider  identification number to identify the provider of service, and 34 percent  did not identify the quantity of services provided (see figure 3).", "Incomplete data limit CMS\u2019s ability to track spending changes and  corroborate spending with reported expenditures because the agency  lacked important information on a significant amount of Medicaid  payments for personal care services. For example, among the 2012  claims we reviewed for personal care services under a fee-for-service  delivery model, claims without a provider identification number accounted  for about $4.9 billion in total payments. Similarly, payments for fee-for- service claims with missing information on the quantity of personal care  services provided totaled about $5.1 billion. These data gaps represented  a significant share of total personal care services spending, which totaled  about $15 billion in fee-for-service expenditures in 2015.", "Even when states\u2019 claims and encounter data collected by CMS was  complete, we found that it was often inconsistent, which limits the  effectiveness of the data to identify questionable claims and encounters.  For purposes of oversight, a complete record (claims or encounters)  should include data for each visit with a provider or caregiver, with dates  of when services were provided, the amount of services provided using a  clearly specified unit of service (e.g., 15 minutes), and the type of  services provided using a standard definition. Such a complete record  would allow CMS and states to analyze claims to identify potential fraud  and abuse. The following examples illustrate inconsistencies in data  regarding when services were provided and the types of services that  were provided from the 35 states whose data we reviewed:", "When services were provided. State-reported dates of service were  overly broad. In the 35 states, some claims for personal care services  had dates of services (i.e., start and end dates) that spanned multiple  days, weeks, and in some cases months. For 12 of the 35 states, 95  percent of their claims were billed for a single day of service.  However, in other states, a number of claims were billed over longer  time periods. For example, for 10 of the states, 5 percent of claims  covered a period of at least 1 month, and 9 states submitted claims  that covered 100 or more days. When states report dates of service  that are imprecise, it is difficult to determine the specific date for which  services were provided and identify whether services were claimed  during a period when the beneficiary is not eligible to receive personal  care services\u2014for example, when hospitalized for acute care  services.", "Type of services provided. States used hundreds of different  procedure codes for personal care services. Procedure codes on  submitted claims and encounters were inconsistent in three ways: the  number of codes used by states; the use of both national and state- specific codes; and the varying definitions of different codes across  states. More than 400 unique procedure codes were used by the 35  states. CMS does not require that states use standard procedure  codes for personal care services; instead, states have the discretion  to use state-based procedure codes of their own choosing or national  procedure codes. As a result, the procedure codes used for similar  services differed from state to state, which limits CMS\u2019s ability to use  this data as a tool to compare and track changes in the use of specific  personal care services provided to beneficiaries because CMS cannot  easily compare similar procedures by comparing service procedure  codes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Medicaid Expenditure Data Collected by CMS Were Not Always Accurate or Complete", "paragraphs": ["In our 2017 report we found that Medicaid personal care services  expenditure data collected were not always accurate or complete,  according to our analysis of expenditure data collected by CMS from  states for calendar years 2012 through 2015. When submitting  expenditure data, CMS requires states to report expenditures for personal  care services on specific reporting lines. These reporting lines correspond  with the specific types of programs under which states have received  authority to cover personal care services, and can affect the federal  matching payment amounts states receive when seeking federal  reimbursement. For example, a 6 percent increase in federal matching is  available for services provided through the Community First Choice  program. For three other types of HCBS programs, CMS also requires  states to report their expenditures for personal care services separately  from other types of services provided under each program on what CMS  refers to as feeder forms\u2014that is, individual expenditure lines for different  types of services that feed into the total HCBS spending amount for each  program.", "We found that not all states were reporting their personal care services  expenditures accurately, and, as result, personal care services  expenditures may have been underreported or reported in an incorrect  category. We compared personal care services expenditures for all states  for calendar years 2012 through 2015 with each state\u2019s approved  programs during this time period and found that about 17 percent of  personal care services expenditure lines were not reported correctly. As illustrated in figure 4, nearly two-thirds of the reporting errors were a  result of states not separately identifying and reporting personal care  services expenditures using the correct reporting lines, as required by  CMS. Without separate reporting of personal care expenditures as  required, CMS is unable to ensure appropriate federal payment, monitor  how spending changes over time across the different program types and  have an accurate estimate of the magnitude of potential improper  payments for personal care services. The other types of errors involved  states erroneously reporting expenditures that did not correspond with  approved programs. As a result, CMS is not able to efficiently and  effectively identify and prevent states from receiving federal matching  funds inappropriately, in part because it does not have accurate fee-for- service claims data that track payments by personal care program type  that is linked with expenditures reported for purpose of federal  reimbursement.", "These errors demonstrated that CMS was not effectively ensuring its  reporting requirements for personal care expenditures were met. We  concluded that by not ensuring that states are accurately reporting  expenditures for personal care services, CMS is unable to accurately  identify total expenditures for personal care services, expenditures by  program, and changes over time. According to CMS, expenditures that  states reported through MBES are subject to a variance analysis, which  identifies significant changes in reported expenditures from year to year.  However, CMS\u2019s variance analysis did not identify any of the reporting  errors that we found. CMS officials told us that they would continue to  review states\u2019 quarterly expenditure reports for significant variances and  follow up on such variances.", "In our 2017 report, we acknowledged certain efforts CMS had taken to  improve the data it collects. However, these efforts had not addressed  data issues we identified that limited the usefulness of the data for  oversight. We recommended that CMS take steps to improve the  collection of complete and consistent personal care services data and  better monitor the states\u2019 provision of and spending on Medicaid personal  care services. Specifically, CMS agreed with recommendations to better  ensure states comply with data reporting requirements and to develop  plans for analyzing and using the data. The agency neither agreed nor  disagreed with recommendations to issue guidance to ensure key data  regarding claims and encounter data are complete and consistent, or with  a recommendation to ensure claims data can be accurately linked with  aggregate expenditure data. In light of our findings of inconsistent and  incomplete reporting of claims and encounters, errors in reporting  expenditures, and the high-risk of improper payments, we believe action  in response to these recommendations is needed.", "In conclusion, Medicaid personal care services are an important benefit  for a significant number of Medicaid beneficiaries and amount to billions  of dollars in spending to the federal government and states. The demand  and spending for personal care services continues to grow. However, the  services are not without risk. Personal care services are at high risk for  improper payments and beneficiaries may be vulnerable and at risk of  unintentional harm and potential neglect and exploitation. Over the years,  federal laws have given states a number of different options to provide  home- and community- based services. Having various options for  providing personal care services provides flexibilities for states in how  they administer their programs and provide services to different groups of  beneficiaries. At the same time, our work has also found a patchwork of  federal requirements, resulting in varying levels of beneficiary safeguards  and requirements to ensure that billed services are actually provided. As  a result, beneficiaries with similar needs could be receiving services in  programs with significantly different safeguards in place, depending on  the program. Similarly, the level of assurance that billed services are  actually provided could vary based on the type of program. Further, our  work showed that the data CMS collects for oversight of these programs  is not always timely, complete, accurate, and consistent. Without better  data, CMS is hindered in effectively performing key management  functions related to personal care services, such as ensuring state claims  for enhanced federal matching funds are accurate. CMS has taken steps  to improve the data it collects from states, and to establish more  consistent administration of policies and procedures across the programs  under which personal care services are provided. However, we found  additional steps are warranted.", "Chairman Murphy, Ranking Member DeGette, and Members of the  Subcommittee this concludes my prepared statement.
