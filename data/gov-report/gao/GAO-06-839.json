In August 2004, GAO recommended that the Department of Defense (DOD) consider requiring program offices to develop acquisition strategies that provide for future delivery of technical data should the need arise to select an alternative source for logistics support or to offer the work out for competition.

The lack of technical data rights has limited the services' flexibility to make changes to sustainment plans that are aimed at achieving cost savings and meeting legislative requirements regarding depot maintenance capabilities. GAO identified seven weapon system programs that encountered such limitations--C-17, F-22, and C-130J aircraft, Up-armored High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicle, Stryker family of vehicles, Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft, and M4 carbine. Although the circumstances surrounding each case were unique, earlier decisions made on technical data rights during system acquisition were cited as a primary reason for the limitations subsequently encountered. As a result of the limitations encountered, the services had to alter their plans for developing maintenance capability at public depots, developing new sources of supply to increase production, or soliciting competitive offers for the acquisition of spare parts and components to reduce sustainment costs. For example, the Air Force identified a need to develop a core maintenance capability for the C-17 at government depots to ensure it had the ability to support national defense emergencies, but it lacked the requisite technical data rights. To mitigate this limitation, the Air Force is seeking to form partnerships with C-17 sub-vendors. However, according to Air Force officials, some sub-vendors have declined to provide the needed technical data needed to develop core capability. Although GAO did not assess the rationale for the decisions made on technical data rights during system acquisition, several factors, such as the extent the system incorporates technology that was not developed with government funding and the potential for changes in the technical data over the weapon system's life cycle, may complicate program managers' decisions. Current DOD acquisition policies do not specifically address long-term technical data rights for weapon system sustainment. For example, DOD's policies do not require program managers to assess long-term needs for technical data rights to support weapon systems and, correspondingly, to develop acquisition strategies that address those needs. DOD, as part of the department's acquisition reforms and performance-based strategies, has deemphasized the acquisition of technical data rights. Although GAO has recommended that DOD emphasize the need for technical data rights, DOD has not implemented these recommendations. The Army and the Air Force have recognized weaknesses in their approaches to assessing and securing technical data rights and have begun to address these weaknesses by developing more structured approaches. However, DOD acquisition policies do not facilitate these efforts. Unless DOD assesses and secures its rights for the use of technical data early in the weapon system acquisition process when it has the greatest leverage to negotiate, DOD may face later challenges in sustaining weapon systems over their life cycle."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["A critical element in the life cycle of a weapon system is the availability of  the item\u2019s technical data\u2014that is, recorded information used to define a  design and to produce, support, maintain, or operate the item.

During the acquisition process, DOD determines what technical data rights  it requires from the manufacturer in order to meet its future weapon  support needs.  Because a weapon system may remain in the defense  inventory for decades following initial acquisition, decisions made at the  time of acquisition can have far-reaching implications for weapon system  support over the system\u2019s life cycle, and the failure to negotiate adequate  technical data rights may impede the government\u2019s ability to sustain the  weapon system.  For example, DOD would need technical data rights to  develop new sources of supply, to recompete follow-on procurements of  equipment, or to develop depot-level maintenance capabilities.  In an  August 2004 report, we recommended that DOD consider requiring  program offices to develop acquisition strategies that provide for a future  delivery of technical data should the need arise to select an alternative  source for logistics support or to offer the work out for competition.

In February 2006, we briefed your offices on our preliminary observations  (see app. I). This report updates and expands on the information in that  briefing and provides recommendations to the Secretary of Defense.   Specifically, our objectives were to (1) evaluate how Army and Air Force  sustainment plans for fielded weapon systems had been affected by  technical data rights and (2) examine requirements for obtaining technical  data rights under current DOD acquisition policies.  The House Report also  asked us to review the military services\u2019 access to technical data to support  field maintenance of weapon systems and to examine the costs for gaining  such access.  These issues are addressed in appendix I.", "To conduct our review, we met with Army and Air Force acquisition and  logistics officials to identify sustainment plans for fielded weapon systems  that may have been affected by the technical data rights available to the  government.  We discussed, and obtained supporting documentation on,  the circumstances surrounding these cases, the extent that a lack of  technical data rights for these systems was a factor, and the effect on the  systems\u2019 sustainment plans.  We did not assess the rationale for the  decisions made on technical data rights during system acquisition, nor did  we determine the extent that program offices complied with acquisition  policies regarding technical data that existed at the time of the acquisition.   We analyzed current DOD acquisition policies and guidance, interviewed  DOD and service officials, and collected DOD correspondence addressing  our August 2004 recommendation.   We met with Army and Air Force  logistics officials to obtain information on their efforts to review  acquisition policies and practices regarding technical data rights.  We  determined that the data used were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

As part of these improvements, program  managers are now responsible for the total life-cycle management of a  weapon system, to include the sustainment of the system.  In addition,  DOD has directed weapon system program managers to develop  acquisition strategies that maximize competition, innovation, and  interoperability and the use of commercial, rather than military-unique, items to reduce costs.  Within the area of weapon system sustainment,  DOD is pursuing the use of performance-based logistics as the preferred  support strategy for its weapon systems. Performance-based logistics, a  variation on other contractor logistics support strategies calling for the  long-term support of weapon systems, involves defining a level of  performance that the weapon system is to achieve over a period of time at a  fixed cost to the government.", "Technical data rights can affect DOD\u2019s plans to sustain weapon systems  throughout their life cycle.  For example, DOD would need technical data  rights if it opts to reduce spare parts costs by developing new sources of  supply, to meet wartime surge requirements by contracting with additional  equipment suppliers, or to reduce system acquisition costs by recompeting  follow-on procurements of the equipment.  In addition, DOD may need to  develop depot-level maintenance capabilities for its weapon systems at  government depots in order to meet legislative requirements.  DOD is  required under 10 U.S.C. 2464 to identify and maintain within government- owned and government-operated facilities a core logistics capability,  including the equipment, personnel, and technical competence identified as  necessary for national defense emergencies and contingencies. Under   10 U.S.C. 2466, not more than 50 percent of the funds made available in a  fiscal year to a military department or defense agency for depot-level repair  and maintenance can be used to contract for performance by nonfederal  personnel.  These provisions can limit the amount of depot-level  maintenance that can be performed by contractors.  Finally, DOD would  also need technical data rights for a weapon system should a contractor fail  to perform, including a contractor working under a performance-based  logistics arrangement.  DOD has referred to this contingency as an \u201cexit  strategy.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army and Air Force Encountered Limitations in Their Sustainment Plans for Some Fielded Weapon Systems", "paragraphs": ["The Army and the Air Force have encountered limitations in their  sustainment plans for some fielded weapon systems because they lacked  needed technical data rights.

We did not assess the rationale for the  decisions made on technical data rights during the acquisition of these  systems.", "The seven weapon system programs we identified where a lack of technical  data rights affected the implementation of sustainment plans are  summarized below:  C-17 aircraft: When the Air Force began acquisition of the C-17 aircraft,  it did not acquire technical data rights needed to support maintenance  of the aircraft at public depots.  According to a program official, the Air  Force did not consider the aircraft\u2019s depot maintenance workload as  necessary to support DOD\u2019s depot maintenance core capability.   Subsequently, however, the Air Force\u2019s 2001 depot maintenance core  assessment identified the C-17 aircraft workload as necessary to  support core capability.  The Air Force determined that it did not have  the technical data rights needed to perform the required maintenance.   According to C-17 program officials, the C-17 prime contractor did not  acquire data rights for C-17 components provided by sub-vendors and  consequently was not able to provide the needed data rights to the Air  Force.  The prime contractor has encouraged its sub-vendors to  cooperate with the Air Force in establishing partnerships to accomplish  the needed core depot maintenance.   Under these partnerships, Air  Force depots would provide the facilities and labor needed to perform  the core depot maintenance work, and the sub-vendor would provide  the required technical data.  According to Air Force officials, there are  some instances where the sub-vendor is unwilling to provide the needed  technical data.  For example, in the case of the C-17\u2019s inertial navigation  unit, the sub-vendor maintains that the inertial navigation unit is a  commercial derivative item and the technical data needed to repair the  item are proprietary.  As of April 18, 2006, the sub-vendor was declining  to provide the technical data needed to the Air Force.  Without the rights  to the technical data or a partnership with the sub-vendor, the Air Force  cannot develop a core maintenance capability for this equipment item.", "F-22 aircraft:  The acquisition of the Air Force\u2019s F-22 aircraft did not  include all of the technical data needed for establishing required core  capability workload at Air Force depots.  Early in the F-22 aircraft\u2019s  acquisition, the Air Force planned to use contractors to provide needed  depot-level maintenance and therefore decided not to acquire some  technical data rights from sub-vendors in order to reduce the aircraft\u2019s  acquisition cost.  Subsequently, however, the Air Force determined that  portions of the F-22 workload were needed to satisfy core depot  maintenance requirements.  The Air Force is currently negotiating  contracts for the technical data rights needed to develop depot-level  maintenance capability.  While the Air Force has negotiated contracts to  acquire technical data for four F-22 aircraft components, F-22 program  officials expressed concern that it may become difficult to successfully  negotiate rights to all components.", "C-130J aircraft:  The Air Force purchased the C-130J aircraft as a  commercial item and, as such, did not obtain technical data rights  needed to competitively purchase C-130J-unique spare parts and  components or to perform depot-level maintenance core workload.   The C-130J shares many common components with earlier versions of  the C-130 for which the government has established DOD and  contractor repair sources. In 2004, the DOD Inspector General reported  that the Air Force\u2019s use of a commercial item acquisition strategy was unjustified to acquire the C-130J aircraft.  In response to the Inspector  General\u2019s findings and added congressional interest, the Air Force is  converting its C-130J acquisition to traditional defense system  acquisition and sustainment contracts.   However, because the Air Force  did not acquire the necessary technical data during the acquisition  process, it has less leverage to negotiate rights to data. In 2005, the Air  Force approached the aircraft manufacturer to purchase technical data  rights for C-130J-unique components, but the aircraft manufacturer  declined to sell the data rights.  Because of its lack of the needed  technical data, the Air Force is planning to establish partnerships with  C-130J sub-vendors that have technical data rights to components of the  C-130J.  Under these partnerships, Air Force depots would provide the  facilities and labor needed to perform the core depot maintenance work,  and the sub-vendors would provide the required technical data. C-130J  program officials expressed concerns that in some instances sub- vendors may not be willing to partner.  The Air Force currently expects  to develop approximately 90 partnerships with as many different  vendors on approximately 300 C-130J core candidate components.  Program officials expressed concern about the proliferation of  partnerships and said the Air Force will incur additional costs to  develop, manage, and monitor these partnerships, but they had not  determined what these costs will be.", "Up-armored High-Mobility Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles: When the  Army first developed the up-armored HMMWV in 1993, it did not  purchase the technical data necessary to develop new sources of supply  to increase production.  Army officials anticipated fielding these  vehicles to a limited number of Army units for reconnaissance and  peacekeeping purposes.   At that time, the Army did not obtain technical  data required for the manufacture of up-armor HMMWVs.  With the  increasing threat of improvised explosive devices during operations in  Iraq, demand for up-armored HMMWVs increased substantially, from  1,407 vehicles in August 2003 to 8,105 vehicles by September 2004.   According to Army officials, the manufacturer declined to sell the rights  to the technical data package.  Because of the lack of technical data  rights to produce up-armored HMMWVs, program officials explained  they were unable to rapidly contract with alternate suppliers to meet the  wartime surge requirement.", "Stryker family of vehicles: When acquiring the Stryker, the Army did not  obtain technical data rights needed to develop competitive offers for the  acquisition of spare parts and components.  Following the initial  acquisition, the program office analyzed alternatives to the interim  contractor support strategy for the weapon system and attempted to  acquire rights to the manufacturer\u2019s technical data package.  The  technical data package describes the parts and equipment in sufficient  technical detail to allow the Army to use competition to lower the cost  of parts.  The contractor declined to sell the Stryker\u2019s technical data  package to the Army.  Further, according to an Army Audit Agency  report, the project office stated that the cost of the technical data, even  if available, would most likely be prohibitively expensive at this point in  the Stryker\u2019s fielding and would likely offset any cost savings resulting  from competition.", "Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft:  The Air Force lacked  technical data for the AWACS needed to develop competitive offers for  the purchase of certain spare parts.  When the Air Force recently  purchased cowlings (metal engine coverings) for the AWACS, it did so  on a noncompetitive, sole-source basis.  The Defense Contract  Management Agency recommended that the cowlings be competed  because the original equipment manufacturer\u2019s proposed price was not  fair and reasonable and because another potential source for the part  was available.  Despite the recommendation, however, the Air Force  said it lacked the technical data to compete the purchase.  We noted that  while the Air Force and the original equipment supplier have a contract  that could allow the Air Force to order technical drawings for the  purpose of purchasing replenishment spare parts, the contractor had  not always delivered such data based on uncertainties concerning the  Air Force\u2019s rights to the data.", "M4 carbine:  When the Army purchased its new M4 carbine, it did not  acquire the technical data rights necessary to recompete follow-on  purchases of the carbine.  The M4 carbine is a derivative of the M16 rifle  and shares 80 percent of its parts with the M16.  However, because the  remaining 20 percent of parts were funded by the developer, the Army  did not have all the rights needed to compete subsequent manufacture  of the M4.  The Army estimated that the unit cost is about twice as much  for the M4 compared with the M16, despite increases in procurement  quantities for the M4 and the large commonality of parts.  According to  Army officials, having the technical data rights for the M16 allowed the  Army to recompete the procurement of the rifle, resulting in a  significantly decreased unit procurement cost.", "Although we did not assess the rationale for the decisions made on  technical data rights during the acquisition of these systems, several  factors may complicate program managers\u2019 decisions on long-term  technical data rights for weapon systems.  These factors include the  following:  The contractor\u2019s interests in protecting its intellectual property rights.", "Because contractors need to protect their intellectual property from  uncompensated use, they often resist including contract clauses that  provide technical data rights to the government.", "The extent to which the system being acquired incorporates technology  that was not developed with government funding.  According to DOD\u2019s  acquisition guidance, the government\u2019s funding of weapon system  development determines the government\u2019s rights to technical data.   Weapon systems are frequently developed with some mix of contractor  and government funding, which may present challenges to DOD in  negotiating technical data rights with the contractor.", "The potential for changes in the technical data over the weapon system\u2019s  life cycle.  The technical data for a weapon system may change over its  life cycle, first as the system\u2019s technology matures and later as the  system undergoes modifications and upgrades to incorporate new  technologies and capabilities.  The potential for changes in technical  data present challenges concerning when the government should take  delivery of technical data, the format used to maintain technical data,  and whether the data should be retained in a government or contractor  repository.", "The extent to which the long-term sustainment strategy may require  rights to technical data versus access to the data.  According to Army  officials, access to contractor technical data is sometimes presented as  an alternative to the government taking delivery of the data.  These  officials noted that while access to technical data may allow for  oversight of the contractor and may reduce the program manager\u2019s data  management costs, it may not provide the government with rights to use  the technical data should a change in the sustainment plan become  necessary.", "The numerous funding and capability trade-offs program managers face  during the acquisition of a weapon system.  Program managers are  frequently under pressure to spend limited acquisition dollars on  increased weapon system capability or increased numbers of systems,  rather than pursuing technical data rights.", "The long life cycle of many weapon systems. With weapon systems  staying in DOD\u2019s inventory for longer periods\u2014up to 40 years, it may be  difficult for the program manager to plan for future contingencies such  as modifications and upgrades, spare parts obsolescence, diminishing  manufacturing support, and diminishing maintenance support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Acquisition Policies Do Not Specifically Address Long-term Needs for Technical Data Rights", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s acquisition policies do not specifically address long-term needs for  technical data rights to sustain weapon systems over their life cycle, and in  the absence of a DOD-wide policy, the Army and the Air Force are working  independently to develop structured approaches for defining technical data  requirements and securing rights to those data.

The  directive, however, does not provide specific guidance as to what factors  program managers should consider in developing a strategy to sustain the  weapon system, including considerations regarding technical data.  DOD  Instruction 5000.2, the agency\u2019s policy for implementing DOD Directive  5000.1, requires program managers to ensure the development of a flexible  strategy to sustain a program so that the strategy may evolve throughout  the weapon system\u2019s life cycle.  In addition, DOD provides non-mandatory  guidebooks to assist program managers with acquisition and product  support.

For example, a 2001 memorandum  signed by DOD\u2019s senior acquisition official stated that the use of  performance-based acquisition strategies may obviate the need for data or  rights. Also in 2001, DOD issued guidance on negotiating intellectual  property rights and stated that program officials should seek to establish  performance-based requirements that enhance long-term competitive interests, in lieu of acquiring detailed design data and data rights. In a  May 2003 revision of its acquisition policy, DOD eliminated a requirement  for program managers to provide for long-term access to technical data and  required them to develop performance-based logistics strategies.", "Even prior to the May 2003 revision of DOD\u2019s acquisition policy, we had  raised concerns about whether DOD placed sufficient emphasis on  obtaining technical data during the acquisition process.  We reported in  2002 that DOD program offices had often failed to place adequate emphasis  on obtaining needed technical data during the acquisition process.  We  recommended that DOD emphasize the importance of obtaining technical  data and consider including a priced option for the purchase of technical  data when considering proposals for new weapon systems or modifications  to existing systems.

We  recommended that DOD consider requiring program offices to develop  acquisition strategies that provide for a future delivery of sufficient  technical data should the need arise to select an alternative source or to  offer the work out for competition.  In response to our recommendation,  DOD concurred that technical, product, and logistics data should be  acquired by the program manager to support the development, production,  operation, sustainment, improvement, demilitarization, and disposal of a  weapon system.  Furthermore, the department recognized the need to take  steps to stress the importance of technical data by its stated intent to  include a requirement in DOD\u2019s acquisition policies (DOD Directive 5000.1  and DOD Instruction 5000.2) for the program managers to establish a data  management strategy that requires access to the minimum data necessary  to sustain the fielded system; to recompete or reconstitute sustainment, if  necessary, to promote real time access to data; and to provide for the  availability of high-quality data at the point of need for the intended user.

The campaign\u2019s policy focus  team is working on the efforts that would provide a more structured  approach to early determination of the government\u2019s technical data rights:  revised polices to require that sustainment support decisions be made  and technical data rights be defined during the technology phase of  acquisition but prior to system development and demonstration;  a standard template for contract solicitations, to be used to guide the  acquisition workforce in securing technical data rights;  contract language to include a priced option for the delivery of technical  data and rights for use of data, which would be negotiated and included  as part of the system development and demonstration solicitation; and  an independent logistics assessment process, to provide an objective  review of the acquisition program office\u2019s sustainment support plans  before major milestone decisions.", "In May 2006, the Secretary of the Air Force directed that the acquisition of  technical data and associated rights be addressed specifically in all  acquisition strategy plans, reviews, and associated planning documents for  major weapon system programs and subsequent source selections.  The  Secretary stated these actions are needed to address challenges in meeting  legislative requirements to maintain a core logistics capability and to limit  the percentage of depot maintenance funds expended for contractor  performance.  The competitive source selection process, according to the  Secretary, provides the best opportunity to address technical data  requirements while at the same time brokering the best deal for the  government in regard to future weapon systems sustainment."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Under current DOD acquisition policies, the military services lack  assurance that they will have the technical data rights needed to sustain  weapon systems throughout their life cycle.  We have previously made  recommendations that DOD enhance its policies regarding technical data.   DOD has concurred with these recommendations but has not implemented  them.  In fact, DOD has de-emphasized the acquisition of technical data  rights as part of the department\u2019s acquisition reforms and performance- based strategies.  Our current work, however, shows that the services face  limitations in their sustainment plans for some fielded weapon systems due  to a lack of needed technical data rights.  Furthermore, program managers  face numerous challenges in making decisions on technical data rights\u2014 decisions that have long-term implications for the life-cycle sustainment of  weapon systems.  Army and Air Force logistics officials have recognized  weaknesses in their approaches to assessing and securing technical data  rights, and each service has begun to address these weaknesses by  developing more structured approaches.  However, current DOD  acquisition policies do not facilitate these efforts.  Unless DOD assesses  and secures its rights for the use of technical data early in the weapon  system acquisition process when it has the greatest leverage to negotiate,  DOD may face later challenges in developing sustainment plans or  changing these plans as necessary over the life cycle of its weapon systems.
