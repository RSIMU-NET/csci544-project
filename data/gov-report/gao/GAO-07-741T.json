Beginning in 2001, GAO published a series of reports examining virtually every aspect of the elections process. GAO's complement of reports was used by Congress in framing the Help America Vote Act of 2002, which, among other things, provided for replacement of older voting equipment with more modern electronic voting systems and established the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) to lead the nation's election reform efforts. GAO's later reports have raised concerns about the security and reliability of these electronic voting systems, examined the EAC's efforts to address these concerns, and surveyed state and local officials about practices used during the 2004 election, as well as plans for their systems for the 2006 election. Using its published work on electronic voting systems, GAO was asked to testify on (1) the contextual role and characteristics of electronic voting systems, (2) the range of security and reliability concerns that have been reported about these systems, (3) the experiences and management practices of states and local jurisdictions regarding these systems, and (4) the longstanding and emerging challenges facing all levels of government in using these systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Voting systems are one facet of a multifaceted, year-round elections process that involves the interplay of people, processes, and technology, and includes all levels of government. How well these systems play their role in an election depends in large part on how well they are managed throughout their life cycles, which begins with defining system standards; includes system design, development, and testing; and concludes with system operations. Important attributes of the systems' performance are security, reliability, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. A range of groups knowledgeable about elections or voting systems have expressed concerns about the security and reliability of electronic voting systems; these concerns can be associated with stages in the system life cycle. Examples of concerns include vague or incomplete voting system standards, system design flaws, poorly developed security controls, incorrect system configurations, inadequate testing, and poor overall security management. For the 2004 national elections, states' and local governments' responses to our surveys showed that they did not always ensure that important life cycle and security management practices were employed for their respective electronic voting systems. In particular, responses indicated that the most current standards were not always adopted and applied, security management practices and controls were employed to varying degrees, and certain types of system testing were not commonly performed. Moreover, jurisdictions' responses showed that they did not consistently monitor the performance of their systems. In GAO's view, the challenges faced in acquiring and operating electronic voting systems are not unlike those faced by any technology user--adoption and application of well-defined system standards; effective integration of the technology with the people who operate it and the processes that govern the operation; rigorous and disciplined performance of system security and testing activities; reliable measurement of system performance; and the analytical basis for making informed, economically justified decisions about voting system investment options. These challenges are complicated by other conditions such as the distribution of responsibilities among various organizations and funding opportunities and constraints. Given the diffused and decentralized allocation of voting system roles and responsibilities across all levels of government, addressing these challenges will require the combined efforts of all levels of government, under the leadership of the EAC. To assist the EAC in executing its leadership role, GAO has previously made recommendations to the commission aimed at better planning its ongoing and future activities relative to, for example, system standards and information sharing. While the EAC agreed with the recommendations, it stated that its ability to effectively execute its role is constrained by a lack of adequate resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on our  nation\u2019s election system.

Our  reports were among the resources that Congress drew on in  enacting the Help America Vote Act (HAVA) of 2002, which  provided a framework for fundamental election administration  reform and created the EAC mission to oversee the election  administration reform process. HAVA also provided for funding to  replace older voting equipment, specifically punch card and  mechanical lever voting equipment and encouraged adoption of  other technology. Subsequently, jurisdictions have increased their  use of electronic voting methods, of which there are two commonly- used types: optical scan and direct recording electronic (DRE)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HAVA Was Enacted to Strengthen the Overall Election Process", "paragraphs": ["Enacted by Congress in October 2002, HAVA affects nearly every  aspect of the voting process, from voting technology to provisional  ballots and from voter registration to poll worker training. In  particular, the act authorized $3.86 billion in funding over several  fiscal years for programs to replace punch card and mechanical  lever voting equipment, improve election administration and  accessibility, train poll workers, and perform research and pilot  studies. HAVA also established the EAC to assist in the  administration of federal elections and provide assistance with the  administration of certain federal election laws and programs. HAVA  also established minimum election administration standards for the  states and units of local government that are responsible for the  administration of federal elections. The act specifically tasked the  EAC to serve as a national clearinghouse and resource for compiling  election information and reviewing election procedures; for  example, it is to conduct periodic studies of election administration  issues, including electronic voting system performance, to promote  methods of voting and administration that are most convenient,  accessible, and easy to use for all voters. Other examples of EAC  responsibilities include developing and adopting voluntary voting system guidelines and  maintaining information on the experiences of states in  implementing the guidelines and operating voting systems;   testing, certifying, decertifying, and recertifying voting system  hardware and software through accredited laboratories; making payments to states to help them improve elections in the  areas of voting systems standards, provisional voting and voting  information requirements, and computerized statewide voter  registration lists; and making grants for research on voting technology improvements.", "The act also established the Technical Guidelines Development  Committee to support the EAC, making it responsible for  recommending voluntary voting system guidelines to the EAC. The  act assigned the National Institute of Standards and Technology  (NIST) responsibility for providing technical support to the  development committee and made the NIST Director the committee  chair.", "The EAC began operations in January 2004, initially focusing on the  distribution of funds to help states meet HAVA\u2019s Title III  requirements for uniform and nondiscriminatory election  technology and administration, including the act\u2019s requirements  pertaining to voting system standards, provisional voting, voting  information, a computerized statewide voter registration list, and  identification for first-time voters who register to vote by mail.  Actions EAC has taken since 2004 to improve voting systems  include publishing the Best Practices Toolkit and specialized  management guides to assist states and local jurisdictions with  managing election-related activities and equipment;  issuing voting system standards in 2005, referred to as the  Voluntary Voting System Guidelines; establishing procedures for certifying voting systems; establishing a program for accreditation of independent testing  laboratories, with support from NIST\u2019s National Voluntary  Laboratory Accreditation Program; disbursing to states approximately $2.3 billion in appropriations  for the replacement of older voting equipment and election  administration improvements under Title III of HAVA; and conducting national surveys of the 2004 general election,  uniformed and overseas voters, and other studies.", "For fiscal year 2006, EAC\u2019s appropriation totaled $14.1 million.

For the November 2004 general  election, optical scan was the predominant voting method for more  than half of local jurisdictions nationwide. In contrast, DREs were  used as the predominant voting method by an estimated 7 percent of  jurisdictions, although they were the predominant voting method for  large jurisdictions. Figure 1 shows the estimated percentage of  small, medium, and large jurisdictions using each predominant  voting method in the 2004 general election.", "Optical scan voting systems use electronic technology to tabulate  paper ballots. For the 2004 general election, we estimated that about  51 percent of all local jurisdictions used optical scan voting  equipment predominantly.", "An optical scan voting system is made up of computer-readable  ballots, appropriate marking devices, privacy booths, and a  computerized tabulation device. The ballot, which can be of various  sizes, lists the names of the candidates and the issues. Voters record  their choices using an appropriate writing instrument to fill in boxes  or ovals or to complete an arrow next to the candidate\u2019s name or the  issue. The ballot includes a space for write-ins to be placed directly  on the ballot.", "Optical scan ballots are tabulated by optical-mark-recognition  equipment (see fig. 2), which counts the ballots by sensing, or  reading, the marks on the ballot. Ballots can be counted at the  polling place\u2014this is referred to as precinct-count optical scan\u2014or  at a central location. If ballots are counted at the polling place,  voters or election officials put the ballots into the tabulation  equipment, which tallies the votes; these tallies can be captured in  removable storage media that are transported to a central tally  location, or they can be electronically transmitted from the polling  place to the central tally location. If ballots are centrally counted,  voters drop ballots into sealed boxes and election officials transfer  the sealed boxes to the central location after the polls close, where  election officials run the ballots through the tabulation equipment.", "Software instructs the tabulation equipment to assign each vote (i.e.,  to assign valid marks on the ballot to the proper candidate or issue).  In addition to identifying the particular contests and candidates, the  software can be configured to capture, for example, straight party  voting and vote-for-no-more-than-N contests. Precinct-based optical  scanners can also be programmed to detect overvotes (where the  voter, for example, votes for two candidates for one office,  invalidating the vote) and undervotes (where the voter does not vote  for all contests or issues on the ballot) and to take some action in  response (rejecting the ballot, for instance), so that voters can fix  their mistakes before leaving the polling place. If ballots are  tabulated centrally, voters do not have the opportunity to detect and  correct mistakes that may have been made. In addition, optical scan  systems often use vote tally software to tally the vote totals from  one or more vote tabulation devices.", "Optical scan systems were widely used as the predominant voting  method for jurisdictions in the 2004 general election and we  reported last year that jurisdictions planned to acquire more of  these systems for the 2006 general election. We estimated that 30  percent of jurisdictions nationwide used precinct count optical scan  voting equipment as their predominant voting method for the 2004  general election, while an estimated 21 percent used central count  optical scan predominantly. While all sizes of jurisdictions had plans  to acquire both precinct count and central count optical scan  systems for the 2006 general election, small jurisdictions showed a  strong preference for acquiring precinct count optical scan systems  (estimated at 28 percent of small jurisdictions) compared with DREs  (13 percent) and central count optical scan (4 percent).", "DREs capture votes electronically without the use of paper ballots.  For the 2004 general election, we estimated that about 7 percent of  all local jurisdictions used DREs predominantly, although 30 percent  of all large jurisdictions used them as the predominant voting  method.", "DREs come in two basic types: pushbutton or touch screen, with  pushbutton being the older technology. The two types vary  considerably in appearance, as shown in figure 3.", "Pushbutton and touch screen units differ significantly in the way  they present ballots to the voter. With the pushbutton type, all ballot  information is presented on a single \u201cfull-face\u201d ballot. For example,  a ballot may have 50 buttons on a 3 by 3 foot ballot, with a candidate  or issue next to each button. In contrast, touch screen DREs display  ballot information on an electronic display screen. For both  pushbutton and touch screen types, the ballot information is  programmed onto an electronic storage medium, which is then  uploaded to the machine. For touch screens, ballot information can  be displayed in color and can incorporate pictures of the candidates.  Because the ballot space on a touch screen is much smaller than on  a pushbutton machine, voters who use touch screens must page  through the ballot information. Both touch screen and pushbutton  DREs can accommodate multilingual ballots.", "Despite the differences between pushbutton and touch screen  DREs, the two types have some similarities, such as how the voter  interacts with the voting equipment. To make a ballot selection,  voters press a button or the screen next to the candidate or issue,  and the button or screen then lights up to indicate the selection.  When voters are finished making their selections, they cast their  votes by pressing a final \u201cvote\u201d button or screen. Until they hit this  final button or screen, voters can change their selections. DREs are  designed to not allow overvotes. Both types allow voters to write in  candidates. While most DREs allow voters to type write-ins on a  keyboard, some pushbutton types require voters to write the name  on paper tape that is part of the device. In addition, different types  of DREs offer a variety of options that jurisdictions may choose to  purchase, such as printed receipts or audio interfaces for voters  with disabilities.", "Although DREs do not receive paper ballots, they can retain  permanent electronic images of all the ballots, which can be stored  on various media, including internal hard disk drives, flash cards, or  memory cartridges. According to vendors, these ballot images,  which can be printed, can be used for auditing and recounts.", "Like optical scan devices, DREs require the use of software to  program the various ballot styles and tally the votes, which is  generally done through the use of memory cartridges or other  media. Some of the newer DREs use smart card technology as a  security feature. Smart cards are plastic devices\u2014about the size of a  credit card\u2014that use integrated circuit chips to store and process  data, much like a computer. Smart cards are generally used as a  means to open polls and to authorize voter access to ballots. For  instance, smart cards on some DREs store program data on the  election and are used to help set up the equipment; during setup,  election workers verify that the card received is for the proper  election. Other DREs are programmed to automatically activate  when the voter inserts a smart card; the card brings up the correct  ballot onto the screen.", "DREs offer various configurations for tallying the votes. Some  contain removable storage media that can be taken from the voting  device and transported to a central location to be tallied. Others can  be configured to electronically transmit the vote totals from the  polling place to a central tally location. Vote tally software is often  used to tally the vote totals from one or more units.", "DREs were chosen as the predominant voting method by a relatively  small overall proportion of local jurisdictions for the 2004 general  election (7 percent overall). However, as previously shown in figure  1, large and medium jurisdictions identified DREs as their  predominant voting method (estimated at 30 percent and 20 percent  of jurisdictions, respectively) more often than small jurisdictions  (estimated at 1 percent).

It has passed  legislation affecting the administration of state elections that  addresses voter registration, absentee voting, accessibility  provisions for the elderly and handicapped, and prohibitions  against discriminatory practices. Congress does not have general  constitutional authority over the administration of state and local  elections.", "At the state level, the states are responsible for the administration of  both their own elections and federal elections. States regulate the  election process, including, for example, adoption of voting system  standards, testing of voting systems, ballot access, registration  procedures, absentee voting requirements, establishment of voting  locations, provision of Election Day workers, and counting and  certification of the vote. As we have reported, the U.S. election  process can be seen as an assemblage of 51 somewhat distinct  election systems\u2014those of the 50 states and of the District of  Columbia.", "Further, although election policy and procedures are legislated  primarily at the state level, states typically have decentralized this  process so that the details of administering elections are carried out  at the city or county levels, and voting is done at the local level. This  is important because local election jurisdictions number more than  10,000 and their size varies enormously\u2014from a rural county with  about 200 voters to a large urban county such as Los Angeles  County, where the total number of registered voters for the 2000  elections exceeded the registered voter totals in 41 states.", "The size and demographics of a voting jurisdiction significantly  affects the complexity of planning and conducting the election, as  does the method used to cast and count votes. For example,  jurisdictions using DRE systems may need to manage the electronic  transmission of votes or vote counts, while jurisdictions using  optical scan technology need to manage the transfer of the paper  ballots this technology reads and tabulates. Jurisdictions using  optical scan technology may also need to manage electronic  transmissions if votes are counted at various locations and totals are  electronically transmitted to a central tally point. No matter what  technology is used, jurisdictions may need to provide ballot  translations; however, the logistics of printing paper materials in a  range of languages, as would be required for optical scan  technology, is different from the logistics of programming  translations into DRE units.", "Some states do have statewide election systems so that every voting  jurisdiction uses similar processes and equipment, but others do  not. For instance, we reported in 2001 that in Pennsylvania, local  election officials told us that there were 67 counties and  consequently 67 different ways of handling elections. In some  states, such as Georgia, state law prescribes the use of common  voting technology throughout the state while in other states, local  election officials generally choose the voting technology to be used  in their precincts, often from a list of state-certified options.", "Regardless of levels of government, however, election  administration is a year-round activity, involving varying sets of  people performing the activities of each stage of the election  process.

These requirements are then translated into design  specifications that are used to develop the system. Electronic voting  systems are typically developed by vendors and then purchased as  commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) products and implemented by state  and local election administrators. During the development,  acquisition, and implementation of the systems, a range of tests are  performed and the process is managed to ensure performance  expectations are met. Together, these activities form a voting  system life cycle (see fig. 5).", "Unless voting systems are properly managed throughout their life  cycle, this one facet of the election process can significantly  undermine the integrity of the whole.", "Standards. Voting system standards define the functional and  performance requirements that must be met and thus provide the  baseline against which systems can be developed and tested. They  also specify how the systems should be implemented and operated.  Voting system standards apply to system hardware, software,  firmware, and documentation, and they span prevoting,voting, and  postvoting activities. They address, for example, requirements  relating to system security; system reliability (accuracy and  availability); system auditability; system storage and maintenance;  and data retention and transportation. In addition to national  standards, some states and local jurisdictions have specified their  own voting system requirements.", "Development. Product development is performed by the voting  system vendor. Product development includes further establishing  system requirements, designing the system architecture, developing  software, integrating hardware and software components, and  testing the system.", "Acquisition. Voting system acquisition activities are performed by  state and local governments and include publishing a request for  proposals, evaluating proposals, choosing a voting system method,  choosing a vendor, writing and administering contracts, and testing  the acquired system.", "Operations. Operation of voting systems is typically the  responsibility of local jurisdictions. These activities include setting  up systems before voting, vote capture and counting during  elections, recounts and system audits after elections, and storage of  systems between elections. Among other things, this phase includes  activities associated with the physical environments in which the  system operates. These include ensuring the physical security of the  polling place and voting equipment and controlling the chain of  custody for voting system components and supplies. The operations  phase also includes monitoring of the election process by use of  system audit logs and backups, and the collection, analysis,  reporting, and resolution of election problems.", "Testing. As noted, testing is conducted by multiple entities  throughout the life cycle of a voting system. Voting system vendors  conduct testing during system development. National testing of  systems is conducted by accredited independent testing authorities.  Some states conduct testing before acquiring a system to determine  how well it meets the specified performance parameters, or states  may conduct certification testing to ensure that a system performs  as specified by applicable laws and requirements. Once a voting  system is delivered by the vendor, states and local jurisdictions may  conduct acceptance testing to ensure that the system satisfies  requirements. Finally, local jurisdictions typically conduct logic and  accuracy tests prior to each election and sometimes subject  portions of the system to parallel testing during each election.", "Management. Management processes ensure that each life cycle  phase produces desirable outcomes and is conducted by the  organization responsible for each life cycle phase. Voting system  vendors manage the development phase, while states and/or local  jurisdictions manage the acquisition and operations phases. Typical  management activities that span the system life cycle include  planning, configuration management, system performance review  and evaluation, problem tracking and correction, human capital  management, and user training.

Each of these  attributes is described here.", "Security. Election officials are responsible for establishing and  managing security and privacy controls to protect against threats to  the integrity of elections. Threats to election results and voter  confidentiality include potential modification or loss of electronic  voting data; loss, theft, or modification of physical ballots; and  unauthorized access to software and electronic equipment. Different  types of controls can be used to counter these threats. Physical  access controls are important for securing voting equipment, vote  tabulation equipment, and ballots. Software access controls (such as  passwords and firewalls) are important for limiting the number of  people who can access and operate voting devices, election  management software, and vote tabulation software. In addition,  physical screens around voting stations and poll workers preventing  voters from being watched or coerced while voting are important to  protect the privacy and confidentiality of the vote.", "Reliability. Ensuring the reliability of votes being recorded and  tallied is an essential attribute of any voting equipment and depends  to a large degree on the accuracy and availability of voting systems.  Without such assurance, both voter confidence in the election and  the integrity and legitimacy of the outcome of the election are at  risk. The importance of an accurate vote count increases with the  closeness of the election. Both optical scan and DRE systems are  claimed to be highly accurate. Although voting equipment may be  designed and developed to count votes as recorded with 100 percent  accuracy, how well the equipment counts votes as intended by  voters is a function not only of equipment design, but also of how  procedures are followed by election officials, technicians, and  voters. It is also important to limit system down time so that polling  places can handle the volume of voter traffic.", "Ease of Use. Ease of use (or user friendliness) depends largely on  how voters interact physically and intellectually with the voting  system. This interaction, commonly referred to as the  human/machine interface, is a function of the system design and  how it has been implemented. Ease of use depends on how well  jurisdictions design ballots and educate voters on the use of the  equipment. A voting system\u2019s ease of use affects accuracy (i.e.,  whether the voter\u2019s intent is captured), and it can also affect the  efficiency of the voting process (confused voters take longer to  vote). Accessibility by diverse types of voters, including those with  disabilities, is a further aspect of ease of use.", "Cost. For a given jurisdiction, the particular cost associated with an  electronic voting system will depend on the requirements of the  jurisdiction as well as the particular equipment chosen. Voting  equipment costs vary among types of voting equipment and among  different manufacturers and models of the same type of equipment.  Some of these differences can be attributed to differences in what is  included in the unit cost.

These management elements would need to take into  account estimating testing capacity and expected volume for the  testing laboratory accreditation program, establishing protocols and  time frames for reviewing certification packages, and setting norms  for timely consideration and decision making regarding system  certifications. Sharing this information with state and local election  officials would help them to plan for system upgrades, testing, and  state certification to meet their upcoming election cycles.", "States and local jurisdictions must also consider the timely adoption  of standards in light of the additional work that is currently under  way and planned to address known weaknesses in the national  standards. For example, in addition to establishing minimum  functional and performance requirements for voting systems,  standards can also be used to govern integration of election  systems, such as the accuracy, reliability, privacy, and security of  components and interfaces. Accordingly, we have recommended  that the EAC collaborate with NIST and the Technical Guidelines  Development Committee to define the specific tasks, measurable  outcomes, milestones, and resource needs required to improve the  voting system standards. Identifying the incremental improvements  to standards for several future election cycles and coordinating  these with states and local jurisdictions would help those officials  plan for these cycles and prepare the public for expected changes in  voting technologies, security and reliability features, and  compensating controls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring that Necessary Security, Testing, and Operational Activities Are Effectively Performed", "paragraphs": ["Maximizing the performance of the voting systems that jurisdictions  currently have and those they plan to use in the next general  election means taking proactive steps between now and November  2008 to ensure that these systems perform as intended. These steps  include activities aimed at securing, testing, and preparing these  systems for operation. Although the vast majority of jurisdictions  performed security, testing, and operational activities in one form or  another for the 2004 general election, the extent and nature of these  activities varied among jurisdictions and depended on the  availability of resources (financial and human capital) committed to  them. The challenge facing all voting jurisdictions will be to ensure  that these activities are fully and properly performed, particularly in  light of the security and reliability concerns that have been reported  with electronic voting systems.", "Security, testing, and operational activities are to a large degree  responsive to\u2014and limited by\u2014formal state and local directives.  For 2004, election officials for some states identified various state  and local directives for managing the security and reliability of their  voting systems, including security plans, security testing, system  acceptance testing, and voting equipment auditing. When  appropriately defined and implemented, such directives can  promote the effective execution of security and testing practices  across all phases of the election process. As voting technologies and  requirements evolve, states and local jurisdictions face the challenge  of adapting and implementing the directives to meet the needs of  their specific election environments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Managing the People, Processes, and Technology as Components of the Overall Process", "paragraphs": ["As previously stated, jurisdictions need to manage the triad of  people, processes, and technology as interrelated and  interdependent parts of the total voting process. Given the amount  of time that remains between now and the November 2008 elections,  jurisdictions\u2019 voting system performance is more likely to be  influenced by improvements in poll worker system operation  training, voter education about system use, and vote casting and  counting procedures than by changes to the physical systems. The  challenge for voting jurisdictions is thus to ensure that these people  and process issues are dealt with effectively.", "In this regard, the election management decisions and practices of  states and local jurisdictions can benefit from the experiences and  results of those with comparable election environments. In 2004 and  again in 2006, EAC compiled such information into guidance  documents for widespread use by election officials. However, as the  election environment and voting systems continue to evolve,  additional lessons and topics will undoubtedly surface. Accordingly,  we have recommended that the EAC establish a process and  schedule for periodically compiling and disseminating  recommended practices for security and reliability across the  system life cycle and that the practices be informed by information  it collects on the problems and vulnerabilities of these systems.  Incorporating the feedback obtained through actual voting system  development, acquisition, preparation, and operations into practical  guidance will allow the election community to be more robust and  efficient."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gathering and Using Reliable System Performance Measures and Data and Making Informed Investment Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Reliable measures and objective data are needed for jurisdictions to  know whether the technology they use is meeting the needs of the  user communities (both the voters and the officials who administer  the elections). While the vast majority of jurisdictions reported that  they were satisfied with the performance of their respective  technologies in the November 2004 elections, this satisfaction was  based mostly on the subjective impressions of election officials  rather than on objective data that measured voting system  performance. Although these impressions should not be discounted,  informed decision making on voting system operations and  technology investment requires more objective data. The immediate  challenge for jurisdictions is to define measures and begin collecting  data so that they can definitely know how their systems are  performing.", "States and local jurisdictions can benefit from sharing performance  data on voting systems, including information on problems and  vulnerabilities. However, the diffused and decentralized nature of  our election system impedes timely and accurate collection and  dissemination of this type of information for particular voting  system models. Accordingly, we have recommended that the EAC  develop a process and associated time frames for sharing  information on voting system problems and vulnerabilities across  the election community. The national voting system certification  process established in January 2007 provides a mechanism for  election officials to report problems and vulnerabilities with their  systems to the EAC. Not yet defined are the mechanisms to collect  and disseminate information on problems and vulnerabilities that  are identified by voting system vendors and independent groups  outside of the national certification process.", "In addition, foreseeable changes in technology require jurisdictions  to determine whether a particular technology will provide benefits  that are commensurate with life cycle costs (acquisition as well as  operation and maintenance) and to assess whether these collective  costs are affordable and sustainable. Thus, the long-term challenge  for jurisdictions is to view and treat voting systems as capital  investments and to manage them as such, including basing decisions  on technology investments on clearly defined requirements and  reliable analyses of quantitative and qualitative return on  investment.", "In closing, I would like to say again that electronic voting systems  are an undeniably critical link in the overall election chain. While  this link alone cannot make an election, it can break one. The  problems that some jurisdictions have experienced and the serious  concerns that have surfaced highlight the potential for continuing  difficulties in upcoming national elections if these challenges are not  effectively addressed. The EAC plays a vital role related to ensuring  that election officials and voters are educated and well informed  about the proper implementation and use of electronic voting  systems and ensuring that jurisdictions take the appropriate steps\u2014 related to people, process, and technology\u2014that are needed  regarding security, testing, and operations. More strategically, the  EAC needs to move swiftly to strengthen the voting system  standards and the testing associated with enforcing them. However,  the EAC alone cannot ensure that electronic voting system  challenges are effectively addressed. State and local governments  must also do their parts. Moreover, critical to the commission\u2019s  ability to do its part will be the adequacy of resources at its disposal  and the degree of cooperation it receives from entities at all levels of  government.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
