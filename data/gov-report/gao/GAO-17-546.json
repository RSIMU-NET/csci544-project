These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas.", "GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research (see table). Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.", "Dollars are in millions and have not been adjusted for inflation", "Source: GAO analysis of agency data. | GAO-17-546"]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DOE lead development of a mechanism for interagency collaboration on research on low-dose radiation's health effects.

Ionizing radiation is considerably more energetic than  non-ionizing radiation, such as radio- or microwaves and visible or  infrared light, and thus has a greater effect on human health. According  to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the severity and type of  health effects depend in part on the amount and duration of exposure. A  very large amount of exposure, such as from a nuclear explosion, can  cause sickness or even death within days. According to EPA, low levels  of exposure are not known to cause acute health effects but may increase  a person\u2019s risk of developing cancer or other health effects, such as  genetic mutations, during the individual\u2019s lifetime.", "To prevent cancer and other harmful effects associated with exposure to  radiation, EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), and other  federal agencies have established requirements and issued guidance that  apply to a wide range of settings in which such exposure can occur.  These requirements and guidance generally follow radiation protection  principles that call for radiation exposure to be justified by producing a net  benefit and by keeping within regulatory limits (i.e., limits on the dose or  limits on the increased risk to health) or, for emergency situations, limits  established by non-binding guidance on exposure levels designed to  protect those affected. These regulatory limits and guidance levels that  federal agencies have established include:  limits on occupational dose, such as for nuclear power-plant workers  and medical personnel whose work involves the use of radiation;  limits on dose or increased health risk for members of the public from  a facility, such as a nuclear power plant or industrial site with  radiological contamination; and guidance levels for protecting workers and members of the public  during an emergency response to an accidental or deliberate incident  that exposes them to radiation, such as an accident at a nuclear  power plant or a radiological dispersal device (also called a \u201cdirty  bomb\u201d).", "The Department of Energy (DOE) and other federal agencies have  funded research to determine the health effects of exposure to low levels  of radiation; however, uncertainties remain in understanding the health  effects, including the risk of cancer. These uncertainties raise questions  about whether dose limits and guidance levels have been set  appropriately. For example, there are concerns that the dose limits and  guidance levels may be too low, increasing costs to reduce radiation  exposure unnecessarily. In contrast, there are also concerns that the  dose limits and guidance levels may be too high, causing greater harm  than assumed based on limited understanding of the risks.", "Several organizations that provide guidance and recommendations to  federal agencies on radiation protection have identified research needs to  better understand the health risks from low levels of radiation exposure.  For example, in 2006, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering,  and Medicine (National Academies) published the seventh in a series of  reports to advise the U.S. government on the relationship between  exposure to radiation and human health. The report identified research  needs in a number of areas, such as occupational radiation exposures  among nuclear industry workers, to help estimate the risk of cancer from  low-dose radiation, which occurs at levels where the biological effects  may not be detected and where current research does not definitively  establish the extent of cancer risk. In 2015, DOE directed its Biological  and Environmental Research Advisory Committee to provide advice on  defining a research program that could lead to conclusive results on  whether low-dose radiation causes cancer in humans. In 2016, the  committee issued a report stating that further research on the cancer risk  from low-dose radiation could decrease uncertainty in cancer risk  estimates. For example, according to the report, new tools for conducting  biological research could advance the understanding of connections  between radiation exposure, DNA damage, tissue responses, and cancer  development.", "You requested that we examine federal agencies\u2019 radiation protection  requirements and guidance and related research. This report (1)  describes how selected federal agencies have developed and applied  radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public  and (2) examines the extent to which federal agencies have funded and  collaborated on research on the health effects of low-dose radiation.", "To describe how selected federal agencies have developed and applied  radiation requirements and guidance for workers and the public, we first  selected a sample of four settings in which radiation exposure can occur:  operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants, cleanup of sites  with radiological contamination, use of medical equipment that produces  radiation, and accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. We  selected these four settings because they can result in radiation exposure  for both workers and the public and because they involve a variety of  federal agencies and sites where exposure can occur. Next, through a  review of federal radiation-protection requirements and guidance, we  identified four federal agencies that have developed requirements or  guidance for these four settings\u2014EPA, NRC, DOE, and the Food and  Drug Administration (FDA) within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS). Findings from our reviews of these four agencies in the  four settings we selected cannot be generalized to all agencies and  settings in which radiation exposure can occur but provided illustrative  examples.", "For each of these four settings and selected federal agencies, we  reviewed agency documentation and interviewed agency officials on how  they developed radiation protection requirements and guidance and how  they apply them in practice. In addition, we interviewed stakeholders  involved in the four selected settings to obtain their views (1) on the  scientific assumptions federal agencies used in developing requirements  and guidance and (2) on the costs and benefits associated with applying  the requirements and guidance. We selected stakeholders who had  studied, issued policy statements on or raised concerns about federal  radiation-protection efforts in the four settings in our review and who  represented a range of private-sector, professional, state-government,  and environmental and public-health interests. Stakeholders we selected  included officials from state agencies responsible for radiation protection  and representatives of organizations active in the nuclear power industry  or radiology and of nonprofit organizations that study issues related to  radiation exposure.", "To better understand how federal agencies have applied requirements  and guidance, we visited three sites\u2014two DOE sites and one EPA site\u2014 with radiological contamination: DOE\u2019s Savannah River Site in South  Carolina and Site 300 at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in  California, and the Nuclear Metals, Inc. site in Massachusetts, overseen  by EPA. We selected contaminated sites to include at least one large site  and one small site, and at least one site managed by DOE and one  overseen by EPA. We also visited a commercial nuclear-power plant to  observe measures used by the plant to limit radiation exposure, and we  interviewed plant personnel regarding their radiation protection program.", "We selected a nuclear power plant that was close to one of the  contaminated sites we selected and that was able to provide access to  us. We interviewed DOE, EPA, and contractor officials at the  contaminated sites regarding the measures used for cleanup of  radiological contamination and how agencies apply radiation  requirements when making cleanup decisions.", "For further information on how agencies have developed and applied  radiation requirements and guidance, we reviewed the reports of national  and international organizations that agency officials and documentation  cited as providing advice and recommendations to agencies involved in  radiation protection in the United States or other countries. These  organizations included the International Commission on Radiological  Protection (ICRP); the National Council on Radiation Protection and  Measurements (NCRP); and the National Academies. In addition, we  reviewed documentation from and interviewed officials at five other  agencies we identified that play a role in developing or applying radiation  protection guidance and requirements. These agencies were the  Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) within the  Department of Labor, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) within  the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense (DOD), and  the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).", "To examine the extent to which federal agencies have funded research  on the health effects of low-dose radiation, we interviewed officials at a  total of 11 agencies\u2014at each of the nine agencies listed above, and also  at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) within HHS because it is a main  source of federal funding for medical research, and at HHS\u2019s Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) because it funds research to  advance the agency\u2019s public health mission. In particular, we interviewed  agency officials to determine which agencies fund related research,  including either epidemiological research on populations of individuals  exposed to radiation or radiobiological research on cellular responses to  radiation exposure. For the purposes of this review, we also included  federal agencies\u2019 funding of research on high-dose radiation (radiation  exceeding the level considered to be low dose) if agency officials  indicated that it had potential implications for low-dose research\u2014for  example, by helping to address uncertainties in the risk of health  outcomes from low-dose radiation. We then requested the seven  agencies that had funded such research to provide data on obligations for  such funding for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 and information on the  type of research funded (epidemiological or radiobiological) and the  names of individual studies or projects. In addition, we interviewed  agency officials about the research these agencies funded. For one  program in particular, DOE\u2019s Low Dose Radiation Research Program, we  requested funding data for every year since the program\u2019s inception in  1998 because we found that it had been a primary source of dedicated  funding for radiobiological research on the health effects of such  radiation. We assessed the reliability of the data we obtained by checking  for obvious errors in accuracy and completeness and by comparing the  data with other sources of information, such as agency budget  documents. We resolved any data inconsistencies we found through e- mail and telephone communications with agency officials. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for reporting on the amount of  federal funding for research on low-dose radiation and the type of  research funded.", "To examine the extent to which federal agencies have collaborated on  research concerning the health effects of low-dose radiation, we included  questions about agencies\u2019 research plans as part of our request for data  on obligations. In addition, to gain an understanding of the areas in which  federal agencies might benefit from collaboration, we interviewed agency  officials about their plans for future research, the potential to use results  of the research in agency efforts to develop and apply radiation  requirements and guidance, and their efforts to foster interagency  collaboration in funding and conducting research. We compared  agencies\u2019 efforts with key considerations we have identified in our prior  work for implementing interagency collaborative mechanisms, such as  interagency task forces, and key practices for enhancing and sustaining  interagency collaboration, such as identifying and addressing needs by  leveraging resources. We also attended a conference on radiation and  health to learn about the results of research in the field and on potential  areas of future research. At the conference, we interviewed individual  researchers from universities who also attended. In particular, to gain  additional perspectives on agencies\u2019 plans for future research and the  potential for agencies to collaborate, we asked researchers about their  areas of research, the support they had received from federal agencies,  and about their views on potential areas for future research and its  relevance to the development and application of radiation requirements  and guidance.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2016 to September  2017 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The symptoms of this syndrome range from nausea, fatigue,  and vomiting to death within days or weeks. The higher the radiation  dose, the sooner the effects of radiation will appear, and the higher the  probability of death. For example, according to NRC\u2019s website, 134 of the  plant workers and firefighters battling the fire at the 1986 Chernobyl  nuclear power plant accident received high doses of radiation and  suffered from acute radiation syndrome. Of these, 28 died within the first  3 months from their radiation injuries.", "In contrast, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to detect. In  particular, below about 100 millisieverts (mSv) (10 rem)\u2014the level below  which the National Academies\u2019 2006 report on radiation and human  health considered radiation to be low dose\u2014data do not definitively  establish the dose-response relationship between cancer and radiation  exposure. It is often not possible to determine the extent to which a  health outcome such as cancer is caused by low dose radiation because  of the potential confounding effects of other chemical and physical  hazards and lifestyle factors, such as smoking and diet. In addition, much  of the data on health effects of radiation exposure come from non-U.S.  populations, such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors, who received a  large exposure to radiation over a short period of time (an acute  exposure), and there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health  effects for these populations can be extrapolated to a U.S. population that  is regularly (chronically) exposed to low-dose radiation.", "The roles of federal agencies in developing and applying radiation  protection requirements and guidance vary depending on the setting in  which radiation exposure occurs. For the four settings in our review\u2014 operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants, cleanup of sites  with radiological contamination, use of medical equipment that produces  radiation, and accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation\u2014the  key agencies for establishing dose limits and guidance levels are EPA,  NRC, DOE, and FDA.", "EPA advises federal agencies about radiation matters that affect  public health and provides technical information for conducting  radiation risk assessments; federal and state agencies use such  assessments to develop and implement radiation protection  regulations and standards. EPA also develops requirements and  guidance for particular settings in which radiation exposure can occur.  For example, EPA has developed regulations to limit discharges of  radioactive material affecting members of the public from operations  associated with use of nuclear energy to produce electrical power for  public use, such as nuclear power plants. In addition, EPA has  developed guidance on establishing protective cleanup levels for  radioactive contamination at sites cleaned up under the  Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and  Liability Act (CERCLA). It has also developed guidance on levels of  radiation exposure that would trigger public safety measures, such as  evacuation, to minimize or prevent radiation exposure during an  emergency.", "NRC is responsible for protecting people and the environment from  unnecessary exposure to radiation as a result of civilian uses of  nuclear materials. Among other things, NRC has established dose  limits for workers and the public exposed to radiation from the  operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants, as well as  minimum requirements for emergency plans for protecting members  of the public from exposure in the event of a radiological emergency.  NRC also has the primary responsibility for licensing, inspecting, and  regulating medical uses of nuclear material.", "DOE is responsible for ensuring that its facilities are managed to  protect workers and the public. As part of this responsibility, DOE has  established radiation dose limits for workers at its facilities and public  dose limits for DOE radiological activities, including cleanup of  radioactive contamination at DOE sites. In addition, under the  Atomic Energy Act of 1954, DOE is the federal agency that currently  has primary responsibility for research related to nuclear energy. This  responsibility includes the protection of health during activities that  can result in exposure to radiation. DOE addresses this requirement  through research to determine if DOE workers and people living in  communities near DOE sites are adversely affected by exposures to  hazardous materials from site operations. DOE\u2019s National Nuclear  Security Administration (NNSA) assists in emergency response to  accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation by characterizing  radiation levels in the area of an accident or terrorist event and  providing information to emergency-response decision makers.", "FDA has issued radiation safety regulations for medical equipment,  such as diagnostic X-ray systems. According to FDA officials, FDA\u2019s  regulations generally do not limit the dose to the patient but instead  prescribe mandatory performance standards for most radiology  medical devices, such as standards for the display of cumulative time  that an X-ray system is activated. FDA has also developed guidance  for state and local agencies to aid in emergency response planning for  accidental or terrorism-related radioactive contamination of human  food and animal feeds.", "Other federal agencies also have roles in radiation protection. For  example, ionizing radiation is addressed in specific OSHA standards for  general industry, shipyard employment, and construction. According to  DOD officials, DOD operates facilities and engages in activities where  radiation exposure can occur and implements occupational and public  dose limits established by NRC and states in which these facilities and  activities are located. NASA sets radiation exposure limits for space flight  and supports research on the health effects of cosmic radiation to better  manage health risks to astronauts. DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency  Management Agency provides guidance on responding to incidents  involving release of radioactive material and has established procedures  for review and approval of state and local emergency plans for the offsite  effects of a radiological emergency that may occur at a commercial  nuclear power facility.", "Two U.S. scientific advisory bodies\u2014the National Academies\u2019 Nuclear  and Radiation Studies Board and the National Council on Radiation  Protection and Measurements (NCRP)\u2014and one international body\u2014the  International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP)\u2014are  involved in analyzing scientific developments regarding the health effects  of radiation exposure and advising federal agencies.", "The National Academies\u2019 Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board  conducts studies on safety and other issues associated with nuclear  and radiation-based technologies.

This advice includes the use of the \u201clinear no-threshold  model,\u201d which assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every  incremental increase in radiation exposure. The model is used to estimate  the risk of cancer when the overall level of exposure is in the range  considered to be low dose. At this level of exposure, data from  epidemiological studies of individuals exposed to radiation provide  evidence of increased risk to cancer, but with uncertainties about the  extent of this risk.", "Under this model, federal regulations set dose limits for radiation  exposure that are below the level in the National Academies\u2019 2006 report  on radiation and human health for defining low-dose radiation. For  example, NRC\u2019s annual dose limit for members of the public (excluding  natural, or background, sources of radiation) is 1 mSv (0.1 rem), or a  hundredth of the level the National Academies considers low dose.", "Three key scientific advisory bodies\u2014ICRP, NCRP, and the National  Academies\u2019 Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board\u2014have supported use  of this model for development of radiation protection requirements and  guidance. For example:  ICRP, in its 2007 update to its recommendations on radiological  protection, stated that at low doses of radiation, it considers the linear  no-threshold model to be the best practical approach to managing risk  from radiation exposure. In addition, ICRP stated that this model is  consistent with the principle that actions should be taken to avoid or  diminish harm to human life or health that is scientifically plausible but  uncertain, as is the case at low doses of radiation. ICRP\u2019s update also  explained that it periodically re-evaluates its recommended dose limits  based on its evaluation of new scientific data and information.", "NCRP, in a 2001 study on the linear no-threshold model that it  continues to reference today, noted that the existing epidemiological  data on the effects of low-dose radiation are inconclusive and, in  some cases, contradictory, prompting some observers to dispute the  validity of the linear no-threshold model. Nevertheless, NCRP  concluded that while there is uncertainty about the health effects of  low-dose radiation, the linear no-threshold model is more plausible  than other models, such as the hormesis model, which assumes that  low-dose radiation protects against rather than increases the risk of  cancer. Further, according to NCRP\u2019s president, recent  epidemiological studies indicate that the preponderance of evidence  continues to support the linear no-threshold model for use in radiation  protection.", "The National Academies, in its 2006 report on low-dose radiation,  supported the use of the linear no-threshold model, stating that the  balance of evidence from epidemiologic, animal, and mechanistic  studies tends to favor a simple proportionate relationship at low doses  between radiation dose and cancer risk. According to the National  Academies, the availability of new and more extensive data since the  publication of its previous report in 1990 strengthened confidence in  the 2006 report\u2019s estimates of cancer risk. For example, the 2006  report incorporated data from an additional 15 years of follow-up of  Japanese atomic bomb survivors and from studies of nuclear workers  exposed to low-dose radiation.", "Nevertheless, these advisory bodies have recognized challenges in  accurately estimating cancer risks from very low doses of radiation  exposure when using the linear no-threshold model. For example, the  epidemiological data used to estimate the dose-risk relationship for  American workers over a 1-year period are largely from studies of  Japanese atomic bomb survivors\u2019 exposure to radiation from the atomic  bomb. As a result, to account for different doses and dose rates of  radiation exposure, advisory bodies have recommended that estimates of  the risk of low doses using these data be adjusted accordingly. For  example, in radiation protection guidance issued in 2007, ICRP  recommended that cancer risk estimates for low doses of radiation be  adjusted downward by a factor of one-half.", "Figure 1 depicts examples of the dose limits and guidance levels  established by EPA, NRC, and DOE. (See app. I for further examples.)  As shown in the figure, the public dose limit for nuclear power plants is  one-third the U.S. average natural background radiation level.", "Some stakeholders have questioned whether radiation dose limits based  on the linear no-threshold model are too strict, or whether they are strict  enough, and have advocated for revising dose limits and guidance levels.  For example, in 2015, NRC received three petitions from different  individuals proposing that NRC raise its occupational and public dose  limits. One petitioner commented that some studies suggest low levels of  radiation have protective effects and that the costs of complying with  linear no-threshold-based regulations were high. Similarly, a joint study  by the French National Academies of Science and of Medicine in 2005  concluded that epidemiological studies have been unable to find a  significant increase of cancer at low levels of radiation exposure.  Conversely, representatives we interviewed from two nonprofit groups,  Physicians for Social Responsibility and Beyond Nuclear, told us that  dose limits based on the linear no-threshold model were not strict enough  to protect vulnerable groups, such as children and pregnant women and  their fetuses.", "NRC officials told us that in the absence of convincing evidence that there  is a dose threshold below which low levels of radiation are beneficial or  not harmful, NRC will continue to follow the recommendations of scientific  advisory bodies to use the linear no-threshold model. Similarly, officials  from EPA told us that they would consider changing the use of the linear  no-threshold model as the basis of their requirements and guidance only  if there were a strong recommendation from scientific advisory bodies on  radiation protection as well as an endorsement of the change by the  National Academies. In addition, EPA published a paper in 2009 that  stated that it believed that the evidence on health effects of radiation  exposure does not preclude the possibility of a threshold below which  there is no increased risk of cancer, but that the evidence at present does  not support the existence of a threshold."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Radiation Protection Requirements and Guidance Vary Depending on the Four Settings Reviewed in Which Exposure Can Occur", "paragraphs": ["The limits and guidance the four agencies have developed and applied  vary depending on the settings in which exposure can occur, as  described below.

ICRP stated that it developed its 1977  recommendations on occupational dose limits in part through a  comparison between the cancer risk from occupational exposure to  radiation and the rates of occupational fatalities in industries recognized  as having high standards of safety. Thus, nuclear power plant workers  would not face a greater risk of cancer than the fatality risks, whether due  to accidents or disease, that workers face in other industries. For the  general public, ICRP suggested that the cancer risk\u2014and therefore the  dose limit\u2014should be less than that for workers and should be  comparable to the public\u2019s risk from everyday activities, such as taking  public transportation. ICRP further stated that when setting public dose  limits, an agency must consider members of the public belonging to  critical groups, such as children and pregnant women, who may be more  susceptible to the effects of radiation than the population as a whole.", "According to one of ICRP\u2019s key recommendations for radiation protection,  radiation exposure should be limited to keep the likelihood and magnitude  of exposure as low as reasonably achievable, taking into account  economic and societal factors. In keeping with this recommendation, NRC  requires nuclear power plants to have a radiation protection program that  includes measures to keep doses as low as reasonably achievable  (ALARA). NRC defines ALARA to mean making every reasonable effort  to maintain exposures to radiation as far below dose limits as is practical  consistent with, among other things, the economics of improvements in  relation to benefits to the public health and safety. Under the ALARA  principle, NRC encourages nuclear plants to demonstrate their use of the  principle through cost-benefit analyses or other quantifiable methods.", "According to NRC officials, nuclear power plants typically set their own  occupational dose limits at 40 percent of NRC\u2019s regulatory limit of 50 mSv  (5 rem) per year, and cost is generally a key criterion that plants use to  determine what actions to take to reduce radiation exposures under their  ALARA programs. At the nuclear power plant we visited, representatives  told us that under their ALARA plan, the plant set its own dose limits for  workers at 40 percent of the regulatory limit. Officials at the plant told us  that they have been able to keep exposures below the plant\u2019s own limit by  continuously seeking opportunities to reduce unnecessary worker  exposure to radiation, such as using robots to perform maintenance work  in radiation areas. According to NRC\u2019s 2014 annual report on  occupational radiation exposure, none of the 124,831 nuclear power plant  workers who were monitored in 2014 received a dose above NRC\u2019s  regulatory limit, and over 99 percent of these workers received a dose  below the 40-percent level used by many plants as their own limit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cleanup of Sites with Radiological Contamination", "paragraphs": ["DOE and EPA both used the recommendations of scientific advisory  bodies, including the use of the linear no-threshold model, to develop  limits on dose or increased health risk for members of the public from  sites with radiological contamination, even though the agencies used  different approaches in implementing the recommendations. For example,  in an order on radiation protection of the public and environment, DOE set  a public dose limit of 1.0 mSv (0.1 rem) per year, which was the dose limit  recommended by ICRP in 1990. In developing its recommendations,  ICRP used the assumptions of the linear no-threshold model to identify a  dose that would not cause more than a small increase in the age-specific  mortality rate from cancer. In contrast, according to a 2014 EPA  memorandum on cleanup of sites with radiological contamination, EPA  uses a risk-based approach to prescribe cleanup levels for carcinogens,  including radiation, in a range that will not result in more than 1 in 10,000  to 1 in 1 million additional cancers in a population during their lifetimes.  Under this approach, EPA uses the assumption of the linear no-threshold  model to set site-specific levels of cleanup that account for various  factors, such as the site\u2019s expected future land use and the presence of  other contaminants, such as chemicals that may also increase the risk of  cancer. Under its 2014 memorandum, EPA determined that when using a  federal or state standard for radiation protection at sites with radiological  contamination, this standard is generally not sufficiently protective if it is  greater than 0.12 mSv (0.012 rem) per year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Medical-Imaging Equipment That Produces Radiation", "paragraphs": ["According to FDA officials, FDA does not have the authority to regulate  the total amount of radiation exposure a patient receives from medical  imaging equipment.

Similarly, ICRP\u2019s 2007 guidance on radiation protection states  that, while all use of radiation in medicine should be justified and the  radiation dose from each examination should be as low as reasonably  achievable, radiation dose limits do not apply to medical exposures of  patients.", "FDA officials stated that, instead of setting limits on total amount of  radiation exposure to patients, the agency regulates the maximum limits  radiation output of medical equipment. In particular, they stated that the  agency based its equipment standards on NCRP guidance from 1968 on  medical X-ray and gamma ray protection. They also commented that this  NCRP guidance provided a dose rate limit for the equipment and stated  that the exposure rate should be as low as reasonably achievable. In a  2005 Federal Register notice on FDA\u2019s change to its performance  standards for medical-imaging equipment, FDA stated that it used the  assumptions of the linear no-threshold model to determine that the health  benefits to medical staff and patients (in monetary terms) exceeded the  costs incurred by equipment manufacturers and FDA to implement the  change.", "In keeping with the principle that radiation exposure should be kept as low  as reasonably achievable, FDA encourages voluntary measures by health  care providers to address radiation exposure to patients from the use of  medical-imaging equipment. Under an initiative launched in 2010, FDA  identified a number of factors that contribute to levels of exposure that  exceed the levels for meeting patients\u2019 clinical need, and FDA identified  steps to mitigate these factors. For example, its initiative recommended  that healthcare professional organizations continue to develop nationally  recognized benchmark levels for medical-imaging procedures that use  radiation, and FDA stated that it has increased its participation in these  efforts both on its own and through collaborative efforts with industry and  healthcare professional organizations.

For  example, according to its 2016 guidance on emergency response to  radiological incidents, EPA compared the cost of evacuation under  several scenarios with the number of cancer deaths avoided to  recommend a radiation dose to the public at which evacuation should be  considered. Using ICRP guidance, EPA assumed a linear relationship  between radiation exposure and cancer risk\u2014a principle of the linear no- threshold model\u2014to calculate the number of potential cancer deaths.

For example, weather hazards may impede evacuation and  favor sheltering-in-place instead. Similarly, EPA\u2019s guidance explains that  decisions on relocation need to account for a variety of health problems  that relocation itself can cause. In its response to frequently asked  questions about radiation in Fukushima, Japan, the World Health  Organization noted that these problems were evident in the aftermath of  the March 11, 2011, earthquake and subsequent tsunami that caused  significant damage to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station,  releasing radioactive material into the environment. There were no known  acute deaths or illnesses from radiation exposure, but the relocation of  thousands of people caused an increase in disaster-related deaths, as  well as mental health and access to health care issues, according to the  World Health Organization.", "FDA also relied on ICRP guidance and the linear no-threshold model to  recommend radiation doses at which protective actions would provide a  net benefit when compared with other factors. In particular, according to a  1998 Federal Register notice about recommendations for accidental  radioactive contamination of human food and animal feed, the agency  developed protective action guides for state and local agencies  responding to these types of accidents. These guides provide a  recommended radiation dose range in which countermeasures should be  taken for the contaminated food and feed after an accident.

The Office of Science established the Low  Dose Radiation Research Program in 1998 and funded it through  fiscal year 2016. A primary focus of this program was to fund  radiobiological research, and over the course of the program, it  provided an average of about $14 million per year for such research,  which included funding for the Million Person Study. According to  DOE\u2019s website for the program, the program provided data and  information about the low-dose range of exposure, producing 737  peer-reviewed publications as of March 2012.

Other areas of discovery included the role of DNA repair and  the immune system, as well as the potential beneficial effects at the  cellular level caused by low-dose radiation. The Office of  Environment, Health, Safety and Security provided annual funding  from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016 for epidemiological  studies in two areas: (1) the Radiation Effects Research Foundation,  which conducts studies involving Japanese atomic bomb survivors in  Hiroshima and Nagasaki and is a source of data used by national and  international standard-setting organizations and scientific advisory  bodies to set regulations and (2) assessments of worker and public  health risks from radiation exposure resulting from nuclear weapons  production activities in the former Soviet Union, which provided DOE  researchers with data from Russian workers who experienced chronic  exposure to radiation.", "NIH has funded and conducted both epidemiological and  radiobiological studies on low-dose radiation, according to NIH  officials.

The aim of the  internal research program for radiation epidemiology is to identify,  understand, and quantify the risk of cancer in populations exposed to  various types of radiation, and to advance understanding of cancer  caused by radiation. Other institutes of NIH, including the National  Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, also fund research related  to the health effects of radiation exposure as part of NIH\u2019s overall  mission to fund medical research. Examples of research supported by  NIH have included (1) a study conducted in partnership with the U.S.  Department of Veterans Affairs on cancer mortality among military  participants in U.S. nuclear weapons tests and (2) a tissue bank with  samples from Chernobyl survivors. These samples are being used to  understand the effects of radioactive exposure from nuclear power  plant accidents. NIH has also funded radiobiological research on high- dose radiation, and some of this research also applies to low-dose  radiation.", "EPA helps fund research through an ongoing interagency agreement  with DOE\u2019s Oak Ridge National Laboratory, according to EPA  officials. The funding supports the development of models that provide  information about doses to particular organs from ingestion or  inhalation of a specific quantity of a radioactive element, such as  cesium or plutonium. According to EPA instructions for calculating  radiation dose and risk, EPA uses this information to estimate cancer  risks of exposure to over 800 radioactive elements. These estimates,  according to EPA, can be used by federal and state agencies to  develop and implement radiation protection regulations and  standards.
