To streamline the process for these servicemembers, the military services and VA have attempted to coordinate their physical exam requirements by developing a single separation exam program. In 1998, VA and DOD signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) instructing local units to establish single separation exam programs. This report examines (1) VA's and the military services' efforts to establish single separation exam programs, and (2) the challenges to establishing single separation exam programs. To obtain this information, GAO interviewed VA and military service officials about establishing the program; evaluated existing programs at selected military installations; and visited selected installations that did not have programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 1998, VA and the military services have collaborated to establish single separation exam programs. However, while we were able to verify that the program was being delivered at some military installations, DOD, its military services, and VA either could not provide information on program locations or provided us with inaccurate information. As of May 2004, VA reported that 28 military installations had single separation exam programs that used one of five basic approaches to deliver an exam that met both VA's and the military services' requirements. However, when we evaluated 8 of the 28 installations, we found that 4 of the installations did not actually have programs in place. Nonetheless, VA and DOD leadership continue to encourage the establishment of single separation exam programs and have recently drafted a new memorandum of agreement (MOA) that is intended to replace the 1998 MOU. Like the original MOU, the draft MOA delegates responsibility for establishing single separation exam programs to local VA and military installations, depending on available resources. However, the draft MOA also contains a specific implementation goal that selected military installations should have single separation exam programs in place by December 31, 2004. This would require implementation at 139 installations--an ambitious plan given the seemingly low rate of program implementation since 1998 and the lack of accurate information on existing programs. Several challenges impede the establishment of single separation exam programs. The predominant challenge is that the military services may not benefit from a program designed to eliminate the need for two separate physical exams because they usually do not require that servicemembers receive a separation exam. As of August 2004, only the Army had a general separation exam requirement for retiring servicemembers. The other military services primarily require separation exams when the servicemember's last physical exam or medical assessment received during active duty is no longer considered current. In fiscal year 2003, only an estimated 13 percent of servicemembers who left the military received a separation exam. Consequently, the military services may not realize resource savings by eliminating or sharing responsibility for this exam. According to some military officials, another challenge to establishing single separation exam programs is that resources, such as facility space and medical personnel, are needed for other priorities, such as ensuring that active duty servicemembers are healthy enough to perform their duties. Additionally, because single separation exam programs require coordination between personnel from both VA and the military services, military staff changes, including those due to routine rotations, can make it difficult to maintain existing programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Servicemembers who leave the military and file disability claims with the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) may be subject to potentially  duplicative physical exams in order to meet requirements of both the  Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) military services and VA.

During fiscal  year 2003, about 55,500 veterans submitted disability claims to VA within  their first year of leaving the military. Similarly, to document any potential  service-related health conditions or complaints of servicemembers leaving  the military, each of the military services requires a medical assessment,  which consists of a questionnaire and in some cases may include a  physical exam. Moreover, each military service has additional medical  requirements servicemembers must meet when they leave the military\u2014 requirements that in some cases include a physical exam, also known as a  separation exam.

VA and the Army  also concluded that such a program would encourage a more efficient use  of VA and military resources, improve the timeliness of disability claims  processing, and offer convenience to servicemembers.

At military installations  with BDD programs, VA personnel educate servicemembers about VA  disability benefits and help them apply for benefits before they leave  military service\u2014a process that is otherwise initiated after  servicemembers leave the military. BDD programs, which are designed for  servicemembers who have between 60 and 180 days remaining on active  duty, are usually located at military installations that have large numbers  of servicemembers leaving the military.

We did not verify whether the remaining  installations on VA\u2019s list had operational programs in place, and we are  only reporting on how programs were operating at these eight selected  installations. To identify the challenges to establishing single separation  exam programs, we interviewed VA officials from 15 locations whose  regions included military installations with at least 500 servicemembers  who left the military in fiscal year 2003. We also visited seven military  installations that were not administering single separation exam programs  to learn why such programs were not in place.

This assessment, which is  used to evaluate and document the health of these servicemembers,  consists of a standard two-page questionnaire asking servicemembers  about their overall health, medical and dental histories, current  medications, and other health-related topics. (See app. II for DOD\u2019s  medical assessment form\u2014DD Form 2697.) Military medical personnel,  who could include a physician, a physician\u2019s assistant, or a nurse  practitioner, are required to review the questionnaire with the  servicemember. If the questionnaire indicates the presence of an illness,  injury, or other medical problem, the reviewer is required to ensure that  the servicemember\u2019s medical or dental records document the problem. In  addition, depending on the servicemember\u2019s responses or based on the  reviewer\u2019s judgment that additional information is needed, the health  assessment could result in a physical exam\u2014one focused on a particular  health issue or issues in order to supplement information disclosed on the  questionnaire. Furthermore, the medical assessment asks if the  servicemember intends to file a claim for disability with VA.   Servicemembers who answer \u201cyes\u201d on the assessment form will be given a  clinically appropriate assessment or exam if the servicemember\u2019s last  physical exam received during active duty is more than 12 months old or if  new symptoms have appeared since the last active duty exam.", "In addition, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines require some of their  servicemembers to undergo separation exams when they leave the  military. Separation exams consist of a clinical evaluation by a medical  provider and could include various diagnostic tests, such as a urinalysis, a  hearing test, and a vision test. Separation exams, as well as other physical  exams the military services conduct, are documented on a three-page  standard DOD form. (See app. III for DOD\u2019s report of medical  examination\u2014DD Form 2808.) According to DOD, the average cost for a  physical exam given by the military services is about $125, exclusive of  any diagnostic tests that may also be conducted.", "The requirements determining which servicemembers must receive  separation exams vary by military service and other factors. The Army  requires that its retirees receive separation exams, although the Army does  not usually require this for servicemembers who are completing their tours  of active duty. The other military services do not require separation exams  for most servicemembers, except for those whose last physical exam or  assessment they received during active duty is out of date. (See table 1 for  each military service\u2019s medical evaluation requirements.) Further, all of  the military services also require separation exams for certain  occupational specialties. For example, the military services require  separation exams for servicemembers who have worked with hazardous  materials. Finally, any servicemember can request and receive a  separation exam.", "Requirements for separation exams may be affected by planned changes to  physical exam requirements for active duty servicemembers. The Army  and Navy plan to change their physical exam requirements for  servicemembers during active duty\u2014replacing routine physical exams  with periodic health assessments, thereby moving closer to the Air Force\u2019s  requirements for active duty servicemembers. In September 2003, the  Armed Forces Epidemiology Board (AFEB) issued a report that  concluded that annual health assessments, as currently administered by  the Air Force to active duty servicemembers, should replace routine  physical exams. According to their Surgeon General representatives, the  Army and the Navy intend to change their regulations relating to periodic  physical exams and to adopt the recommendations offered by the AFEB  by 2005.

Veterans retain the option of  initiating claims at any time after leaving the military, even if they did not  state their intention to do so on the medical assessment form completed  when they left military service.", "A VA C&P exam is a physical exam used to determine a veteran\u2019s degree of  disability in support of claims for service-connected disability  compensation. The exam obtains information on the veteran\u2019s medical  history and includes diagnostic and clinical tests, the scope of which  depend on what disabilities the veteran claims. For example, if a veteran  claims a disability for a knee injury, VA would require a comprehensive  orthopedic exam to determine the percent of movement that has been lost  due to the knee injury. Veterans may claim multiple disabilities\u2014all of  which must be evaluated for disability rating purposes.", "In general, VA\u2019s C&P exam is more comprehensive and detailed than the  military services\u2019 separation exams, as military service exams are intended  to document continued fitness for duty, whereas the purpose of the VA  C&P exam is to document disability or loss of function regardless of its  impact on fitness for duty. VA physicians who conduct the C&P exam  must evaluate the extent of a veteran\u2019s physical limitations and determine  their impact on the veteran\u2019s future employment for compensation  purposes. VA physicians usually conduct C&P exams at VA Medical  Centers, although since 1996 VA has had authority to use civilian  physicians to provide C&P exams at 10 VA regional offices. In addition,  VA physicians may provide C&P exams at some military medical facilities.

The officials explained  that VA\u2019s C&P exams obtain more information than needed to meet the Air  Force\u2019s health assessment requirement and that using VA\u2019s exam as a  single separation exam would not be an efficient use of resources. The  officials said that it would take military medical personnel too much time  to review the VA C&P exams to identify the information the Air Force  required. Similarly, officials at other Air Force installations we visited\u2014 Hurlburt Field, Langley Air Force Base, and Eglin Air Force Base\u2014agreed  that they would not benefit from a single separation exam program.  However, we did find one Air Force installation\u2014MacDill Air Force  Base\u2014where a single separation exam program was operational,  demonstrating the feasibility of Air Force installations participating in  single separation exam programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Military Officials Do Not Allocate Installation Resources for Single Separation Exam Programs", "paragraphs": ["Some military officials told us that they use their installations\u2019 resources  for other priorities than establishing single separation exam programs.  Although the 1998 MOU encouraged the establishment of these programs  for servicemembers leaving the military and filing VA disability claims,  some local military officials told us that their installations did not  currently have these programs because they decided to use available  resources to support other efforts, such as conducting wartime training  and ensuring that active duty servicemembers are healthy enough to  perform their duties. For example, when we visited Fort Bragg we learned  that the commander had initially agreed to provide space at his installation  for a single separation exam program. However, the same space was  committed to more than one function, and when the final allocation  decision was made, other mission needs took priority. In addition,  Nebraska VA officials told us that an existing single separation exam  program was eliminated at Offutt Air Force Base because military medical  personnel assigned to help VA physicians administer the exams were  needed to focus on the health of active duty servicemembers at the  installation.", "In addition, military officials explained that administering single  separation exams that include VA\u2019s C&P protocols are more time intensive  for their staff and can involve more testing than the military\u2019s separation  exams. As a result, military officials are reluctant to assign resources,  including facilities and staff, to this effort. Further, military officials  explained that expending time and resources to train military physicians  to administer single separation exams is not worthwhile because these  physicians periodically rotate to other locations to fulfill their active duty  responsibilities so other military physicians would have to be trained as  replacements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Military Staff Turnover Creates Challenges for Maintaining Established Single Separation Exam Programs", "paragraphs": ["Because single separation exam programs require coordination between  personnel from both VA and the military services, staff changes or  turnover can make it difficult to maintain existing programs. For example,  during our visit to the Army\u2019s Fort Lee, we found that the installation\u2019s  single separation program had stopped operating because of staff  turnover. When the program was in operation, a sequential approach was  used in which Army personnel conducted the initial part of the exams,  which included medical history and diagnostic testing, and then shared  servicemembers\u2019 medical records with VA personnel at the VA hospital,  where the single separation exams were completed. According to VA and  Army officials, after the Army personnel changed, the installation no  longer provided VA with the medical records.", "Further, VA officials told us that maintaining joint VA and DOD  programs\u2014such as single separation exam programs\u2014is challenged by  the fact that military staff, including commanders, frequently rotate.  According to VA officials, some commanders do not want to continue  agreements made by their predecessors so single separation programs  must be renegotiated when the commands change. However, VA officials  told us that the new draft MOA should help alleviate this challenge to  program establishment because it states that local agreements between  military medical facilities and VA regional offices will continue to be  honored when leadership on either side changes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 1998, VA and DOD\u2019s military services have attempted to establish  single separation exam programs in order to prevent duplication and  streamline the process for servicemembers who are leaving the military  and intend to file a disability claim with VA. However, according to VA,  fewer than 30 out of 139 military installations with BDD programs had  single separation exam programs as of May 2004. To encourage more  widespread program establishment, the departments have drafted a new  national MOA with the goal of having programs in place at all BDD sites by  December 31, 2004. Increasing the single separation exam program to all  BDD sites will allow more servicemembers to benefit from its  convenience. Yet, given the seemingly low rate of program implementation  since 1998 and the challenges we identified in establishing and maintaining  the program, it is unlikely that the programs will be established at about  100 more sites less than 2 months after the MOA becomes effective.  Consequently, both departments will need to monitor program  implementation to ensure that the new MOA is put into practice\u2014 especially since local agreements for single separation exam programs  have not always resulted in the establishment and operation of such  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To determine where single separation exam programs are established and  operating, we recommend that the Secretary of VA and the Secretary of  Defense develop systems to monitor and track the progress of VA regional  offices and military installations in implementing these programs at BDD  sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from VA and DOD.

We also obtained service-specific requirements  for periodic physical exams and health assessments and evaluations,  especially those requirements pertaining to separating and retiring  servicemembers. We obtained and reviewed relevant documentation  about both departments\u2019 efforts to establish single separation exam  programs. We also interviewed officials from the office of the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, the military services\u2019 Surgeons  General, and VA. In addition, we obtained VA\u2019s data on the number of  disability claims and the cost data associated with conducting military  physical exams and VA C&P exams. Based on our review of these data and  subsequent discussions with agency officials, we determined that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We obtained a list of 28 military installations that VA officials had  identified as having single separation exam programs through a survey of  their Benefits Delivery at Discharge (BDD) sites. We used this list to select  8 installations to learn how their programs operated. We did not verify  whether the remaining 20 installations had single separation exam  programs because such verification would have required a full evaluation  of actual program operations at these locations. We also did not verify the  number of installations with BDD sites or the numbers of single separation  exams VA reported for these military installations. We selected  installations that represented each of VA\u2019s reported approaches for  operating the single exam program\u2014VA physicians conducting the exam  at military installations, VA physicians conducting the exam at VA medical  centers, Department of Defense (DOD) physicians conducting the exam,  VA and DOD using a sequential approach for the exam, and VA\u2019s civilian  contractors delivering the exam. The installations we selected represented  each of the four branches of the military service\u2014Army, Navy, Air Force,  and Marines\u2014and all but one had more than 500 servicemembers leave in  fiscal year 2003. We obtained the separation data from the Defense  Manpower Data Centers\u2019 (DMDC) Active Duty Military Personnel file on  the number of servicemembers who left the military from various  separation locations during fiscal year 2003. To assess the reliability of  these data, we conducted logic tests to identify inconsistencies, reviewed  existing information about it and the system that produced it, and  interviewed an agency official who was knowledgeable about the data.

We also visited installations  that were located in the same VA regions as installations we visited that  VA had reported as having single separation exam programs. The seven  military installations we visited were Marine Corps Air Station Cherry  Point, North Carolina; Eglin Air Force Base, Florida; Fort Bragg, North  Carolina; Fort Gordon, Georgia; Hurlbert Field Air Base, Florida; Langley  Air Force Base, Virginia; and Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia. At these  installations, we interviewed medical command officials and VA officials  to learn whether single separation exam programs had been considered  and what the challenges were to establishing them. For the two Army  installations included in these seven selected installations\u2014Fort Bragg,  North Carolina and Fort Gordon, Georgia\u2014we obtained both the  separation exam data and C&P exam data for each installation to  determine how many separating servicemembers from each installation  received both an Army separation exam and a VA C&P exam. We chose  Army installations for this analysis because duplicate service and C&P  exams were more likely to occur due to the Army\u2019s requirement that  retirees receive a physical exam. After our review of the documentation  and subsequent discussions with agency officials, we concluded that these  data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We also  reviewed DOD\u2019s separation exam data and discussed it with an agency  official.
