To better understand how other countries deal with similar challenges, GAO was asked to identify how other countries address the issues that Exon-Florio is intended to address. Specifically, this report describes selected countries' (1) laws and policies enacted to regulate foreign investment to protect their national security interests and (2) implementation of those laws and policies. This report updates a 1996 GAO report that describes how four major foreign investors in the United States--France, Germany, Japan, and the United Kingdom--monitored foreign investment in their own countries to protect national security interests. It also examines foreign investment in six additional countries: Canada, China, India, the Netherlands, Russia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

However, each of the 10 countries has its own concept of national security that influences which particular investments may be restricted. As a result of the differing concepts, restrictions range from requiring approval of investments in a narrowly defined defense sector to broad restrictions on the basis of economic security and cultural policy. In addition, some countries have recently made changes to their laws and policies to more explicitly identify national security as an area of concern, in some cases as the result of controversial investments. Several countries have also introduced lists of strategic sectors in which foreign investment requires government review and approval. While there are many unique characteristics of the systems employed by the 10 countries to regulate foreign investment, in many ways the systems are similar to each other, and to the U.S. process under Exon-Florio. Eight countries use a formal review process--usually conducted by a government economic body with input from government security bodies--to review a transaction. Generally, national security is a primary factor or one of several factors considered in evaluating transactions. While the concepts of national security vary from country to country, all countries share concerns about a core set of issues. These include, for example, the defense industrial base, and more recently, investment in the energy sector and investment by state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds. Most countries have established time frames for the review and can place conditions on transactions prior to approval. For example, a country may place national citizenship requirements on company board members. However, unlike the voluntary notification under Exon-Florio, most countries' reviews are mandatory if the investment reaches certain dollar thresholds or if the buyer will obtain a controlling or blocking share in the acquired company. Further, unlike the United States, five countries allow decisions to be appealed through administrative means or in court. Two countries do not have a formal review process. The Netherlands restricts entry into certain sectors such as public utilities, and the UAE restricts the extent of ownership allowed in all sectors without a review. In addition to the formal mechanisms, there are unofficial factors that may influence investment in each of the 10 countries. For example, in some countries an informal government preapproval for sensitive transactions may be needed. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of the Treasury emphasized the United States' commitment to an open investment policy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. investment policy is anchored in the belief that global investment is  beneficial and necessary to bring economic prosperity worldwide. The  United Nations reported that between 2000 and 2006, annual foreign direct  investment in the United States averaged $144 billion, which is 16 percent  of the world\u2019s total during that period. The Deputy Secretary of the  Treasury testified in 2005 that there is an inherent link between our  national security interests and a strong U.S. economy that facilitates free  and fair trade. However, foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies can pose a  significant challenge for the U.S. government because of the need to  balance the benefits of foreign investment with national security concerns.  The Exon-Florio amendment to the Defense Production Act authorizes the  President to suspend or prohibit transactions that could result in foreign  control of U.S. companies if the transaction threatens to impair national  security. The review of individual transactions has been delegated to an  interagency committee, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the  United States (CFIUS).

For example, in 2006, there were approximately 1,730  transactions of foreign companies acquiring U.S. companies. In the same  year, CFIUS received 113 notices, or 6.5 percent of the total transactions  for 2006. Seven of those notices proceeded to a 45-day investigation and  none of them were prohibited.

One aspect of this energy policy proposal would be a  prohibition on non-EU companies acquiring control of a European  Community energy transmission system or transmission system operator,  unless it is specifically permitted by an agreement between the EU and the  foreign company. The stated goal of this proposal is to promote  competition, but the effect would also be to block foreign companies,  state-owned enterprises, sovereign wealth funds, and others from being  able to acquire certain energy assets in an EU country.", "Some countries review or restrict foreign investment based on economic  security or cultural nationalism. Canada, China, and Japan formally  indicate economic reasons as part of the criteria for the review of foreign  investment. For example, China reviews the acquisition of traditional  Chinese brands, and Canada restricts foreign investment specifically to  protect Canada\u2019s cultural heritage. The UAE also has in place investment  restrictions focused on ensuring UAE citizen involvement in the country\u2019s  economy. India maintains restrictions on investments in the financial  sector, defense industry, real estate, infrastructure, telecommunications,  print media, and single-brand product retail, among other sectors.", "Government officials in six countries have expressed specific concerns  about investments by foreign state-owned enterprises or sovereign wealth  funds. Because sovereign wealth funds are government owned, there are  concerns that they may be guided by political objectives rather than profit  maximization or that their financial decisions may be motivated by  support for certain \u201cnational champion\u201d companies. A sovereign wealth  fund is a fund owned by a government and is composed of financial assets  such as stocks, bonds, property, or other financial instruments. Sovereign  wealth funds are generally composed of government fiscal surpluses, or  from official foreign exchange reserves at central banks. Because of the  unknown potential for sovereign wealth funds to be motivated by political  instead of economic considerations, countries may seek to limit such  investments.", "On February 27, 2008, the European Commission released a document  entitled A Common European Approach to Sovereign Wealth Funds  proposing that EU leaders endorse a common EU approach to increasing  the transparency, predictability, and accountability of sovereign wealth  funds. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is also developing best  practices on how to manage sovereign wealth funds. According to the  IMF, sovereign wealth funds have existed since the 1950s, but their total  size worldwide has increased significantly in the last 10 to 15 years. The  IMF estimates that as of September 2007, total holdings of sovereign  wealth funds were between $2 trillion and $3 trillion, and may reach $10  trillion by 2012.", "China, Russia, and the UAE all maintain sovereign wealth funds whose  worth is estimated in the billions of dollars. Japan has also proposed  establishing its own sovereign wealth fund, according to a private sector  representative. In Germany and France, specific concerns have been  raised about sovereign wealth funds investing in the two countries. In a  joint letter, the German Chancellor and the French President wrote to the  current President of the European Union Council in September 2007 to  request that attention be paid by the European Union to the manner in  which sovereign wealth funds can distort competition, as well as to call for  a code of conduct to be developed for hedge funds investing in Europe.  The letter emphasized that financial market transparency and appropriate  regulation and supervision of investors is necessary to avoid potential  negative results. Further, the German government is considering whether  to develop measures to address concerns about the implications of  sovereign wealth funds acquiring German companies.", "Russian government officials told us that under the July 2007 version of  the proposed Strategic Sectors Law, state-owned enterprises and  sovereign wealth funds would require government approval and will not  be able to obtain a controlling share in certain strategic sectors. The U.S.  State Department has indicated that in the February 2008 version of the  draft, entities partially owned by a foreign government would face a 5  percent limit on unsupervised ownership. In December 2007, the Canadian  government issued new guidelines to clarify how the Investment Canada  Act applies to state-owned enterprises, including sovereign wealth funds.  Entities within the United Kingdom and the Netherlands have also  expressed concerns about foreign government-controlled investments, but  the governments do not currently have plans to revise their foreign  investment policies to address those concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Countries Specify Review Time Frames, Can Set Conditions on Approval, Specify Thresholds for Review, and Allow Appeals", "paragraphs": ["Every country except China specifies time frames in which the review is to  be completed.

In Russia, the current anti- monopoly review time frame is 30 days, but national security reviews have  no set time frames. Reviews in the United Kingdom must be completed  within 6 months, although many are completed in 30 days.

These conditions, also referred to as undertakings,  contingencies, or mitigation agreements, were generally similar in each of  the countries. For example, a country may place national citizenship  requirements on an acquired company\u2019s board members, or a company  may be required to maintain its defense contracts after an acquisition.  Examples of conditions imposed by the French government include (1)  guaranteed continuation of the activities of the company, (2) protection of  the companies\u2019 research and development capabilities, and (3) guarantees  that the company will meet its obligations under its current procurement  contracts. In the United Kingdom, when foreign investors have acquired  companies that produced items for the military, those investors have been  required to agree to conditions related to the maintenance of strategic  capabilities. For example, when a U.S. defense company acquired a  defense company in the United Kingdom, the British government required  the acquiring company to agree to certain conditions related to the  protection of classified technology and information. We also found that  similar conditions have been required in Canada and Russia. Further,  some countries have required annual reporting by the investing companies  to ensure adherence to the mitigation agreements, and may require  divestment if the company does not adhere to the agreements.", "Of the eight countries with a review process, six maintain official  thresholds for review, either dollar thresholds or a controlling or blocking  stake, which may be defined differently in each country. China reviews all  transactions at some government level. India requires government  notification for all investments, and does not specify monetary thresholds  for review. In Germany, an investor\u2019s failure to comply with the  notification requirement may generate civil and criminal penalties.  Countries generally rely on the fear of reprisal, fines, or mandatory  divestment to encourage application and adherence to their review  process, rather than actively pursuing companies that do not file.", "Unlike the United States, five countries allow judicial appeal of decisions  or have an administrative procedure to ask for reconsideration of a  decision made as a result of the review process.

Certain  foreign investments may be considered sensitive by the host government;  therefore, a firm may informally contact the host government to discuss  the transaction prior to formal application for review. This was a common  practice in several of the selected countries. Seeking unofficial  preapproval can enable the potential investor to assuage any concerns the  host government may have about the pending transaction. Likewise, if a  host government is unlikely to approve a transaction, this can be  communicated to the investor prior to the formal application process. In  such a case, the investor may never apply for review because of unofficial  feedback from government officials concerning the likelihood of approval.  In other circumstances, a firm may withdraw its application for a review if  it receives unofficial feedback from the government that the transaction is  unlikely to be approved.", "Although the laws and policies that regulate the review of foreign  investment are generally designed to be apolitical, for example, by basing  the review mechanism in an administrative component of the host  government, political influence in the public sphere may negatively affect  the outcome of an attempted investment. Regardless of the official policy  of the country, domestic politics play an important role in the review and  approval of foreign investment. This can add a measure of uncertainty to  the review process. According to the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), political pressure often occurs in  areas of policy that are loosely defined, such as protecting national and  cultural interests. Political figures may be able to block an investment on  these grounds.", "While most governments support foreign direct investment in their  economy, in some instances the perceived economic impact of a particular  investment may still be a cause for concern. According to the OECD,  countries may attempt to mask this by citing national security  considerations or other legitimate national interests to block a foreign  investment transaction. The European Commission has reported to the  OECD that these reasons have been cited in several instances by European  Union member states to disguise economic or protectionist actions. In  some cases, host governments may seek to protect certain companies,  \u201cnational champions,\u201d from external takeover or competition. National  champions may be protected from foreign acquisition through, among  other means, the public comments of political figures or the provision of  government assistance to aid a company in seeking an alternative  domestic merger partner.", "The public may also react negatively to foreign investment. For example,  the 2006 Chinese mergers and acquisitions regulations allow competing  domestic firms to request that the Chinese government review a foreign  merger or acquisition for anti-trust concerns, a procedure that provides  Chinese companies a legal process to become involved in decisions about  foreign investment reviews of their competitors. Further, the public may  react negatively to the sale of local companies to foreign firms because  such sales may place a local region\u2019s economy in the control of a foreign  entity. Local employees and residents may fear that foreign investment  will increase the likelihood of layoffs and other reductions in force. The  practice of foreign private equity firms purchasing a company to obtain its  assets, and then laying off or significantly restructuring the local  workforce so as to reap rapid profits through resale of the company, is a  concern, and has been referred to as \u201cvulture\u201d and \u201clocust\u201d capitalism in  Japan and Germany."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested and received written comments on a draft of this report  from the Department of the Treasury.

Various factors make  China\u2019s foreign investment review process unpredictable in practice.  Factors affecting the review process include (1) competitor firms  generating negative public attention that may influence relevant officials,  (2) bureaucratic infighting, (3) differences in priorities between the local  and central level Chinese government related to their motivations for the  approval of foreign investment, (4) the Chinese political calendar, and (5)  regulatory ambiguity and lack of procedural transparency.

In addition, China\u2019s foreign  investment regulations are considered complex, in transition, and lack  definitions for key terms, making the review process ambiguous.", "According to Chinese officials, there is one review process with many  facets, and all transactions must go through the Ministry of Commerce.", "Step 1: All foreign investors must apply to the local or provincial-level  Ministry of Commerce when attempting to merge with or acquire a  Chinese firm.", "Step 2: Most small transactions are reviewed and approved by the local-  level Ministry of Commerce and then go to the local- or provincial-level  government for registration and licensing.

(Step 4.)", "Step 3: The central-level Ministry of Commerce reviews large or politically  sensitive transactions. Factors affecting political sensitivity might include  the size of the transaction, whether a state-owned enterprise is involved,  whether the sector itself is sensitive, and whether actors involved in the  transaction are connected to the State Council. At this point, the central-  level Ministry of Commerce acts as the administrative coordinator for the  review.", "Step 4: Other relevant actors provide \u201cpreapproval.\u201d This step generally  determines whether or not a transaction will be approved.

While the  great majority of transactions are cleared without incident, the review\u2019s  multiple layers and ambiguous standards allow intervention by parties  opposed to a transaction, according to U.S. State Department officials. For  example, the 2006 regulations state that domestic competitors of the  Chinese firm being acquired can request that the Chinese government  review a transaction for anti-trust concerns. According to U.S. and  industry officials, domestic competitors can also indirectly affect  transactions by generating negative public attention around a deal that  could then affect decision makers. For example, when a U.S. private equity  firm attempted to purchase 85 percent ownership of a construction  machinery company, the chief executive officer of a rival Chinese firm  stated that selling the company to a foreign firm was not in China\u2019s  interest, and he reportedly worked to derail the transaction. Recently this  type of interference has become more common.", "A second factor that can slow approvals is bureaucratic infighting.  According to U.S. and industry officials, a number of Chinese  bureaucracies have overlapping jurisdictions and competing interests,  which can affect the outcome of a particular review. For example, Chinese  officials in the Ministry of Commerce and the State Administration of  Industry and Commerce both suggested they conducted anti-trust reviews,  but, according to U.S. State Department officials, there appears to be little  coordination of their efforts. This overlapping claim is indicative of the  lack of clarity regarding what governmental bodies are involved in a given  review.", "A third factor that can affect approvals is the difference in incentives  between the local and central level Chinese government when approving  foreign mergers and acquisitions. According to U.S. government officials,  there is a split between the central government, which is concerned about  implementing social policies, and the local governments, which are more  concerned with economic growth, providing jobs, and attracting  investment. Since local governments have a large degree of influence in  the approval process, they are one of the major forces counteracting  protectionist tendencies in China.", "A fourth factor is the Chinese political calendar. According to U.S. and  industry officials, foreign firms can have increased difficulty getting  government approval for mergers and acquisitions in the year preceding a  Chinese Communist Party congress. The Chinese Communist Party  convenes a party congress approximately every 5 years. At these events,  the party decides its future policy positions and selects new leadership.  According to U.S. and industry officials, the atmosphere preceding a party  congress is politically charged. Since the appearance of appeasing  foreigners can have negative political repercussions in the Chinese  political system, many Chinese officials are apprehensive about approving  any foreign investments during this time. In particular, since most top  executives at state-owned enterprises are party members, investments that  affect powerful vested interests, particularly in state-dominated sectors, or  those that risk being viewed as contrary to central government policies,  are more likely to face political interference according to the U.S. State  Department.", "In addition to those factors, according to U.S. officials and industry  representatives, the relationships among various laws and regulations are  complex and unclear. This lack of clarity lessens the ability of foreign  firms to predict the likelihood of government approval of an investment.  For example, Chinese officials stated that the 2006 regulations and the  Catalog provide the primary regulatory framework for reviewing and  regulating foreign investment. However, they could not articulate the  relationship between the two other than to say that the Catalog is one of  many factors considered in the review process. Moreover, according to a  U.S. government official, Chinese laws tend to be vaguely worded and  general in nature. This allows implementing ministries leeway in  interpreting these measures. Implementing rules sometimes offer  clarification. Further, according to the Organization for Economic Co- operation and Development, the 2006 regulations appear to create a new  layer of review, in addition to the examination and approval process based  on the Catalog.", "In another example, the State Council Opinion on Revitalizing the  Industrial Machinery Industry calls for China to expand the domestic  market share in 16 equipment-manufacturing fields. The Guiding Opinion  Concerning the Advancement of Adjustments of State Capital and the  Restructuring of State-Owned Enterprises lists seven sectors the  government deems critical to the national economy, which must be kept in  the state\u2019s hands. However, it is unclear how these opinions are related to  the review process. A Chinese official from the commission that  promulgated the list stated that it would be more difficult for a foreign firm  to purchase a Chinese company in one of those sectors. However, another  Chinese official did not view the list as important because it is nonbinding.", "The Chinese government has not defined key terms in the 2006 regulations,  contributing to a lack of transparency in the review process. The updated  regulations add a screening requirement if the foreign investment  transaction affects \u201cnational economic security,\u201d involves a \u201cmajor  industry,\u201d or results in the transfer of \u201cfamous trademarks\u201d or \u201ctraditional\u201d  Chinese brands. However, the regulations do not define these terms,  making it difficult for businesses to determine when screening is required  and when it is not.", "According to U.S. government and industry officials, the definition of  \u201cnational economic security\u201d is particularly unclear. In fact, according to  an industry official, the Ministry of Commerce has not publicly used  national economic security as a reason for preventing a foreign merger or  acquisition. According to the U.S. State Department, some Chinese  scholars affiliated with more protectionist factions of the government use  national economic security to refer to self-sufficient economic growth.  Thus, investment that would lead China to become dependent on foreign  participation in the economy to sustain economic growth should be  restricted. Other Chinese scholars believe national economic security  refers to economic development that promotes stability, such as a  continued increase in living standards, progress on environmental  protection, and the creation of jobs. Since China\u2019s leaders see economic  development as key to maintaining internal stability, national security and  national economic security are treated as equally important, according to  Chinese and U.S. officials. In practice, the sectors China considers  important to national security are listed as forbidden in the Catalog.", "Confusion over new regulations is common. According to industry  representatives, the Chinese government sometimes promulgates a  regulation that many, including those in the government charged with  implementing the regulations, do not understand. Implementing  regulations are key to spelling out the details of a law, but may be released  after the law takes effect. When this occurs, the business community  attempts to determine the parameters of the law or regulation through trial  and error. Over time, the regulation will take shape. Accordingly, a U.S.  State Department official said the lack of definitions and transparency in  the 2006 regulations could be indicative of disagreements within the  Chinese government regarding how to regulate foreign investment.

Whereas countries such as West Germany and France emerged  from the war and took measures to attract foreign capital to rebuild, Japan  has historically had a surplus of capital and therefore little need to attract  foreign investment, according to a consultant on Japanese financial and  trade-related issues. Japan enacted the Foreign Exchange and Foreign  Trade Act (FEFTA) in 1949, which, according to an academic, barred  foreign companies from repatriating profits from Japan, effectively  prohibiting all but a few cases of foreign investment. This continued until  1967, at which time Japan was required to open its economy to foreign  investment to become a member of the OECD. Japan further changed its  laws in 1991, by amending the Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Act,  which today remains the primary law relevant to FDI. However, despite  changes in the law, foreign investment did not increase substantially until  the economic downturn in the late 1990s; this increase in foreign  investment is the result of bankrupt companies seeking foreign investors  in order to stay afloat, according to U.S. State Department officials and  representatives from the private sector and academia.", "Officials also offered multiple explanations for why foreign investment in  Japan has been low. One explanation is that foreign acquisitions of  Japanese companies face barriers caused by business practices such as  cross-shareholding\u2014the practice of companies holding shares of each  other\u2019s stock\u2014and keiretsu relationships\u2014groups of affiliated companies  that hold each other\u2019s shares and may also have financial (such as bank  loans) or manufacturer-supplier ties or distributor relationships. Cross- shareholding and keiretsu relationships lessen the amount of shares  available on the stock market. In addition, cross-shareholding may prevent  a foreign company from taking management control of a company, even if  the foreign company is the largest individual shareholder. The Japanese  government notes that keiretsu relationships and cross-shareholding have  become less common than they were in the past. Another explanation is  that Japanese businesses are averse to foreign investment. One reason for  that is because Japan possesses a system of guaranteed lifetime  employment, which has led Japanese business managers to place a greater  value on internal corporate loyalty than shareholder returns, according to  the U.S. State Department.

In May 2005, the Japanese government released  guidance on how to appropriately implement defensive measures. As of  May 2007, about 340 companies in Japan had instituted such defensive  measures.

In fact, foreign investment  mergers and acquisitions in Japan have typically occurred only when the  Japanese company is in financial distress, according to a business  association representative.
