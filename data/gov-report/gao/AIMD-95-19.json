First, the projections in the chart are based on revenue estimates. As we noted in our June 1994 report, the District has overestimated some revenues in the past. Lower than expected revenues would increase the debt service percent. And, as discussed in our June 1994 report, the District plans to limit general obligation bond borrowing below what is needed for capital projects.

Public Schools and the Water and Sewer Authority."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The District\u2019s Bond Rating and Debt Compared With Other Jurisdictions", "paragraphs": ["Various debt indicators are available to compare debt characteristics of jurisdictions. For example, investment services provide ratings of bonds which assess the amount of risk associated with borrowing.

Tables 1 and 2 show the long-term bond ratings of the 20 largest cities and all 50 states.", "As can be seen from tables 1 and 2, the District\u2019s bond rating of Baa is lower than any state and all but two of the cities listed. According to Moody\u2019s Investors Service analysts, this rating reflects the District\u2019s long history of financial pressures and budget-balancing difficulties. This rating has been the same since the District first issued general obligation bonds in 1984.", "Other comparisons of the District\u2019s debt with other jurisdictions are more problematic. For example, comparing the District\u2019s 14-percent debt service limitation with other jurisdictions is difficult because the type of limits vary. In fact, a Moody\u2019s Investors Service official told us that no state imposes a limit on cities and counties based on a percentage of total revenues like the District\u2019s limitation. A May 1994 Moody\u2019s Investors Service report that outlined debt restrictions imposed on cities and counties by their states notes that almost all states imposed general obligation debt volume limits on cities and counties. In most states the limit is based on a percentage of the local jurisdictions\u2019s taxable real property.", "Although the limits imposed by states on cities and counties most often are related to property values, the way these limits are calculated varies widely. For example, some limits are based on the full property value and others on an adjusted value. In other states, limits exclude some types of borrowing; for example, enterprise fund borrowing or public school borrowing. Because the limits of other jurisdictions vary widely, we did not specifically determine how close other jurisdictions are to their legal limits.", "Other indices are routinely used by investment services to compare the extent of borrowing among jurisdictions. Two of these indices are per capita debt and the amount of debt compared with the value of real property subject to tax. Table 3 shows the median, high, and low values for these indices for various population categories of cities, counties, and states.", "The District of Columbia\u2019s overall net debt per capita was $6,315, and the ratio of net debt to taxable real property was 8.1 percent. Although both ratios are high when compared with other cities, counties, or states, comparing the District\u2019s debt limitations and amount of debt with other jurisdictions is problematic because of the unique nature of the District. For example, debt limits for state, counties, and cities would only affect the debts incurred to finance the functions carried out by the specific jurisdiction. In contrast, the District has a single debt limit applicable to carry out all its governmental functions, whether these functions are representative of those carried out by states, counties, or cities. Thus, comparing the District\u2019s ratios to state, county, or city debt ratios may not be a meaningful comparison to the extent the District\u2019s debt is used to finance functions that may overlap functions financed by state, county, and city debt. For example, the District\u2019s debt would include debt related to typical city functions (for example, police and fire protection) as well as debt associated with typical state and county functions (for example, motor vehicle and driver licensing). District officials also pointed out that other unique factors make comparing the District to other jurisdictions difficult. They noted that unlike most cities and counties, sales and income tax provide a substantial portion of the District\u2019s tax revenue. Therefore, the debt/taxable real property ratio is not meaningful to compare the District to other jurisdictions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Debt Service Information Is Not Consistent", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier in this letter, the general obligation debt limitation calculations are made by the Treasurer\u2019s Office at the time the District issues new general obligation bonds and are included in the bond prospectus.

Information on the debt service percent is also included in the District\u2019s multi-year plans and annual financial reports, but this information is not consistent with the Home Rule Act methodology.", "The estimates in the multi-year plans do not use the methodology required by the Home Rule Act, which is the same methodology that is used to determine whether the District may issue new general obligation bonds.Instead of calculating the debt service percent by using the highest fiscal year debt service divided by the estimated revenue for the fiscal year the bonds will be issued\u2014as is done in the bond prospectus\u2014the debt service percent information in the multi-year plan is calculated by dividing the current year debt service by the current year revenue.", "The result is that the debt service percent information contained in the multi-year plans is less than what the percent would be if the Home Rule Act methodology were used. For example, for fiscal year 1994, information in the bond offering documents indicated that the debt service percent was 11.42 percent, while the debt service percent included in the multi-year plan for fiscal year 1994 was 10.14 percent. Although the fiscal year 1994 revenue estimates for each calculation were slightly different, the primary reason for the difference was the amount of debt service. The bond offering documents used the highest debt service for any fiscal year ($409.1 million which will occur in fiscal year 1998) and the multi-year plan used the fiscal year 1994 debt service of $362.2 million. The Home Rule Act not only specifies the methodology to be used in the multi-year plan, but the information in the current multi-year plans understates the debt service percentage in relation to the District\u2019s debt limit.

The methodology for calculating the debt service percentage in the financial statements is not specified in law. Like the debt service percent information contained in the multi-year plan, the debt service percent included in the financial statements is calculated by dividing fiscal year debt service by fiscal year revenues rather than the highest debt service for any fiscal year. The financial statements include the debt service information in an exhibit entitled \u201cComputation of Legal Debt Limitation\u201d.

District officials provided two additional reasons for the relatively low bond rating: the District\u2019s unfunded pension liability and lack of state sovereignty. They also noted that part of the reason the District is approaching the debt limit was the issuance of $331 million in 12-year bonds in 1991 to eliminate a deficit in the General Fund. They explained that these bonds were of shorter duration than typical general obligation bonds that are used to finance capital projects and that this increased the amount of debt service.
