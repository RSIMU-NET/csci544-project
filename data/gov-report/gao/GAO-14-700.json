This report examines (1) trends in federal crop insurance costs and farm sector income and wealth from 2003 through 2012 and (2) the potential savings to the government and impacts on farmers, if any, of reducing federal premium subsidies for revenue policies. GAO analyzed USDA crop insurance program data and farm sector income and wealth data from 2003 through 2012 (most recent year with complete crop insurance data); reviewed economic literature and documents from stakeholders including farm industry groups and researchers; and interviewed USDA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The cost of the federal crop insurance program and farm sector income and wealth grew significantly from 2003 through 2012. The cost of crop insurance averaged $3.4 billion a year from fiscal years 2003 through 2007, but it increased to $8.4 billion a year for fiscal years 2008 through 2012. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA), the agency that administers the crop insurance program, subsidies for crop insurance premiums accounted for $42.1 billion\u2500or about 72 percent\u2500of the $58.7 billion total program costs from 2003 through 2012. Revenue policies, the most frequently purchased crop insurance option, accounted for $30.9 billion of the total premium subsidy costs for 2003 through 2012. Crop insurance premium subsidy rates\u2014the percentage of premiums paid by the government\u2014are set by Congress and would require congressional action to be changed. For most policies, the rates range from 38 to 80 percent, depending on the policy type, coverage level chosen, and geographic diversity of crops insured. As premium subsidy costs increased, farm sector income and wealth indicators also increased. For example, for each year from 2003 through 2012, median farm household income exceeded median U.S. household income. Specifically, on average, median farm household income was $7,205, or 13.8 percent, greater each year than U.S. household income, in constant 2012 dollars. Farm sector income also grew from $73.8 billion in 2003 to $113.8 billion in 2012, in constant 2012 dollars. Farm real estate values, another measure of farm prosperity, increased by 72 percent from 2003 through 2012, in constant 2012 dollars, and farmers relied less on borrowed funds to finance their holdings.", "Reducing premium subsidies for revenue policies could potentially result in hundreds of millions of dollars in annual budgetary savings with limited costs to individual farmers. For example, the federal government would have potentially saved more than $400 million in 2012 by reducing premium subsidies by 5 percentage points, and the savings would have been nearly $2 billion by reducing these subsidies by 20 percentage points. Although such reductions would have required farmers to pay more of their premiums, the impact on their average production costs per acre would have been limited, usually less than 2 percent, and often less than 1 percent. For example, for corn, premium subsidy reductions of 5 and 20 percentage points in 2012 would have raised average production costs per acre by about $2.80 and $11.20, respectively. These increases would have been about 0.4 percent and 1.7 percent, respectively, of the total average production cost per acre of $656 that year for corn. The ultimate impact of such limited production cost increases on farmers' income would depend on their individual profit margins. However, for the industry as a whole, the impact appears to be minimal. In 2000, when Congress enacted new premium subsidy rates, the new rates immediately became effective. In contrast, when RMA increases the premiums charged for policies, it generally phases in the increases over several years to lessen the impact on farmers. Documents from farm industry groups and some researchers note that reductions in premium subsidies could result in lower farmer participation in the program and lower insurance coverage levels. However, available economic literature indicates that farmers' response to such reductions may be small due to factors such as the attractiveness of revenue policies and increasing importance of crop insurance as other farm programs are reduced or eliminated. In addition, other stakeholders identified incentives that would help keep farmers in the program, including pressure from lenders to maintain crop insurance coverage and the importance of crop insurance to many farmers as their primary risk management tool. In the event that subsidy rates were reduced, actual information on the impact on farmer participation would be available if participation were monitored."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To reduce the cost of the crop insurance program, Congress should consider reducing the level of federal premium subsidies for revenue crop insurance policies, including a phased reduction, if appropriate, and directing USDA to monitor and report on the impact, if any, of this reduction on crop insurance program participation.

Under the federal crop insurance  program, farmers can choose various levels and types of insurance  protection. For example, they can insure against losses caused by poor  crop yields or declines in revenues for each insurable crop they produce.  In 2012, the crop insurance program provided more than $117 billion in  insurance coverage for about 283 million acres of farmland with almost  1.2 million policies. The federal government\u2019s crop insurance costs  include subsidies to pay for (1) part of a farmer\u2019s crop insurance  premiums, which averaged about 62 percent of total premiums in 2012,  and (2) administrative and operating expenses (administrative costs)\u2014 provided on behalf of farmers\u2014to insurance companies to cover their  expenses for selling and servicing crop insurance policies.", "In recent years, policies that protect against crop revenue loss resulting  from declines in production, price, or both\u2014known as revenue policies\u2014 have become the most popular policy type.

In general, these policies include a harvest price provision,  allowing farmers with this coverage whose insured crops experience a  decline in revenue below the level guaranteed in their policy to file a loss  claim based on the higher of either the preplanting price or the harvest  price of the covered crop.", "The cost of the federal crop insurance program has come under scrutiny  at the same time that the nation\u2019s budgetary pressures have been  increasing. As of March 2014, the national debt was estimated at $17.6  trillion. Furthermore, in the last 15 years, debt held by the public has  nearly doubled. As we discuss on our key issues website, the large  national debt reduces the federal government\u2019s flexibility to respond to  new and unexpected challenges and, if interest rates rise, the payments  on the debt will use up a growing part of the federal budget.

This report examines (1) trends in federal  crop insurance costs and farm sector income and wealth from 2003  through 2012 and (2) the potential savings to the government and  impacts on farmers, if any, of reducing federal premium subsidies for  revenue policies.", "To address these objectives, we interviewed officials of the U.S.  Department of Agriculture (USDA), including officials from the Economic  Research Service (ERS) and Risk Management Agency (RMA), and  reviewed documents they provided, including, for example, documents on  crop insurance program costs and outlays. We also interviewed officials  at the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). For the first objective, we  reviewed and analyzed RMA crop insurance program data for 2003  through 2012, including data on the types of crops insured, the number  of acres insured, and total program costs. In particular, we focused on  these data as they relate to revenue policies. For these analyses we only  included information on \u201cbuy-up\u201d policies\u2014that is, the portion of crop  insurance for which a farmer pays a premium; \u201cbuy-up\u201d policies account  for any coverage that is purchased above the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d level. We  also reviewed and analyzed ERS data for 2003 through 2012 on the  overall financial condition of the farm sector, including data on farm  income and farmland values. For the purposes of this report, crop  insurance costs and premium subsidies, which are budget-related data,  are reported in nominal dollars, while data on median farm household and  U.S. household income, net farm and net cash income, and farmland  values are reported in inflation adjusted dollars, using 2012 as the  reference year. In addition, as appropriate, we report these data in  calendar, fiscal, or crop years, depending on how the data were reported  in the source documents. Unless otherwise indicated, these data are in  calendar years. To address the second objective, we analyzed the  potential impacts of reducing premium subsides for revenue policies in  2012, the most recent year for which we had complete data at the time of  our analysis. Using RMA data, we estimated what the savings to the  federal government would have been if premium subsidies had been  reduced by 5, 10, 15, or 20 percentage points in 2012. We also estimated  what a reduction in premium subsidies by each amount would have  added to the production costs of farmers. Specifically, using ERS  Agricultural Resource Management Survey data, we estimated what the  additional production cost per acre, on average, would have been in 2012  for a variety of crops, including the major field crops of corn, cotton,  soybeans, and wheat that receive the majority of the revenue crop  insurance premium subsidies. We reviewed related documentation,  interviewed knowledgeable agency officials, and reviewed related internal  controls information to evaluate the reliability of the data discussed  above. In each case, we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report. In addition, we reviewed the agricultural  economic literature for the period 1993 through 2013, to get information  on what impact, if any, premium subsidy reductions would have on  farmers\u2019 participation in the crop insurance program. A more detailed  discussion of our objectives, scope, and methodology is presented in  appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2013 to August 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Farmers are exposed to financial losses because of production risks\u2014 droughts, floods, and other natural disasters\u2014as well as variations in the  market price of their crops. The federal government has played an active  role in helping to mitigate the effects of these risks on farm income by  promoting the use of crop insurance. RMA has overall responsibility for  administering the federal crop insurance program, including controlling  costs and protecting against fraud, waste, and abuse. As of May 2014,  RMA partnered with 19 private insurance companies that sell and service  the program\u2019s insurance policies and share a percentage of the risk of  loss and opportunity for gain associated with the policies (known as  \u201cunderwriting\u201d). RMA administers the crop insurance program through a  Standard Reinsurance Agreement that establishes the terms and  conditions under which participating insurance companies sell and  service federal crop insurance policies.", "Through the federal crop insurance program, farmers insure against  losses on more than 100 crops. These crops include major crops\u2014such  as corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat, which accounted for more than  three-quarters of the acres enrolled in the program in 2012\u2014as well as  nursery crops and certain fruits and vegetables. More specifically,  according to RMA, federal crop insurance penetration based on planted  acres is high for the principal crops of corn, soybeans, wheat, and  cotton. For example, in 2012, about 84 percent of the planted principal  crops were insured under the federal crop insurance program. More  specifically, corn acreage was 84 percent insured, soybean acreage was  84 percent insured, wheat acreage was 83 percent insured, and cotton  acreage was 94 percent insured.", "Most crop insurance policies are either production-based or revenue  policies. For production-based policies, a farmer can receive a payment if  there is a production loss relative to the farmer\u2019s historical production per  acre. Revenue policies protect against crop revenue loss resulting from  declines in production, price, or both. The federal government  encourages farmers\u2019 participation in the federal crop insurance program  by subsidizing the insurance premiums and acting as the primary  reinsurer for the private insurance companies that take on the risk of  covering, or underwriting, losses of participating farmers.", "The federal government\u2019s premium subsidies for crop insurance policies  are not payments to farmers, but they can be considered a financial  benefit to farmers. Without a premium subsidy, a participating farmer  would have to pay the full amount of the policy premium. Congress sets  premium subsidy rates, meaning the percentage of the premium paid by  the government. Premium subsidy rates vary by the level of insurance  coverage that the farmer chooses and the geographic diversity of crops  insured. For most policies, the statutory premium subsidy rates range  from 38 percent to 80 percent. Premium subsidy rates increased, as a  percentage of total premiums, from an average of 37 percent in 2000 to  an average of 63 percent in 2012. In addition, premium subsidies rose as  crop prices increased because higher prices meant the insured value of  the crop increased, and premiums are based on the value of what is  insured.", "In addition, the federal government pays administrative and operating  expense subsidies to insurance companies as an allowance that is  intended to cover their expenses for selling and servicing crop insurance  policies. In turn, insurance companies use these subsidies to cover their  overhead expenses, such as payroll and rent, and to pay commissions to  insurance agencies and their agents. Insurance companies also incur  expenses associated with verifying\u2014also called adjusting\u2014the amount of  loss claimed. These expenses include, for example, loss adjusters\u2019  compensation and travel expenses of adjusters to farmers\u2019 fields. The  administrative expense subsidies also can be considered a subsidy to  farmers; with these subsidies, crop insurance premiums are lower than  they would otherwise be if the program followed commercial insurance  practices. In private insurance, such as automobile insurance, these  administrative expenses typically are captured through the premiums paid  by all policyholders.", "The federal government provides crop insurance premium subsidies in  part to achieve high crop insurance participation and coverage levels.  Higher participation and coverage levels may reduce or eliminate the  need for disaster assistance payments from congressionally authorized  ad hoc disaster programs to help farmers recover from natural disasters,  which can be costly. For example, under three separate congressionally  authorized ad hoc disaster programs, USDA provided $7 billion in  payments to farmers whose crops were damaged or destroyed by natural  disasters from 2001 to 2007. Farmers\u2019 participation in the federal crop  insurance program and spending on ad hoc disaster assistance have been policy issues for more than 30 years. A 2005 USDA publicationasserts that Congress passed the Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980  and subsequent related legislation to strengthen participation in the crop  insurance program with the goal of replacing costly disaster assistance  programs. According to this publication, the government has historically  attempted to increase participation in the federal crop insurance program  by subsidizing premiums, including increasing the level of these subsidies  over time.", "The 2014 farm bill introduced several changes to the crop insurance  program. Regarding revenue policies specifically, the legislation added  peanuts to the list of crops eligible for this policy type. The legislation also  made \u201centerprise units\u201d a permanent option for revenue and other policy  types. An enterprise unit consists of all insurable acreage of the same  insured crop in the county in which the farmer has a share on the date  coverage begins for the crop year. In addition, separate insurable  enterprise units for both irrigated and nonirrigated crops will be available.  Separating the acreage can increase risk protection for farmers because  losses on dryland crops would no longer be offset by higher yields on  irrigated acreage when the two are combined.", "The 2014 farm bill also added two new policy options to the crop  insurance program\u2014the Supplemental Coverage Option and the Stacked  Income Protection Plan for upland cotton. The Supplemental Coverage  Option is based on expected county yields or revenue, to cover part of the  deductible under the farmer\u2019s underlying policy (referred to as a farmer\u2019s  out-of-pocket loss or \u201cshallow loss\u201d). The federal subsidy as a share of  the policy premium is set at 65 percent. The Stacked Income Protection  Plan insures against losses in county revenue of 10 to 30 percent of  expected county revenue based on the deductible level selected by the  farmer for the underlying individual policy. The federal subsidy as a share  of the policy premium is set at 80 percent. As of June 2014, USDA was  developing implementing guidance for these new policies that it expects  to issue before the start of the 2015 crop year. For now, it is uncertain  how farmers will utilize these new policies and how their use will impact  federal crop insurance premium costs, including for revenue policy  premium subsides."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Crop Insurance Costs and Farm Sector Income and Wealth Grew Significantly from 2003 through 2012", "paragraphs": ["Federal crop insurance program costs and farm sector income and wealth  grew significantly during the period 2003 through 2012.

In 2000, when Congress enacted legislation to increase crop  insurance premium subsidy rates, the new rates immediately became  effective (i.e., upon enactment of the legislation). In contrast, according  to RMA officials, when the agency increases the premiums charged for  crop insurance policies based on new actuarial data, as it did in 2012, it  generally phases in the increases over several years so the impact on  farmers is less dramatic. Table 2 provides more information on the  amount of potential savings that corresponds to the various levels of  reduction in revenue policy premium subsidies, by crop.", "These levels of potential savings are based on the assumption that  farmers would not make any changes to their policies. For example,  according to this assumption, farmers would not change from a revenue  policy to a less expensive yield policy or leave the crop insurance  program altogether. In addition, they are based on the assumption that  farmers would keep their existing coverage levels. To the extent that  farmers purchased less expensive policies, left the program, or  purchased lower coverage levels, the potential savings would be greater  because the total amount of federal premium subsidies required would  decrease. In addition, the potential savings would decline if crop prices  declined. This would occur because premiums are affected by crop  prices\u2014as crop prices decrease so does the value of the crops being  insured, which results in lower crop insurance premiums. Since premium  subsidies are a set percentage of the premiums, these subsidy amounts  would decrease as premium amounts decreased.", "We and other federal agencies have previously analyzed the potential  savings to the federal government from reductions in premium subsidies  to all or selected crop insurance policies. In our March 2012 report, based  on an analysis of RMA data, we found that if the premium subsidy rates of  all participating farmers in 2010 and 2011 had been reduced by 10  percentage points\u2014from 62 percent to 52 percent\u2014the annual cost  savings for those years would have been about $759 million and $1.2  billion, respectively.", "The president\u2019s 2013 budget, which included a proposal to reduce  premium subsidies, asserts that deep premium subsidies are no longer  needed with the current high farmer participation rates in the crop  insurance program. Further, in his 2014 budget, the president included  two legislative proposals to reduce the premium subsidies to farmers.  One proposal was to reduce the premium subsidies by 3 percentage  points for all yield and revenue policies that had premium subsidy rates  above 50 percent. According to the RMA\u2019s analysis for this proposal, the  premium subsidy reduction would save the federal government about  $4.2 billion over 10 years. The second proposal was to reduce premium   RMA estimated  subsidies for revenue policies by 2 percentage points. that this reduction in premium subsidies would save the government  about $3.2 billion over a 10-year time frame. The president made a  similar proposal in his 2015 budget but increased the subsidy rate  reduction for revenue policies to 4 percent. RMA estimated the total  expected savings over 10 years from that proposal would be $6.3 billion.  However, any change in the premium subsidies would require action by  Congress.", "Specifically, the second proposal applied to revenue policies that include the harvest  price provision. Such policies accounted for about 98 percent of the premium subsidies for  all revenue policies in 2012.", "CBO, Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2014 to 2023 (Washington, D.C.: November  2013). were implemented, CBO estimated the federal government would save  $22.1 billion over a 10-year period from 2014 through 2023."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reducing Federal Premium Subsidies Would Increase Individual Farmers\u2019 Average Costs per Acre, but the Increase Would Be Limited", "paragraphs": ["Reductions to revenue policy premium subsidies of 5, 10, 15, and 20  percentage points would result in increases in farmers\u2019 production costs  as the share of the premium that they pay would increase. However, our  analysis of 2012 RMA crop insurance data indicates that changes in  average production costs would be limited. For example, individual corn  farmers would have experienced average premium cost increases per  acre for their crop insurance policies of $2.81, $5.62, $8.43, or $11.24  with premium subsidy reductions of 5, 10, 15, or 20 percentage points,  respectively, in 2012. Those premium cost increases represent a limited  increase in the average production costs per acre for corn farmers,  usually less than 2 percent and often less than 1 percent. For example,  the average production costs for corn farmers were about $656 per acre  that year; with the premium cost increases, their production costs would  have increased an average of 0.4 percent, 0.9 percent, 1.3 percent, and  1.7 percent with premium subsidy reductions of 5, 10, 15, or 20  percentage points, respectively.

However, for the industry as a whole, the impact on farmers\u2019 income  appears to be minimal. For example, as noted in table 2, for a 5 to 20  percentage point reduction in subsidies, total farm costs in 2012 would  have increased from about $0.4 billion to $1.8 billion. Further, as  discussed, farm sector income in 2012 was about $114 billion. Thus,  these increased costs, as a percentage of farm sector income, would  have been about 0.4 to 1.6 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact to Farmers\u2019 Participation in the Crop Insurance Program Resulting from Premium Subsidy Reductions May Be Minimal", "paragraphs": ["Information on the impact to farmer participation from reductions in  federal crop insurance premium subsidies is limited, but the economic  literature and government information that is available suggest the impact  may be minimal. Farm industry groups and some researchers have stated  that changes to crop insurance premium subsidies could result in  reductions in farmer participation and insurance coverage levels.  However, available economic literature on the impact on farmer  participation due to premium subsidy reductions indicates that farmers\u2019  response to changes in premium subsidies may be small due to factors  such as their heavy reliance on crop insurance, the attractiveness of  revenue policies, and the increasing importance of crop insurance as  other farm programs are reduced or eliminated.", "Government studies of this issue have reached similar conclusions. A  limited RMA analysis in support of the president\u2019s 2014 budget proposal  determined that a 5 percentage point premium subsidy reduction for yield  and revenue policies would result in a limited number of farmers leaving  the crop insurance program; that analysis determined that it was more  likely that some farmers would purchase lower levels of policy coverage.  According to RMA\u2019s Chief Actuary, it is difficult to determine the effect of a  premium subsidy change in part because of the lack of data. The task of  determining the effect of a change is easier if there has been a major  change in premium subsidy rates, and the impact can be assessed, this  official said. A major change in premium subsidy rates creates a \u201cnatural  experiment\u201d in which to better analyze the impact to farmer participation  from a change in subsidy rates. According to the Chief Actuary, this  \u201cnatural experiment\u201d last occurred with the passage of the Agricultural  Risk Protection Act in 2000 that significantly raised premium subsidy  rates. This in turn led to an increase in farmer participation in the crop  insurance program. However, there has been no \u201cnatural experiment\u201d to  analyze how reduced premium subsidy rates impact farmer participation  because, since 2000, premium subsidy rates generally have not been  reduced. In the event that premium subsidy rates were reduced, actual  information on the impact on farmer participation would be available.  According to an RMA official, it would be a good idea to monitor the  impact on farmer participation if Congress reduced premium subsidy  rates.", "CBO, Options for Reducing the Deficit: 2014 to 2023 (Washington, D.C.: November  2013).", "4 percent of their acres.farmers rely heavily on crop insurance, these results could overestimate  the potential impact to farmer participation and the overall number of  farmers leaving the crop insurance program could be smaller.", "However, the study further noted that, because  Stakeholder and government officials we interviewed, as well as  documents and data we reviewed, have identified several different  incentives that could lessen the likelihood of significant changes in farmer  participation in the crop insurance program even if premium subsidies are  reduced. First, even with the premium subsidy reduction, farmers would  receive substantial premium subsidies for revenue policies. For example,  with a premium subsidy reduction of 20 percentage points for revenue  policies, farmers would receive an average premium subsidy rate of about  40 percent for their premium cost, based on our analysis of 2012 RMA  data. Second, crop insurance is important to lenders that provide loans to  farmers to help finance their operations. According to lending  associations that represent agriculture credit providers, crop insurance  provides lenders with greater certainty that loans made to farmers will be  repaid. In addition, according to an economic paper published by two  ERS economists and a professor from the University of Illinois,participation in crop insurance lowers revenue risk and might allow  lenders to accept loan applications with lower collateral or applications for  farm operations that are more leveraged. Third, farmers may not be  inclined to exit the crop insurance program since it has emerged as the  main safety net for farmers. According to some farm industry  stakeholders, many farmers have made crop insurance their primary risk  management tool. Finally, another incentive for farmer participation may  be growing concerns among farmers about the frequency and severity of  adverse weather events, such as floods, droughts, heat waves, and  strong storms. According to the Secretary of Agriculture, other USDA  officials, and some state extension officials and academic researchers,  farmers are increasingly concerned about such weather events and their  impact on agricultural production, including crop losses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Federal crop insurance plays an important role in protecting farmers from  losses caused by natural disasters and price declines, and it has become  one of the most important programs in the farm safety net for farmers,  according to USDA officials and some farm industry stakeholders.  However, with increasing budgetary pressures, it is critical that federal  resources are targeted as effectively as possible. With record farm  income in recent years, the subsidies, including premium subsidies,  provided for federal crop insurance have come under increasing scrutiny.  Reductions in premium subsidies for farmers who purchase revenue  policies, the most common and expensive crop insurance policy type,  present an opportunity to potentially save hundreds of millions of dollars  per year for taxpayers with limited increases in individual farmer\u2019s  production costs. The president has included proposals for premium  subsidy reductions in his fiscal year 2013, 2014, and 2015 budgets. Such  a change would require congressional action and could either be  implemented immediately, as in 2000, when Congress enacted legislation  to increase premium subsidy rates, or phased in, as when RMA increases  the premiums charged for crop insurance policies based on new actuarial  data.", "One point of discussion in the debate over premium subsidy reductions is  the possible impact on farmer participation in the program. The crop  insurance industry and some researchers suggest that even a modest  premium subsidy reduction would result in some farmers lowering their  coverage levels or dropping coverage altogether. However, the  administration, CBO, and other researchers say that a modest reduction  in premium subsidies would have little impact on program participation,  and that incentives, such as the continued high level of premium  subsidies, would likely keep farmers in the program.

We also spoke with officials at the  Congressional Budget Office (CBO).", "To address our first objective, we reviewed and analyzed RMA data on  the government\u2019s cost for the federal crop insurance program for the  period 2003 through 2012. We are reporting federal crop insurance  program costs, not outlays, because the cost numbers more accurately  reflect the true costs for a given year. For example, much of the actual  costs for 2012 were not determined until the following year after the  claims adjustments were completed and the underwriting gains and  losses determined. In contrast, outlays for 2012 do not include many of  the costs actually incurred that year, but they do include many costs  incurred the prior year (i.e., 2011) because of the lag time in completing  the claims adjustments for that year. Finally, in reporting costs, not  outlays, we are being consistent with how the program reports its costs,  including in the audited financial statements of the Federal Crop  Insurance Corporation. We analyzed RMA crop insurance program data  including data on the level of premium subsidies for revenue policies, the  top 10 states that received revenue policy premium subsidies, the  insurance coverage levels chosen by farmers with revenue policies, and  the crops that received the most revenue policy premium subsidies. For  overall program costs, we analyzed fiscal year data presented in RMA\u2019s  cost and outlay tables. RMA data contain more detailed crop insurance  information by crop year, which is what we used for our revenue policy  analyses. For these analyses, we only included information on \u201cbuy-up\u201d  policies\u2014that is, the portion of crop insurance for which a farmer pays a  premium. Any coverage that is purchased above the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d level  is considered \u201cbuy-up\u201d coverage; this type of coverage represented 99.9  percent of the revenue policy premium subsidies for the 2003 through  2012 period. In addition, we only included information for individual  revenue policies and excluded group revenue policies because these  latter policies made up only a small portion (less than 2 percent) of the  total premium subsidies associated with revenue policies. We selected  the time period of 2003 through 2012 to get a representation of the trend  in program costs, usage of revenue policies, and financial condition of the  farm sector. At the time of our analysis, USDA officials said that 2012  would be the most recent year with complete and stable crop insurance  program data. To get an understanding of trends in farm sector income  and wealth, we reviewed and analyzed ERS data and reports on the  overall financial condition of the farm sector, including information on net  farm and cash income, production costs, and farm debt ratios from 2003  through 2012, as well as information from USDA\u2019s National Agricultural  Statistics Service on farmland values for these years. We also reviewed  and analyzed ERS information on forecasts for these elements of the  farm economy, including net cash income and net farm income for 2013  and 2014. For the purposes of this report, crop insurance costs and  premium subsidies, which are budget-related data, are reported in  nominal dollars, while data on median farm household and U.S.  household income, net farm and net cash income, and farmland values  are reported in inflation adjusted dollars, using 2012 as the reference  year.
