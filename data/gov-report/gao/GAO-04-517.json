The company's decisions were part of an overall strategy to increase the scope and size of American Growers' crop insurance business. However, when anticipated profits did not cover the company's high operating expenses and dropped its surplus below statutory minimums, Nebraska's Department of Insurance (NDOI) declared the company to be in a hazardous financial condition prompting the state commissioner to take control of the company. In 2002, RMA's oversight was inadequate to evaluate the overall financial condition of companies selling federal crop insurance. Although RMA reviewed companies' plans for selling crop insurance and analyzed selected financial data, oversight procedures generally focused on financial data 6 to 18 months old and were insufficient to assess the overall financial health of the company. Additionally, RMA did not routinely share information or otherwise coordinate with state regulators on the financial condition of companies participating in the crop insurance program. For example, NDOI had identified financial and management weaknesses at American Growers. Since American Growers' failure, RMA has acted to strengthen its oversight procedures by requiring additional information on companies' planned financial operations. It is also working to improve its coordination with state insurance regulators. However, as we completed our review, neither of these initiatives had been included in written agency policies. When American Growers failed, RMA effectively protected the company's policyholders, but lacked a policy to ensure it handled the insolvency efficiently. RMA has spent over $40 million, working with the state of Nebraska, to protect policyholders by ensuring that policies were transferred to other companies and that farmers' claims were paid. NDOI accommodated RMA's interests by allowing RMA to fund the operation of the company long enough to pay farmers' claims. Prior to American Growers' failure, RMA did not have an agreement with the NDOI commissioner defining state and federal financial roles and responsibilities. If the NDOI commissioner had decided to liquidate the company, RMA may have incurred more costs and had less flexibility in protecting policyholders."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Federal crop insurance is part of an overall safety net of federal programs  for American farmers. Federal crop insurance provides protection for  participating farmers against the financial losses caused by droughts,  floods, or other natural disasters and against the risk of crop price  fluctuations. Participation in the program is voluntary; however,  participation is encouraged through federal premium subsidies. In 2003, the  program provided nearly $40 billion in risk protection for over 200 million  acres of farmland at a cost of over $3 billion to the federal government. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s  (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA)  has overall responsibility for the crop insurance program. RMA manages  the contracts with the companies that sell and service crop insurance,  oversees the development of new insurance products for farmers, and  monitors compliance with program provisions by both farmers and  insurance companies. RMA also acts as the ultimate guarantor for policy  losses, in the event companies are unable to fulfill their obligations under  the federal crop insurance program. RMA administers the program in  partnership with private insurance companies that share a percentage of  the risk of loss or gain associated with each insurance policy written. In  addition, RMA pays companies an expense reimbursement\u2014a percentage  of premiums on policies sold\u2014for the administrative costs of selling and  servicing federal crop insurance policies. Companies sell crop insurance to  farmers through agents, who are paid a commission by the companies on  the policies they sell.", "American Growers Insurance Company (American Growers) failed in 2002;  at that time, it was the largest participant in the federal crop insurance  program, accounting for about 20 percent of the premiums written in 2002.  American Growers experienced a 50 percent decline in its surplus over a  9-month period, from January through September 2002. This decline in the  company\u2019s surplus prompted the Nebraska Department of Insurance  (NDOI), the regulator for the state in which American Growers was  chartered, to take control of the company, due to its hazardous financial  condition. On November 22, 2002, NDOI issued a state order of supervision.  Under the order of supervision, American Growers could not sell any new  insurance policies or conduct other nonroutine business without the  approval of the supervisor appointed by NDOI. Rather than immediately  liquidating the company, NDOI decided with RMA to place the company in  rehabilitation\u2014the process where the regulator, in this case NDOI, takes  control of the management of the company\u2014and to operate the company  to settle remaining claims and transfer existing policies to other  companies. On December 20, 2002, NDOI obtained a court order that  placed American Growers into rehabilitation under the auspices of NDOI.  Under rehabilitation, NDOI appointed a rehabilitator who took control of  American Growers to oversee the orderly termination of the company\u2019s  business and to allow for an orderly transfer of policies to other companies.  To ensure continued service to farmers who purchased crop insurance  through American Growers, RMA chose to pay costs associated with  managing the company while American Growers finished collecting and  processing premiums and settling claims. To date, RMA\u2019s funding of  American Growers\u2019 operations has cost taxpayers over $40 million to pay  agent commissions, staff salaries, and other operating expenses.", "You asked us to determine (1) what key factors led to the failure of  American Growers, (2) whether RMA procedures were adequate for  monitoring crop insurance companies\u2019 financial condition, and (3) how  effectively and efficiently RMA handled the dissolution of American  Growers. In addition, you asked us to determine the factors that led to RMA  determinations that affected a proposed sale of American Growers\u2019 assets  to Rain and Hail LLC (Rain and Hail); and RMA\u2019s decision to guarantee that  all American Growers\u2019 agent commissions be paid. Information related to   Rain and Hail\u2019s proposal is provided in appendix VII. Information on RMA\u2019s  decision to pay agent commissions is provided in appendix VIII. To  determine the key factors that led to the failure of American Growers, we  examined company documents and financial statements, reviewed RMA  and NDOI files, conducted interviews with employees and company  personnel, and obtained statistical analyses of the crop insurance program  from RMA\u2019s data mining center. We compared American Growers\u2019 financial  information with that of other companies in the crop insurance program.  We also spoke with crop insurance companies to gain an industry  perspective on the failure of American Growers and RMA\u2019s actions. To  evaluate RMA\u2019s procedures for monitoring companies, we reviewed RMA\u2019s  regulations and methods, interviewed RMA staff, and reviewed  documentation to verify that monitoring procedures were followed. To  determine the effectiveness of RMA\u2019s handling of the dissolution of  American Growers, we examined RMA\u2019s decision-making process,  reviewed financial and other documents, and interviewed RMA and  American Growers\u2019 staff, National Association of Insurance  Commissioners (NAIC) officials, and industry groups. We also contacted  state insurance commissioners where crop insurance companies are  chartered to discuss oversight issues and coordination with RMA. We  performed our work between July 2003 and May 2004, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I contains  more detailed information on our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Farming is an inherently risky enterprise. In conducting their operations,  farmers are exposed to both production and price risks. Crop insurance is  one method farmers have of protecting themselves against these risks.  Over the years, the federal government has played an active role in helping  to mitigate the effects of these risks on farm income by promoting the use  of crop insurance.", "Federal crop insurance began on an experimental basis in 1938, after  private insurance companies were unable to establish a financially viable  crop insurance business. The federal crop insurance program is designed  to protect farmers from financial losses caused by events such as droughts,  floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters as well as losses resulting  from a drop in crop prices. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation  (FCIC), an agency within USDA, was created to administer the federal crop  insurance program. Originally, crop insurance was offered to farmers  directly through FCIC. However, in 1980, Congress enacted legislation that  expanded the program and, for the first time, directed that crop  insurance\u2014to the maximum extent possible\u2014be offered through private  insurance companies, which would sell, service, and share in the risk of  federal crop insurance policies. In 1996, Congress created an independent  office called RMA to supervise FCIC operations and to administer and  oversee the federal crop insurance program.", "Federal crop insurance offers farmers various types of insurance coverage  to protect against crop loss and revenue loss. Multiperil crop insurance is  designed to minimize risk against crop losses due to nature\u2014such as hail,  drought, and insects\u2014and to help protect farmers against loss of  production below a predetermined yield, which is calculated using the  farmer\u2019s actual production history. Buy-up insurance, the predominant  form of coverage, provides protection at different levels, ranging from 50 to  85 percent of production. Catastrophic insurance provides farmers with  protection against extreme crop losses. Revenue insurance, a newer crop  insurance product, provides protection against losses in revenue  associated with low crop market prices in addition to protecting against  crop loss. RMA, through FCIC, pays a portion of farmers\u2019 premiums for  multiperil and revenue insurance, and it pays the total premium for  catastrophic insurance. However, farmers still must pay an administrative  fee for catastrophic insurance. RMA determines the amount of premium  for each type of insurance policy by crop. RMA, through FCIC, contracts  with private insurance companies who then sell these policies to farmers.  Companies sell crop insurance to farmers through agents. An agent, a  person licensed by the state in which the agent does business to sell crop  insurance, is employed by or contracts with a company to sell and service  eligible crop insurance policies. While most companies pay their agents a  commission to sell and service crop insurance policies, some companies  pay agents a salary. American Growers paid its agents a commission.", "RMA establishes the terms and conditions to be used by private insurance  companies selling and servicing crop insurance policies to farmers through  a contract made with the companies called the SRA. The SRA is a  cooperative financial assistance agreement between RMA, through FCIC,  and the private crop insurance companies to deliver federal crop insurance  under the authority of the Federal Crop Insurance Act. Under the SRA,  FCIC reinsures or subsidizes a portion of the losses and pays the insurance  companies an administrative fee or expense reimbursement\u2014a  preestablished percentage of premiums\u2014to reimburse the companies for  the administrative and operating expenses of selling and servicing crop  insurance policies, including the expenses associated with adjusting  claims. While the reimbursement rate is set at a level to cover the  companies\u2019 costs of selling and servicing crop insurance policies, the  companies have no obligation to spend their payment on expenses related  to crop insurance, and they may spend more than they receive from FCIC.  The current reimbursement rates, set by statute, are based on  recommendations in our 1997 report of the costs associated with selling  and servicing crop insurance policies. However, RMA does not have a  process for regularly reviewing and updating these rates. RMA is currently  conducting a limited review of companies\u2019 expenses to validate the costs of  selling and servicing federally reinsured crop insurance policies.", "RMA, through FCIC, is the reinsurer for a portion of all policies covered by  the federal crop insurance program. Reinsurance is sometimes referred to  as insurance for insurance companies. It is a method of dividing the risk  among several insurance companies through cooperative arrangements  that specify ways in which the companies will share risks. Reinsurance  serves to limit liability on specific risks, increase the volume of insurance  policies that may be written, and help companies stabilize their business in  the face of wide market swings in the insurance industry. As the reinsurer,  RMA shares the risks associated with crop insurance policies with  companies that sell federal crop insurance. However, if a crop insurance  company is unable to fulfill its obligations to any federal crop insurance  policyholder, RMA, as the ultimate guarantor for losses, assumes all  obligations for unpaid losses on these policies. Reinsurance is also  available through private reinsurance companies. Crop insurance  companies must maintain certain surplus levels to issue crop insurance  policies. However, they may increase their capacity to write policies and  may further reduce their risk of losses by purchasing reinsurance from  private reinsurance companies on the risk not already covered by FCIC.", "American Growers was originally established in 1946 as Old Homestead  Hail Insurance Company. The company went through several  reorganizations and name changes between 1946 and 1989. In 1989, the  company became American Growers Insurance Company, operating as a  subsidiary of the Redland Group, an Iowa-based insurance holding  company. Acceptance Insurance Companies Inc., (Acceptance)\u2014a  publicly owned holding company that sold specialty property and casualty  insurance\u2014acquired American Growers in 1993.", "As a wholly owned subsidiary of Acceptance, American Growers was  primarily responsible for selling and servicing federal crop insurance  policies and shared the same general management as the parent  organization.

The company\u2019s  decisions were part of an overall management strategy to increase the  scope and size of American Growers\u2019 crop insurance business. The  company\u2019s surplus declined due to losses and other costs from mistakes  made when introducing a new crop insurance product, decisions to pay  higher than average agent commissions, and the purchase of a competitor\u2019s  business. Additionally, the company\u2019s operating expenses were about 1 1/3  times its reimbursement from RMA. In other words, American Growers  was spending $130 for every $100 it was receiving from RMA to pay for  selling and servicing crop insurance. American Growers planned to use  profits from policy premiums to pay for the expenses not covered by RMA\u2019s  reimbursement. When these gains did not materialize due to widespread  drought, the company\u2019s surplus dropped below statutory minimums,  prompting NDOI to take control of the company.", "First, the company introduced a new crop insurance product, but mistakes  associated with the sale of this product resulted in significant losses in the  company\u2019s surplus. In 1997, the company chose to market a new crop  insurance product, Crop Revenue Coverage Plus (CRC Plus), which was a  supplement to federal crop insurance, but which was not reinsured by  RMA. In 1999, American Growers expanded the sale of this product into  rice, a crop with which it had little experience. When the company realized  it had mis-priced the product for rice and withdrew the product, farmers  who had planned on using CRC Plus sued the company. Financial losses,  legal settlements, and other costs related to CRC Plus caused significant  losses in the company\u2019s financial surplus. Appendix II provides further  details on the losses associated with CRC Plus.", "Second, American Growers chose to spend more than RMA reimbursed it  for selling and servicing crop insurance, in part, because the company  chose to pay above-average agent commissions in order to attract more  agents to sell for the company. As part of its effort to expand operations,  the company in 2000 to 2002, paid agent commissions about 12 percent  higher, on average, than those offered by other crop insurance companies.  In addition to paying agent commission rates above the average of other  companies in the industry, American Growers offered agent sales  incentives, such as trips to resort locations, and funded other expenses not  required to sell and service federal crop insurance. These expenses, among  others, created operating costs that were 11 percent greater than the  average operating costs of other companies selling crop insurance, and  these expenses exceeded the reimbursement RMA provided companies.  Appendix III provides additional details of the high operating costs  associated with agent commissions and other expenses.", "Third, the company purchased the crop business of a competitor, which  increased its expenses. In 2001, American Growers attempted to expand its  share of the crop insurance market by purchasing assets from another  company, including that company\u2019s book of crop insurance business.  Because American Growers was unable to achieve the operational  efficiencies it had anticipated, this acquisition resulted in additional  operating costs and expenses that were higher than the reimbursement that  RMA provided companies to cover the sale and service of crop insurance.  Appendix IV provides additional details on the operating expenses incurred  from the purchase of a competitor\u2019s crop insurance business.", "Finally, the company relied on large underwriting gains to pay for its  expenses, rather than RMA\u2019s reimbursement. When these gains did not  materialize due to widespread drought in 2002, the company\u2019s surplus  dropped to a level that prompted NDOI to take control of the company. In  its 2002 operating budget, American Growers projected profits in excess of  its 10-year average and relied on these anticipated profits to cover the  company\u2019s operating expenses and to further its growth. The company\u2019s  profit projections were based, in part, on retaining a higher percentage of  the risk for the policies it sold than in past years. By retaining a higher  percentage of the risk on the policies, American Growers could increase its  profits if claims were low. Conversely, the company increased its exposure  to loss if claims were high.  However, profits did not materialize as the  result of widespread drought, which caused overall federal crop insurance  program losses to increase from $3 billion in 2001 to $4 billion in 2002.  When American Growers\u2019 expenses and losses dropped the company\u2019s  surplus below statutory minimums, NDOI declared the company to be in a  hazardous financial condition and took control of the company\u2014first  placing the company under supervision in November 2002 and then in  rehabilitation in December 2002.

RMA\u2019s actual oversight procedures focused primarily  on whether a company had sufficient surplus to pay claims based on its  past performance, rather than the overall financial health and outlook of  the company. In addition, RMA did not generally share information or  coordinate with state regulators on the financial condition of companies  participating in the federal crop insurance program. Although RMA  reviewed companies\u2019 operational plans and selected financial data, such as  annual financial statements, in the case of American Growers, RMA was  unaware that the company was projecting underwriting gains in excess of  historic averages to pay for its operating expenses. The company\u2019s failure  to achieve these gains resulted in a substantial reduction in its surplus and  its subsequent financial failure.

However, the information provided was typically 6 to 18  months old; and, according to an RMA official, the agency\u2019s oversight  focused primarily on whether a company had financial resources to pay  claims on crop insurance policies and not on the overall financial health of  the company. RMA\u2019s approach to financial oversight stemmed, in part,  from the fact that the companies participating in the program are private  and are licensed and regulated by state insurance departments. State  insurance departments are responsible for monitoring the overall financial  condition of companies chartered and licensed to operate in their state. In  addition, some of the companies selling crop insurance are affiliated with  holding companies or other related companies, which RMA does not  review for financial soundness. Since American Growers\u2019 failure, RMA has  begun requiring federal crop insurance companies to provide additional  financial data to help the agency determine if companies are adequately  financed to perform their obligations under their SRAs.", "One of RMA\u2019s primary responsibilities is to ensure the integrity and stability  of the crop insurance program, in part, by monitoring insurance companies\u2019  compliance with program criteria such as submitting statutory statements  required by state regulators and meeting certain financial ratios, as defined  in federal regulations. To ensure that the companies participating in the  federal crop insurance program sell and service insurance policies in a  sound and prudent manner, the Federal Crop Insurance Act requires crop  insurance companies to bear a sufficient share of any potential policy loss.  Title 7, Code of Federal Regulations, chapter IV, contains the general  regulations applicable to administering the federal crop insurance  program. The SRA between RMA and participating crop insurance  companies establishes the terms and conditions under which RMA will  provide subsidy and reinsurance on crop insurance policies sold or  reinsured by insurance companies. These terms and conditions state, in  part, that companies must provide RMA with accurate and detailed data,  including their (1) annual plan of operation, (2) financial statements filed  with the applicable state insurance regulator, and (3) any other information  determined necessary for RMA to evaluate the financial condition of the  company.", "When approving a company to participate in the crop insurance program,  RMA analyzes it according to 16 financial ratios set forth in RMA  regulations. Combined, these 16 ratios are intended to provide RMA a  reasonable set of parameters for measuring insurance companies\u2019 financial  health, albeit generally from a historical perspective. The 16 financial  ratios include such things as (1) change in net writings, (2) 2-year overall  operating ratio, (3) change in surplus, and (4) liabilities to liquid assets.  Ten of the 16 ratios specifically refer to changes related to companies\u2019  surplus\u2014the uncommitted funds used to cover policy claims. When a  company fails more than 4 of the 16 financial ratios, RMA requires the  company to submit an explanation for the deviation and its plans to correct  the situation. If the explanation appears reasonable, RMA approves the  company to sell and service crop insurance for the next crop year.", "In August 2001, RMA notified American Growers that the company had 6  ratios, based on its December 2000 financial statement, that fell outside  acceptable ranges, including its 2-year overall operating ratio, change in  surplus, and 2-year change in surplus. Table 1 shows the 6 ratio  requirements and American Growers\u2019 ratio for each of the 6 ratios it failed.", "According to an RMA memorandum dated October 2001, American  Growers reported that most of its unacceptable ratios were due primarily  to underwriting losses related to its multiperil crop insurance that  produced unfavorable results due to drought conditions in 2000,  particularly in Nebraska and Iowa, and the impact of the federally  subsidized reimbursement not covering the company\u2019s expenses.  Additionally, American Growers cited the cost of the class-action lawsuit  relating to its CRC Plus product as a contributing factor. Finally, American  Growers explained that the expansion of its crop operations through the  purchase of a competitor\u2019s crop insurance business was expected to  provide efficiencies that would reduce expenses and help improve the  company\u2019s profitability in the future.", "Based on American Growers\u2019 explanations, RMA determined that the  company\u2019s 2002 SRA should be approved. RMA did not believe that the  adverse developments that American Growers had experienced were  significant enough to move the company close to insolvency. RMA\u2019s  decision was partially based on anticipated improvements in overall  performance resulting from American Growers\u2019 acquisition of another  company\u2019s assets and the potential for achieving greater economies of  scale.", "Furthermore, while American Growers failed more than 4 of the 16  financial ratios, it was not the only company with such results. Of the 18  companies participating in the federal crop insurance program in 2002,  other companies had a higher number of failed ratios than American  Growers, though most had fewer. Specifically, of the other 17 companies, 3  companies had 7 or more failed ratios, 1 had 6\u2014the same number as  American Growers, and 13 companies had 4 or fewer failed ratios.", "In March 2002, American Growers had 5 ratios, based on its December 2001  financial statement, that fell outside acceptable ranges, including change in  net writings, 2-year overall operating ratio, and liabilities to liquid assets.  Table 2 shows the 5 ratio requirements and American Growers\u2019 ratio for  each of the 5 ratios it failed.", "American Growers cited its acquisition of its competitor\u2019s crop insurance  business, the adverse development of its CRC Plus settlement, and the  delay in its reinsurance payments due from RMA as the primary reasons for  failing these ratios. Based on the company\u2019s explanation of why it had  failed the 5 ratios, in June 2002\u20145 months before American Growers\u2019  financial failure\u2014RMA determined that American Growers met the  standards for approval to sell and service crop insurance policies for 2003.", "In 2002, as in 2001, although American Growers failed to meet more than 4  ratios, as required by the SRA, its performance was not unlike some other  companies. Of the 19 companies participating in the crop insurance  program in 2003, 2 companies had 8 or more failed ratios, 2 had 5\u2014the  same number as American Growers, and 14 companies had 4 or fewer  failed ratios.", "Although RMA routinely reviewed the financial documents required under  the SRA, we found the agency\u2019s financial oversight procedures inadequate  to fully assess American Growers\u2019 financial condition. RMA reviewed the  company\u2019s surplus and reinsurance arrangements and approved the  company to write policies for the 2003 crop year, based on this analysis.  However, RMA was unaware that American Growers was projecting profits  in excess of historic averages to pay for its operating expenses and that its  failure to achieve these profits would mean that the company\u2019s surplus  would be inadequate to absorb resulting operating losses and could result  in the financial failure of the company.", "One reason RMA was unable to identify deficiencies in American Growers\u2019  finances was because, following the agency\u2019s emphasis on companies\u2019  compliance with program criteria, RMA only reviewed a company\u2019s  historical financial information and its ability to pay claims on the basis of  the company\u2019s past surplus and its private reinsurance agreements. For  example, RMA\u2019s decision to approve companies to participate in the federal  crop insurance program for 2002 (July 2001 \u2013 June 2002) was based on the  company\u2019s financial information as of December 31, 2000. Further, while  RMA required companies to submit an operation plan showing projected  policy sales, RMA did not require a company to provide operating budget  projections for the upcoming year. As a result, RMA\u2019s approval decisions  were generally based on a company\u2019s past financial performance rather  than a forward-looking perspective of a company\u2019s financial health.", "Without knowing the details of a company\u2019s projected operating budget  including its acquisition plans and the financial conditions of affiliated,  parent, or subsidiary companies, RMA did not have a complete picture of  the company\u2019s financial condition. Thus, RMA was unable to adequately  identify or take action to lessen any risks that may have been developing in  companies with deteriorating profits, as was the case in American  Growers. We believe that this lack of information impaired RMA\u2019s  decision-making process; therefore, the agency was forced to make  decisions based on incomplete, narrowly focused, and dated information.", "Subsequent to the financial failure of American Growers, RMA took several  steps to improve its oversight and analysis of the financial condition of  companies currently participating in the federal crop insurance program.  For example, in 2003, RMA started requesting more comprehensive budget  and cash flow information from participating companies, which provides  the agency a more forward-looking perspective of the companies\u2019 financial  health. Specifically, RMA will require insurance companies to provide their  estimated underwriting gains or losses for the coming year; copies of all  risk-based capital reports; and a signed statement identifying any  potential threats to the company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations for current  and future reinsurance years, along with the possible financial ramification  of such obligations. In addition, RMA is revising the SRA in its efforts to  address some of the shortcomings of the current SRA. Although RMA  officials said the agency plans to continue requesting more comprehensive  information from crop insurance companies and had developed a financial  analysis plan, as we concluded our review, the agency did not have formal  written policies and procedures in place incorporating these changes.", "In a November 2003 memorandum to RMA\u2019s administrator, USDA\u2019s Office of  Inspector General provided general comments and suggestions for RMA\u2019s  consideration in its renegotiation of the current SRA.

Beginning in 2001, and continuing through August  2002, NDOI was internally discussing the possibility of conducting a  targeted examination of Acceptance, including its subsidiary\u2014American  Growers. However, in September 2002, due to other priorities and resource  constraints, NDOI decided to postpone an on-site examination of the  company until 2003. RMA called the state insurance regulator in May 2002,  and again in September 2002, asking whether there were any special  inquiries or actions pending by the state regarding American Growers and  whether American Growers was listed on the state\u2019s list of companies at  risk. NDOI acknowledged to RMA that it had asked American Growers to  provide additional information regarding its first quarterly submission for  2002; however, NDOI explained that this was not unusual because a  number of other companies also had outstanding inquiries. NDOI explained  that most of its information is considered public and could be furnished to  RMA if requested. However, NDOI\u2019s work products, including its list of  companies most at risk, company examination reports, and associated  work papers were considered confidential. As a result, NDOI required that  a confidentiality agreement be signed before they could share the  information.

More specifically, it  suggests that companies must find ways to achieve operating efficiencies  so that their expenses do not exceed the administrative and operational  expense reimbursement provided by RMA to cover expenses for the sale  and service of federal crop insurance policies. Further, the failure of  American Growers highlights the need to improve RMA\u2019s financial  oversight of companies participating in the federal crop insurance  program. Clearly, RMA\u2019s oversight procedures at the time of the failure  were inadequate to ensure that companies met applicable financial  requirements for participation in the program. Specifically, the failure of  American Growers highlights the need for improved financial and  operational reviews, and improved coordination with state insurance  regulators. If adequate financial oversight procedures had been in place  prior to the failure of American Growers, the company\u2019s weakened  financial condition may have been detected in time to allow for corrective  actions and thereby reduced costs to taxpayers.

The product  was a supplement to Crop Revenue Coverage (CRC), an insurance product  that protected farmers against crop loss and low crop prices in the event of  a low price, a low yield, or any combination of the two. CRC Plus allowed  farmers to obtain supplemental coverage for their crops, in essence  providing a higher level of coverage in the event of losses. American  Growers initially marketed CRC Plus in only two states and covered grain,  corn, sorghum, and soybean crops. In 1999, when the company extended  CRC Plus to rice, a crop with which American Growers had limited  actuarial experience, the company mistakenly priced the product too low.  It then promoted the product heavily and did not adequately anticipate the  demand for the product.", "When it priced CRC Plus for rice, American Growers made a mathematical  error\u2014caused by the misplacement of a decimal point\u2014that resulted in the  insurance being sold for a lower price than it should have been. The low  price for the policy, coupled with uncertainty in the market price of rice  that year, resulted in a greater demand for the product than the company  had anticipated. When American Growers realized that the demand for the  product and associated losses would be greater than the company\u2019s surplus  could handle, especially considering its low price, American Growers  announced it would no longer accept applications at the price originally  listed, effectively withdrawing the product from the market. However,  farmers had already made decisions about what crop insurance they would  purchase, based upon their belief that they could obtain the new product  offered by American Growers. The withdrawal of the product was untimely  and made it difficult for some farmers to find adequate insurance. As a  result, Congress acted to extend the filing deadline for other types of  federally reinsured crop insurance so that farmers adversely affected by  American Growers\u2019 actions could obtain adequate insurance for their  crops.", "Finally, some farmers sued American Growers, while RMA and six states  examined American Growers\u2019 actions. The litigation by farmers and  regulatory actions resulted in more than $13 million in fines and  settlements levied against American Growers in addition to losses of $6  million.

This  decline in American Growers\u2019 surplus occurred at the same time the  company increased the amount of insurance premium it wrote, from $271  million in 1998 to $307 million in 2000, an increase of 13 percent. To lessen  the impact of losses associated with the CRC Plus policies, American  Growers accepted a $20 million loan in the form of a surplus note from an  affiliate company to strengthen its surplus.

These costs include agent  commissions, staff and office expenses required to process policies and  claims, and loss adjusting expenses. In 1998, Congress reduced the amount  of reimbursement from a cap of 27 cents per dollar of premium a company  sells to 24.5 cents per dollar of premium. This reduction occurred after our  1997 report revealed that companies were basing their request for higher  reimbursement rates on numerous expenses that were not directly related  to the sale and service of crop insurance, such as trips to resorts,  noncompete clauses associated with company mergers, and company  profit-sharing arrangements. Under the current reimbursement  arrangement, companies have no obligation to spend their payment on  expenses related to crop insurance; they may spend the payment in any  way they choose.

By retaining a higher percentage of the risk on policies,  American Growers could increase its profits if claims were low.  Conversely, the company increased its exposure to loss if claims were high.", "However, widespread drought impacted the company\u2019s ability to achieve  these gains. In June 2002, more than one-third of the contiguous U.S. was in  severe to extreme drought. Total losses for the crop insurance program  increased 33 percent from 2001. In 2001, total losses to the program were  over $3 billion. In 2002, total losses increased to over $4 billion. For the  category of policies for which American Growers retained a higher level of  risk, the loss ratio in 2002 was about 40 percent higher than in 2001,  resulting in the payment of $114 in claims for every $100 it received in  premiums for those policies.", "When the underwriting gains American Growers had predicted did not  materialize, losses and expenses depleted the company\u2019s surplus. As a  result, NDOI, which regulates insurance companies domiciled in that state,  declared that the company was operating in a hazardous financial  condition and placed the company in supervision, and later rehabilitation.  On November 22, 2002, NDOI took steps to protect American Growers\u2019  policyholders by issuing a state order of supervision. NDOI ordered the  supervision because the company\u2019s surplus declined from about $75 million  for the year ending December 31, 2001, to about $11 million as of  September 2002. According to the order, the decline in American Growers\u2019  surplus\u2014in excess of 50 percent within a 9-month period\u2014rendered the  company financially hazardous to the public and its policyholders. Under  the order of supervision, American Growers could not sell any new  insurance policies or conduct business beyond those that are routine in the  day-to-day operations of its business, without the approval of the  supervisor appointed by NDOI.", "On December 20, 2002, NDOI obtained a court order that placed American  Growers into rehabilitation under the auspices of NDOI. Under  rehabilitation, NDOI appointed a rehabilitator who took control of  American Growers to oversee the orderly termination of the company\u2019s  business and to allow for an orderly transfer of policies to other  companies. The NDOI-appointed rehabilitator assumed the responsibilities  of the board of directors and officers and took control of the day-to-day  management of the company."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RMA Paid Policyholders\u2019 Claims after American Growers\u2019 Failure", "paragraphs": ["RMA worked in conjunction with NDOI and remaining American Growers\u2019  staff to ensure that claims were paid (see table 4).

These funds were used, in part, to pay American Growers\u2019  staff and support staff operating under the auspices of NDOI to pay  policyholder claims. When American Growers\u2019 cash reserves were reduced  to $10 million, RMA reimbursed NDOI for additional costs of $40.5 million  to operate the company. When RMA began reimbursing NDOI in February  2003, the vast majority of policyholder claims had been paid (see Fig. 1).  About $317 million, or 77 percent, of the approximately $410 million in  claims were paid by the end of January 2003.", "According to an RMA official, while the costs of reimbursing American  Growers\u2019 operations may appear excessive, relative to the amount of  claims paid, the claims that had been paid before February 2003, were  those that could be expeditiously handled. The claims that remained to be  paid\u2014beginning in February 2003\u2014were those that required follow-up to  determine the accuracy of reported information, were difficult to process  due to missing information, or had other problems.

In September 2002, as  losses associated with that year\u2019s extensive drought began to materialize,  American Growers realized that the company\u2019s operating expenses and  crop losses were outpacing its income and surplus and advised NDOI and  RMA accordingly. To improve its financial condition, American Growers  attempted to sell its crop insurance business to another insurance  company. On November 18, 2002, American Growers\u2019 parent company,  Acceptance, signed a nonbinding letter of intent setting forth preliminary  terms for the company to sell portions of its crop insurance business to  Rain and Hail LLC (Rain and Hail) for over $20 million pending regulatory  approval.", "Rain and Hail asked RMA for authority to transfer American Growers\u2019  policies without having to cancel each policy and rewrite them under its  own name\u2014a concession that would have facilitated the bulk transfer of  the policies. In the past, RMA had allowed this type of transfer only if the  acquiring company agreed to (1) accept all the policies previously  underwritten by the company being purchased and (2) assume all past  liability for those policies. According to RMA, Rain and Hail did not want to  assume any past liabilities for the policies and wanted to retain the right to  select agents and policyholders with whom it wished to contract.  According to RMA, Rain and Hail\u2019s intention was to not accept past  liabilities regarding disputed claims, compliance issues, litigation or  regulatory issues associated with American Growers\u2019 policies and  ultimately to acquire only about one-third of American Growers\u2019 business.", "In a letter dated November 25, 2002, RMA rejected Rain and Hail\u2019s request  for exemptions from RMA rules regarding the bulk transfer of policies. The  agency was concerned that waiving the existing rules regarding potential  liabilities and future policy placement would not protect the interests of  policyholders and taxpayers or the integrity of the federal crop insurance  program. RMA was concerned that if it approved the sale of American  Growers\u2019 policies to Rain and Hail, it could have left a significant number of  policyholders without insurance. It also may have left a disproportionate  number of poor performing policies for other insurance providers to  assume. Since reinsured companies are required to accept all policyholders  that apply for insurance regardless of their loss history, RMA was  concerned that its decision would be unfair to other insurance providers  and that any future denial of similar exemptions to other companies would  be challenged as arbitrary and capricious. As a result, RMA informed Rain  and Hail that it could not grant the exemptions it requested.", "Accordingly, Rain and Hail announced that it was withdrawing its offer to  purchase American Growers\u2019 business. When we discussed this issue with  Rain and Hail, it concurred that its company was unwilling to accept the  past liabilities associated with American Growers\u2019 policies, but denied it  was not willing to accept all of American Growers\u2019 policyholders. Senior  managers at Rain and Hail said their company was unwilling to accept the  past liabilities associated with American Growers\u2019 policies because they  did not have adequate time to assess the extent of any such liabilities and  the financial implications for Rain and Hail. However, these managers said  that Rain and Hail was willing to accept any farmer who wanted a policy  from the company, but they stated that the company wanted to retain the  right to select which agents it would use to sell and service crop insurance  policies.", "Whether the sale of American Growers\u2019 policies to Rain and Hail could  have saved taxpayers all or some of the costs of the dissolution if the  proposed sale had been completed is unclear. A Rain and Hail  representative stated that the sale would have provided a cash infusion that  could have prevented the failure of American Growers.  An Acceptance  representative stated that the sale might have allowed American Growers  to pay remaining claims without having to come under control of NDOI.  However, depending on the details, even with the cash infusion from the  sale of assets to Rain and Hail, the company may still have been found to be  in a financially hazardous condition."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "RMA\u2019s Decision to Pay American Growers\u2019 Agent Commissions", "paragraphs": ["After consultation with NDOI, RMA agreed to pay American Growers\u2019  agent commissions in full, despite the fact that they were paid higher than  industry averages. RMA believed several factors, any one of which could  have resulted in the disruption of policyholders\u2019 coverage, warranted  paying agent commissions in full. First, RMA agreed to pay agent  commissions in full, in part, because NDOI\u2019s position was that as long as  American Growers was under the rehabilitation order instead of in  liquidation, the company\u2019s contracts were valid, enforceable legal  obligations that had to be paid. Second, RMA was concerned that some  agents may have refused to continue to service policyholders if they knew  they would not get paid for their work, and RMA needed agents\u2019  cooperation in ensuring the timely collection of premiums and transfer of  policies to other crop insurance companies. Third, RMA was concerned  that some agents, particularly small agents, could go out of business if not  paid their commissions and would therefore be unable to service claims or  transfer policies. Finally, RMA was concerned that some agents may have  deducted their commissions from policyholder premiums, which could  have made it more difficult for RMA to determine which policyholders had  paid the premiums on their policies.", "While RMA could have potentially achieved cost savings of about $800,000  by not paying some of American Growers\u2019 agents\u2019 commissions\u2014the  portion of their $7.6 million in commissions that exceeded industry  averages\u2014agents\u2019 response to such a decision could have also disrupted  service to policyholders and caused RMA to incur additional costs.", "Industry opinion varied on whether RMA should have paid agent  commissions in full. According to the former chief executive officer of  American Growers, high commissions paid to agents contributed to  American Growers\u2019 and other companies\u2019 financial troubles. One company  executive expressed concerns that RMA\u2019s actions might make it more  difficult for companies that are holding the line on agent commissions to  continue to hold commissions at a reasonable level. Another representative  was concerned that agents were going to work for the company that paid  the highest commissions, regardless of the company\u2019s financial health,  because RMA had shown that agents would receive their commission  regardless of the company\u2019s status. However, one crop insurance company  representative was concerned about the consequences of not paying agent  commissions, particularly since the agents were not directly responsible  for the company\u2019s failure. Representatives also stated that RMA was  correct in paying agent commissions to ensure agent cooperation, to not  drive smaller agents into bankruptcy, and to maintain the integrity of the  federal crop insurance program.", "Finally, RMA\u2019s actions in paying full agent commissions could have  implications for the future of the federal crop insurance program, but it is  unclear how future company and agent practices may be affected by RMA\u2019s  decisions. RMA\u2019s actions could suggest that it might provide similar  financial support in the event of future insolvencies, regardless of company  and agent practices. For example, RMA\u2019s actions could have set a precedent  for high agent commissions, a key factor in the failure of American  Growers, which could, in turn, be a factor in other insolvencies. However,  RMA has stated that it plans to consider each new situation on a case-by- case basis and that agents and companies should not expect the same  treatment as in the case of American Growers. RMA said that a managing  general agent had recently gone out of business and that RMA had not  stepped in to provide relief to agents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from RMA", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Risk Management Agency\u2019s  letter dated April 28, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. Per RMA\u2019s suggestion, we have provided additional details in this report  noting that NDOI placed American Growers under supervision on  November 22, 2002, and later placed the company under rehabilitation  on December 20, 2002. RMA suggests that the state\u2019s initial action  impacted its flexibility in working with the state and the company. As  we note in our conclusions, better coordination with state regulators  regarding respective authorities and responsibilities in the event of  future insurance provider insolvencies is necessary to ensure that  RMA\u2019s interests are protected. 2. We revised the report to note that some agents are paid a salary rather  than receiving commissions on the premiums from policies sold.  American Growers\u2019 agents received commissions, as do most agents  who sell and service crop insurance.  3. At the time of our review, we noted written procedures based on  regulations for the yearly review and approval of SRA holders and  applicants. However, as noted in this report, these procedures were  insufficient to assess the overall financial health of a company. To the  extent that the final SRA does not fully address oversight weaknesses  identified in our report, RMA should take action to modify its  regulations or other written policies.   4. RMA on-site financial and operational reviews do not appear to focus  on the overall financial health of a company, but rather on internal  controls.
