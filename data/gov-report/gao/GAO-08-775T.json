Securing these systems is therefore vital to ensuring national security, economic well-being, and public health and safety. While most critical infrastructures are privately owned, the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), a federal corporation and the nation's largest public power company, provides power and other services to a large swath of the American Southeast. GAO was asked to testify on its public report being released today on the security controls in place over TVA's critical infrastructure control systems. In doing this work, GAO examined the security practices in place at TVA facilities; analyzed the agency's information security policies, plans, and procedures in light of federal law and guidance; and interviewed agency officials responsible for overseeing TVA's control systems and their security."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["TVA had not fully implemented appropriate security practices to secure the control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures at facilities GAO reviewed. Multiple weaknesses within the TVA corporate network left it vulnerable to potential compromise of the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network devices and the information transmitted by the network. For example, almost all of the workstations and servers that GAO examined on the corporate network lacked key security patches or had inadequate security settings. Furthermore, TVA did not adequately secure its control system networks and devices on these networks, leaving the control systems vulnerable to disruption by unauthorized individuals. Network interconnections provided opportunities for weaknesses on one network to potentially affect systems on other networks. For example, weaknesses in the separation of network segments could allow an individual who gained access to a computing device connected to a less secure portion of the network to compromise systems in a more secure portion of the network, such as the control systems. In addition, physical security at multiple locations that GAO reviewed did not sufficiently protect the control systems. For example, live network jacks connected to TVA's internal network at certain facilities GAO reviewed had not been adequately secured from unauthorized access. As a result, TVA's control systems were at increased risk of unauthorized modification or disruption by both internal and external threats. An underlying reason for these weaknesses was that TVA had not consistently implemented significant elements of its information security program. For example, the agency lacked a complete and accurate inventory of its control systems and had not categorized all of its control systems according to risk, limiting assurance that these systems are adequately protected. In addition, TVA's patch management process lacked a mechanism to effectively prioritize vulnerabilities. As a result, patches that were identified as critical, meaning they should be applied immediately to vulnerable systems, were not applied in a timely manner. Numerous opportunities exist for TVA to improve the security of its control systems. For example, TVA can strengthen logical access controls, improve physical security, and fully implement its information security program. If TVA does not take sufficient steps to secure its control systems and fully implement an information security program, it risks not being able to respond properly to a major disruption that is the result of an intended or unintended cyber incident."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing to discuss  control systems security. We have previously reported and testified before  this subcommittee that critical infrastructure control systems face  increasing risks due to cyber threats, system vulnerabilities, and the  serious potential impact of attacks as demonstrated by reported incidents.  If control systems are not adequately secured, their vulnerabilities could  be exploited, and our critical infrastructures could be disrupted or  disabled, possibly resulting in loss of life, physical damage, or economic  losses.", "The majority of our nation\u2019s critical infrastructures are owned by the  private sector; however, the federal government owns and operates  critical infrastructure facilities including ones used for energy, water  treatment and distribution, and transportation. One such entity, the  Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)\u2014a federal corporation and the nation\u2019s  largest public power company\u2014generates electricity using its 52 fossil,  hydro, and nuclear facilities, all of which use control systems. As a wholly- owned government corporation, TVA is to comply with the Federal  Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA) by developing a  risk-based information security program and implementing appropriate  information security controls for its computer systems.", "In our testimony today, we will summarize the results of our review of the  security controls over TVA\u2019s critical infrastructure control systems. We are  issuing two reports today, one publicly available and one with limited  distribution, which provide additional details on the results of our review.  Our objective was to determine whether TVA has effectively implemented  appropriate information security practices for its control systems. In  preparing for this testimony, we relied on our work supporting these  reports, which discuss the details of our scope and methodology. The  information in this testimony is specifically based on our public report,  which has been reviewed for sensitivity by TVA.", "Our testimony is based on the work done for our reports from March 2007  to May 2008. The work on which this testimony is based was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, which  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Information security is a critical consideration for any organization that  depends on information systems and computer networks to carry out its  mission or business. Of particular importance is the security of  information and systems supporting critical infrastructures\u2014physical or  virtual systems and assets so vital to the nation that their incapacitation or  destruction would have a debilitating impact on national and economic  security and on public health and safety. Although the majority of our  nation\u2019s critical infrastructures are owned by the private sector, the  federal government owns and operates key facilities that use control  systems, including oil, gas, water, electricity, and nuclear facilities. In the  electric power industry, control systems can be used to manage and  control the generation, transmission, and distribution of electric power.  For example, control systems can open and close circuit breakers and set  thresholds for preventive shutdowns.", "Critical infrastructure control systems face increasing risks due to cyber  threats, system vulnerabilities, and the potential impact of attacks as  demonstrated by reported incidents. Control systems are more vulnerable  to cyber threats and unintended incidents now than in the past for several  reasons, including their increasing standardization and connectivity to  other systems and the Internet. For example, in August 2006, two  circulation pumps at Unit 3 of the Browns Ferry, Alabama, nuclear power  plant operated by TVA failed, forcing the unit to be shut down manually.  The failure of the pumps was traced to an unintended incident involving  excessive traffic on the control system\u2019s network.", "To address this increasing threat to control systems governing critical  infrastructures, both federal and private organizations have begun efforts  to develop requirements, guidance, and best practices for securing those  systems. For example, FISMA outlines a comprehensive risk-based  approach to securing federal information systems, which include control  systems. Federal organizations, including the National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST), the Federal Energy Regulatory  Commission (FERC), and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),  have used a risk-based approach to develop guidance and standards to  secure control systems. NIST guidance has been developed that currently  applies to federal agencies; however, much of the guidance and standards  developed by FERC and NRC has not yet been finalized.
