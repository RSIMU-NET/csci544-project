As of April 1999, it had 182 members. The IMF\u2019s first purpose is the promotion of international monetary cooperation. Its Articles of Agreement (as amended), or charter, also provide that it may make its resources available to members experiencing balance-of-payments problems; this is to be done under \u201cadequate safeguards.\u201d Making resources available to counter balance-of-payments problems is intended to shorten the duration and lessen the degree of these problems and avoid \u201cmeasures destructive of national or international prosperity.\u201d", "Member countries govern the IMF through the Executive Board\u2014the IMF\u2019s primary decision-making body. The IMF Executive Board comprises 24 Executive Directors who are appointed or elected by one or more IMF member countries. The U.S. Executive Director, for instance, represents the United States at the IMF. When a country joins the IMF and later when IMF members agree to increase the IMF\u2019s capital, the country pays a quota or a capital subscription to the organization. The quota serves several purposes: (1) the funds paid to the IMF contribute to the pool of funds that the IMF uses to lend to members facing financial problems and (2) the amount of quota paid determines the voting power of the member. The IMF calculates the quota by assessing each member country\u2019s economic size and characteristics\u2014economically larger countries pay relatively larger quota amounts. The United States pays the largest quota and thus has the largest single share of voting rights. The IMF also has access to lines of credit provided by member countries under the General Arrangements to Borrow and, more recently, under the New Arrangements to Borrow.", "As part of the IMF\u2019s mission to promote economic and financial cooperation among its members, the IMF may provide financial assistance to countries facing actual or potential balance-of-payments difficulties that request such assistance. Balance-of-payments difficulties may have short- term, as well as longer-term aspects. The IMF\u2019s approach to alleviating a country\u2019s balance-of-payments difficulties is intended to address both aspects, as needed. As such, the IMF\u2019s approach has two main components\u2014financing and conditionality\u2014that are intended to address both the immediate crisis as well as the underlying factors that contributed to the difficulties. Although financing is designed to help alleviate the short-term balance-of-payments crisis by providing a country with needed reserves, it may also support the longer-term reform efforts by providing needed funding. Similarly, although conditionality, usually in the form of performance criteria and policy benchmarks, is intended to primarily address the underlying causes of the balance-of-payments difficulties over the medium term, it can also assist in alleviating the immediate balance-of- payments problems by, for example, reducing the country\u2019s aggregate demand, including imports.", "The access to and disbursement of IMF financial assistance is conditioned upon the adoption and pursuit of economic and structural policy measures the IMF and recipient countries negotiate. This IMF \u201cconditionality\u201d aims to alleviate the underlying economic difficulty that led to the country\u2019s balance-of-payments problem and ensure repayment to the IMF. As the reasons for and magnitude of countries\u2019 balance-of-payments problems have expanded (due, in part, to the growing importance of external financing and changes in the international monetary system since the 1970s), conditionality has also expanded. According to IMF staff, conditionality has moved beyond the traditional focus of reducing aggregate demand, which was appropriate for relieving temporary balance- of-payments difficulties, typically in industrial economies. Structural policies\u2014such as reducing the role of government in the economy and opening the economy to outside competition\u2014that take longer to implement and are aimed at increasing the capacity for economic growth became an important part of conditionality. More recently, the financial crises in Mexico (1994-95) and in Asia and Russia (1997-99) have resulted in an increased focus on strengthening countries\u2019 financial sectors and the gradual opening of the economy to international capital flows.", "The main instruments used by the IMF to provide financial assistance are", "Stand-by Arrangements (SBA), that provide short-term assistance for problems of a temporary nature; extended arrangements, under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), that provide longer-term balance-of-payments assistance for problems arising from structural maladjustments; typically, when established, a program lists the general objectives for the first year; objectives for subsequent years are spelled out in program reviews; a Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF), provided under an SBA or extended arrangement, that provides assistance for exceptional balance- of-payments problems owing to a large and short-term financing need resulting from a sudden and disruptive loss of market confidence reflected in pressure on the capital account and reserves; it is likely to be used when the magnitude of capital outflows may threaten the international monetary system; and an Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF), which is the principal means for providing financial support (highly concessional, or low- interest, loans) to low-income countries facing protracted balance-of- payments problems.", "The first three arrangements are funded through the IMF\u2019s general resources account (GRA). The ESAF is funded through separate resources. A country may also draw on its \u201creserve tranche,\u201d that is, call on funds that initially represented about one-quarter of its quota. Except for the highly concessional ESAF loans, the country pays market-based interest rates on money it receives. The SRF is a new facility that charges a higher amount for its use than other IMF instruments. According to the IMF, for a member country to use this facility, there should be a reasonable expectation that the implementation of strong adjustment policies and adequate financing will result in the early correction of its difficulties.", "IMF financial assistance may be a part of a larger package of financial assistance committed to countries in crisis. Brazil, for example, received commitments for a package that included about $18 billion to be provided by the IMF and approximately $4.5 billion each from the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank\u2013primarily to provide improved social safety nets and banking reform. Additional bilateral sources agreed to provide $14.5 billion in financing, primarily to guarantee credits extended to Brazil from the Bank for International Settlements. The resulting package for Brazil amounted to more than $41 billion in commitments.", "An IMF program can also serve as a catalyst for debt relief from other creditors. For example, to qualify for debt relief from the Paris Club of creditor governments, countries must reach agreement with the IMF on a reform program. The Paris Club conditions its debt relief on countries\u2019 implementation of economic and structural reforms under IMF-supported financing programs.

If a member country determines that it is experiencing or could experience a balance-of- payments problem, it can initiate discussions with IMF staff that may lead it to request IMF financial assistance. These discussions can occur at any time, including during the country\u2019s annual consultation with the IMF or through informal consultations requested by the member. At these consultations, IMF staff and country authorities discuss economic data and policies as well as the nature of the country\u2019s balance-of-payments difficulty, amount of financing expected to be provided by various sources and the amount that may be requested from the IMF, instruments under which the IMF resources could be provided, potential schedule for reviewing countries\u2019 performance and disbursing likely conditions for assessing countries\u2019 performance under the program.", "IMF staff noted that key tasks during country missions to conduct the negotiations are (1) the collection of extensive data describing the country\u2019s economic conditions and (2) an analysis of those data to recommend the amount and timing of the IMF financial assistance and conditionality. The IMF\u2019s review of a country\u2019s economy is an iterative process that is often based on country-provided data, projections of key macroeconomic variables, and judgment by the IMF staff and country officials.", "The design of an IMF program is complicated, and negotiations between IMF staff and country authorities can be difficult for several reasons. First, the countries are facing an adverse or uncertain economic situation. Second, the negotiators may disagree on the type, pace, or feasibility of the reforms needed to help overcome the difficulty. In some cases, needed reforms reflect long-standing problems and are difficult to undertake due to political constraints. For example, reforms may entail changes to labor practices opposed by unions or removal of tax preferences benefiting certain sectors. Third, conditionality and financing are based, in part, on projections of key variables such as estimated growth rates and access to external financing. Fourth, in some cases, the country may lack reliable data for analyzing the current situation or making projections.", "IMF staff and country authorities may or may not reach agreement on a package of financing and conditionality. If they do not reach agreement, then the member may seek other means for addressing its difficulty. If they reach agreement, the arrangement is presented to the IMF Executive Board for approval.

While the IMF Executive Board has not established guidelines that would add greater specificity to the Articles\u2019 general criteria, over time the IMF has developed a broad framework that serves as a basis for analyzing a country\u2019s economy and forming judgments regarding the existence and magnitude of balance-of-payments deficits and the adequacy of international reserves.", "The first element\u2014the country\u2019s balance of payments\u2014represents the economy\u2019s external financing requirement and equals the sum of a member\u2019s current and capital account balances. The current account primarily includes exports and imports in goods and services; transfers; and income payments, such as interest payments. The capital account provides summary data on the changes in the net foreign assets of domestic residents arising from transactions such as external borrowing or repayments, foreign direct investment, portfolio investment (equity and bonds), and short-term capital movements. The second element\u2014the country\u2019s reserve position\u2014refers to the amount of resources (hard currency, reserve position in the IMF, special drawing rights, and monetary gold) that can be used to pay for imports and make payments on external debt. IMF documents indicate that the third element\u2014developments in the reserve position\u2014has a very narrow application. This element is intended to ensure that members of the IMF whose currency is a reserve currency (such as the United States) would be able to use IMF resources when requested, despite the absence of a need as outlined in the first two elements.", "The IMF\u2019s framework has enabled it to consider countries\u2019 individual circumstances and changes in the international monetary system. These include increased capital flows between countries and changes in the composition and source of those flows as well as the shift in the primary recipients of IMF financial assistance from industrialized countries to developing countries. Given such considerations, decisions about a country\u2019s need for IMF resources have become more difficult. According to IMF documents, determining need based solely on the overall balance- of-payments position is relatively clear-cut because the balance is either in surplus or deficit. Assessing need based on whether a country\u2019s foreign reserves are sufficient requires a greater degree of judgment because no precise criteria define the appropriate level of reserves. In determining the sufficiency of a country\u2019s reserves, the IMF can adjust the definition of \u201csufficient\u201d reserves to account for such country-specific factors as the volume and variability of exports and imports, the size and variability of capital flows, the amount of short-term liabilities, and the nature of the country\u2019s exchange rate regime. Significant declines in the foreign reserve position may be of concern if they indicate that a country may have difficulty financing its imports or repaying its external debt in the future.", "IMF documents indicate that the Executive Board has been reluctant to establish guidelines that would add greater specificity to the general criteria for balance-of-payments need set forth in the Articles of Agreement, as amended. Members of the IMF Board have been concerned that \u201ccodification\u201d of the concept of need would create unnecessary inflexibility. For this reason, they urged that the concept of need should continue to be applied on a case-by-case basis. As a result, application of this concept involves considerable data analysis as well as judgment.", "The IMF uses somewhat different criteria for low-income countries requesting resources under the ESAF. In contrast to the criteria for demonstrating a need for GRA resources, when assessing whether a member that meets income and other criteria for ESAF eligibility has a protracted balance-of-payments problem, emphasis is to be placed on the components of its balance of payments rather than solely on its overall balance-of-payments position. According to IMF staff, the underlying balance-of-payments problems of many low-income countries did not necessarily result in conditions similar to those reflecting the GRA criteria; that is, an actual balance-of-payments deficit or low reserves. For this reason, emphasis would have to be placed on those indicators that would normally evidence \u201cpoor external performance.\u201d Such indicators include a deterioration in the terms of trade and diminished access to capital markets. Moreover, protracted balance-of-payments problems would often be reflected by exchange rate restrictions, payments arrears, or prolonged use of IMF resources. As with the GRA criteria, the IMF Executive Board agreed to continue to use flexibility in applying the ESAF criteria. Some Board members have expressed the opinion that a low-income country, by definition, has a protracted balance-of-payments problem. and external developments. For example, owing to a rundown in its reserves, a country may allow its currency to float more freely until adjustment policies take effect and reserves are rebuilt. resource needs, IMF quota, outstanding IMF resources, and previous performance in using IMF financing; the strength of its adjustment program; and its capacity to repay the IMF. While the IMF has discretion in deciding the total amount of resources it will provide to a country, disbursements are to be limited to the amount needed by the country. If the IMF later discovers that a country drew IMF funds without a need for those funds (that is, the information on which the financing need was determined was later found to be incorrect), it can undertake remedial action.", "The IMF Executive Board encourages countries to request its assistance early and to undertake corrective actions early in order to minimize the potential costs and disruption of correcting the underlying causes of a balance-of-payments problem. However, a number of factors\u2014including the belief that the problem is temporary or can be solved without official assistance, or the concern that political and social problems may arise from needed structural changes\u2014can cause some countries to hesitate in asking for IMF assistance. For example, Korea did not draw on IMF resources until its reserves had fallen substantially."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IMF Conditionality Focuses on Fiscal, Monetary, and Structural Reforms", "paragraphs": ["Once the IMF staff has determined the balance-of-payments needs of a member and its eligibility to draw resources, the IMF must be satisfied that the member can meet its repayment obligations to the IMF and that the policy measures agreed to are sufficient to overcome the member\u2019s balance-of-payments problem. The IMF does this, in part, through conditionality. Fundamental weaknesses in the underlying economy, such as a large budget deficit and/or high inflation, or in the structure of the financial or corporate sectors, may contribute to the balance-of-payments problem of a country. Conditionality may vary with each country\u2019s individual program as it seeks to address these weaknesses. As such, according to the IMF, there is no \u201crigid and inflexible\u201d set of operational rules in the establishment of a country\u2019s conditionality program. The process is one of negotiation between the country authorities and the IMF to reach agreement on a number of issues, ranging from economic assumptions to the speed and magnitude of structural reforms.", "The IMF arrangement often occurs within the context of the country\u2019s larger reform efforts. As a result, not all of a country\u2019s policies or reform efforts may be included as conditions of the IMF arrangement. For example, some structural reforms and trade liberalization measures may be mentioned in the arrangement reached between the IMF and the country authorities, but only the actions the IMF judges to be particularly important for achieving program objectives will become performance criteria and benchmarks within the arrangement. IMF officials noted that achieving performance criteria is not the ultimate goal of conditionality; rather, the performance criteria are selected as clearly observable and measurable indicators that a country is making progress toward the overall program goals, such as strengthening the balance of payments and reducing inflation. The IMF uses two types of performance criteria that generally must be met for members to qualify for disbursements. The first are quantitative performance criteria, or macroeconomic indicators, such as monetary and budgetary targets. The second are structural performance criteria, or quantifiable/observable actions that demonstrate progress toward the borrower country\u2019s structural reform goals. Benchmarks are points of reference against which progress may be monitored but disbursements are generally not dependent on meeting them. Benchmarks are not necessarily quantitative and frequently relate to structural variables and policies, such as tax reform and privatizing state-owned enterprises.", "IMF conditionality tends to focus on three areas: fiscal, monetary, and structural. These three areas are designed to support a general framework that aims to strengthen the balance-of-payments position, achieve market- based growth, and decrease the role of the government in a country\u2019s economy. Borrower country IMF arrangements generally consist of a combination of efforts in these three areas, which depend on the country\u2019s particular circumstances.", "According to the IMF, poor fiscal management in a member\u2019s economy generally has been a major factor underlying such problems as high inflation, large current account deficits, and sluggish growth. Large and persistent budget deficits may tend to overheat the economy, contributing to high inflation (especially when financed by the printing of money), excess imports, and low domestic savings. IMF staff and the member country negotiate ways to address this fiscal deficit, including instituting reductions in government spending and increases in tax revenues. Numerical targets for the fiscal level consistent with these reforms are often part of a country\u2019s quantitative performance criteria.", "Similarly, IMF staff and the member country will negotiate monetary policy changes as part of the conditionality package. The underlying goals of these conditions are typically strengthening the balance-of-payments position, safeguarding or rebuilding international reserves, restoring market confidence, reducing sizeable exchange rate changes, restraining growth in domestic credit, and/or reducing inflation. For example, limits may be imposed on the increase in short-term debt owed or guaranteed by the government; this may be done in an effort to restrict the ability of a government to use short-term external financing to meet reserve targets or finance fiscal deficits. Another performance criterion that is frequently used is a limit on the net domestic assets of the central bank. By limiting the resources made available by the central bank to the economy, the growth of the money supply is slowed and inflation is lessened. Frequently, the country and the IMF reach agreement on the minimum level of foreign reserves that the country may hold; such a requirement reduces the country\u2019s ability to manage its exchange rate through interventions in the foreign currency market. The performance criterion on international reserves is a key indicator of progress toward external viability.", "According to IMF staff, the presence of pervasive structural problems in a member\u2019s economy and the need to ensure the sustainability of a country\u2019s reform effort require that structural policy changes be included within the overall conditionality negotiated. These structural problems encompass a broad array of issues, including inefficient state enterprises, trade restrictions, and lack of transparency in the financial and corporate sectors. Reforms in these areas are included as part of a country\u2019s structural benchmarks, which the country is strongly encouraged to satisfy, although the benchmarks do not have the same significance as the performance criteria. However, in certain instances, structural changes may be established in a precise quantitative manner and made part of a country\u2019s structural performance criteria.", "Once the financial arrangement has been negotiated, it is presented to the IMF Executive Board for approval. The IMF Board generally accepts the recommendations of the staff, largely because the staff brings to the IMF Board only proposals that the staff believes the Board will accept. The decision to approve an arrangement depends on a judgment by the IMF staff, management, and Executive Board that the program is sufficient to overcome the country\u2019s balance-of-payments difficulty and the country will be able to repay the IMF. After the country completes any prior actions and the IMF Executive Board then approves the arrangement, the arrangement will take effect and the country becomes eligible for its first disbursement of IMF funds. The country is then expected to implement the policy measures agreed to under the arrangement.

In each case, the balance-of-payments problem was described and the conditionality program was intended to address the underlying problems of the individual countries as defined by IMF staff and country authorities. Our analysis showed that, to varying degrees, the balance-of-payments problems of the six countries we studied stemmed from concerns regarding the access of the countries\u2019 public and private sectors to external financing. In addition, the reform programs of each country generally addressed the areas of concern identified by country and IMF officials as contributing to the balance-of-payments problems. Moreover, the type of financial arrangement each country received, the time period of the arrangement, and the total amount of financing the IMF agreed to provide were based on the IMF\u2019s analysis of the needs and circumstances of the individual countries. In determining the potential amount of IMF assistance, the IMF also considered the country\u2019s outstanding IMF resources in relation to its quota. Table 1 outlines the current IMF financial arrangements for the six borrower countries. (These arrangements are described in greater detail for each country in apps. II to VII.)", "According to our analysis, the balance-of-payments problems of the six countries we studied were due to concerns about the countries\u2019 continued ability to obtain external financing. In the cases of Korea, Indonesia, and Brazil, concerns over severely diminished reserves and continued access to external financing were clearly identified as important factors in the initial set of documents that recommended the establishment of an IMF financial arrangement in these countries. In the cases of Argentina, Russia, and Uganda, concerns over continued access to external financing were not as clearly defined but were embedded within a larger set of reasons for IMF assistance, including continued support for the countries\u2019 economic reform programs. Nonetheless, the information provided by IMF staff and country authorities was sufficient to determine that a potential balance-of- payments problem existed in each of these three countries.", "Our analysis also indicated that the individual IMF programs were geared toward the specific IMF assessment of the needs of the six countries, as shown in table 2.", "The purpose of the programs was to address the immediate or potential balance-of-payments problem of each country as well as the underlying factors that IMF staff and country officials identified as contributing to that problem. The fiscal, monetary, and structural objectives of all six countries\u2019 arrangements had the goal of helping to improve the medium- term economic growth and/or bolster investor confidence in order to continue to finance or reduce the balance-of-payments deficit or to build reserves. However, within the context of these general goals, the magnitudes and definitions of the performance criteria and the specifics of structural reforms differed across the countries.", "The financing of each package addressed the balance-of-payments problem of each country. In the cases of the three countries with significant losses in their reserves (Brazil, Indonesia, and Korea), the amount of the IMF financing was substantial and frontloaded, meaning that the countries were to receive much of the funding early, with the intent of providing a signal to market participants that the commitment to these countries was strong. In the three remaining countries, IMF financing was designed to be more evenly distributed throughout the duration of the program. The financing for Russia and Uganda was to be provided in relatively equal installments over the life of the program to assist in addressing the reforms agreed to under the program. Argentina\u2019s financing was viewed as a precautionary line of credit, available only if necessary.", "Korea and Argentina exemplify the differences that can exist between countries\u2019 financial arrangements with the IMF. The IMF\u2019s approach to the financial crisis in Korea was intended to address the country\u2019s immediate need for financing as well as the underlying causes identified by IMF staff and country authorities as contributing to the balance-of-payments difficulties. The IMF arrangement in Korea was heavily frontloaded, with the country receiving much of the agreed-to financing at the beginning of the arrangement, in order to address the country\u2019s immediate need to replenish depleted reserves. The country faced balance-of-payments problems primarily due to significant capital outflows. Korean banks had a large amount of foreign debt, composed substantially of short-term external loans that needed frequent refinancing. As market confidence fell, the willingness of external creditors to roll over (that is, refinance) the debt declined rapidly. The attempt by the government to support the former exchange rate rapidly depleted the foreign reserves by providing creditors with the hard currency that they ultimately withdrew as short- term debt matured. As reserves reached precariously low levels, Korea abandoned its attempt to support the exchange rate, moved to a flexible rate, and sought IMF support.", "The conditions outlined in the IMF arrangement were intended to address immediate concerns as well as the underlying causes of the balance-of- payments difficulties as determined by IMF staff and Korean authorities. The immediate causes were a loss of market confidence, depleted foreign reserves, and a rapidly depreciating currency. The arrangement\u2019s immediate goal was to restore calm in the markets and contain the inflationary impact of the currency\u2019s depreciation by providing substantial financing and requiring a tightening of monetary policy. In terms of longer- term changes, IMF staff and Korean authorities identified weaknesses in the corporate and financial sectors as underlying causes for the difficulties. Specifically, increases in corporate bankruptcies (caused by large debt burdens and excess capacity) and nonperforming (unpaid) loans exacerbated weaknesses in the banking system. Weaknesses in the banking systems included a focus on maximizing revenues (not profits) and limited experience in managing risk, combined with lax prudential supervision. As a result, under Korea\u2019s IMF arrangement, compared to other countries\u2019 arrangements, greater emphasis was placed on structural reforms\u2014particularly corporate and financial restructuring.", "Unlike Korea\u2019s IMF arrangement, Argentina\u2019s arrangement addresses a potential, rather than existing, balance-of-payments problem. Although Argentina enjoyed good access to capital markets and employed a strategy to lengthen the maturity of its debt and borrow when interest rates were low, it faced an uncertain future due to deteriorating conditions in the international financial environment and the effect this likely would have on its future access to capital markets. To address this potential problem, Argentina and the IMF reached agreement on a precautionary program, with Argentina agreeing to access IMF resources only if external conditions made it necessary.", "The government and the IMF identified fiscal discipline and structural reforms (particularly in tax systems and labor markets) as two of the most crucial elements of Argentina\u2019s program. In Argentina, the goal of maintaining fiscal discipline is to reduce the federal government deficit, stimulate domestic saving, and strengthen confidence in the continued viability of the convertibility regime, under which Argentine pesos are exchanged at a 1-to-1 rate with U.S. dollars. Reducing the amount of the government\u2019s deficit lowers the amount of funds the government needs to borrow from domestic and external creditors, therefore freeing up resources for other uses and decreasing the government\u2019s dependence on external borrowing. Argentina\u2019s government is limited in its ability to print money (pesos) to finance its deficit because under its currency board arrangement, the government has agreed to exchange each Argentine peso circulating in the economy with a U.S. dollar if requested. Consistent with this, the quantitative performance criteria agreed to under the IMF arrangement emphasize fiscal issues and are intended to limit the federal government\u2019s budget deficit and government debt levels. Monetary issues are not emphasized as strongly due to the government\u2019s limited power to affect the money supply and interest rates. Structural reforms aimed at, for example, decreasing the costs of labor and lowering taxes on production are aimed at making the economy more competitive, with the goal of reducing the trade deficit and thus the current account deficit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The IMF\u2019s Process for Monitoring Conditionality Is Intended to Respond to Individual Borrower Country Progress in Implementing Its Program", "paragraphs": ["The IMF\u2019s process for monitoring conditionality is intended to respond to individual country progress in meeting required conditions.

In some cases, disbursements depend only on a determination by the IMF staff that the country has met prenegotiated criteria. As such, according to IMF staff, for most programs, review by the IMF Executive Board is not required prior to each quarterly disbursement. For these programs, semiannual reviews by the IMF Executive Board are the more typical approach. In these cases, IMF staff reviews whether the country has met its performance criteria quarterly and, if they have been met, a disbursement can follow without a full IMF Board review. Larger programs, such as several we studied, tend to have tighter monitoring, and reviews can be held quarterly, bimonthly, or monthly. Future disbursements are contingent on the outcome of these reviews.

However, according to IMF staff, it is fairly common for one or more of the program\u2019s conditions to be missed, including performance criteria. When this happens, IMF staff and country officials discuss the causes behind the missed criteria and changes that may be needed in the program. According to an IMF official, if the staff concludes that the deviation is minor and self-correcting or the underlying objectives of the program can be met despite the deviation, they may recommend to the IMF Executive Board that it grant the country\u2019s request for a waiver and be eligible for the next disbursement. However, if the staff concludes that the reform program is not on track and that the criteria were missed because the country was not sufficiently pursuing an agreed-upon policy, the staff will not recommend approval of a waiver at that time and will instead delay or suspend the completion of the country\u2019s review. Negotiations between the two parties can continue if and until the two sides reach agreement on how to restart the existing program or initiate an entirely new program, or the borrower country requests that the program be terminated.

This situation was primarily due to adverse external factors. In this instance, the federal government deficit, estimated at $3.85 billion in 1998 (1.1 percent of gross domestic product ), exceeded its ceiling by about $350 million, or around 0.1 percent of GDP. According to the Argentine government, its efforts to contain expenditures could not compensate fully for the revenue shortfall. The shortfall mainly reflected the slowdown of economic activity in the second half of 1998 and its adverse effect on taxes, particularly the value-added tax. IMF staff viewed the deviation as minor and as not detracting from overall fiscal performance. Hence, they recommended the waiver be granted; in March 1999, the IMF Executive Board approved the waiver.", "In another example, Uganda requested a waiver for nonobservance of one quantitative performance criterion during its April 1998 IMF Board review. In this instance, the quantitative performance criterion was a limit on the net claims on the government by the banking system. During the review period that ended in December 1997, the Ugandan government experienced a temporary shortfall in its checking accounts with the banking system, thereby causing it to miss the performance criterion. According to IMF documents, the shortfall was due to government payments being made sooner than expected. IMF staff recommended the waiver be granted because they viewed this nonobservance as minor and of a technical nature rather than a policy violation; the IMF Executive Board approved the waiver in April 1998. The shortfall was corrected within a short period of time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The IMF May Delay or Withhold Funds if Sufficient Progress Is Not Made", "paragraphs": ["During the review process, instances in which the country did not meet key quantitative or structural performance criteria may be considered significant enough to delay or suspend disbursements.

The Indonesian IMF program began with Executive Board approval in November 1997, with completion of the first review scheduled for mid-March. The IMF, however, delayed Indonesia\u2019s disbursements from mid-March to early May 1998 due to the IMF staff\u2019s determination that Indonesia had not made sufficient progress in carrying out its program. The first review was completed in May 1998, with Indonesia meeting none of the quantitative performance criteria and one of the required structural performance criteria. IMF staff recommended and the Executive Board granted Indonesia\u2019s request for waivers of nonobservance of these criteria based on actions taken by the government, and disbursements resumed. At this time, the IMF moved from quarterly to monthly reviews of Indonesia\u2019s program. Disbursements were also delayed in the process of completing several subsequent reviews.", "Brazil\u2019s program is a more recent example of a delay in disbursements. The program began in November 1998, with the first disbursement occurring in early December. In January 1999, the government of Brazil was forced to devalue and then float its currency. Up until that time, Brazil\u2019s currency was pegged to the U.S. dollar, and maintenance of the exchange rate was an objective of Brazil\u2019s IMF program. Because Brazil received funds under two different IMF policies and drew from these sources simultaneously, the first and second reviews were scheduled to occur simultaneously. Completion of this set of reviews and the second disbursement were initially scheduled to occur no later than the end of February 1999. The change in the currency regime required substantial revision to the program, thus delaying until late March completion of the review. Brazil\u2019s program was modified to reflect new economic and exchange rate circumstances. Brazil missed one of its quantitative performance criteria (a ceiling on net domestic assets in the central bank). The Executive Board granted Brazil a waiver for the nonobservance of this performance criterion, agreed to the program modifications, and approved completion of the first and second review on March 30, 1999, thus opening the way for Brazil to receive the next disbursement of funds.", "Russia\u2019s program is an example of one in which the IMF delayed disbursements and program approval, reduced the amount of the disbursement, and ultimately suspended the program. The IMF delayed four disbursements: one in June and two in September and October 1996, and then another in November 1997. Russia received no funds between February and May 1997, pending approval of the 1997 program, which was delayed until May 1997, based on Russia\u2019s successful completion of prior actions. The delayed approval of the 1998 program, due to cabinet changes and difficulty in meeting the revenue package, meant that Russia received no funds between January and June 1998. The program was finally approved in June 1998, based on implementation of prior actions. In July 1998, the IMF approved additional funds to Russia but reduced the amount of the initial disbursement from $5.6 billion to $4.8 billion due to delays in getting two measures passed in the Duma (the lower house of the Russian parliament). The IMF was scheduled to release the next disbursement in September 1998, but Russia had deviated so far from the program that the IMF made no further disbursements. Ultimately, according to the IMF, it delayed disbursements because of Russia\u2019s poor tax collections, reflecting a lack of government resolve to collect these revenues. However, throughout Russia\u2019s program, the IMF staff expressed the view that Russia\u2019s key senior authorities were committed to the program and should be supported; therefore, the IMF Executive Board continued to approve disbursements. In March 1999, Russia requested that the program be terminated. In April 1999, IMF staff and Russian authorities announced they had reached agreement on an economic program that management hoped to be able to recommend to the IMF Executive Board in support of a new arrangement.

In these cases, such agreements outline modified performance criteria, indicative targets, and benchmarks.", "IMF and country officials may modify conditions contained in borrower country programs for a variety of reasons, depending on individual country circumstances. Two reasons for modifications of programs are (1) the effect of unanticipated internal and external factors on the country\u2019s ability to fulfill the required conditions and (2) the determination that the initial conditions were not realistic or feasible. In many instances, there is overlap between these two reasons. Unanticipated internal factors generally reflect events over which the government had less control than it had hoped. Examples include the inability of the government to enact required legislation, or other political turmoil. Unforeseen external factors are generally changes in the global economic environment that affect the ability of a borrower country to fulfill the macroeconomic conditions of its program. Examples include such things as a decline in investor confidence and/or capital flows, a decrease in demand for or price of primary exports, default by a major debtor, a recession or other economic problems in another country to which one\u2019s economy is closely tied, and natural disasters like droughts and floods. Unrealistic or unfeasible conditions can result when a country\u2019s problem is misdiagnosed or when the impact of certain conditions is different from what was expected.", "Developments in the early stages of Indonesia\u2019s current program are an example of an instance in which unanticipated internal events made it difficult for Indonesia to fulfill the conditions it had agreed to. These events included (1) circumvention of government decrees to dismantle cartels and open up markets, (2) the government\u2019s consideration of a currency board (which was not part of the program), (3) social unrest, and (4) the resignation of the president. Indonesia experienced a significant loss of investor confidence that resulted in a run on the banks, the reduction of foreign credit lines, and a continuing depreciation of the currency. The IMF and Indonesia revised the economic program a number of times before the situation stabilized.", "Brazil is another example in which unanticipated internal events resulted in program revisions. The maintenance of the exchange rate regime was an objective of the country\u2019s IMF program. Brazil turned to the IMF for assistance in September 1998, when its currency came under pressure as a result of the Russian crisis, and it experienced a significant loss of reserves. This reserve loss decelerated after the negotiations began, but, according to Brazilian officials, Brazil\u2019s currency came under additional pressure for a variety of reasons after its IMF program had started. These reasons included three internal setbacks that were out of the government\u2019s control, including the defeat in Brazil\u2019s congress of two tax measures deemed crucial to the fiscal adjustment program and the reluctance of a number of Brazilian state governors to fulfill their financial obligations to the government. To try to stem the additional loss of reserves, the Brazilian government found it necessary to devalue and then float the currency. The IMF program was then revised to reflect the new economic situation and currency regime.", "In Korea, a significant external factor that limited its macroeconomic performance, in the view of the IMF, was the continued Japanese recession. According to an IMF assessment, the weakening of the Japanese yen affected Korea\u2019s export competitiveness by making Korea\u2019s exports more expensive in comparison with Japanese exports. In addition, it was a contributing factor in worsening and lengthening Korea\u2019s own recession.", "Reassessment of initial conditions can take place because these conditions are later determined to be unfeasible or unrealistic due to economic factors that were not well known at the time. For example, Treasury and IMF officials told us the IMF projections for Korea were overly optimistic at the beginning of the program. These estimates were based on Korea\u2019s past strong growth and did not accurately project the \u201crolling financial crisis\u201d throughout Asia. Also, the true state of Korea\u2019s financial sector was not clear when Korea\u2019s initial program was designed. Part of Korea\u2019s agreement with the IMF was to improve transparency (openness) in its financial reporting, but as greater information became available, investor confidence dropped when the market learned more about the level of usable international reserves, corporate debt, and banks\u2019 nonperforming loans.", "Apart from waivers and reviews, quantitative performance criteria and indicative targets can be changed by means of \u201cadjusters\u201d that are included in some country programs. Adjusters are prenegotiated to account for specific actions and assumptions about economic and financial movements. We found that there were basically two types of adjusters in the agreements we reviewed: adjusters due to unexpected external events that temporarily affect a key variable and adjusters due to in-country policy changes that affect a key variable or the measurement of that variable.", "The first type of adjuster automatically changes the level of a quantitative performance criterion when there are unexpected changes\u2014generally outside of the country\u2019s control\u2014to one or more key variables. The rationale is that occasionally countries may fail to reach a particular quantitative performance criterion due to fluctuations in economic conditions outside their control and that temporary changes in key variables should not derail an IMF agreement. Also, some adjusters are designed to take into account the effect of positive as well as negative external developments on the quantitative performance criteria. For example, Uganda\u2019s program had a quantitative performance criterion that set a minimum level for net international reserves. This minimum level was based on an assumed level of inflows of funds from bilateral and multilateral lending agencies. An adjuster was added to the quantitative performance criterion in order to adjust the required minimum level upward (or downward) in the event that creditors provided more (or less) debt relief than was expected.", "The second type of adjuster automatically changes the level of a quantitative performance criterion when policymakers choose to make changes in their monetary or fiscal policy instruments in a manner that would either directly or indirectly affect the target variables. For example, an IMF official noted that a common performance criterion in programs is a maximum permissible level of net domestic assets of the central bank, usually included as part of a strategy to target the growth of the money supply. However, other policy decisions can affect the level of the money supply. For instance, decreases in the required reserve ratio (the proportion of the total value of deposits that a commercial bank must keep either in its vault or in an account at the central bank) may increase commercial bank liquidity and the money supply. Thus, frequently the quantitative performance criteria include an adjuster that automatically decreases the performance criterion for the net domestic assets of the central bank when the required reserve ratio is reduced to offset potential increases in the money supply. This adjuster is intended to prevent policy changes from compromising the achievement of overall program objectives, such as price stability or low inflation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives were to (1) describe how the IMF establishes financial arrangements with borrower countries and the types of conditions set under these programs and assess how this process was used for six borrower countries; and (2) describe how the IMF monitors countries\u2019 performance and assess how this process was used for six borrower countries, detailing the conditions met and not met, the reasons why conditions were not met, and the actions the IMF took in response.

The IMF staff\u2019s review of the state of a member\u2019s economy is an iterative process and is based on country-provided data, assumptions about key macroeconomic variables, and judgment by the IMF staff and country officials. To do this, the IMF staff examines the following four related sectoral statistical systems over the medium term of 3 to 5 years with the assumption that the government will follow its stated policies: (1) national income and product accounts for gross domestic product (GDP), (2) government financial accounts for the fiscal sector, (3) consolidated banking system accounts for the monetary sector, and (4) external accounts for the balance-of-payments position.", "In order to analyze these four sectors, an IMF team (IMF mission) travels to the country to review the situation within the country. The team begins the analysis by reviewing the data previously collected from country officials for the most recent Article IV consultation as well as other requested information provided by the country.

According to an IMF official, data inconsistencies may be discovered in a variety of ways. For example, if IMF staff believed that the country-provided trade data were inaccurate, it would cross-check that country\u2019s trade data with similar data of a neighboring county with whom it trades in order to verify whether the information was accurate. In other cases, if the data suggested that the manufacturing level in a country had increased and at the same time indicated that electricity usage had decreased, the staff would be alerted to the inconsistency and would seek to verify the data. In such instances, the IMF team would work with government employees in ministries or agencies to calculate and verify the information. According to an IMF official, this type of analysis is, by necessity, undertaken on a case-by-case basis, and it would be difficult to develop a universal set of standards for verifying such information. For this work, the IMF relies on its mission chiefs, who have acquired knowledge and experience in each country to assist in verifying the data.", "According to an IMF official, determining the balance-of-payments position is central to both the analysis of the economy and the determination about whether the country would be eligible for IMF financial support. The concept of a balance-of-payments need is broadly defined in the IMF\u2019s Articles of Agreement and includes (1) the country\u2019s overall balance of payments, (2) the country\u2019s foreign reserve position, and (3) developments in its reserve position. IMF documents state that these three elements are regarded as separate, and a member\u2019s representation of a balance-of- payments need can be based on any one of them. The first element\u2014the country\u2019s overall balance of payments\u2014represents the economy\u2019s external financing requirement and equals the sum of a member\u2019s current and capital account balances. The current account primarily includes exports and imports of goods and services. The capital account provides summary data on the changes in net foreign assets of domestic residents arising from such transactions as external borrowing or repayments (borrowing from or repaying foreign sources), foreign direct investment, portfolio investments (both equity shares and bonds), and short-term capital movements.", "The second element\u2014the country\u2019s reserve position\u2014refers to the amount of resources (convertible currency, special drawing rights, and gold) a country has to support its imports and external debt payments. The reserves are under the control of the monetary authority.

This is because the process of assessing an economy is subject to many assumptions and uncertainties, including factors within and outside of the country\u2019s control. For example, in the case of Russia, the IMF documents establishing the 1996 extended arrangement do not explicitly describe the underlying balance-of-payments need. However, the IMF documents do present a clear case for the role that IMF funding was to play in catalyzing debt rescheduling and encouraging the inflow of private capital to avoid a potential balance-of-payments problem. In 1996, Russia had a basic weakness in its external accounts due in part to short-term capital outflows and an inadequate level of reserves. Furthermore, many debt service obligations were expected to occur between 1996 and 2000, adding more stress to Russia\u2019s external accounts. An IMF financial arrangement in 1996 was seen as critical for Russia to avoid a potential balance-of- payments problem. The IMF arrangement helped Russia obtain debt rescheduling to reduce the future burden on the federal budget and improve Russia\u2019s access to private capital markets.", "Analyzing the nature, source, and severity of any existing or potential balance-of-payments problem involves assessing data about the balance-of- payments deficit and the country\u2019s ability to finance it. To determine the nature of the imbalance, the IMF determines whether the problem is short term or longer term. For example, a short-term problem could be a cyclical or seasonal imbalance caused by the falling price of a primary export. A longer-term imbalance might be caused by underlying or structural weaknesses in the economy, such as an unsustainable government budget deficit. The IMF staff also determines to what extent the reasons for the imbalance are within the government\u2019s control, along with the dimensions and urgency of the problem, including the availability of financing.", "After the balance-of-payments gap analysis is complete and if the country decides to seek IMF financial assistance, the country officials and IMF staff begin to discuss IMF financing as well as the conditions for the country program. However, according to the IMF, in order to adapt programs to individual country circumstances, it has no inflexible set of operational rules for establishing a country\u2019s program. Nonetheless, Deputy Managing Director of the IMF, said that staff enter into negotiations with detailed instructions, agreed upon within the IMF staff offices and then by IMF management. This IMF official stated that negotiations are often long and sometimes contentious, involving several rounds of discussions. The disagreements tend to be over difficult issues, for example, whether the budget needs to be tightened, the inflation rate should be reduced less rapidly, or the agreed-upon balance-of-payments deficit can be larger.", "To address the balance-of-payments problem, typically the IMF uses economic models to project the potential impact of a variety of adjustment measures to develop several scenarios of possible program elements. Based on these scenarios, the IMF staff and the country negotiate what they view as the appropriate mix of fiscal and monetary adjustment, structural reforms, and financing required to achieve their overall goals; these goals can include an increase in economic growth or in investor confidence.", "For example, for the external sector, two independent projections of imports need to be made and reconciled. The first is based on the demand for imports, derived from information including the projected level of output and relative prices, and the second is based on the capacity to import, derived from the target change in international reserves and projections of other components of the balance of payments. For example, if the demand for imports is greater than the country\u2019s capacity to import, the basic options for adjustment may include the following: (1) seek additional foreign exchange, (2) lower the initial target for net international reserves, (3) reduce the initial projection for output to lower the demand for imports, or (4) some combination of the above. Similar iterative analyses are also carried out for the fiscal and monetary sectors.", "The IMF staff and the country negotiate an arrangement that describes (1) the amount of financing expected to be provided by various sources and the amount that may be requested from the IMF; (2) the instruments under which the IMF resources could be provided, for example, Stand-by Arrangement (SBA) or Extended Fund Facility (EFF); and (3) the potential schedule for reviewing a country\u2019s performance and disbursing funds.

Prior actions may be negotiated by IMF staff and country officials as part of the country\u2019s initial arrangement or during subsequent program reviews; they generally have to be implemented before an IMF arrangement or a disbursement of funds is approved.

In general, benchmarks could include targeted structural changes for tax policy and administration reform, financial sector reform, or exchange system reform. For example, to achieve the overall goal of strengthening a country\u2019s banking system, the IMF and the country may agree to a structural benchmark, such as enacting legal reforms for bankruptcy or developing a bank recapitalization plan.

Korea had recorded real GDP growth of about 6 percent in the first 3 quarters of 1997, and inflation was around 4 percent. Korea\u2019s external financing crisis stemmed from fundamental weaknesses in its corporate and financial sectors. Korea had experienced a mild recession in 1993. In response, Korea\u2019s elected officials promised growth and encouraged Korea\u2019s conglomerates (called \u201cchaebols\u201d) to invest heavily in new factories. In turn, Korean firms made substantial investments, leaving Korea with excess production capacity and large debt burdens for Korean firms. This overcapacity led to falling prices for its main exports\u2014computer memory chips, cars, ships, steel, and petrochemicals\u2014and weakened profitability.", "The large amount of short-term borrowing compounded these other problems. Most of the corporate debt was either short-term borrowing from domestic financial institutions or from the issuance of promissory notes. At the end of December 1997, the 30 largest conglomerates owed approximately 111.3 trillion won (the Korean currency) in loans and payments to Korean banks, according to Korea\u2019s Office of Bank Supervision. The conglomerates\u2019 current liabilities (less than 1 year) accounted for 60 percent of total liabilities and roughly half of nominal GDP in 1996. These factors resulted in an increase in bankruptcies beginning in 1997, including a large Korean steel company and car manufacturer.", "These bankruptcies weakened the financial system, since bank loans were not being paid off, and non-performing loans rose sharply, causing strains in the banking system. Korean government estimates of nonperforming loans at the end of 1997 were 34.9 trillion won. Weaknesses in the banking system were thought to be based on a lack of commercial orientation (that is, a focus on increasing market share over improving profitability) and limited experience in managing risk, combined with lax prudential supervision. These factors, as well as the large-scale, external short-term borrowing of the Korean banks, made Korea vulnerable to the contagion effects of financial problems in Southeast Asia.", "The weak state of the banking sector led to successive downgrades by international credit rating agencies and a sharp tightening in the availability of external financing. External creditors began to reduce their debt exposure to Korean banks in the latter part of 1997, causing a sharp decline in usable reserves. A large amount of these reserves were being used to finance the repayment of the short-term debt of Korean commercial banks\u2019 offshore branches. Historically, Korean authorities had a policy of not letting private banks go into default. Consequently, the Bank of Korea was providing foreign exchange support to commercial banks as foreign creditors reduced their exposure on short-term lines of credit. The total amount of foreign currency reserves the Bank of Korea, the central bank of Korea, held at the end of December 1997 was $20.4 billion, the usable portion of which was $8.9 billion. As of December 31, 1997, the total amount of Korea\u2019s private and governmental external liabilities was $154.4 billion, calculated under IMF standards. The Korean government estimated that at the end of December 1997, approximately $27.3 billion was due by the end of the first quarter in 1998. The ability of Korea to repay its short-term foreign debts was dependent on the willingness of foreign lenders to extend the terms of existing loans and/or to offer new financing.", "Korea had made earlier attempts to reform the financial sector and had taken steps to liberalize its capital account. Korea permitted short-term foreign borrowing but had not allowed domestic banks access to longer- term foreign borrowing, which added to Korea\u2019s financing problems.

The evaluation stated that Uganda had fully achieved stabilization and the major macroeconomic reforms had been implemented, and consequently, the IMF has reached the point where it had to decide whether to (1) maintain its exclusive focus on crisis-management and so withdraw from Uganda, or (2) extend its mandate and remain in Uganda. It noted that the case for withdrawal from Uganda is that the IMF\u2019s work is done. The case for continued involvement was that (1) investors and donors still regard Uganda as high risk and want the reassurance that an IMF presence brings, (2) the Ugandan government still needs IMF expertise, and (3) ESAF resources are most productive in an already reformed policy environment such as Uganda\u2019s. The evaluation favored continued IMF involvement in Uganda. U.S. Treasury officials felt that continued IMF involvement in Uganda is warranted because the reform program is still in a fragile state due to (1) serious weaknesses in human and institutional capacity that the IMF is uniquely suited to help remedy, and the recently-identified problems with corruption that are in part related to these capacity deficiencies, and (2) the threats to fiscal and economic stability posed the military security problems in the region."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Uganda\u2019s Nonobservance of Criteria Results in the IMF Delaying of Disbursement", "paragraphs": ["IMF staff conducted their midterm review of Uganda\u2019s performance under the arrangement in February/March 1999 in conjunction with their annual Article IV consultations.

The structural performance criterion on the verification of arrears was also missed.

The official said that Ugandan revenues were very good due to (1) improved controls of corruption in customs, (2) improved tax administration, and (3) income tax reforms, such as a broadened tax net and elimination of tax exemptions, which were paying off. However, the official said the government had used the unexpected revenues to increase military spending from 1.9 percent of GDP to 2.5 percent. Although the increased military spending does not violate IMF criteria, the official expressed concern that government officials not continually expect revenues to exceed expectations in order to pay for increasing military expenditures. The official said that IMF staff\u2019s major concern was that Uganda\u2019s privatization effort was completely off track due to political factors and corruption. The official said there is a loss in government credibility and therefore buyers are reluctant to bid for enterprises in the privatization program. The parliament had suspended the program while it conducts an investigation. The IMF staff set prior actions relating to the privatization program and the financial sector, which the government must meet prior to the staff\u2019s completion of the midterm review, which resumed in May 1999 and is expected to be completed in June 1999.

This issue recently received considerable prominence when the U.S. Congress considered an increased U.S. quota contribution to the IMF in 1998. While a full discussion of these issues is outside the scope of this report, several themes, including \u201cmoral hazard,\u201d the appropriateness of IMF conditionality, and the effect of IMF programs on the poor, have been consistently raised and illustrate the complexity of this debate.", "The issue of moral hazard has two components: (1) the willingness and ability of an international financial institution, such as the IMF, to \u201crescue\u201d a country from problems that may be of its own doing; and (2) the concern that the financing provided by these institutions is shielding private sector participants from the risks inherent in their investments. In the first instance, critics argue that the incentives for a country to avoid financial difficulties are diminished by its reliance on IMF assistance to lessen the impact of its policy mistakes. In response to this criticism, the IMF stresses that crises inevitably bring painful consequences, and that, in exchange for receiving its financial assistance, countries have to agree to adopt a stringent conditionality program that is designed to address each country\u2019s underlying problems. The adjustments required in implementing such a program can be very costly and painful, and thus should provide sufficient disincentive to countries from pursuing questionable policies. Furthermore, countries are obligated to repay the IMF for the financial assistance provided.", "Under the second moral hazard issue, critics of the IMF contend that in providing financial support to countries, the IMF also \u201cbails out\u201d large international banks and other private lenders. When a member country receives financial assistance from the IMF, the funds can be used to pay off existing creditors including those in the private sector. This activity has raised concerns about the efficiency of the international financial system by shielding private sector participants from the risks inherent in their investments. If some creditors are not fully assuming investment risk, and are lending under the assumption that the IMF and other official support will be forthcoming if necessary, distortions could be introduced into the international financial system. The IMF and the Group of Seven (G-7), in recent public announcements, have acknowledged the existence of this threat to the international financial system and are exploring strategies for reducing it. However, it has been argued that the danger of moral hazard should be balanced against the danger of the further spread of financial difficulties, or \u201ccontagion.\u201d During a crisis, lenders and investors may try to limit their exposure to all developing countries, not just those in crisis. This can result in countries with sound economic policies experiencing a financial crisis, driven largely by external events out of their control. By providing assistance to nations facing such a crisis, the IMF may also slow or stop the exit of private-sector lending to other developing countries and thus help minimize this potential threat to the international financial system.", "The appropriateness of IMF conditionality has also been subject to a considerable amount of debate. First, some critics believe that the IMF has overstepped its original mission by including conditions related to economic and social development strategies (\u201cmission-creep\u201d). Second, some critics have stressed that the imposition of an IMF conditionality program, under crisis conditions, that lacks a political consensus is unlikely to be successful and could in fact generate instability within the country. Third, during the Asian financial crises, several critics questioned the IMF\u2019s underlying economic assumptions for these countries, believing the initial IMF programs in Korea, Thailand, and Indonesia represented the IMF\u2019s standard approach to crises (macroeconomic austerity) that was inappropriate for these countries\u2019 situations. According to those critics, the IMF\u2019s \u201ccookie-cutter approach\u201d was doing those countries more harm than good. In response, the IMF has said that the flexibility of its approach to countries has allowed it to adapt to changing situations. In particular, its increasing emphasis on structural issues has reflected a growing understanding that balance-of-payments problems cannot be resolved if an economy suffers from deep-seated structural weaknesses. Moreover, the IMF has emphasized that its arrangements for individual countries constantly evolve, depending on developments, and that conditions are modified as necessary. The Thai, Indonesian, and Korean programs, for instance, were modified to take account of these countries\u2019 unexpectedly severe recessions. The IMF has also striven in recent years to coordinate its efforts with other international financial institutions, including the World Bank.", "The IMF has also been criticized because of the belief that its programs impose undue hardships on the poor. These critics point out that IMF programs often require that governments cut expenditures and reduce budget deficits in order to meet the IMF\u2019s macroeconomic goals. They argue that such cuts often result in reductions in spending on health, education, and other social programs vital to the poor. The IMF has acknowledged that, in certain cases in the past, programs for the poor have been excessively reduced. To lessen this potential, the IMF says that it now pays considerable attention to social issues and to social safety nets, to the point of sometimes now requiring that countries maintain minimum spending levels for social programs, despite the need for a general reduction in government spending."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Glossary", "paragraphs": ["This glossary is provided for reader convenience, not to provide authoritative or complete definitions for IMF funding arrangements, programs, and facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Arrangement", "paragraphs": ["A decision by the IMF that gives a member the assurance that the institution stands ready to provide foreign exchange or special drawing rights (SDRs) in accordance with the terms of the decision during a specified period of time.
