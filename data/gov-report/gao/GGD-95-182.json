Together, FPDs and CDOs are generally referred to as Federal Defender Organizations (FDOs). As shown in table 1, the number of FPDs and CDOs has gradually increased since 1990. FPD attorneys are federal employees; CDO attorneys are not. CDOs are private organizations funded by federal defender services grants. FPD and CDO attorneys are salaried; panel attorneys receive an hourly rate for their services that varies by district. Higher panel attorney hourly rates are generally paid for death penalty cases in all districts.

Occasionally, FDOs have also been appointed in such cases. At the end of fiscal year 1994 there were 20 DPRCs serving 50 federal judicial districts. The DPRCs are specialized CDOs that provide legal services\u2014through direct representation and/or consultation and support services to panel attorneys\u2014for persons appealing state death penalty convictions and/or sentences. The DPRCs are also authorized to represent defendants in federal capital prosecutions and in appeals of federal death penalty convictions.

This limitation is noted in our analysis and conclusions. Certain information, including data on cases involving mandatory minimum sentences and federal prosecutions of state-developed cases, was either unavailable or too incomplete for analysis. Also, because data reported by FDOs and panel attorneys differed, workload and cost comparisons between the two were limited.", "To determine the additional costs of paying panel attorneys the higher standard hourly rates, we used AOUSC\u2019s database to calculate the difference in compensation at the higher and lower standard hourly rates. We calculated the in-court and out-of-court compensation approved for those representations in the 16 districts compensated at the higher standard hourly rates. We then estimated the in-court and out-of-court compensation that would have been requested at the lower standard hourly rates of $40 out-of-court and $60 in-court. We subtracted the lower rate estimate from the actual amounts approved for payment at the higher standard rates. The difference was the estimated additional costs of paying the higher standard rates.

These reasons included implementation of the federal sentencing guidelines, which require additional attorney time; changing prosecutorial priorities that increased the number of complex drug and multiple defendant cases prosecuted in federal court, which were more likely to result in trials for one or more defendants; and greater numbers of offenses carrying mandatory minimum sentences, which were more likely to result in trials.", "These arguments were supported by some anecdotal evidence and such aggregate empirical data as total district court criminal caseload statistics showing a rising number of criminal trials and multiple defendant cases.

The authorizing legislation for the sentencing guidelines, the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, provided for appeals of sentences imposed by U.S. District Courts. For example, the act provided that a defendant or the federal government may appeal a sentence on the basis that the sentence was imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the guidelines. Generally, appeals of sentences were not common prior to the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s appellate review provisions.

We defined a panel attorney representation as the representation of a defendant charged with or convicted of a specific offense by a private, court-appointed attorney. Representations for convicted defendants included appeals of conviction and/or sentence or habeas corpus proceedings in which the defendant may be challenging a state conviction in federal court.", "We took several steps to avoid double-counting panel attorney representations closed. When a panel attorney was appointed, the court assigned a unique voucher number that the panel attorney was to use when submitting request(s) for payment. Panel attorneys may submit more than one voucher for each representation using the voucher number they were assigned upon appointment. We considered all claims for payment under a single voucher number to be part of a single representation. If payments under the same voucher number were approved and paid in two successive fiscal years, AOUSC counted the request for payment in the new fiscal year as a separate representation. We found 691 voucher numbers that appeared in fiscal years 1990 and 1991, 900 numbers that appeared in fiscal years 1991 and 1992, and 1,202 numbers that appeared in fiscal years 1992 and 1993. Thus, AOUSC would have counted as separate representations 691 voucher numbers in 1991, 900 in 1992, and 1,202 in 1993.", "We followed the AOUSC convention because we were tracking payments per representation closed in each fiscal year. Thus, like AOUSC, our counts of representations closed in each fiscal year were not precisely accurate. First, we overestimated representations actually closed in fiscal year 1990 by as much as 691 (2.4 percent of the 28,575 representations we attributed to 1990); in fiscal 1991 by as many as 900 (2.5 percent of 36,027 representations); and in fiscal year 1992 by as many as 1,202 representations (3.3 percent of 36,479 representations).", "Second, this method of counting did not accurately reflect panel attorney costs per representation closed. If each voucher number appearing in two fiscal years represented a single representation, then the true cost for each representation closed would be the total of all the payments made under each voucher number for both fiscal years. This approach affected hours per representation closed for the same reason. The total attorney hours appearing in both fiscal years would be the true hours per representation closed.", "Some defendants were represented by more than one panel attorney in the same case, but we counted such situations as a single representation.

This calculation was not very precise, but available data did not permit a more detailed estimate of costs per representation closed. This methodology may have overstated the FPD and CDO costs per representation closed because an undeterminable portion of their budgets was used for representations opened, but not closed, during the fiscal year. In addition, FDO attorneys provide training for panel attorneys, the costs of which are included in FDO budgets.", "The calculation of panel attorney costs per representation closed was somewhat more complicated. The AOUSC used \u201cpayment date\u201d\u2014the date on which the check was written\u2014to calculate per representation costs. In fiscal years 1991 and 1992, payments to panel attorneys were deferred due to shortage of funds, with large numbers of payments made in the first month of the new fiscal year. Thus, payment date was not necessarily the best measure of when the representation was closed. Therefore, we used \u201ccertification date,\u201d the date on which the court approved payment, because this date was likely to be closer to the date on which the work was completed and payment requested than the payment date.", "We calculated costs per representation closed using a two-step process. First, to determine costs for closed representations having a single panel attorney, we aggregated all payments for each voucher number. That is, if there were five payments approved for voucher number 12345, we combined all five payments to obtain a single cost for that voucher number. Second, we aggregated all payments for each voucher number associated with the same representation. For example, if voucher numbers 54321 and 67890 were associated with the same representation, we combined them into a single total for that representation.", "As noted, our panel attorney costs per representation closed may be somewhat understated since in the database we used the costs for as many as 691 representations that were split between fiscal years 1990 and 1991, 900 between 1991 and 1992, and 1,202 between 1992 and 1993. Moreover, our costs per representation closed included attorney time only. The costs of experts, investigators, and other services, reported on another form, were not included in our costs because of the difficulty of matching these payments, recorded in a separate database, with the representations recorded in the AOUSC database for attorney hours. However, such costs were included in the costs for FPDs and CDOs, since these costs were included in the total budget obligations we used to calculate FPD and CDO costs. Thus, the FPD and CDO cost per representation closed used in our analysis included all costs incurred by these organizations, while our panel attorney cost per representation closed included only attorney time.

In all but 16 districts panel attorneys were reimbursed at the standard rate of $60 per hour for in-court time and $40 per hour for out-of-court time. Thus, in these districts in-court hours are reimbursed at a rate 50 percent higher than out-of-court hours. The court may reduce the amount requested for either in-court compensation, out-of-court compensation, or both. However, where the court made a reduction in the amount approved for payment, the database did not usually indicate the number of attorney hours by which the request had been reduced. Rather, the database showed separately the amount requested and the amount approved for payment.", "Because attorney hours were not entered into the automated database, AOUSC calculated the actual number of in-court hours expended per panel attorney representations by dividing the total amount of compensation requested (for example, $2,400) for in-court time by the authorized hourly rate ($60 in most districts). The same calculation was made for out-of-court hours. The database supports no other reasonable method of calculation. Consequently, we used the same method to calculate attorney hours per representation closed.", "If the the authorized hourly rate is recorded erroneously on the CJA-20, this would affect the calculation of attorney hours. We found a wide variety of hourly rates reported in the database for both death penalty and nondeath penalty representations. Some appeared to be keying errors. For example, in more than 1,300 nondeath penalty panel attorney representations in fiscal year 1993 the out-of-court hourly rate was recorded as $752, perhaps reflecting a data entry error. The correct rate was probably $75\u2014the higher standard hourly rate in those districts authorized to pay the higher rates. However, because of the method used to calculate panel attorney hours, this error would reduce by a factor of 10 the actual out-of-court hours reported as expended in such cases. Due to resource limitations, we did not validate the hourly rates entered in the database. Consequently, we could not determine the magnitude of the error that may be attributable to such erroneous hourly rates, and the data used in our analyses were based on the rates as reported in the database.", "FPDs and CDOs were not assigned death penalty cases during the period of our review.

However, total 1993 panel attorney costs for criminal representations were actually $30,009,222 more than the 1990 total.

We excluded from our analysis representations compensated at rates other than the standard higher rates, as applicable, of $60, $70, or $75 per hour in these 16 districts.
