Employed in concert with other important IT management controls, such as portfolio investment management (selection, control, and evaluation) practicesand continuous information security management practices, enterprise architectures can greatly increase the chances that modernization programs will succeed. Our experience with federal agencies has shown that attempting to define and build major IT systems without first completing an enterprise architecture often results in IT systems that are duplicative, are not well integrated, are unnecessarily costly to maintain and interface, and do not effectively optimize mission performance.", "Congress, OMB, and the federal CIO Council have recognized the importance of enterprise architectures. The Clinger-Cohen Act, for example, requires that agency CIOs develop, maintain, and facilitate the implementation of enterprise architectures as a means of integrating business processes and agency goals with IT. Further, OMB has issued guidance on the development and implementation of agency IT architectures. Among other things, OMB guidance directs that agency investments in information systems be based on these architectures.Similarly, the CIO Council has issued guidance providing (1) a federal framework for the content and structure of an enterprise architecture,(2) a process for assessing investment compliance with an enterprise architecture, and (3) a set of management controls for developing, implementing, and maintaining an enterprise architecture.", "According to CIO Council guidance, it is critically important that an enterprise architecture be derived through a \u201ctop-down\u201d incremental approach, consistent with the hierarchical architectural views that are the building blocks of published architecture frameworks, including DOD\u2019s. It is equally important, according to this guidance, that the higher level views span the entire enterprise.

According to the draft plan, once BSM is completed (scheduled for fiscal year 2005), DLA will add other business functions to the BSM Business Architecture Blueprint so that the end result is an enterprisewide architecture (see fig. 4).", "DLA\u2019s approach to developing and implementing a C4ISR-based, agencywide enterprise architecture is thus one of compliance after the fact (that is, after acquiring and implementing its system solution), rather than development before the fact (and application during the fact).

For example, BSM officials acknowledged as enterprise requirements the following: technology infrastructure standards, a transition strategy, technical reference models, standards profiles, and information assurance policies at the enterprise level. In our view, such information would be valuable and useful in building a DLA enterprise architecture.", "However, DLA nevertheless does not have a complete enterprise architecture as defined by DOD\u2019s C4ISR framework, and its plans for developing one are not consistent with a fundamental best practice in CIO Council guidance. That is, DLA\u2019s approach is focused on only part of its enterprise (albeit the largest), whereas CIO Council guidance promotes a process to ensure development of an enterprisewide perspective. According to this guidance, the scope of the architecture for the operational view needs to encompass the entire enterprise. Only then can the agency understand the relationships and dependencies among its business areas and position itself to make informed decisions about the level of depth and detail to include in the architecture. Necessarily, this level of depth and detail will be tailored to each enterprise based on its size and complexity, as well as the purpose of the architecture and the riskiness of the modernization effort to be undertaken.", "Although DLA\u2019s approach does not preclude success, it does introduce a risk of misalignment between the COTS solution and the enterprise\u2019s strategic operational vision. To manage this risk, the enterprise would have to fully evaluate the COTS solution against the business requirements for the whole enterprise, not just a portion of it. Such an enterprisewide perspective is what Strategic Plan 2000: DLA 21 and the Logistics Transformation Plan envision. (For instance, DLA 21 refers to logistics solutions that are integrated from two standpoints: throughout the supply chain and throughout the agency.) An approach that lacks an enterprisewide perspective does not adequately ensure that the COTS system solution being acquired and implemented will optimally support all logistics business functions.", "Despite the existence of some enterprisewide architectural information, DLA\u2019s plan for building an architecture for its future operational, systems, and technical environment does not have an enterprisewide perspective. Instead, DLA is defining and implementing its architecture by first focusing on one of its six business functions (materiel management) separately from the others. For DLA, this is particularly problematic because DLA\u2019s six business functions are interrelated and interdependent. For example:   Materiel management and cataloging are related, because how an item is procured is determined in part by how an item is classified during the cataloging process.", "Materiel management and distribution are related, because decisions about whether DLA will distribute the materiel (or the vendor will deliver directly to the requisitioner) are made at the same time the materiel is bought.", "Distribution and cataloging are related, because how materiel is stored and transported is determined by how it is classified during cataloging (e.g., hazardous materiel has special storage and transportation needs).", "DLA adopted its approach to developing and implementing an enterprise architecture because the agency believed that using materiel management\u2014its largest business process\u2014as a starting point would lead to a solution with a baseline functionality that could be augmented as DLA evolves. Further, DLA expected that addressing materiel management would lead to the inclusion of some aspects of its other business functions, such as distribution and cataloging, for that part of materiel management operations to be performed via private sector supply chains.", "However, DLA also recognized that postponing consideration of some business functions might lead to disconnects later in the development. According to DLA, if the later DLA business functions could not be incorporated into the BSM Business Architecture Blueprint without major redesign, then DLA would construct linkages between BSM and the other business areas to produce an enterprisewide architecture.

DLA invested in its preliminary work (the analysis of candidate COTS systems against previously reengineered business processes) and in the initial release of BSM on the basis of this economic analysis.

Making investment decisions up front on large-scale, long-term projects is generally risky: their economic justification is based on costs, benefits, and risks that are difficult to forecast reliably, partially because later increments are not well understood or defined, and partially because they are subject to change in light of experience on nearer term increments and changing business needs. Through incremental investment management, organizations can reduce the level of project risk and complexity faced at any one time by spreading this risk and complexity across a series of smaller investments;   permit the delivery of some part of the expected business value earlier rather than waiting until later for the total, but more uncertain, business value;   continuously monitor and evaluate the delivery of cost and benefit expectations on ongoing increments and use this information to better define and economically justify these increments; and   permit later increments to exploit technology advances or accommodate evolving business needs.", "In January 2001, DOD issued a change to its major system acquisition policy requiring incremental investment management; specifically, the policy notes that a program\u2019s milestone decision authority must verify that each increment meets part of the mission need and delivers a measurable benefit, independent of future increments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DLA Has Not Yet Made Investment Decisions Incrementally", "paragraphs": ["Although DLA plans to acquire and implement its BSM system solution in four increments, it has not so far managed BSM investments incrementally.

Accordingly, DLA prepared a program life-cycle economic analysis for BSM, according to which the program is expected to produce a positive net present value over its 15- year life cycle and improve military readiness.

Approaching the BSM investment decision in this way was especially risky, since at the time that DLA prepared the BSM program life-cycle economic analysis, it had defined BSM business requirements for only the reengineered part of the materiel management business area. Thus, DLA was not only attempting the daunting task of accurately estimating the costs and benefits of many things over many years, it was doing so without knowing its BSM requirements beyond the reengineered parts of the materiel management business area.

Additionally, DLA has not employed incremental investment practices.", "Officials of DLA and the Office of the Secretary of Defense have committed to correcting these management weaknesses. We view these commitments as positive first steps for two primary reasons. First, if DLA continues to invest large sums of money in BSM without a DLA- or DOD- wide logistics enterprise architecture, it runs the serious risk that it will acquire a system solution that focuses narrowly on DLA materiel management performance and accountability at the expense of DLA- and DOD-wide performance and accountability. Second, until DLA begins justifying the return on its BSM investment incrementally, making BSM investment decisions incrementally, and measuring actual return on this investment incrementally, it will not be able to make well-informed and prudent investment decisions, and it will not know whether its BSM system solution is cost-effective until it has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To address DLA\u2019s need for an enterprise architecture to guide and constrain its IT capital investments, including BSM, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the DLA Director to designate and treat development, implementation, and maintenance of a DLA enterprise architecture as an agency priority.", "We recommend that in fulfilling this direction from the Secretary, the DLA Director (1) issue a policy governing development, implementation, and maintenance of an enterprise architecture and (2) establish a DLA enterprise architecture steering committee, chaired by the DLA Vice Director, to provide a DLA-wide direction and focus to the enterprise architecture, and to ensure that one is developed and maintained in a manner consistent with the CIO Council published guide on managing enterprise architectures.", "To provide for the effective development and maintenance of the DLA enterprise architecture, we recommend that the DLA Director make the CIO accountable to the enterprise architecture steering committee for developing and maintaining the agency\u2019s enterprise architecture. We recommend that in fulfilling this responsibility, the CIO appoint a Chief Architect for DLA and establish a program office responsible for developing and maintaining a DLA-wide enterprise architecture. We further recommend that the CIO direct the Chief Architect to work collaboratively with the appropriate offices within the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary for Logistics and Materiel Readiness to appropriately align the DLA enterprise architecture with this office\u2019s ongoing efforts to develop a DOD-wide logistics enterprise architecture. Additionally, we recommend that the CIO have the Chief Architect, as appropriate, follow the steps outlined in the CIO Council\u2019s published guide for managing enterprise architectures, including   obtaining executive buy-in and support,   establishing architecture management structure and controls,   defining the architecture process and approach,   developing the baseline architecture, the target architecture, and the sequencing plan, facilitating the use of the architecture, and   maintaining the architecture.", "To ensure that, once developed, the enterprise architecture is effectively implemented, we also recommend that the Director require the DLA 21 Executive Board and its subsidiary investment review boards to ensure that only architecturally compliant IT investments are approved and funded, unless the investment decisionmaking authority issues a written waiver in response to a written justification.", "Until a DLA enterprise architecture is developed and can be used to effectively guide and constrain DLA IT investment, we also recommend that the DLA Director limit future investment in BSM to only its first incremental release.", "To address DLA\u2019s need to incrementally invest in BSM, we recommend that the DLA Director impose three further conditions on investment in BSM beyond its first increment. Specifically, such investment should not occur until plans have been developed and processes implemented for (1) measuring and validating whether ongoing BSM increments are actually producing benefits commensurate with costs, (2) developing economic justifications for each subsequent increment that consider the actual performance of ongoing increments, and (3) ensuring that decisions on each subsequent increment are based on these incremental economic justifications.", "To ensure that the approach to DLA\u2019s logistics modernization (as well as that of other DOD component organizations) recognizes the logistics management interdependencies and interrelationships among DOD components and aims to optimize departmentwide performance and accountability, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics to (1) expedite development of a DOD-wide logistics management enterprise architecture in a manner consistent with CIO Council published guidance and (2) establish effective controls for ensuring that component investments in modernized logistics systems are compliant with the architecture or are otherwise granted an explicit waiver to this requirement on the basis of analytical justification."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report (reprinted in appendix II), the acting Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness agreed with us on the importance of developing and maintaining enterprise architectures and making BSM investment decisions incrementally, concurring with eight of our ten recommendations.

Despite these areas of substantial agreement, the Deputy Under Secretary disagreed with our recommendations that the DLA Director limit future investment in BSM to the first incremental release until (1) a \u201cfull-blown\u201d (as DOD termed it) DLA enterprise architecture is developed and (2) the BSM program manager has the means in place to measure actual benefit accrual on the first incremental release and to use this information in deciding on investment in the next release.", "According to DOD, our findings and conclusions regarding the overall level of risk to the successful achievement of BSM and other DOD logistics modernization program objectives are not supported by the single risk factor addressed in this report\u2014the use of enterprise architectures. DOD\u2019s stated view is that the risks associated with delaying BSM are greater than the risks of modernizing while concurrently developing the architecture. DOD also stated that while the conditions that we recommended regarding measurement and use of actual benefit accrual are valuable and will be performed by DOD, they should not be performed by the program manager and should not be on the critical path for undertaking future incremental releases.", "While DOD agrees that the absence of an \u201cend-to-end\u201d enterprise architecture for DLA is a risk, DOD strongly believes that this risk is amply mitigated by measures already taken. As examples, the Deputy Under Secretary\u2019s comments refer to the preparation of an enterprisewide logistics implementation plan for community data management services that defines the future information and business rules interaction among DOD components; the existence of an \u201cas is\u201d logistics architecture (documented during the Y2K campaign); the recent establishment of an OSD-led enterprise integration consortium that, according to the comments, will ensure optimal collaboration among programs; and the commercial architecture and process reengineering procedures being followed by DLA\u2019s BSM program.", "Notwithstanding the considerable level of agreement between DOD and us on this report, we have a differing view on the level of risk facing DOD logistics modernization programs in general, and BSM in particular, in the absence of the two risk mitigators addressed in this report: (1) effective enterprise architecture development and implementation and (2) effective incremental investment management.", "Our experience in reviewing other federal agency modernization programs has shown that the absence of these program management controls are two of the root causes for other programs\u2019 lack of success.  The two recommendations that DOD disagrees with are intended to strike a reasonable balance between the risk that DOD will suffer the same fate as these other agencies and the risk that DOD points out of delaying BSM. These recommendations permit DLA to make progress on the first BSM increment while developing and implementing the two missing management controls and thus becoming better equipped to move forward on subsequent increments. Therefore, we continue to believe that DOD should limit investment in BSM beyond the first increment until certain conditions are met.", "We agree with the Deputy Under Secretary that the risk mitigation strategies that DOD has followed can lower the risk associated with the lack of a complete enterprise architecture. However, we continue to believe that these efforts are not a sufficient substitute for having an explicit enterprise architecture and effectively using it to guide and constrain modernization investment decisions. At most, these mitigation strategies should be viewed as temporary controls until the architecture is available, as well as useful starting points for the development and use of an enterprise architecture.", "With regard to risk mitigation, the Deputy Under Secretary comments further that commercial implementation of enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a proven means for achieving an enterprise business strategy, adding that a key requirement of DLA\u2019s BSM program is to move to a commercial approach for achieving its end-state enterprise architecture. We agree that the use of commercial products can be a less risky approach than the development of custom applications, but we believe that success still depends on effective implementation and in particular on ensuring that the chosen products meet the needs of the enterprise; this requirement is best fulfilled by having and using an enterprise architecture. The main point of our recommendations is that DLA has yet to define its end-state enterprise architecture and therefore cannot know whether its chosen ERP solution will satisfy requirements beyond the materiel management business area. Accordingly, we stand by our recommendation in this area, which is intended to significantly lower the risk for the BSM program in relation to its role in developing DLA\u2019s enterprise architecture, not just in achieving DLA\u2019s requirements for modernizing its materiel management systems.", "We would add that DOD\u2019s characterization of the enterprise architecture that we recommend as \u201cfull-blown\u201d and \u201cend-to-end\u201d suggests that we are prescribing the full depth and detail of this architecture. We are not. In fact, effective architecture management practices recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all architecture solution and that the driving goal in developing an architecture is to make it useful for the task at hand, meaning that its depth and detail will vary from enterprise to enterprise.", "The Deputy Under Secretary also disagreed with our recommendation to impose additional conditions on investment in BSM beyond its first increment, specifically concerning the development of processes for performing cost/benefit analyses of ongoing and completed increments. According to the Deputy Under Secretary, the BSM program does plan to prepare a business case to support each of four scheduled releases and to include in each of these increments a projection of business process performance and an evaluation of empirical results of the program to that point. These are the very activities that we recommend as conditions for investing beyond the first increment. The Deputy Under Secretary\u2019s disagreement with our recommendation appears to center on who should be required to measure and use actual benefit accrual in making decisions on continuing the program to the next increment. It is not our intent to suggest that only the BSM program manager should measure and use actual benefit accrual or that one increment must be fully completed and fully evaluated before another can begin. In fact, effective incremental investment management necessitates some overlap among increments, and our recommendations do not contradict this. On the matter of who should measure and validate actual benefit accrual, we are not opposed to DLA assigning this responsibility to someone other than the program manager, and we acknowledge that the program manager should not be solely responsible for ensuring that investment decisions on subsequent increments are based on economic justifications.

This review did not address other system modernization best practices, such as whether DLA is employing effective system acquisition process controls, and did not evaluate the specific commercial, off-the-shelf product that DLA chose as its BSM system solution.", "To determine whether DLA has an enterprise architecture to guide BSM, we identified the DOD organizations involved in efforts to reform and modernize DOD logistics management operations and systems, as well as organizations responsible for DOD policy and guidance on enterprise architectures, including the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics); the Director of Logistics Systems Modernization; the DLA Logistics Operations Directorate; and the DLA Director of Information Operations, who is in charge of corporate information policy. From each of these organizations, we solicited information on plans and activities that defined the form and content of these reform and modernization efforts. We then questioned officials from each organization about planned and existing architectural artifacts and obtained copies of all such plans and artifacts. Next, we analyzed the information provided, including DOD\u2019s Joint Vision 2020, 21st Century Logistics: DOD Logistics Strategic Plan, and available DLA enterprise architecture artifacts, against DOD\u2019s C4ISR Architecture Framework to determine the extent to which these organizations individually or collectively had produced architectural artifacts that satisfied DOD requirements.

We evaluated policies, procedures, and guidance related to DLA\u2019s IT modular contracting activities. We evaluated task order plans and performance data against commonly accepted IT investment methodologies.", "Additionally, we reviewed economic analysis of DLA\u2019s BSM program and the related cost justifications.

We agree that the BSM program should not be held \u201chostage\u201d to the architecture and that the program and the architecture can proceed in parallel, but only to a point. As we have recommended, this point is the start of the next BSM increment, which according to DLA is August/September 2002. Our recommendation affords DLA ample time to develop and use the missing architectural definition without delaying the program. 2.  We disagree that this report draws conclusions about the program\u2019s \u201coverall\u201d risk based on a single risk factor. Our report is not intended to and does not provide a comprehensive BSM risk profile. Rather, it identifies important risks associated with the two IT management controls that were the focus of our work: (1) the use of an enterprise architecture and (2) the use of incremental investment controls. Further, while we acknowledge that DLA has taken risk mitigation measures, as cited in the draft report provided to DOD for comment, these measures are not a sufficient substitute for having an explicit enterprise architecture and effectively using it to guide and constrain modernization investment decisions. At most, they should be viewed as temporary controls until the architecture is available. In fact, while DOD believes that it cannot delay modernization, it nevertheless states in its comments that it supports the need for enterprise architectures and the integration of these architectures into its investment management processes. 3.  We agree that one should not conclude from this report that there is unacceptable risk associated with modernizing systems while developing an enterprise architecture. We also agree that there are risks associated with delaying modernization. Accordingly, our recommendation strikes a reasonable balance between the need for an architecture and the need to modernize legacy systems by allowing DOD to continue modernization while it develops an architecture. However, it does not allow the two to proceed in parallel indefinitely, because the longer DLA proceeds without an architecture, the greater the risks will become. 4.  We do not disagree and our report does not question the use of an ERP solution. Our point is that DLA has yet to define its end-state enterprise architecture and therefore cannot be sure that it is implementing its chosen ERP solution in a manner that will not suboptimize DLA enterprisewide performance and accountability, in order to optimize performance and accountability of one business area. 5.  See comments 1 and 2. Also, we do not agree that BSM is currently guided by sound architectural discipline. Such discipline would be evidenced by the existence and use of architectural artifacts developed in accordance with the practices outlined in CIO Council guidance.While we acknowledge the existence of some enterprise architecture information, as cited in the draft report provided to DOD for comment, and state in this report that that information would be valuable and useful in building a DLA-wide architecture, the fact remains that DLA does not currently have such an architecture. 6.  We acknowledge that the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel Readiness has pursued risk-reducing strategies, as noted in this report. However, they are not a sufficient substitute for a DOD-wide logistics architecture. 7.  We agree. The incremental investment actions described, if effectively implemented, are consistent with our recommendations. 8.  See comments 1 and 2. 9.  See comment 1. 10. We generally agree. The activities described in the comment are the very activities that we recommend as conditions for investing beyond the first increment. Further, it was not our intent to suggest that only the BSM program manager should measure and use actual benefit accrual or that one increment must be fully completed and fully evaluated before another can begin. In fact, effective incremental investment management necessitates some overlap among increments, and our recommendations do not preclude this. On the matter of who should measure and validate actual benefit accrual, we are not opposed to DLA assigning this responsibility to someone other than the program manager, and we acknowledge that the program manager is not the appropriate person to ensure that investment decisions on subsequent increments are based on economic justifications. Accordingly, we have slightly modified the recommendation and clarified language elsewhere in the report to reflect this. 11. We agree. We have changed the title of the report. 12. We disagree. The statement in our report is supported by DLA\u2019s draft Enterprise Information Architecture Plan, which clearly shows that the initial component of DLA\u2019s enterprise architecture will be, by design, limited to the materiel management business area. The plan also shows that DLA\u2019s other business areas are to be incorporated into the enterprise architecture following completion of the BSM program, which, according to BSM documents, is 5 years from now. 13. Our report has given the department credit for its DOD Logistics Strategic Plan, as well as Joint Vision 2020 and other strategic planning directions. However, as previously stated, these plans are not a sufficient substitute for an effective DOD-wide logistics management enterprise architecture. Moreover, in its comments, DOD states that having an architecture-based approach to investing in modernized systems is a more efficient means to optimizing enterprise performance and accountability. DOD also states that having an architecture would provide a more efficient and effective means for developing and overseeing the implementation of a common vision. 14. We disagree. While we have recognized these \u201cinterim measures\u201d in our report, our position is that these are just what DOD terms them\u2014 temporary controls until DOD has in place the architecture-based approach to modernization that its comments state are needed to achieve end-to-end optimization. See also comment 3. 15. We disagree. Notwithstanding DLA\u2019s recent commitments to incrementally invest in BSM, DLA has so far treated BSM as a single investment decision. The economic analysis used to justify DLA\u2019s decision to invest in BSM is dated April 2000, and this analysis was for the entire program. We requested any further economic analyses developed to justify the ongoing BSM increment as well as any plans to produce such analyses. DLA did not provide either. In June 2001, DLA provided an updated economic analysis, dated March 30, 2001, which continued to treat BSM as a whole. DOD\u2019s comments are consistent with statements made by BSM officials at the conclusion of our review, which were cited in the draft report. We are encouraged by DOD\u2019s comment that DLA will prepare a business case for each release and will include a projection of business process performance as well as a retrospective evaluation of empirical results of the program to that point. 16. We have modified our report to reflect this change. 17. We disagree. As we state in the report, enterprise architectures are essential tools for effectively and efficiently reengineering business processes and for implementing and evolving their supporting systems. Their development, implementation, and maintenance are recognized hallmarks of successful public and private sector organizations. Congress, OMB, and the federal CIO Council have recognized the importance of enterprise architectures. 18. We disagree. See comments 2 and 6. Further, our report does not state that the lack of an enterprise architecture will result in \u201cbad\u201d effects. Our report concludes that this lack increases the probability of such effects, and our report recognizes that other IT management weaknesses can also be contributing factors. 19. See comment 5. 20. See comment 12. 21. We disagree that our report implies that there is little interaction and consideration of the enterprise cataloging requirements. Our report refers to DLA\u2019s expectation that some aspects of other business functions would be included in the BSM blueprint. At the time of our review, however, DLA recognized that postponing some business functions might lead to disconnects, requiring later linkages between BSM and other business areas to produce an architecture with an enterprisewide scope. Our point is that because these functions are interrelated, it makes sense to construct an enterprise architecture to guide and constrain BSM implementation and thereby optimize DLA- wide performance and accountability. 22. See comments 2 and 21. 23. See comment 13. 24. We have modified the report to reflect this comment. 25. We have modified the report to incorporate the additional context provided in this comment and to recognize when efforts to develop a DOD-wide logistics enterprise architecture began. 26. We disagree that we have been provided a copy of the document defining the mission-critical logistics \u201cthreads\u201d used in DOD\u2019s Year 2000 testing \u201cin their current status.\u201d While we did receive in 1999 a copy of the document defining these mission-critical logistics threads, the Director also told us that these were being modified in light of ongoing modernizations, and DOD\u2019s comments acknowledge that they have since been modified. 27.
