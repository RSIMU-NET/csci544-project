While the Internet originated as a U.S. government-sponsored research project, the vast majority of its infrastructure is currently owned and operated by the private sector. Federal policy recognizes the need to prepare for debilitating Internet disruptions and tasks the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with developing an integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery. GAO was asked to summarize its report on plans for recovering the Internet in case of a major disruption (GAO-06-672) and to provide an update on DHS's efforts to implement that report's recommendations. The report (1) identifies examples of major disruptions to the Internet, (2) identifies the primary laws and regulations governing recovery of the Internet in the event of a major disruption, (3) evaluates DHS plans for facilitating recovery from Internet disruptions, and (4) assesses challenges to such efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A major disruption to the Internet could be caused by a physical incident (such as a natural disaster or an attack that affects key facilities), a cyber incident (such as a software malfunction or a malicious virus), or a combination of both physical and cyber incidents. Recent physical and cyber incidents, such as Hurricane Katrina, have caused localized or regional disruptions but have not caused a catastrophic Internet failure. Federal laws and regulations that address critical infrastructure protection, disaster recovery, and the telecommunications infrastructure provide broad guidance that applies to the Internet, but it is not clear how useful these authorities would be in helping to recover from a major Internet disruption. Specifically, key legislation on critical infrastructure protection does not address roles and responsibilities in the event of an Internet disruption. Other laws and regulations governing disaster response and emergency communications have never been used for Internet recovery. As of 2006, DHS had begun a variety of initiatives to fulfill its responsibility to develop an integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery, but these efforts were not yet comprehensive or complete. For example, the department had developed high-level plans for infrastructure protection and incident response, but the components of these plans that address the Internet infrastructure were not complete. As a result, the risk remained that the government was not adequately prepared to effectively coordinate public/private plans for recovering from a major Internet disruption. Key challenges to establishing a plan for recovering from Internet disruptions include (1) innate characteristics of the Internet that make planning for and responding to disruptions difficult, (2) lack of consensus on DHS's role and when the department should get involved in responding to a disruption, (3) legal issues affecting DHS's ability to provide assistance to restore Internet service, (4) reluctance of many in the private sector to share information on Internet disruptions with DHS, and (5) leadership and organizational uncertainties within DHS. Until these challenges are addressed, DHS will have difficulty achieving results in its role as a focal point for helping the Internet to recover from a major disruption. DHS has made progress in implementing GAO's recommendations by revising key plans in coordination with private industry infrastructure stakeholders, coordinating various Internet recovery-related activities, and addressing key challenges to Internet recovery planning. However, further work remains to complete these activities, including finalizing recovery plans and defining the interdependencies among DHS's various working groups and initiatives. Full implementation of these recommendations should enhance the nation's ability to recover from a major Internet disruption."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss public/private recovery plans for  the Internet infrastructure. Since the early 1990s, the world community has  come to rely on the Internet as a critical infrastructure supporting  commerce, education, and communication.

From its origins in the 1960s as a research project  sponsored by the U.S. government, the Internet has grown increasingly  important to both American and foreign businesses and consumers,  serving as the medium for hundreds of billions of dollars of commerce  each year. The Internet has also become an extended information and  communications infrastructure, supporting vital services such as power  distribution, health care, law enforcement, and national defense. Today,  private industry\u2014including telecommunications companies, cable  companies, and Internet service providers\u2014owns and operates the vast  majority of the Internet\u2019s infrastructure. In recent years, cyber attacks  involving malicious software or hacking have been increasing in frequency  and complexity. Attacks against the Internet can come from a variety of  sources, including criminal groups, hackers, and terrorists.", "Federal regulation recognizes the need to protect critical infrastructures  such as the Internet. It directs federal departments and agencies to identify  and prioritize critical infrastructure sectors and key resources and to  protect them from terrorist attack. Furthermore, it recognizes that since a  large portion of these critical infrastructures is owned and operated by the  private sector, a public/private partnership is crucial for the successful  protection of these critical infrastructures. Federal policy also recognizes  the need to be prepared for the possibility of debilitating disruptions in  cyberspace and, because the vast majority of the Internet infrastructure is  owned and operated by the private sector, tasks DHS with developing an  integrated public/private plan for Internet recovery. In its plan for  protecting critical infrastructures, DHS recognizes that the Internet is a  key resource composed of assets within both the information technology  and the telecommunications sectors. It notes that the Internet is used by  all critical infrastructure sectors to varying degrees and provides  information and communications to meet the needs of businesses and  government.", "In the event of a major Internet disruption, multiple organizations could  help recover Internet service. These organizations include private  industry, collaborative groups, and government organizations. Private  industry is central to Internet recovery because private companies own  most of the Internet\u2019s infrastructure and often have response plans.  Collaborative groups\u2014including working groups and industry councils\u2014 provide information-sharing mechanisms to allow private organizations to  restore services. In addition, government initiatives could facilitate a  response to major Internet disruptions.", "Federal policies and plans assign DHS with the lead responsibility for  facilitating a public/private response to and recovery from major Internet  disruptions. Within DHS, responsibilities reside in two divisions within the  Office of the Under Secretary for National Protection and Program, Office  of Cybersecurity and Communications: the National Cyber Security  Division (NCSD) and the National Communications System (NCS). NCSD  operates the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT),  which coordinates defense against and response to cyber attacks. The  other division, NCS, provides programs and services that assure the  resilience of the telecommunications infrastructure in times of crisis.  Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission can support  Internet recovery by coordinating resources for restoring the basic  communications infrastructures over which Internet services run. For  example, after Hurricane Katrina, the commission granted temporary  authority for private companies to set up wireless Internet  communications supporting various relief groups; federal, state, and local  government agencies; businesses; and victims in the disaster areas.", "Prior evaluations of DHS\u2019s cyber security responsibilities have highlighted  issues and challenges facing the department. In May 2005, we issued a  report on DHS\u2019s efforts to fulfill its cyber security responsibilities. We  noted that while DHS had initiated multiple efforts to fulfill its  responsibilities, it had not fully addressed any of the 13 key cyber security  responsibilities noted in federal law and policy. We also reported that DHS  faced a number of challenges that have impeded its ability to fulfill its  cyber responsibilities. These challenges included achieving organizational  stability, gaining organizational authority, overcoming hiring and  contracting issues, increasing awareness of cyber security roles and  capabilities, establishing effective partnerships with stakeholders,  achieving two-way information sharing with stakeholders, and  demonstrating the value that DHS can provide. In that report, we also  made recommendations to improve DHS\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission as an  effective focal point for cyber security, including recovery plans for key  Internet functions. DHS agreed that strengthening cyber security is central  to protecting the nation\u2019s critical infrastructures and that much remained  to be done."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Cyber and Physical Incidents Have Caused Disruptions, the Internet Has Not Yet Suffered a Catastrophic Failure", "paragraphs": ["The Internet\u2019s infrastructure is vulnerable to disruptions in service due to  terrorist and other malicious attacks, natural disasters, accidents,  technological problems, or a combination of these things. Disruptions to  Internet service can be caused by cyber and physical incidents\u2014both  intentional and unintentional. Over the last few years, physical and cyber  incidents have caused localized or regional disruptions, highlighting the  importance of recovery planning. However, these incidents have also  shown the Internet as a whole to be flexible and resilient. Even in severe  circumstances, the Internet has not yet suffered a catastrophic failure.", "To date, cyber attacks have caused various degrees of damage. For  example, in 2001, the Code Red worm used a denial-of-service attack to  affect millions of computer users by shutting down Web sites, slowing  Internet service, and disrupting business and government operations. In  2003, the Slammer worm caused network outages, canceled airline flights,  and automated teller machine failures. Slammer resulted in temporary loss  of Internet access to some users, and cost estimates on the impact of the  worm range from $1.05 billion to $1.25 billion. The federal government  coordinated with security companies and Internet service providers and  released an advisory recommending that federal departments and agencies  patch and block access to the affected channel. However, because the  worm had propagated so quickly, most of these activities occurred after it  had stopped spreading.", "In 2002 and again in 2007, coordinated denial-of-service attacks were  launched against all of the root servers in the Domain Name System. In the  2002 attack, at least nine of the thirteen root servers experienced  degradation of service, while in the 2007 attack, six of the thirteen root  servers experienced degradation of service. However, average end users  hardly noticed the attacks. The attacks were efficiently handled by the  server operators and their service providers. The 2002 attack pointed to a  need for increased capacity for servers at Internet exchange points to  enable them to manage the high volumes of data traffic during an attack.  The 2007 attack demonstrated that some of the improvements made since  2002 to improve the resilience of the Internet had worked.", "Like cyber incidents, physical incidents could affect various aspects of the  Internet infrastructure, including underground or undersea cables and  facilities that house telecommunications equipment, Internet exchange  points, or Internet service providers. For example, on July 18, 2001, a 60- car freight train derailed in a Baltimore tunnel, causing a fire that  interrupted Internet and data services between Washington and New York.  The tunnel housed fiber-optic cables serving seven of the biggest U.S.  Internet service providers. The fire burned and severed fiber optic cables,  causing backbone slowdowns for at least three major Internet service  providers. Efforts to recover Internet service were handled by the affected  Internet service providers; however, local and federal officials responded  to the immediate physical issues of extinguishing the fire and maintaining  safety in the surrounding area, and they worked with telecommunications  companies to reroute affected cables.", "In another physical incident, Hurricane Katrina caused substantial  destruction of the communications infrastructures in Louisiana,  Mississippi, and Alabama, but it had minimal affect on the overall  functioning of the Internet outside of the immediate area. According to an  Internet monitoring service provider, while there was a loss of routing  around the affected area, there was no significant impact on global  Internet routing. According to the Federal Communications Commission,  the storm caused outages for more than 3 million telephone customers, 38  emergency 9-1-1 call centers, hundreds of thousands of cable customers,  and more than 1,000 cellular sites. However, a substantial number of the  networks that experienced service disruptions recovered relatively  quickly.", "Federal officials stated that the government took steps to respond to the  hurricane, such as increasing analysis and watch services in the affected  area, coordinating with communications companies to move personnel to  safety, working with fuel and equipment providers, and rerouting  communications traffic away from affected areas. However, private sector  representatives stated that requests for assistance, such as food, water,  fuel, and secure access to facilities were denied for legal reasons; the  government made time-consuming and duplicative requests for  information; and certain government actions impeded recovery efforts.", "Since its inception, the Internet has experienced disruptions of varying  scale\u2014including fast-spreading worms, denial-of-service attacks, and  physical destruction of key infrastructure components\u2014but the Internet  has yet to experience a catastrophic failure. However, it is possible that a  complex attack or set of attacks could cause the Internet to fail. It is also  possible that a series of attacks against the Internet could undermine  users\u2019 trust and thereby reduce the Internet\u2019s utility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Existing Laws and Regulations Apply to the Internet, but Numerous Uncertainties Exist in Using Them for Internet Recovery", "paragraphs": ["Several federal laws and regulations provide broad guidance that applies  to the Internet infrastructure, but it is not clear how useful these  authorities would be in helping to recover from a major Internet disruption  because some do not specifically address Internet recovery and others  have seldom been used. Pertinent laws and regulations address critical  infrastructure protection, federal disaster response, and the  telecommunications infrastructure.", "Specifically, the Homeland Security Act of 2002 and Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 7establish critical infrastructure protection as a  national goal and describe a strategy for cooperative efforts by the  government and the private sector to protect the physical and cyber-based  systems that are essential to the operations of the economy and the  government. These authorities apply to the Internet because it is a core  communications infrastructure supporting the information technology and  telecommunications sectors; however, they do not specifically address  roles and responsibilities in the event of an Internet disruption.", "Regarding federal disaster response, the Defense Production Actand the  Stafford Act provide authority to federal agencies to plan for and respond  to incidents of national significance like disasters and terrorist attacks.  Specifically, the Defense Production Act authorizes the President to  ensure the timely availability of products, materials, and services needed  to meet the requirements of a national emergency. It is applicable to  critical infrastructure protection and restoration but has never been used  for Internet recovery. The Stafford Act authorizes federal assistance to  states, local governments, nonprofit entities, and individuals in the event  of a major disaster or emergency. However, the act does not authorize  assistance to for-profit companies\u2014such as those that own and operate  core Internet components.", "Other legislation and regulations, including the Communications Act of  1934and the NCS authorities,govern the telecommunications  infrastructure and help to ensure communications during national  emergencies. For example, the NCS authorities establish guidance for  operationally coordinating with industry to protect and restore key  national security and emergency preparedness communications services.  These authorities grant the President certain emergency powers regarding  telecommunications, including the authority to require any carrier subject  to the Communications Act of 1934 to grant preference or priority to  essential communications.The President may also, in the event of war or  national emergency, suspend regulations governing wire and radio  transmissions and authorize the use or control of any such facility or  station and its apparatus and equipment by any department of the  government. Although these authorities remain in force in the Code of  Federal Regulations, they have seldom been used\u2014and never for Internet  recovery. Thus it is not clear how effective they would be if used for this  purpose.", "In commenting on the statutory authority for Internet reconstitution  following a disruption, DHS agreed that this authority is lacking and noted  that the government\u2019s roles and authorities related to assisting in Internet  reconstitution following a disruption are not fully defined."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Initiatives Supporting Internet Recovery Planning Are Under Way, but Much Remains to Be Done and the Relationships Among the Initiatives Are Not Evident", "paragraphs": ["As of our June 2006 report, DHS had begun a variety of initiatives to fulfill  its responsibility to develop an integrated public/private plan for Internet  recovery, but these efforts were not complete or comprehensive.

While these activities were promising, the responsibilities  and plans for selected working groups had not yet been defined, and key  exercises lacked effective mechanisms for incorporating lessons learned.  In addition, the relationships among the initiatives were not evident. For  example, the National Cyber Response Coordination Group, the Internet  Disruption Working Group, and the North American Incident Response  Group were all meeting to discuss ways to address Internet recovery, but  the interdependencies among the groups had not been clearly established.

Until these  challenges are addressed, DHS will have difficulty achieving results in its  role as a focal point for recovering the Internet from a major disruption.", "First, the Internet\u2019s diffuse structure, vulnerabilities in its basic protocols,  and the lack of agreed-upon performance measures make planning for and  responding to a disruption more difficult. The components of the Internet  are not all governed by the same organization. In addition, the Internet is  international. According to private-sector estimates, only about 20 percent  of Internet users are in the United States. Also, there are no well-accepted  standards for measuring and monitoring the Internet infrastructure\u2019s  availability and performance. Instead, individuals and organizations rate  the Internet\u2019s performance according to their own priorities.", "Second, there is no consensus about the role DHS should play in  responding to a major Internet disruption or about the appropriate trigger  for its involvement. The lack of clear legislative authority for Internet  recovery efforts complicates the definition of this role. DHS officials  acknowledged that their role in recovering from an Internet disruption  needs further clarification because private industry owns and operates the  vast majority of the Internet.", "Private sector officials representing telecommunication backbone  providers and Internet service providers were also unclear about the types  of assistance DHS could provide in responding to an incident and about  the value of such assistance. There was no consensus on this issue. Many  private-sector officials stated that the government does not have a direct  recovery role, while others identified a variety of potential roles, including    providing information on specific threats;    providing security and disaster relief support during a crisis;  funding backup communication infrastructures;   driving improved Internet security through requirements for the  government\u2019s own procurement;   serving as a focal point with state and local governments to establish  standard credentials to allow Internet and telecommunications companies  access to areas that have been restricted or closed in a crisis;   providing logistical assistance, such as fuel, power, and security, to  focusing on smaller-scale exercises targeted at specific Internet disruption  issues;  limiting the initial focus for Internet recovery planning to key national  security and emergency preparedness functions, such as public health and  safety; and   establishing a system for prioritizing the recovery of Internet service,  similar to the existing Telecommunications Service Priority Program.", "A third challenge to planning for recovery is that there are key legal issues  affecting DHS\u2019s ability to provide assistance to help restore Internet  service. As noted earlier, key legislation and regulations guiding critical  infrastructure protection, disaster recovery, and the telecommunications  infrastructure do not provide specific authorities for Internet recovery. As  a result, there is no clear legislative guidance on which organization would  be responsible in the case of a major Internet disruption. In addition, the  Stafford Act, which authorizes the government to provide federal  assistance to states, local governments, nonprofit entities, and individuals  in the event of a major disaster or emergency, does not authorize  assistance to for-profit corporations. Several representatives of  telecommunications companies reported that they had requested federal  assistance from DHS during Hurricane Katrina. Specifically, they  requested food, water, and security for the teams they were sending in to  restore the communications infrastructure and fuel to power their  generators. DHS responded that it could not fulfill these requests, noting  that the Stafford Act did not extend to for-profit companies.", "A fourth challenge is that a large percentage of the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure\u2014including the Internet\u2014is owned and operated by the  private sector, meaning that public/private partnerships are crucial for  successful critical infrastructure protection. Although certain policies  direct DHS to work with the private sector to ensure infrastructure  protection, DHS does not have the authority to direct Internet owners and  operators in their recovery efforts. Instead, it must rely on the private  sector to share information on incidents, disruptions, and recovery efforts.  Many private sector representatives questioned the value of providing  information to DHS regarding planning for and recovery from Internet  disruption. In addition, DHS has identified provisions of the Federal  Advisory Committee Actas having a \u201cchilling effect\u201d on cooperation with  the private sector. The uncertainties regarding the value and risks of  cooperation with the government limit incentives for the private sector to  cooperate in Internet recovery-planning efforts.", "Finally, DHS has lacked permanent leadership while developing its  preliminary plans for Internet recovery and reconstitution. In May 2005,  we reported that multiple senior DHS cyber security officials had recently  left the department.These officials included the NCSD Director, the  Deputy Director responsible for Outreach and Awareness, the Director of  the US-CERT Control Systems Security Center, the Under Secretary for  the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate and the  Assistant Secretary responsible for the Information Protection Office.

This effort could include providing  specific authorities for Internet recovery as well as examining potential  roles for the federal government, such as providing access to disaster  areas, prioritizing selected entities for service recovery, and using federal  contracting mechanisms to encourage more secure technologies. This  effort also could include examining the Stafford Act to determine whether  there would be benefits in establishing specific authority for the  government to provide for-profit companies\u2014such as those that own or  operate critical communications infrastructures\u2014with limited assistance  during a crisis.", "Additionally, to improve DHS\u2019s ability to facilitate public/private efforts to  recover the Internet in case of a major disruption, we recommended that  the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security implement nine  actions (see table 1).
