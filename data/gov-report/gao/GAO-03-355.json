The reported inventory increases were primarily due to the Navy reporting aviation parts held by ships and air squadrons that were previously not reported and to overall DOD inventory requirements increases. In addition, GAO identified large imbalances in the department's inventory; as of September 30, 2001, over 1.7 million items had $38 billion of inventory that exceeded the items' current inventory operating requirements of $24.9 billion. At the same time, there were 523,000 items that needed an additional $10.4 billion of inventory to meet the items' current inventory operating requirements. Generally, inventory increases are the result of increases in inventory requirements. DOD's overall inventory requirements increased by $10.6 billion, or 26 percent, between the end of fiscal years 1999 and 2001, with some of the Navy's requirements being overstated. The Navy was responsible for the largest dollar increase, $4.7 billion of the $10.6 billion increase. A large part of the Navy increase, $3.4 billion, was attributable to a change in the way the Navy accounted for aviation parts held by ships and air squadrons. The remaining Navy increase was attributable to a variety of reasons, such as price increases; increased demand and item wear-out rates; and, in some cases, inaccurate data. Also, since 1997 the Navy has reduced the amount of administrative lead time it takes to place inventory orders (the period between when the need to replenish an item through a purchase is identified and when a contract is let), yet it has not formally updated the data used to compute those requirements. For example, the Navy reduced the administrative lead time for medium-sized sole-source contracts for repairable items from 200 days to 130 days, but it did not recognize the reduction in its requirements computations. As a result, those requirements are inaccurate and overstated."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense maintains a supply of spare and repair parts in  order to keep its equipment operational for war- and peace-time missions.

According to the Navy, prior to 1996, aviation items  that inventory control points sold to customers onboard ships and at  installations were not accounted for in its inventory. In 1996, the Navy  began accounting for aviation items held by ships and installations by  recognizing these requirements and assets in its inventory system and  recording them as insurance item requirements. The Navy made the  change in order to provide item managers visibility of the inventory and  associated requirements and assets. Most of the increase in requirements  and inventory occurred after 1999 when the Navy began to include  aviation parts held on aircraft carriers. Generally, the change in  accounting for these requirements resulted in a $3.4 billion increase in  Navy insurance item requirements, from $2.4 billion on September 30,  1999, to $5.8 billion on September 30, 2001.", "To gain insight into why increases in the Navy\u2019s inventory requirements  occurred, we compared the 307,000 items the Navy managed as of  September 30, 1999, to the 309,000 items managed as of September 30,  2001, and identified 279,000 items that were managed in both years.  Overall, the value of the 279,000 items increased $4.2 billion between  September 30, 1999, and September 30, 2001 (see table 3). Of this amount,  $3.1 billion was the result of increased inventory requirement quantities  and $1.1 billion was due to price changes. About 37,000 items accounted  for $4.3 billion in inventory requirements increases, and another 37,000  items accounted for a $1.2 billion decrease in inventory requirements  decreases. There was no change in inventory requirement quantities for  the remaining 205,000 items during the same period of review.", "We also reviewed in more detail 90 of the 279,000 items. We selected the  90 items because they had large increases in requirements and accounted  for $1.1 billion of the $4.2 billion of the requirements increase associated  with the 279,000 items. For 37 of the 90 items, insurance requirements  increases accounted for $454 million of the 90 items\u2019 $1.1 billion total  requirements increase between 1999 and 2001. Of the $454 million,  $428 million of the increase was attributable to including existing  aviation requirements and $26 million was attributable to new aviation  requirements. For example, the insurance requirement for an aviation  radar transmitter, valued at $446,000 each and used on the F-18 and the  AV-8B aircraft, increased from 44 transmitters on September 30, 1999, to  196 on September 30, 2001. The requirement caused an increase of  128 transmitters by recognizing existing aviation requirements in the  Navy\u2019s inventory and an increase of another 24 transmitters as a result of  new requirements for these transmitters in newer versions of the  F-18 aircraft.", "In addition to the $454 million increase in insurance item requirements,  our analysis of the 90-item sample identified a wide variety of additional  reasons for the increases in requirements. For example, increased usage  of items resulted in requirements increasing by $294 million for 46 items.  Increased usage was often the result of changes in demand for an item,  defective parts needing to be replaced, and items wearing out at a faster  rate than expected. Changes in the Navy\u2019s stock, overhaul, or operational  policies; the inability to find a commercial source for an item; and the  unavailability of material needed to manufacture items were among the  other reasons for requirements increases. Table 4 summarizes the reasons  identified for the requirements increases. Additional information and  examples are discussed in more detail in appendix IV.", "The Navy has not formally updated the data it uses to project  administrative lead time requirements for aviation parts since 1999, and  thus these requirements are overstated. Before 1999, the Navy used the  actual administrative lead time from an item\u2019s previous procurement as a  basis for projecting its future administrative lead time requirements for  aviation parts. In 1999, the Navy began using an administrative lead time  matrix for computing the requirements. Under this approach, the Navy  places aviation items into matrix cells based on the type of item being  purchased, the size of the potential purchase, and the type of contract to  be used to purchase the item. The Navy believes that items that are similar  and are purchased in a similar manner will have similar lead times. As of  September 30, 2001, the Navy had computed $895 million of administrative  lead time requirements for its 101,000 aviation parts.", "When the Navy implemented the matrix approach for computing  administrative lead time requirements in 1999, it based the requirements  on actual fiscal year 1997 lead time data. Since 1997 the Navy has generally  reduced its actual administrative lead time. While the Navy has  recomputed its administrative lead times using statistical techniques  aimed at reducing fluctuations from year to year, it has not formally  updated the administrative lead time matrix used to compute requirements  to reflect the most current, lower data. However, in response to our  inquiries, the Navy, in December 2002, reviewed the administrative lead  time data used to compute requirements and found that the data had been  revised. Item manager reviews and the purchase of items that had not  recently been purchased led to changes to the lead time data in the files.", "Our analysis of the changes showed that the revised data had lowered the  administrative lead times for most of the matrix cells and that the  Navy-computed lead times would be further reduced for most matrix  cells. For example, revised data reduced the lead time from 200 days to  183 days for medium-sized sole-source contracts for repairable items. The  Navy-computed lead time further reduced the lead time to 130 days. In  contrast, for large-sized sole-source contracts for repairable items, the  revised data reduced the lead time from 280 days to 183 days while the  Navy-computed lead time set it at 195 days.", "Navy officials responsible for aviation parts have been reluctant to use  the lower Navy-computed lead time data. Even though the Navy uses a  technique to reduce fluctuations in its computed lead time from year to  year, the officials believe that annual changes in the lead time will result in  terminating contracts for parts in 1 year and possibly having to repurchase  the same items the next year."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Navy is overstating its administrative lead time requirements for  aviation items by not using the most current data available for computing  those requirements.
