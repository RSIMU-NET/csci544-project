This limits their ability to collectively or comparatively assess these data to identify any disparities (i.e., instances in which a racial, ethnic, or gender group was overrepresented) in the military justice system within and across the services. For example, the number of potential responses for race and ethnicity across the military services' databases ranges from five to 32 options for race and two to 25 options for ethnicity, which can complicate cross-service assessments. The services also are not required to and, thus, do not report demographic information in their annual military justice reports\u2014information that would provide greater visibility into potential disparities.", "GAO's analysis of available data found that Black, Hispanic, and male servicemembers were more likely than White or female members to be the subjects of investigations recorded in databases used by the military criminal investigative organizations, and to be tried in general and special courts-martial in all of the military services when controlling for attributes such as rank and education. GAO also found that race and gender were not statistically significant factors in the likelihood of conviction in general and special courts-martial for most services, and minority servicemembers were either less likely to receive a more severe punishment than White servicemembers or there was no difference among racial groups; thus, disparities may be limited to particular stages of the process. The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken some steps to study disparities, but has not comprehensively evaluated the causes of racial or gender disparities in the military justice system. Doing so would better position DOD to identify actions to address disparities and help ensure the military justice system is fair and just.", "Note: These analyses, taken alone, should not be used to make conclusions about the presence or absence of unlawful discrimination. These multivariate regression analysis results estimate whether a racial or gender group is more likely or less likely to be the subject of an investigation or a trial in general or special courts-martial after controlling for race, gender, rank, and education, and in the Air Force, years of service.

It also outlines the jurisdiction and basic  procedure of the military justice system, and provides the legal framework  for conducting investigations and prosecutions of allegations of  misconduct by servicemembers. Every active-duty member of the Army,  the Navy, the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the Coast Guard is  subject to the UCMJ. According to the Manual for Courts-Martial, the  purpose of military law is to promote justice, assist in maintaining good  order and discipline in the armed forces, promote efficiency and  effectiveness in the military establishment, and thereby strengthen the  national security of the United States. The Military Justice Review Group  elaborated on this purpose, stating that the current structure and practice  of the UCMJ embodies a single overarching principle: a system of military  law can foster a highly disciplined force if it is fair and just, and is  recognized as such by both members of the armed forces and by the  American public.", "The military justice system has rules, proceedings, and consequences  that are different from the rights and obligations in the civilian criminal  court system. In addition to articles that punish traditional crimes such as  unlawful drug use and assault, the UCMJ includes unique military  offenses including desertion, failure to obey orders or regulations, and  misbehavior before the enemy, among others. These unique military  offenses are specifically proscribed in the military context because of their  deleterious effect on morale and mission accomplishment.", "In 1995, we reported that studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s  showed no disparities\u2014instances in which a racial, ethnic, or gender  group was overrepresented\u2014in discipline rates between Black and White  servicemembers and found no evidence that minority groups received  courts-martial or nonjudicial punishments out of proportion to certain  types of violations. In that same report, however, we found that studies  published in the 1990s by the Navy and the Defense Equal Opportunity  Management Institute showed that Black servicemembers were  overrepresented in the number of servicemembers receiving judicial and  nonjudicial punishments. In 2017, a non-profit organization reported that  Black servicemembers were substantially more likely than White  servicemembers to face military justice action.", "House Report 115-200, accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, included a provision for us to  review differences in the way that the military services collect and  maintain information about the race and gender of servicemembers  convicted of violations of the UCMJ and to assess the extent that  disparities may exist in the military justice system. This report assesses  the extent to which (1) the military services collect and maintain  information about the race, ethnicity, and gender of servicemembers  investigated and disciplined for violations of the UCMJ that can be used  to assess disparities; and (2) there are racial or gender disparities in  investigations, disciplinary actions, and case outcomes in the military  justice system, and whether the Department of Defense (DOD) and the  military services have taken steps to study any identified disparities.", "For our first objective, we reviewed service guidance, user manuals, and  other documentation to determine the types of data officials are required  to collect and maintain as well as internal procedures the services follow  to input information about race, ethnicity, and gender into their  investigations, military justice, and personnel databases. For example, we  determined whether the collection of this information was mandatory, and  how this information was entered into and recorded in each database. We  also interviewed agency officials who manage and use the databases to  determine which fields in each database track the race, ethnicity, and  gender of the accused; how these data are input in the databases; and  their insights regarding the reliability of these data. We also analyzed the  data we received from the investigations, military justice, and personnel  databases to determine the completeness of the race, ethnicity, and  gender information that was recorded in each of the databases. We  assessed service systems and procedures for collecting data against  DOD and service guidance and relevant federal internal control  standards.", "For our second objective, we analyzed military justice actions initiated  and recorded in service investigations and military justice databases  between fiscal years 2013 through 2017\u2014the most recent data available  at the time of our review\u2014as well as record-level data from each of the  military services\u2019 personnel, investigations, and military justice  databases. To prepare the data for our analyses and ensure that we  had consistent profiles for the race, ethnicity, and gender of the  servicemembers, we merged records using unique identifiers, such as  social security number or DOD employee identification number, that were  common among a particular service\u2019s databases. Based on discussions  with service officials, we treated the personnel databases as the  authoritative sources for servicemembers\u2019 demographic and  administrative data. In addition, as part of our data preparation, we  consolidated the various race and ethnicity values in the service  personnel databases to the five groups for race and the two groups for  ethnicity established by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  standards for maintaining, collecting, and presenting data on race and  ethnicity for federal reporting purposes. When military service personnel  databases included different or additional possible options for race and  ethnicity than the groups established by the OMB standards, we  consolidated the options in accordance with the definitions for each race  and ethnicity option listed in the OMB standards. We grouped individuals  of Hispanic ethnicity together, regardless of their racial identification, so  that we could compare those of Hispanic ethnicity to other racial groups.  Throughout this objective in our report, we refer to the combined race and  ethnicity values as race.", "We analyzed data from the military services\u2019 investigations, military  justice, and personnel databases to determine the extent to which racial  and gender groups were the subjects of recorded investigations, tried in  courts-martial, and subject to nonjudicial punishments at higher or lower  rates than each racial and gender group\u2019s proportion of the overall service  population. We analyzed data for trials in general and special courts- martial separately from trials in summary courts-martial because general  and special courts-martial result in a criminal conviction if the  servicemember is found guilty, while summary courts-martial are not a  criminal forum and do not result in a criminal conviction. Our analyses  only counted cases that were ultimately tried at general, special, or  summary courts-martial, and excluded those cases where charges were  dismissed, withdrawn, or subject to some alternate resolution.", "We also conducted bivariate analyses to estimate the association  between select attribute factors (or independent variables) and the  outcome variables (the dependent variable) in a binary format. We  reviewed relevant literature and interviewed agency officials to determine  which demographic attributes would be most appropriate to include in our  analyses. Our bivariate analyses examined attributes such as race,  gender, age, rank, years of service, education, and offense. We then  conducted multivariate regression analyses to test the association  between servicemember characteristics, such as race and gender, and  the odds of a military justice action, while holding other servicemember  attributes constant, such as gender, rank, and education. Our  multivariate regression analyses controlled for attributes such as race,  gender, rank, years of service, and education. We conducted data  reliability assessments on the datasets we received from the databases in  our review. We examined the documentation related to the databases,  conducted electronic tests on the data we received, and discussed data  reliability with database managers. Based on these actions, for the  purposes of our analysis, we found the variables we ultimately reported  on to be sufficiently reliable. Our analyses of these data, taken alone, do  not establish whether unlawful discrimination has occurred, as that is a  legal determination that would involve other corroborating information  along with supporting statistics. Further, we did not identify the causes of  any racial or gender disparities, and the results of our work alone should  not be used to make conclusions about the military justice process.

The jurisdiction of the UCMJ extends to all places and  applies to all active-duty servicemembers. UCMJ jurisdiction applies to  other individuals as well, such as members of the National Guard or  reserves who are performing active-duty service; retired members who  are entitled to pay or are receiving hospitalization in a military hospital;  prisoners of war in custody of the armed forces; persons serving with or  accompanying the armed forces in the field in time of declared war or  contingency operations, such as contractors; and members of  organizations such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration and the Public Health Service when assigned to and  serving with the armed forces.", "In creating the military justice system, Congress established three types  of military courts, called courts-martial: summary, special, and general.  Each of these types respectively is intended to deal with progressively  more serious offenses, and each court-martial type may adjudicate more  severe maximum punishments as prescribed under the UCMJ. In  addition, an accused servicemember can receive nonjudicial punishment  under Article 15 of the UCMJ, by which a commander can punish a  servicemember without going through the court-martial process. Table 1  provides an overview of nonjudicial punishments and the three different  types of courts-martial.", "The Military Justice Act of 2016 enacted significant reforms to the UCMJ,  most of the provisions of which became effective on January 1, 2019.  These reforms included changes such as limitations on the types of  punishments permitted with nonjudicial punishments, changes to  required size of the panel, or jury, and changes to what judicial  outcomes are subject to automatic appeal. There are some areas where  individual services supplement but remain consistent with the UCMJ. For  example, the Air Force provides a right to counsel in certain forums where  the services are not required to do so.", "In addition to the reforms affecting the UCMJ, the Military Justice Act of  2016 also directed changes to military justice data collection and  accessibility. Specifically, section 5504 of the Military Justice Act of  2016 directed the Secretary of Defense to prescribe uniform standards  and criteria pertaining to case management, data collection, and  accessibility of information in the military justice system. As a result, the  DOD Office of General Counsel authorized the establishment of the  Article 140A Implementation Subcommittee of the Joint Service  Committee on Military Justice to, among other things, assess each  service\u2019s case management system, recommend what data fields the  services should collect, propose uniform definitions for the data fields the  services should collect, and recommend standardized methods and data  field definitions to improve the collection of data concerning race and ethnicity of individuals involved in the military justice system.

We previously reported in 1995  on DOD studies on discrimination and equal opportunity, and found DOD  and the services conducted seven reviews of racial disparities in  discipline rates between 1974 and 1993. Since our 1995 report through  2016, DOD and service assessments of military justice disparities have  been limited. Officials in the Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion  (ODEI) noted DOD has not conducted any department-wide assessments  of racial or gender disparities in military justice during this period. The  military services\u2019 diversity offices also were not able to identify any  service-specific reviews of disparities in military justice.", "However, the military services have some initiatives to examine and  address disparities in military justice. For example, Air Force officials said  that in May 2016, the Air Force conducted a servicewide data call to  solicit information about cases involving a challenge to a member of a  court-martial based on race or a motion for selective prosecution. The  officials said that a thorough review revealed no evidence of selective  prosecution in Air Force courts-martial. In addition, the Air Force has  conducted analyses of its own military justice data. Specifically, the Air  Force routinely analyzes military justice data using a rates-per-thousand  analysis to identify whether certain demographic groups are tried by  court-martial or subject to nonjudicial punishments at higher rates than  others. These Air Force analyses found that Black and male  servicemembers were more likely than White and female  servicemembers to be subject to courts-martial and nonjudicial  punishments from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, which is consistent  with what we found. However, the other services do not routinely  conduct such analyses.", "Moreover, DOD has conducted climate surveys to address  servicemembers\u2019 perceptions of bias. In 2013, for example, DOD  conducted service-wide equal opportunity surveys that queried  servicemembers on whether they believed they received nonjudicial  punishment or a court martial they should not have, and whether they  believed their race or ethnicity was a factor. The survey responses  showed that 1.3 percent of servicemembers indicated experiencing a  perceived undue punishment, a result that was unchanged from the 2009  survey. Minority members were more likely to indicate experiencing  perceived undue punishment than White members, but there were no  significant differences between racial or ethnic groups who indicated  experiencing undue punishment. ODEI officials told us that their office did  not make any recommendations related to military justice as a result of  these 2013 survey results because the findings were too small to warrant  such steps. Moreover, ODEI officials said that while they have not  completed their analysis of the 2017 survey data, the question about  receiving nonjudicial punishment or court-martial had been removed from  the 2017 survey. ODEI officials explained that the question was removed  because the perception of unfair punishment was not the goal of the  survey, although they said that the question could be reinstated for future  surveys if the goals for the survey change.", "In June 2017, ODEI initiated a review of the military justice system  following the publication of a report by a non-profit organization that found  racial disparities in military justice actions. According to ODEI officials,  their review assesses disparities in the military justice system using a  similar analysis to that in the non-profit organization\u2019s report, which  analyzed rates of military justice actions per thousand servicemembers.  ODEI officials told us they also observed racial and gender disparities  among servicemembers involved in the military justice system in their  own analysis of the service data. The officials said that the report on the  results of their review will not directly address the issue of whether bias  exists in the military justice process or the causes of any disparities, but  will serve as a precursor to a future research study that looks more  comprehensively into the issue of whether bias exists in the military  justice system.

Officials from DOD and the military  services acknowledged that they do not know the cause of the racial and  gender disparities that have been identified in the military justice system.  This is because they have not conducted a comprehensive evaluation to  identify potential causes of these disparities and make recommendations  about any appropriate corrective actions to remediate the cause(s) of the  disparities.

DOD and the military services collect and maintain data  on the race, ethnicity, and gender of all servicemembers. However, these  data vary within and across the services, limiting the ability to collectively  or comparatively assess military justice data to identify any disparities.  DOD has recently taken steps to address this issue by directing the  military services to, no later than December 23, 2020: collect uniform race  and ethnicity data in their military justice databases, or aggregate any  expanded ethnic or racial categories to the categories listed in the  standards; collect either the social security number or DOD identification  number in their military justice databases; and collect complete summary  courts-martial information. It will be important for the military services to  complete these actions to allow for efficient analysis and reporting of  consistent military justice data.", "However, the newly issued standards apply only to the military justice  databases and not to the investigations and personnel databases. The  ability to query and report on the gender of servicemembers in its military  justice database would provide the Coast Guard with more readily  available data to identify or assess any gender disparities that may exist  in the investigation and trial of military justice cases without merging data  from multiple databases. Moreover, taking steps to develop the capability  to present the race and ethnicity data from the military services\u2019 personnel  and investigations databases using the same categories included in the  December 2018 standards for the military justice databases would enable  DOD and the military services to more easily and efficiently assess the  extent to which there are any racial or ethnic disparities throughout the  military justice process.", "Further, DOD\u2019s annual reports about the number and status of pending  military justice cases do not include demographic information, such as  breakdowns by race or gender, about servicemembers who experienced  a military justice action. Reporting this information would provide  servicemembers and the public with greater visibility into potential  disparities and help build confidence that DOD is committed to a military  justice system that is fair and just. Moreover, DOD does not have  guidance that establishes criteria to determine when data indicating  possible disparities among racial, ethnic, or gender groups in the  investigations, trials, or outcomes of cases in the military justice system  should be further reviewed, or describes the steps that should be taken to  conduct such further review. By establishing such criteria, DOD and the  services would be better positioned to monitor the military justice system  to help ensure that it is fair and just, a key principle of the UCMJ.", "Our analysis of available data identified racial and gender disparities in all  of the military services for servicemembers with recorded investigations,  and for four of the military services for trials in special and general courts- martial, but these disparities generally were not present in the convictions  or punishments of cases. These findings suggest disparities may be  limited to particular stages of the military justice process for the period  covered by our analysis. However, we were unable to determine whether  there were disparities among servicemembers subject to nonjudicial  punishments in the Army, the Navy, and the Coast Guard because these  services do not collect complete nonjudicial punishment data, such as  data on the servicemember\u2019s race, ethnicity, gender, offense, and  punishment for all nonjudicial punishments, in any of their databases. The  absence of complete nonjudicial punishment data in the Army, the Navy,  and the Coast Guard limits their visibility into the vast majority of legal  punishments imposed on servicemembers under the UCMJ every year.  Without such data, these three services will remain limited in their ability  to assess or identify disparities among populations subject to this type of  punishment.", "Finally, DOD recently conducted a study of racial and gender disparities  in the military justice system, and expects to complete its report in 2019.  However, this study will not assess the causes of the racial and gender  disparities identified in the military justice system. Our findings of racial  and gender disparities, taken alone, do not establish whether unlawful  discrimination has occurred, as that is a legal determination that would  involve other corroborating information along with supporting statistics.

In discussions with officials after we had  completed our preliminary analyses, they recommended that we use the  referral date instead of the preferral date, so that our total number of  cases would be more consistent with the number of cases that they  reported. However, changing the date for grouping cases would have  required us to request new military justice data from each of the military  services, and conduct additional work. Above all, using the preferral date  would not impact the findings of racial and gender disparities. In addition,  our analyses only counted cases that were ultimately tried at general,  special, or summary courts-martial, and excluded those cases where  charges were dismissed, withdrawn, or subject to some alternate  resolution.

We first tried to match these  cases using the servicemembers\u2019 name and date of birth; however, in  some cases we were unable to match personnel records with  investigations or military justice cases. As a result, we compiled lists of  those cases we were unable to match, and we provided the services with  lists of these cases. Service officials manually looked up this data and  provided us with the missing social security numbers or employee  identification numbers for these cases so that we could complete our  analyses. These manual look up efforts increased our match rates so that  we had a data set that we determined was sufficiently complete to  perform our analyses.", "For servicemembers who were the subjects of military justice actions, we  used the attribute data that was available in the personnel database at  the time an investigation or disciplinary action was initiated (the preferral  date for courts-martial). For our total service populations, which included  servicemembers who were not the subject of a military justice action, we  used their attribute data from the \u201cmedian\u201d snapshot of the five fiscal  years of personnel data we received. Based on discussions with service  officials, we treated the personnel databases as the authoritative sources  for servicemembers\u2019 demographic and administrative data. For some  services when needed, if we identified a discrepancy in the race or  gender value for a servicemember between the data in the personnel and  military justice databases, we used the value recorded in the personnel  database because service officials had told us that the personnel  databases were the official sources for demographic data such as race  and gender, and would be more likely to contain more reliable data for  these fields than the investigations or military justice databases. For some  services where there were cases where an attribute value was missing in  the personnel database, we used the military justice or investigative  database as a secondary source for this information. In merging the  records from the personnel, military justice, and investigations databases,  we created a single data file for each service that contained attribute data  for all active-duty servicemembers, as well as complete information on  the investigation and discipline of servicemembers who were the subject  of a military justice action from fiscal years 2013 through 2017.", "In using this methodology to merge the records, the total number of  servicemembers we use in our report when discussing the total service  populations for each service is greater than the total active-duty force end  strength of that service in any given fiscal year. This is because our total  service populations represent the number of unique individuals who  served on active duty from fiscal years 2013 through 2017.", "In addition, as part of our data preparation, we consolidated the various  race and ethnicity values in the service personnel databases to the five  groups for race and the two groups for ethnicity established by Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) standards for maintaining, collecting,  and presenting data on race and ethnicity for all federal reporting  purposes. The five race groups in the standards are American Indian or  Alaska Native; Asian; Black or African American; Native Hawaiian or  Other Pacific Islander; and White. The two ethnic groups are Hispanic or  Latino and Not Hispanic or Latino. First, we collapsed race and ethnicity  data into a single combined field. Specifically, we grouped individuals of  Hispanic ethnicity together, regardless of their racial identification, so that  we could compare those of Hispanic ethnicity to other racial groups. We  did this in part because of the ways in which some of the services record  these data in their databases. For example, the Navy\u2019s and the Marine  Corps\u2019 military justice databases do not have separate fields for race and  ethnicity; instead, the values are tracked in a single field. Throughout the  discussion for objective 2 of this report, we refer to the combined race  and ethnicity values as race.", "We then consolidated races to the five racial groups in the OMB  standards. When military service personnel databases included different  or additional possible options for race and ethnicity than the groups  established by the OMB standards, we consolidated the options in  accordance with the definitions for each race and ethnicity listed in the  OMB standards. Given the small number of cases in some racial groups,  we collapsed certain racial groups into an \u201cOther\u201d group in order to report  statistically reliable results. The \u201cOther\u201d group includes individuals who  identified as Asian, Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander, American  Indian/Alaska Native, and multiple races.", "Summary statistics. We analyzed data from the military services\u2019  investigations, military justice, and personnel databases to determine the  extent to which racial and gender groups were the subjects of recorded  investigations, tried in courts-martial, and subject to nonjudicial  punishments (for Army and Marine Corps, services for which we had  complete data) at higher rates or lower rates than each racial and gender  group\u2019s proportion of the overall service populations. Other than our  analysis of recorded investigations, we did not analyze Coast Guard  cases due to the small number of general and special courts-martial  adjudicated in the Coast Guard from fiscal years 2013 through 2017.", "To conduct this analysis, we used data on all active-duty servicemembers  to identify what proportion each racial group (White, Black, Hispanic, and  Other) and gender group (male, female) made up of the overall service  population from fiscal years 2013 through 2017. We then used data from  the services\u2019 military justice or personnel databases to calculate the  representation of each racial and gender group as a percent of the  population subjected to each type of military justice action.", "We also examined the rates at which certain racial and gender groups  were charged with drug offenses (Article 112a) and sexual assault  offenses (Article 120) compared to their proportions of the overall service  populations. See Appendix III for information regarding recorded  investigations and general and special courts-martial of drug and sexual  assault offenses. We analyzed these two specific UCMJ offenses  because officials from some services told us that an investigation into  these offenses may frequently be mandatory, and thus could potentially  mitigate the risk of bias. To conduct this analysis, we used offense data  from the services\u2019 military justice databases to determine each racial and  gender group\u2019s representation in the population that was the subject of a  military justice action for a drug, sexual assault, or other offense type.", "Bivariate and Multivariate Regression Analyses. We developed a  logistic regression model using the data we received from the services\u2019  investigations and military justice databases to determine the extent that  certain attributes were associated with higher rates of investigation or  discipline of servicemembers. We conducted bivariate logit analyses to  estimate the association between select attribute factors (or independent  variables) and the outcome variables (the dependent variable) in a binary  format, except for the two offense outcome variables. Table 7 below lists  all of the dependent and independent variables we used in our analyses.", "To conduct our statistical analyses, we created groups for each  demographic and administrative attribute (independent variable) that we  tested in our regression model. We created these groups based on input  and guidance from service officials. While the modeling subgroups we  created are largely consistent across services, some values are different  for certain services. Table 8 summarizes the modeling groups we  constructed for each service for each attribute included in our regression  analyses.", "When analyzing the severity of punishments, we developed two groups  for the Navy and the Marine Corps, and three groups for the Air Force  and the Army, as shown in table 9 below. We did not create a third  punishment group for confinement without dismissal or discharge for the  Navy and the Marine Corps because of the small number of cases with  confinement that did not also include some sort of discharge. Based on  discussions with service officials, we determined that a sentence resulting  in a dismissal or discharge was the most severe punishment outcome.", "Typically, a logistic regression model is appropriate when the model  outcome is a binary (yes/no) response. Because the punishment groups  for the Army and the Air Force were not binary, they could not be  analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression. Instead, we used an  ordered logit model, also called an ordered logistic regression model, to  analyze punishment severity in the Army and the Air Force. An ordered  logistic regression is an extension of the logistic regression model that  applies to dependent variables where there are more than two response  categories. This model allowed us to examine the degree to which a  racial or gender group was more likely or less likely than another group to  receive a more severe punishment in general and special courts-martial,  while controlling for other attributes, such as gender, education, rank,  composition of panel, and offense type. To conduct this analysis, we  reviewed outcome data from the services\u2019 personnel, investigations, and  military justice databases.", "Based on our bivariate analyses, we determined which variables were  significantly associated with military justice actions, and that appeared to  be statistically significant predictors of an individual\u2019s likelihood to be  subject to a military justice action. Appendix IX includes a summary of  those indicators for each of the services. We also examined correlation  matrices of the independent variables to determine where there were high  correlations between two variables. Where variables were highly  correlated, we chose one variable over the others or created a hybrid  variable combining those two variables. Specifically, we excluded age  and years of service for most of the military services, due to high  correlation with the rank variable. Based on our discussions with service  officials, they indicated that rank would be the preferred variable to  include in our analyses if selecting only one variable among rank, age,  and years of service. However, for the Air Force, based on discussion  with Air Force officials, we did control for years of service among the  lower enlisted ranks (E1-E4). In addition, we could not include education  for the Army due to variability and overlapping values in the data. Further,  we chose not to model attributes such as occupation and location due to  the great variability in these data and the difficulty in creating groups and  reaching agreement about those groups with service officials.", "Based on these results, we then conducted a series of multivariate  logistic regression models. Multivariate logistic regression modeling is a  statistical method that examines several variables simultaneously to  estimate whether each of these variables are more likely or less likely to  be associated with a certain outcome. A multivariate regression analysis  analyzes the potential influence of each individual factor on the likelihood  of a binary outcome (e.g., a specific military justice action) while  simultaneously accounting for the potential influence of the other factors.  This type of modeling allowed us to test the association between  servicemember characteristics, such as race or gender, and the odds of a  military justice action (shown as the outcome variables in table 7 above),  while holding other servicemember attributes constant (such as gender,  rank, and education, shown as the independent variables in table 7  above). We conducted a separate regression for each of the military  justice actions listed as an outcome variable. We selected this type of  model because it could account for the attributes simultaneously. For the  purposes of consistency, in our multivariate regression analyses, we  made all racial comparisons with White servicemembers as the reference  category. Similarly, we made all gender comparisons with female  servicemembers as the reference category.", "A logistic regression model provides an estimated odds ratio, where a  value greater than one indicates a higher or positive association; in this  case, between the race, ethnicity, or gender of a servicemember (the  independent variables) and the likelihood of being the subject of a military  justice action (the dependent, or outcome, variable). An estimated odds  ratio less than one indicates lower odds or likelihood of being the subject  of a military justice action when a factor\u2014here, a specific demographic or  administrative attribute\u2014is present. The statistical significance of the  logistic regression model results is determined by a p-value of less than  0.05. As a result, in our report we state that odds ratios that are  statistically significant and greater than 1.00 or lower than 1.00 indicate  that individuals with that characteristic are more likely or less likely,  respectively, to be the subject of a particular outcome or military justice  action. In cases where the p-value was greater than 0.05, we report that  we could not identify any statistically significant differences, which means  that we could not conclude that there was an association between race or  gender and the likelihood of a military justice action.", "We report the results from our regression models as odds ratios. We  generally report multivariate results from testing associations between  key attributes\u2014including race, ethnicity, gender, rank, and education\u2014on  a servicemember\u2019s likelihood of being investigated and disciplined for a  UCMJ violation. In the body of this report, we focused on race and gender  disparities among servicemembers investigated and disciplined for  violations of the UCMJ, while holding other factors constant; however, our  analyses of recorded investigations and general and special courts-  martial for drug and sexual assault offenses are discussed in Appendix III.  In all of these analyses for the Air Force, we also controlled for years of  service among the lower enlisted ranks (E1-E4). In the analyses we  conducted for the Army, we could not control for education, but we were  able to control for age.", "All regression models are subject to limitations. For our analyses, the  limitations included:", "Results of our analyses are associational and do not imply a causal  relationship. We did not identify the causes of any racial or gender  disparities, and the results of our work alone should not be used to  make conclusions about the military justice process. Our analyses of  these data in finding the presence or absence of racial or gender  disparities, taken alone, do not establish the presence or absence of  unlawful discrimination, as that is a legal determination that would  involve other corroborating information along with supporting  statistics.", "We could not assess some attributes that potentially could be related  to a servicemember\u2019s likelihood of facing a military justice action in the  data analyzed for this review. For example, a servicemember\u2019s  socioeconomic background or receipt of a waiver upon entering the  service could potentially be related to the likelihood of being  investigated, tried in a court-martial, or subject to a nonjudicial  punishment. However, we were unable to test these associations  because most services indicated they did not have information about  socioeconomic status or waivers in the databases that we requested  data from. Furthermore, while some other attributes may have been  available\u2014such as marital status of the subject or the number of  dependent children\u2014we did not include these attributes in our data  requests because we prioritized analyzing other demographic factors  based on our background research and conversations with service  officials.", "As outlined above, we incorporated input from service officials to the  extent possible as we prepared our modeling groups for the  demographic and administrative attributes we tested, such as rank,  education, and years in service. However, this process was  necessarily imprecise. Our modeling results may have been impacted  by our discretionary decisions to include certain values in the groups  we created for these variables.", "Data reliability. We conducted data reliability assessments on the  datasets we received from the databases in our review. We examined the  documentation officials provided to us on each database and conducted  electronic tests on the data we received to check for completeness and  accuracy. We also sent data reliability questionnaires to database  managers about how the data are collected and their appropriate uses,  and had discussions with database managers to discuss the reliability of  the data in their databases. When we determined that particular fields  were not sufficiently reliable, we excluded them from our analysis. For  example, we did not use data in our analysis where a substantial number  of values were missing. We also checked to see that the values for  variables were internally consistent and that results were not affected  unduly by outlier values that might suggest miscoded values. For the  purposes of our analysis, we found the variables we ultimately reported  on to be sufficiently reliable. Furthermore, due to the sensitivity of the  information analyzed in this report, we did not include information in  instances where the number of servicemembers subjected to a particular  military justice action was fewer than 20, to protect privacy.", "Literature review. To assess the extent to which disparities in the military  justice system and the civilian justice system had been previously  assessed, we conducted a literature review. To identify relevant  publications about disparities in the military justice system and the civilian  justice system, we performed a literature search of a number of  bibliographic databases, including ProQuest Academic, ProQuest Dialog,  Scopus, EBSCO, and HeinOnline. We also searched two think tank  search engines: Policy File and the Think Tank Search (from the Harvard  Kennedy School). We received the following types of publications:  scholarly/peer reviewed material, dissertations, and association/think  tank/nonprofit publications. To identify publications by DOD and the  services related to the military justice system, we reviewed prior GAO  reports and asked officials at the DOD Office of Diversity, Equity and  Inclusion, and in the services\u2019 respective diversity and inclusion offices to  identify relevant publications. We concluded our searches in October  2018. We also asked the service Judge Advocate General offices for  publications relevant to disparities in military justice. We also identified  publications in our own background information search. We reviewed  those publications that assessed racial, ethnic, or gender disparities  among servicemembers in the military justice system. While the civilian  and military justice systems differ from each other, we selected a few  nationwide studies examining disparities in the civilian justice system to  summarize in the background section of our report, in order to enhance  our understanding of the complexities of the issues, including how others  have attempted to measure disparities. We did not assess the  methodologies used in any of these studies or the reliability of the data  cited in the studies; the studies related to the civilian justice system are  discussed in our report to provide broader context for the discussion  about racial and gender disparities in the military justice system.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2017 to May 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We analyzed data for these offenses  for recorded investigations, trials in general and special courts-martial,  and convictions from fiscal years 2013 through 2017 to assess the extent  to which racial and gender disparities may exist.
