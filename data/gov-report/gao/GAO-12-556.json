Accordingly, a committee report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act directed GAO to report on DOD\u0092s plans. GAO evaluated: (1) the extent to which DOD has established its concept for conducting security force assistance, including defining the term and identifying actions needed to plan for and prepare forces to execute it; (2) the extent to which the geographic combatant commands have taken steps to plan for and conduct security force assistance, and what challenges, if any, they face; and (3) what steps the services have taken to organize and train general purpose forces capable of conducting security force assistance, and what challenges, if any, they face. GAO reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed officials from combatant commands, the services, and other DOD organizations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to establish its concept for conducting security force assistance, including broadly defining the term and identifying actions needed to plan for and prepare forces to execute these activities. For example, in October 2010, the department issued an instruction that broadly defines security force assistance and outlines responsibilities for key stakeholders, including the geographic combatant commands and military services. DOD also identified gaps in key areas of doctrine, organization, and training related to the implementation of security force assistance and tasks needed to address those gaps. The tasks include reviewing joint and service-level doctrine to incorporate security force assistance as needed and developing measures to assess progress in partner nations. Citing a need to clarify the definition of security force assistance beyond the DOD Instruction, DOD published a document referred to as a Lexicon Framework in November 2011 that included information to describe how security force assistance relates to other existing terms, such as security cooperation.", "The geographic combatant commands conduct activities to build partner nation capacity and capability, but face challenges planning for and tracking security force assistance as a distinct activity. Notwithstanding DOD\u0092s efforts to present security force assistance as a distinct and potentially expansive activity and clarify its terminology, the commands lack a common understanding of security force assistance, and therefore some were unclear as to what additional actions were needed to meet DOD\u0092s intent. Specifically, officials interviewed generally viewed it as a recharacterization of some existing activities, but had different interpretations of what types of activities should be considered security force assistance. Further, some command officials stated that they were not clear as to the intent of DOD\u0092s increased focus on security force assistance and whether any related adjustments should be made in their plans and scope or level of activities. As a result, they do not currently distinguish security force assistance from other security cooperation activities in their plans. DOD intended the Lexicon Framework to provide greater clarity on the meaning of security force assistance and its relationship to security cooperation and other related terms. However, some officials said that they found the distinctions to be confusing and others believed that additional guidance was needed. GAO\u0092s prior work on key practices for successful organizational transformations states the necessity to communicate clear objectives for what is to be achieved. Without additional clarification, the geographic combatant commands will continue to lack a common understanding, which may hinder the department\u0092s ability to meet its strategic goals. Moreover, the system that the commands are directed to use to track security force assistance activities does not include a specific data field to identify those activities. The commands also face challenges planning for and executing long-term, sustained security force assistance plans within existing statutory authorities, which contain some limitations on the types of activities that can be conducted.", "The services are taking steps and investing resources to organize and train general purpose forces capable of conducting security force assistance based on current requirements. For example, to conduct activities with partner nation security forces, the Army and the Air Force are aligning certain units to geographic regions, and the Marine Corps has created tailored task forces. However, the services face certain challenges. Due to a lack of clarity on how DOD\u0092s increased emphasis on security force assistance will affect future requirements, they are uncertain whether their current efforts are sufficient or whether additional capabilities will be required. Further, services face challenges in tracking personnel with security force assistance training and experience, particularly in identifying the attributes to track."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends DOD clarify its intent for security force assistance, including how combatant commands should adjust their current planning efforts and provide a means to track activities.

For example, the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review generally  described security force assistance as DOD\u2019s \u201chands on\u201d efforts to train,  equip, advise, and assist countries\u2019 forces in becoming more proficient at  providing security to their populations, protecting their resources and  territories, and enabling them to participate in operations that improve  regional security, such as coalition and peacekeeping operations.  Similarly, DOD\u2019s January 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance reiterated  security force assistance as a key element of DOD\u2019s mission to counter  terrorism, provide a stabilizing presence overseas, and share the costs  and responsibilities of global leadership.", "While security force assistance is a recently introduced term within the  department, the objective to develop the capabilities of partner nation  security forces is not new and has traditionally been achieved through a  broader set of activities and programs planned for and conducted by the  geographic combatant commands, such as security cooperation, security   assistance, and foreign internal defense. Historically, special operations  forces have conducted the majority of DOD\u2019s activities to train, advise,  and assist partner nation security forces, whereas the involvement of  general purpose forces has been more limited. As such, these forces  had not been permanently organized and trained to carry out this mission.  However, during operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, general purpose  forces have been tasked with training and advising the security forces of  those countries. Our prior work that was focused on U.S. efforts to advise  and assist Iraqi and Afghan security forces observed challenges related  to the way that ground forces were organized to conduct these missions.In light of the experience in Iraq and Afghanistan and in anticipation of the  growing role of security force assistance in U.S. strategy and future  operations, the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review identified the need to  strengthen and institutionalize capabilities within the general purpose  force to conduct security force assistance.", "The House Armed Services Committee report accompanying the Fiscal  Year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act bill (H.R. 1540) directed us  to report on the department\u2019s plans to institutionalize security force  assistance capabilities in the general purpose force. To address this requirement, this report evaluates (1) the extent to which DOD has  established its concept for conducting security force assistance, including  defining the term and identifying actions needed to plan for and prepare  forces to execute security force assistance; (2) the extent to which the  geographic combatant commands have taken steps to plan for and  conduct security force assistance, and what challenges, if any, they face;  and (3) what steps the services have taken to organize and train general  purpose forces to be capable of conducting security force assistance, and  what challenges, if any, they face.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed DOD and service strategic  guidance, policy, and doctrine related to security force assistance. We  also examined the roles and responsibilities for security force assistance  identified in DOD Instruction 5000.68 Security Force Assistance and the  tasks identified through DOD\u2019s security force assistance capabilities- based assessment. Further, we reviewed documentation related to  activities currently being conducted by the geographic combatant  commands to engage with partner nation security forces and evaluated  various military service efforts to organize and train forces capable of  meeting current requirements from the geographic combatant commands  to conduct such activities and address future requirements. Finally, we  met with officials throughout the department and its components,  including, but not limited to, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict; the Joint Staff; Defense  Security Cooperation Agency; military service headquarters, force  providers, and training organizations; U.S. Special Operations Command;  four of the six geographic combatant commands\u2014U.S. Africa Command,  U.S. Central Command, U.S. European Command, and U.S. Southern  Command\u2014and selected service component commands. In these  discussions we corroborated the information provided in the documents  above and discussed the commands\u2019 understanding of the security force  assistance concept and steps being taken to implement it, and the  development of relevant plans, requirements, and capabilities. We  focused on the department\u2019s efforts to plan for and conduct security force  assistance in areas of responsibility other than Afghanistan because  DOD\u2019s focus on security force assistance is more long term than current  operations in Afghanistan and the scope of the mission in that country  may not be typical of efforts worldwide. In addition, while we understand  the State Department is a critical stakeholder in U.S. security force  assistance efforts, our review focused solely on DOD efforts to plan for  and institutionalize security force assistance.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2011 to May 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Security cooperation is the broad term used to  define those activities taken by DOD to build relationships that promote  specified U.S. interests, build partner nation capabilities for self-defense  and coalition operations, and provide U.S. forces with peacetime and  contingency access. These activities are carried out under various  statutory authorities. For example, DOD may conduct activities with  partner nations, such as sending out military liaison teams, exchanging  military personnel between units, and conducting seminars and  conferences in theaters of operations under U.S. Code Title 10. DOD  also may conduct security cooperation activities through security  assistance programs, authorized by U.S. Code Title 22, which include  foreign military sales and foreign military financing programs, and allow  DOD to provide defense articles and services to partner nations in  support of U.S. national policies and objectives. These security  assistance programs are tools that can allow DOD to train and equip  partner nation security forces.

Historically, DOD has primarily relied on special operations  forces to train and advise partner nation security forces as part of their  foreign internal defense mission, which is to assist foreign governments in  protecting themselves from internal threats. More recently, the increased  demand on special operations forces in Iraq and Afghanistan has  required the department to use general purpose forces to advise and  assist the Iraqi and Afghan security forces. For example, in Iraq and  Afghanistan, DOD has used training and transition teams and augmented  brigade combat teams, respectively, to train, advise, equip, and mentor  those countries\u2019 security forces. As a result of its experiences in Iraq and  Afghanistan, its increasing emphasis on the importance of security force  assistance, and its intent to expand these types of efforts to other parts of  the globe, DOD has highlighted the need to further develop security force  assistance capabilities within its general purpose forces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Geographic Combatant Command Theater Campaign Plans Develop Strategies for Engaging with Partner Nations", "paragraphs": ["To perform its military missions around the world, DOD operates six  unified military geographic combatant commands, which are responsible  for a variety of functions including planning for and conducting missions  that range from humanitarian assistance to combat operations.

In addition, the military services are  responsible for organizing, training, and equipping their forces to execute  the current and future operational requirements of the combatant  commands.", "As part of their planning responsibilities, geographic combatant  commands develop theater campaign plans, which are multiyear plans  that reflect the command\u2019s strategy to achieve certain end states within  their areas of responsibility. These plans are the primary vehicle for designing, organizing, integrating, and executing security cooperation  activities. A hierarchy of national and strategic guidance\u2014including the  National Security Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, the National  Military Strategy, and the Guidance for Employment of the Force\u2014  informs the development of the combatant commands\u2019 theater campaign  plans. For example, the Guidance for Employment of the Force provides  2-year direction to geographic combatant commands on security  cooperation, among other things, and consolidates and integrates DOD  planning guidance related to operations and other military activities into a  single overarching document. This guidance is considered essential to  geographic combatant command planners as it provides the strategic end  states that form the basis for theater campaign plans, including the  assumptions and level of detail to be considered in developing those  plans. For example, the Guidance for Employment of the Force has eight  security cooperation focus areas, which include Operational Access and  Global Freedom of Action, Operational Capacity and Capability Building,  and Interoperability with U.S. Forces / Support to U.S. Capabilities. These  focus areas are designed to link geographic combatant command security  cooperation activities to achieve theater campaign plan end states. In  order to execute the activities in their theater campaign plans, geographic  combatant commands request the required force capabilities through the  Global Force Management system.

DOD documents characterize security force assistance  as a subset of security cooperation, but identify it as a distinct activity  from other types of security cooperation activities. The Lexicon  Framework states that the purposes of security force assistance are to  create, maintain, or enhance a capacity or capability to achieve a desired  end state. It distinguishes these purposes from other types of security  cooperation activities, such as activities conducted to gain access,  influence, or diplomatic or political action with a partner nation, but do not  enhance any capacity or capability. To further illustrate this distinction, an  OSD official said that the geographic combatant commands conduct  security cooperation activities, such as military-to-military engagements  and joint exercises, but these activities do not have the primary purpose  to build partner nation capacity and capability and thus are not considered  security force assistance. The Lexicon Framework states that the  effective execution of security force assistance requires geographic  combatant commands to develop objectives for the development of  partner nation security forces, articulate regional objectives, link  resources to overarching goals, and create operational roadmaps for  persistent cooperation. It further states that this comprehensive, global  approach to improving partner security capacity will require new and  innovative strategies and authorities that go beyond traditional security  cooperation applications.", "According to OSD, the emphasis on security force assistance in recent  guidance reflects an expectation that geographic combatant commands  will conduct increased security force assistance activities through  sustained and proactive plans focused on building partner nation capacity  and capability. For example, Security Force Assistance Working Group  officials said that as U.S. forces are drawn down in Afghanistan, the  demand for security force assistance outside of Afghanistan is expected  to increase over the next few years. The geographic combatant  commands are expected to identify and plan for security force assistance  based on the needs of the partner nations in their areas of responsibility  and forecast the forces needed to conduct planned activities.

Officials from several combatant commands said that they  develop their theater campaign plans and strategies based on the  Guidance for Employment of the Force and other strategic guidance and  that they would expect any emphasis requiring them to change how they  plan for and conduct activities to be reflected in that guidance. According  to OSD, strategic guidance documents are being reviewed to determine  whether they should be revised based on the January 2012 Defense  Strategic Guidance to reflect greater emphasis on security force  assistance.", "We recognize that the department has taken steps intended to increase  understanding of security force assistance, such as the issuance of the  Lexicon Framework in November 2011.

We  also recognize that the Lexicon Framework was issued recently.  However, some geographic combatant command and service officials  familiar with the framework said that they found some of the distinctions  within the document to be confusing and others cited the need for  additional guidance that provides greater clarity on what is required to  plan for and conduct security force assistance as OSD intends. Further,  officials from the Joint Center for International Security Force Assistance  said that, while they believe the Lexicon Framework is helpful to clarify  the relationship between security force assistance and other related  terms, joint doctrine on security force assistance is necessary to ensure  that all stakeholders understand security force assistance.

Beyond the challenges that commands face in distinguishing  between security force assistance activities and other types of activities,  we also found that the system into which they are instructed to track  security force assistance activities has limitations. For example, the  system does not contain a corresponding data field specifically for  security force assistance activities. There are several different versions of  the Theater Security Cooperation Management Information System  currently in use by the geographic combatant commands and service  component commands, including individual command legacy systems  and an interim system being used by multiple commands.

Joint Staff officials responsible for  the development of this system told us no plans currently exist to create  such a data field within the Global Theater Security Cooperation  Management Information System.

Security Force Assistance Working Group officials have suggested that a  security force assistance field should be added to the Global Theater  Security Cooperation Management Information System because tracking  and monitoring security force assistance activities is important to ensure  that the department is directing resources toward its strategic goal of  building partner capacity and capability. As the department continues to  develop and manage security force assistance as a stand-alone concept,  without a data field or other mechanism within the future Global Theater  Security Cooperation Management Information System to specify which  activities are security force assistance activities, and a consistent  approach to collecting data on these activities, OSD will lack visibility over  both security force assistance activities and the U.S. resources being  invested in building the capacity and capability of partner nations.", "Moreover, while the Theater Security Cooperation Management  Information System is intended to enable planning, tracking, and  forecasting security cooperation activities, eliminate potential overlap and  duplication of activities by different commands, and ensure that resources  are being directed towards priority countries, the different versions of the  system currently lack standard global business rules to guide how  information on activities should be entered. Thus, it is up to the  geographic combatant commands and services to develop their own set  of rules\u2014formal or informal\u2014governing how activities are entered into the  legacy and interim systems. Some commands enter all proposed  activities into the system, while another enters data less consistently thus  reducing the value of the system as a planning and forecasting tool. The  inconsistency of reporting in this system can result in an inefficient use of  resources. For instance, Navy officials told us of a recent example in  which an Air Force-sponsored medical engagement with a partner nation  was conducted in the same location as a similar Navy-sponsored medical  engagement, but the Air Force was unaware of this until it arrived on  location. The officials noted that, had the activities been identified and  forecasted in the system, the Air Force and Navy could have coordinated  and either chosen to redirect resources to another location or planned the  activities to build upon one another. As part of the process to update the  Global Theater Security Cooperation Management Information System,  Joint Staff officials recognize the need to have some level of  standardization in how activities are entered across the department so  that they have a complete and consistent picture of global activities, and  are in the process of developing global business rules to that effect,  expected to be completed by the end of fiscal year 2012."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Geographic Combatant Commands May Face Challenges in Developing and Executing Long-Term Security Force Assistance Plans within Existing Statutory Authorities", "paragraphs": ["Geographic combatant commands conduct security cooperation and  security assistance activities, which may include security force  assistance, through a variety of different statutory authorities within Title  10 (Armed Services) and Title 22 (Foreign Relations and Intercourse) of  the U.S. Code. For example, geographic combatant commands conduct  security cooperation activities including military-to-military engagements,  interoperability activities, and joint training exercises under traditional Title  10 authorities. DOD also can conduct activities involving interactions with  partner nation security forces through State Department-led Title 22  security assistance programs and authorities, which include, foreign  military sales, foreign military financing, international military training and  education, and peacekeeping operations. All of the geographic combatant  commands we spoke with told us that they used Title 22 programs such  as Foreign Military Assistance and International Military Education and   to provide training to partner nation forces. While the statutory  Trainingauthorities codified within Title 10 or Title 22 remain available unless  Congress repeals them, other authorities are temporary and must be  renewed periodically through legislation. For example, the annual  National Defense Authorization Acts can provide specific authorities that  allow the geographic combatant commands to conduct activities, such as  counternarcotics training with partner nations. Table 1 below shows  selected statutory authorities used by geographic combatant commands  to conduct security cooperation and security force assistance activities.", "These statutory authorities are specific in nature and some contain  limitations and restrictions on the types of activities that can be conducted  under these authorities. For example, the authorities codified within Title  10 do not authorize general purpose forces to conduct security force  assistance activities, such as training, advising, and assisting partner  nation security forces. Thus, geographic combatant commands rely on  statutory authorities beyond traditional Title 10 authorities, such as the  aforementioned specific authorities provided for in the National Defense  Authorization Acts or through Title 22 security assistance programs. For  example, both U.S. Central Command and U.S. Southern Command  stated that they used authority originally provided by section 1004 of the  Fiscal Year 1991 National Defense Authorization Act to conduct  counterdrug and counternarcotics training with militaries in their  respective regions. Further, all four of the geographic combatant  commands that we spoke to had at some point used authority originally  provided by section 1206 of the Fiscal Year 2006 National Defense  Authorization Act to train and equip partner nation forces. Like Title 10,  many of these National Defense Authorization Act authorities and Title 22  security assistance programs have limitations in how they can be used.  For example, section 1206 of the Fiscal Year 2006 National Defense  Authorization Act only allows for training and equipping programs that  build the capacity of foreign militaries to conduct counterterrorism  operations or participate in or support military and stability operations in  which U.S. forces participate.", "Once the geographic combatant commands\u2019 theater campaign plans are  approved by the Secretary of Defense, they must find separate  authorization for activities that they will conduct with partner nations.  Some geographic combatant command and service component  command officials said that they often have to cobble together multiple  authorities in order to carry out a single activity with partner nation forces  because of the specificity of the authorities. For example, officials from  one service component command stated that a single training event  targeted toward building the aviation capabilities of a partner nation  required 11 different authorities and funding streams.", "Some geographic combatant command officials noted that they may  require additional or revised authorities in order to plan for and conduct  increased and sustained security force assistance activities, such as  training and equipping partner nation forces, beyond their current level of  effort. According to an OSD official, current authorities generally allow for  more short-term relationships with partner nations, but planning for and  conducting security force assistance as the department envisions it  requires longer-term, sustained interaction. In that regard, this official  stated that the department has efforts underway to review the current  statutory authorities available to DOD to determine whether additional  authorities are needed and to potentially develop proposals to Congress.

The regionally-aligned forces will remain at  homestation and deploy only those elements of the unit that are  required to meet the specific geographic combatant command  requirements. The Army\u2019s initial regionally-aligned force will be a  brigade combat team that will be aligned to U.S. Africa Command  starting in January 2013, with additional forces expected to be aligned  to the other geographic combatant commands beginning in fiscal year  2014. Although the initial unit will be a brigade combat team, officials  said that future aligned forces could be smaller or larger units,  depending on geographic combatant command requirements and can  be augmented by specialized capabilities as needed. This initial  regionally-aligned brigade is to conduct approximately 120 activities  with partner nations within U.S. Africa Command\u2019s area of  responsibility over the course of a year. According to Army  headquarters officials, most of the 120 activities will be short-duration,  small-footprint activities, conducted by teams as small as three  people, while larger exercises with partner nations may be longer  duration events, conducted by battalion-sized units.", "The aligned brigade will receive training for the full spectrum of  operations, comprising offense, defense, and stability operations, as  well as tailored language, culture, and advising training for the specific  missions. The Army has identified language proficiency as a beneficial  skill but is still determining the level of language proficiency required  within its regionally-aligned forces. For the initial regionally-aligned  brigade, the Army plans to provide the majority of the brigade with  basic language training that would allow it to build rapport with partner  nation security forces, while smaller elements of the brigade are  intended to receive more specialized training in one of the five key  languages identified for Africa: Arabic, French, Swahili, Hausa, or  Portuguese. In addition, a small portion of the brigade may be sent  through a full culturally-based language training course provided by a  language training detachment at the unit\u2019s homestation. After the  initial regional alignment, the Army will assess the level of language  training that was provided to see whether it is sufficient or whether it  should be adjusted for future regionally-aligned forces.", "Once fully established, the Army\u2019s regionally-aligned forces are  expected to conduct most engagements with partner nation security  forces, but officials stated that the Army will still employ other options  as necessary to meet combatant command requirements. The Army  is projecting costs of approximately $1 million to establish the  aforementioned language training detachment. In addition, the Army  is estimating costs of about $100,000 for soldiers to travel to train with  the 162nd Infantry Brigade. Army headquarters officials told us that  the costs for force generation of the initial regionally-aligned brigade  are not expected to be substantially different than those for a standard  infantry brigade being trained for full-spectrum operations.", "The Marine Corps has organized several types of forces to meet  geographic combatant command requirements with deployed teams  ranging in size from one or two marines to larger task forces. For  example, the Marine Corps deploys tailored special-purpose marine- air-ground task forces on a rotational basis to different regions to  conduct activities with partner nation security forces. These task  forces are meant to build military capacity of partner nations, provide  regional stability, and develop lasting partnerships with nations in the  region. According to officials, the Marine Corps also has small teams,  such as 15-to-50-person security cooperation teams to conduct  military-to-military engagements, and 11-person coordination, liaison,  and assessment teams that have specific cultural knowledge of  regions and are available to help the Marine Corps component  commands with planning, coordination with partner nation forces, and  assessment of partner nation forces. In addition to these efforts, the  Marine Corps has been conducting a sustained effort with the country  of Georgia\u2019s military, called the Georgia Deployment Program, to train  and deploy Georgian battalions for full-spectrum operations in  Afghanistan.", "According to officials, the Navy builds partner nation capacity and  capability through a variety of ways using both its fleet and  expeditionary forces. For example, officials stated that personnel from  Navy ships regularly interact with partner nation security forces  through port visits and engagements with partner nation navies.", "Further, the Navy conducts ship-based rotational deployments,  referred to as Partnership Stations, which include activities with  partner nation security forces such as military-to-military  engagements, exercises, and training. In addition to naval personnel,  partnership stations also can include embarked marines or mobile  training teams from other services depending on the activities planned  by the respective geographic combatant commands. Moreover, the  Navy provides expeditionary capabilities through its Naval  Expeditionary Combat Command and Maritime Civil Affairs and  Security Training Command. Specifically, the Maritime Civil Affairs  and Security Training Command, budgeted in the Navy base budget  to cost approximately $41 million for fiscal year 2012, is organized to  provide tailored mobile training teams, referred to as Security Force  Assistance Detachments, to geographic combatant commands to  conduct training with partner nation navies across a range of topics  such as small boat operations, weapons training, and leadership and  professional development.", "The Air Force is standing up two mobility support advisory squadrons  with one to be aligned to U.S. Africa Command and the other to U.S.  Southern Command for the purposes of conducting capacity- and  capability-building activities with partner nations. Mobility support  advisory squadrons are expected to conduct activities in air mobility  processes, such as maintenance, air traffic control, and airfield  operations. All airmen assigned to the mobility support advisory  squadrons receive training that is tailored to the region to which the  squadron will be aligned. The mobility support advisory squadrons will  remain at homestation and deploy only elements of the unit for  specific activities as required to meet specific geographic combatant  command requirements. Officials from Air Force Mobility Command  stated that the approximate cost of standing up each squadron is just  over $2 million, which covers the organizing, training, and equipping  costs for the squadrons annually, but not the man-hours for the  personnel in the squadrons. In addition to the mobility support  advisory squadrons, the Air Force provides capabilities through  mobile training teams and Extended Training Service Specialist  teams, among others.", "As previously discussed, the department\u2019s emphasis on security force  assistance is indicative of its expectation that the geographic combatant  commands will conduct more security force assistance activities, such as  organizing, training, and advising partner nation security forces to build  their capacity and capability, and officials stated that they expect  requirements for forces capable of conducting security force assistance  activities outside of Afghanistan to increase in the future. The services\u2019  efforts to develop capabilities are based on the current requirements from  geographic combatant commands, but without greater clarity in regard to  future requirements, service officials stated that they are not able to  assess whether their current efforts to develop force capabilities in this  area are sufficient or whether additional capabilities may be required. For  example, an Army official stated that the initial regionally-aligned force will  provide the Army valuable information in regard to the sufficiency of the  force to meet geographic combatant command requirements, the  effectiveness of the training provided for the security force assistance  mission, and the level of language proficiency required, but that future  geographic combatant command requirements would influence the scope  of the Army\u2019s efforts to develop capabilities for this mission. Additionally,  Air Force officials said that the Air Force Campaign Support Plan is  intended to provide structure and guidance to Air Force theater planners  to support the development of future geographic combatant command  security cooperation requirements, including security force assistance,  which will then inform the Air Force\u2019s efforts to develop security force  assistance capabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Services Are Training Certain Personnel for Security Force Assistance, but Have Not Yet Fully Determined the Level of Training Required for All Security Force Assistance Activities", "paragraphs": ["DOD Instruction 5000.68 directs the services to establish training and  education requirements for personnel conducting security force  assistance activities and to develop service-specific training and  education proficiency standards for security force assistance capabilities.

The total cost for the Air Advisor Academy for fiscal year 2012  is expected to be approximately $6.4 million.", "The Navy provides its forces with language and culture training prior  to every deployment, but has not established specific advisor training.  According to Navy headquarters officials, because sailors typically  deploy on ships for extended periods of time, the service trains them  for a broad range of missions in accordance with the Fleet Readiness  Training Program and based on the requirements set forth by the  geographic combatant commands. As a result, Navy officials said that  they would need clear security force assistance requirements from the  geographic combatant commands to train forces to meet those  specific requirements. Unlike the other services, the Navy\u2019s method  for training depends less on training at schools and more on learning  required skills from superiors while on the job. Officials added that,  since sailors can train their subordinates, they can also deliver  subject-matter training to partner nation security forces, if necessary.  However, expeditionary personnel assigned to the Maritime Civil  Affairs and Security Training Command may receive training in  methods of instruction and in the course topics they will be teaching  while deployed.", "Further, DOD and service officials noted that theater security cooperation  planners\u2019 courses are available to personnel who may assist or be  responsible for the geographic combatant command and service  component command planning efforts. According to these officials, these  courses are intended to provide an understanding of security cooperation  planning, including some information related to security force assistance.  For example, Marine Corps officials told us that the Marine Corps offers  the Security Cooperation Planner\u2019s Course, which is a 1-week course that  provides students with basic knowledge regarding security cooperation  planning systems and operations, as well as the statutory authorities that  allow for activities with partner nation security forces. Over the past 2  years, officials said that this course has been offered to a variety of  organizations, including personnel from all of the military services, OSD,  the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, and State Department.  Additionally, according to Air Force officials, the Air Force has recently  established an online course intended to provide Air Force planners and  air advisors education and training in the areas of irregular warfare,  security cooperation, security force assistance, and theater campaign  planning, among other topics, and is developing a 1-week in-residence  course at the Air Advisor Academy, projected to begin in September  2012.", "However, while personnel complete predeployment training prior to  deploying on missions, and the services have established the various  training and education efforts discussed above, the services have not yet  fully determined what level of training should be provided for forces  deploying on an as-needed basis for shorter-term missions, such as for  mobile training teams or for teams of individuals formed and deployed to  conduct individual activities. The Air Force is in the process of developing  an instruction that identifies which airmen will get training from the Air  Advisor Academy and for which missions, and officials said that, at a  minimum, the instruction will likely direct that all security force assistance  missions will require some air advisor training. An Army headquarters  official stated that it is difficult to determine which missions should require  advisor training for the purposes of establishing an official requirement.  For example, regionally-aligned forces deploying for months at a time to  provide training to partner nation forces in Africa and a team of four  individuals from Army Training and Doctrine Command deploying to  conduct a 1-week classroom training could both potentially be considered  security force assistance, but training and mission requirements could be  significantly different, and it is unclear whether the latter would really  require training on advising, language, and culture skills. Moreover, the  Army has established security force assistance mission essential tasks  and incorporated them into their mission essential tasks for full-spectrum  operations. Similarly, the Marine Corps has published a security  cooperation training and readiness manual, which includes training tasks  required for personnel deploying on security cooperation missions,  including security force assistance.

We also met  with officials from the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special  Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict, Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Personnel and Readiness, the Joint Staff J-5 Strategic Plans  and Policy directorate, and Joint Staff J-7 Operational Plans and Force  Development directorate to discuss the security force assistance concept,  its definition, the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders identified in the  DOD Instruction and the Joint Staff Security Force Assistance Change  Recommendation Memorandum, and what other steps the department  has taken to implement the security force assistance concept. In addition,  we met with Joint Center for International Security Force Assistance and  U.S. Special Operations Command officials to discuss their  understanding of security force assistance and role in the department\u2019s  efforts to institutionalize the concept. Further, we examined the charter for  the Security Force Assistance Steering Committee and Working Group,  which the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations/Low- Intensity Conflict and Joint Staff J-5 cochair, to determine the group\u2019s  responsibilities to implement and oversee security force assistance efforts  throughout the department.", "To identify the extent to which the geographic combatant commands have  taken steps to plan for and conduct security force assistance, and what  challenges, if any, they face, we met with officials from U.S. Africa  Command, U.S. Central Command, U.S. European Command, and U.S.  Southern Command and selected military service component commands.  In these meetings, we discussed their understanding of the security force  assistance concept, their responsibilities as outlined in the DOD  Instruction, as well as their efforts to plan for, request forces for, and track  theater security cooperation activities. These commands were selected  and visited as a nonprobability sample of four of the six geographic  combatant commands. U.S. Africa Command and U.S. Southern  Command and their service component commands were selected  because the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) suggested them as  primary examples of geographic combatant commands conducting  security force assistance in a peacetime environment\u2014the expected  environment of future security force assistance efforts. The two other  commands\u2014U.S. Central Command and U.S. European Command and  their service component commands\u2014were selected because of  efficiencies gained by colocation to other site visits. We examined  relevant geographic combatant command and service component  command planning documentation, such as theater campaign plans and  strategy briefings related to theater security cooperation planning,  requirements, and activities being conducted in their respective areas of  responsibility. We further met with geographic combatant command and  Joint Staff J-5 Strategic Plans and Policy officials regarding the Theater  Security Cooperation Management Information System to discuss how  the system is intended to be used, and reviewed documentation related to  its development. Finally, we reviewed relevant statutory authorities and  Defense Security Cooperation Agency and geographic combatant  command guidance documents outlining available statutory authorities to  determine the authorities and funding available for the execution of  security force assistance, and discussed these authorities and related  challenges with geographic combatant command and service component  command officials.", "To identify what steps the services have taken to organize and train  general purpose forces to be capable of conducting security force  assistance, and what challenges, if any, they face, we met with officials  from the U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, and U.S. Air Force  who were responsible for implementing security force assistance within  each service, including officials from each service\u2019s headquarters, force  providers and training commands, and other service organizations related  to security force assistance. We examined relevant service-level  documentation, which included doctrine, policy and guidance, briefings,  and white papers related to security force assistance. We also discussed  with each service their efforts to implement the security force assistance  concept, their understanding of the concept, service capabilities being  developed, and any potential cost factors related to security force  assistance. To understand how the services are organizing for security  force assistance and what capabilities are being provided, we met with  officials from the service headquarters and service force providers,  including U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Marine Forces Command,  U.S. Fleet Forces Command, U.S. Air Force Combat Command, and U.S.", "Air Force Mobility Command. To understand the training and education  that is being provided to service personnel who conduct security force  assistance missions, we met with officials about service-level training and  education from the U.S. Army 162nd Infantry Brigade, U.S. Marine Corps  Security Cooperation Group, and the U.S. Air Force Air Advisor Academy,  and discussed joint training standards with U.S. Special Operations  Command. In addition, we met with service officials to discuss each  service\u2019s efforts to track uniformed military personnel with security force  assistance-related skills, training, or experience. We also met with the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness to  discuss DOD efforts to establish policy and guidance for tracking  uniformed military personnel with security force assistance skills, training,  and experience departmentwide.", "We interviewed the following organizations during our review:", "Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special  Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict, Arlington, Va.", "Office of the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for Personnel and  Readiness, Arlington, Va.", "Office of Secretary of Defense Cost Assessment and Program  Evaluation, Arlington, Va.", "Security Cooperation Reform Task Force, Arlington, Va.", "Joint Staff, Operations (J-3), Arlington, Va.
