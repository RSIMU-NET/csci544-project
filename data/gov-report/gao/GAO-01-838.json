The other communities experienced rolling layoffs or a series of smaller plant closures that dislocated as many or more workers but did so gradually. Experiences in the communities GAO visited indicate that Temporary Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and NAFTA-TAA assistance to dislocated workers, although substantial, could be implemented more effectively. Program administrators and training providers in each community said that the programs have structural problems that impede effective service delivery. One factor that influenced the implementation of training benefits in many communities is that a significant percentage of dislocated workers needed to earn a high school equivalency degree or take remedial courses before they could even start a training program. Case study communities' experience with economic adjustment showed that the assistance available to them was limited and that there are no easy answers to community recovery, even when funds are available. These communities had relied on low-skilled manufacturing jobs, which are disappearing, and now face the difficult task of diversifying their economies while addressing fundamental human capital issues. These communities' experiences with efforts to assist dislocated workers and adjust to changing economic conditions offer several lessons. Program administrators and training providers said that bureaucratic rigidities in dislocated workers programs limited their flexibility in addressing dislocated workers' diverse training needs. Also, local officials believe that dislocated worker training programs are more effective and job placements much higher when strong links exist between training and local business needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The rapid pace of economic change due to the globalization of national economies has heightened concerns about the efficacy of federal trade adjustment assistance. While the transition to the \u201cnew economy\u201d has meant an increase in technology and service sector jobs, it has also resulted in the loss of many manufacturing jobs as companies that cannot compete with lower-priced imports close or relocate to lower-wage countries abroad. The federal government recognizes that while the benefits of free trade are widely dispersed across the economy, the costs of worker dislocation effects are more localized. Accordingly, federal trade adjustment assistance programs are designed to target aid to dislocated workers through the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and North American Free Trade Agreement Transitional Adjustment Assistance (NAFTA-TAA) programs. There are also assistance programs to mitigate the adverse impacts of trade for businesses, the Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms program, and for communities, the Community Adjustment and Investment Program. At the Committee\u2019s request, we completed evaluations of these programs in 2000.", "As you requested, this review builds on our previous work by providing distressed communities\u2019 perspectives on how trade adjustment assistance and other assistance programs have helped them deal with the adverse impacts of trade. We conducted case studies in six trade-impacted communities where we examined (1) the impact of trade-related layoffs on these communities, (2) the experiences of these communities with trade- related dislocated worker assistance, (3) their experiences with trade- related economic adjustment and other assistance, and (4) the lessons learned from these communities\u2019 experiences.", "Between January and March 2001, we conducted case studies in Watsonville, Calif.; Coushatta, La.; Owosso, Mich.; Washington and Chocowinity, N.C.; El Paso, Tex.; and Martinsville and Henry County, Va. We chose these locations using a number of criteria designed to identify communities particularly hard hit by trade-related layoffs, including the numbers of workers certified for federal adjustment assistance between 1995 and 1999, local unemployment rates, and diversity of industry and geographic location. The communities we selected based on these criteria thus likely represent more difficult cases than typical communities that have experienced trade-related job losses. We visited each selected community and interviewed local government officials, community leaders, training providers, and workers receiving benefits from trade adjustment assistance programs. We also met with federal and state officials that administer trade adjustment assistance programs for workers and economic assistance programs for communities, and analyzed the data available on these programs.

The current TAA program was created by the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (P.L. 87-794). It was substantially modified by the Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618) and the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993 (P.L. 103- 182). The TAA program covers workers who lose their jobs because of imports from any country, while the NAFTA-TAA program covers only workers who have lost their jobs because of increased imports from or shift of production to Mexico or Canada. These programs provide benefits such as trade readjustment allowances (extended income support beyond normal unemployment insurance benefits), services such as job training, and allowances for job search and relocation. The Department of Labor administers both programs and makes determinations regarding worker group eligibility. Groups of workers or their representatives can petition the Department of Labor for certification of eligibility to apply for services or benefits under the program. The Department then conducts an investigation to determine if increased imports or a shift in production to Canada or Mexico have contributed to their loss of employment. Once a TAA or NAFTA-TAA petition is approved covered workers must meet several tests regarding the timing of their layoff and their length of employment with the trade-impacted firm. Workers can be certified as eligible for both programs but can claim benefits from only one. The states play a major role by providing program services and benefits, such as job training and reemployment services. The TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs together received about $407 million in fiscal year 2001 funding.", "Generally, TAA and NAFTA-TAA income assistance for a dislocated worker is equal to the weekly benefits of the state\u2019s unemployment insurance program and may be paid for up to 52 weeks after the initial 26 weeks (30 weeks in Massachusetts and Washington State) of unemployment insurance benefits have been exhausted. Thus, eligible dislocated workers may receive up to 78 weeks (18 months) of cash payments if enrolled in approved training.  Dislocated workers also are eligible for up to 104 weeks (2 years) of training. Therefore, workers do not necessarily receive income assistance during their entire period of training.", "The process by which workers receive assistance is often triggered when a company gives 60 days\u2019 notice of plant closure or layoffs. Generally, a state Rapid Response Team, comprised of employment service officials, meets with plant managers to obtain information about the prospective layoff or closure and the profile of the affected workers. If appropriate, the Rapid Response Team will suggest that the company apply for TAA or NAFTA- TAA certification, so that workers can receive these benefits after separation. The Rapid Response Team generally returns to the plant after the layoff or closure announcement to give workers information about available services. In some states, training providers may join the team. After separation, the dislocated workers can receive job placement assistance, and if suitable employment is not found, they can enroll in training. TAA and NAFTA-TAA provide extended income support and pay for training, within certain time limits and restrictions.

The TAA program for firms, established in 1962 and administered by the Department of Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration (EDA), provides assistance to firms that can demonstrate that increases in imports have contributed importantly to layoffs and declines in sales or production. The TAA for firms program was funded for $10.5 million in fiscal year 2000. The Community Adjustment and Investment Program was established as a result of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. Under the program, loan guarantees, loans, and grants are provided to businesses and grantees in eligible counties to help stimulate private sector employment and growth. An interagency committee chaired by the Department of the Treasury administers this program. Loan guarantees to local businesses have accounted for the preponderance of financing commitments to date.

The firms that these communities lost represent a cross section of the types of industries that have been affected by increased trade, as shown in figure 2.", "Although many layoffs in these communities occurred gradually as companies downsized to remain competitive with offshore producers, each community experienced at least one major plant closure that had an immediate impact on the local workforce and economy. For example, Tultex, an apparel manufacturer and one of the largest employers in Martinsville, Va., declared bankruptcy in December 1999 without prior notice and immediately closed all operations, leaving more than 2,000 workers without jobs. Likewise, in December 1996, Coushatta, La., lost 500 jobs when the Sunbeam small appliance plant, the city\u2019s only manufacturing concern, closed as part of a corporate restructuring that moved many production operations offshore. Table 1 shows the total number of workers certified under the TAA program when threatened by job loss in these communities, as well as the numbers certified in major layoffs.", "Trade-related plant closures and mass layoffs had serious economic impacts on these communities. In the short term, their unemployment rates rose dramatically. For example, as a result of the Tultex closure in Martinsville, the city\u2019s unemployment rate went from about 9 percent to almost 20 percent in 1999. Similarly, in Coushatta, the closing of the Sunbeam manufacturing plant in 1996 caused the city\u2019s unemployment rate to rise to almost 24 percent in 1997. Where the layoffs were particularly severe, the communities were not prepared to deal with the workers\u2019 immediate needs, and local social service agencies were overwhelmed with requests for assistance. In Martinsville, many displaced Tultex workers were not eligible for assistance, such as food stamps, because they owned vehicles and other assets and could not meet requirements for assistance. These workers, who had also lost medical coverage as a result of the Tultex bankruptcy, were forced to find employment or seek assistance from charitable organizations such as the Salvation Army.", "Plant closures and layoffs also impacted local government revenues and hurt local businesses. Government officials in some communities said that they lost significant business tax revenues when companies abandoned their plants. For example, according to Martinsville officials, as a result of its bankruptcy, Tultex defaulted on more than $1 million in property taxes owed in 1999, and the city will continue to lose tax revenue from the property. In addition, Martinsville was forced to raise water and sewer service rates to compensate for the $1.4 million Tultex had paid annually for these services. The loss of income suffered by displaced workers also affected local businesses. Coushatta officials said that Sunbeam\u2019s $10 million annual payroll represented about one-fifth of Red River Parish\u2019s gross income. Such losses of income had a negative impact on retail sales in trade-impacted communities. Businesses that supplied or subcontracted for plants that closed also felt the impact. For example, in Martinsville, a plant that generated steam for the Tultex factory was forced to close after Tultex went bankrupt.", "Many dislocated workers found new jobs in their area, but most were paid lower wages, according to community officials. In Owosso, Mich., community officials said that many workers who lost their jobs in the trade-impacted automobile accessory industry eventually found lower- paying service sector jobs. In Washington, N.C., some workers who were displaced when Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex, Inc. moved its small appliance operation to Mexico found work in the local furniture-making industry, but at significantly lower wages. Similarly, in Coushatta, many former Sunbeam workers who were hired at a nearby compressor plant that had recently opened were paid less. In El Paso, the city had been successful in attracting some new manufacturing businesses, but many displaced apparel workers were not qualified for the jobs and either found employment in the service sector or remained unemployed. Based on available but incomplete Department of Labor data, nationally only 61.5 percent of dislocated workers who responded and entered new employment reported that their new jobs paid at least 80 percent of their old job\u2019s wages.", "Some communities feared that the loss of relatively well-paying, but low- skilled jobs could lead to a decline in the standard of living for a large segment of the population. Food processing jobs in Watsonville, California, and apparel manufacturing jobs in El Paso, Texas, have been considered a means of upward mobility for recent immigrants with limited English skills. Workers who had these jobs were paid union-scale wages and received fringe benefits, which provided an opportunity to buy homes and send their children to college. Officials in Watsonville and Washington said that, until recently, young people could count on a factory job after high school where they might stay for most or all of their working lives. However, workers who have lost manufacturing jobs in these communities have limited prospects for obtaining new jobs with similar wages and benefits, since the jobs now available require higher skills or more education, according to community officials.", "Communities we visited were also concerned about the threat of additional trade-related layoffs and plant closures. Washington and Martinsville community leaders said that they expect their textile and apparel industries to continue to decline because of increased foreign competition. Martinsville leaders also fear that the furniture industry, another large employer in their community, will begin to feel the impact of increased furniture imports. Watsonville leaders also expected that the city would continue to lose food processing jobs as more companies shift operations to Mexico."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assistance to Dislocated Workers Can Be Substantial, but Structural Problems Impede Service Delivery", "paragraphs": ["The communities we visited had experienced serious adverse impacts from trade-related layoffs.

TAA and NAFTA-TAA are widely available and can provide substantial assistance to trade-impacted dislocated workers through extended income support and training benefits. However, local program administrators told us that these programs have structural problems that hinder the effective delivery of services. The states also varied in how they implemented training benefits. Furthermore, it is difficult to evaluate the efficacy of the varied training or job placement approaches used across communities or states, because Labor\u2019s outcome data for these programs are incomplete."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most TAA and NAFTA-TAA Assistance Was Income Support", "paragraphs": ["The trade adjustment assistance that our case study communities received primarily came through the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs for trade- impacted dislocated workers. These are entitlement programs, available to dislocated workers whose eligibility had been certified by Labor.  TAA and NAFTA-TAA provide substantial assistance, primarily by supplying extended income support after unemployment insurance is exhausted, as well as training benefits.", "TAA and NAFTA-TAA program data show that the largest benefit delivered to displaced workers was in the form of extended income support, primarily for partial wage replacement while in training. As shown in table 2, the two programs paid a total of just over $66 million in income support to individuals in these communities over 6 years. Of this amount, almost $44 million was for \u201cbasic\u201d allowances, or payments made in the 26 weeks after unemployment benefits are exhausted. About $22 million was for \u201cadditional\u201d allowances made after basic allowances are exhausted, if the dislocated worker is in training or has a training waiver. Thus about 78 percent of TAA and NAFTA-TAA assistance that went to workers in the case study communities was used for income support. In these communities, training courses, which can last up to 104 weeks, cost $19 million over the 6-year period, which was about 22 percent of total funding. Forty-four percent of all program recipients in these communities enrolled in training. Total payments for income support and training was $85 million. Among the communities, El Paso had by far the highest number of recipients\u20148,581\u2014and the highest total payments\u2014at almost $70 million.

Although there are mixed views and little data on the outcomes associated with shorter and longer training programs, as discussed below, the gap in income support is believed to create difficulties for workers in 2-year training programs because when income support payments stop, dislocated workers generally drop out of training because they cannot afford to remain in classes without financial assistance.", "The local administrator for the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs in Washington, N.C., said that he and his staff advised workers to enroll in a course of study that would take no more than 18 months to complete, unless they had other sources of income. Dislocated workers we spoke with, most of whom were currently enrolled in training, frequently referred to workers who had to drop out of training due to financial constraints. Family responsibilities and the need to make mortgage or car loan payments had made it impossible for them to subsist without income support. Some workers we interviewed said they could afford to continue because they had a spouse who was working, but others said that they chose training that lasted 18 months or less. This choice precluded them from pursuing a 2-year Associate of Arts degree program, which could result in higher earnings or better skills, or any 2-year course of study involving initial remedial courses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Problems Lead to Training Delays", "paragraphs": ["Another problem cited by local program administrators with program structure was the lack of a stable funding stream for training benefits. Although training is a key part of a worker\u2019s benefits, some states had difficulties providing consistent funding for training due to budgetary problems in the Department of Labor. The amount of funding the Department of Labor can provide is governed by legislatively set caps on training funds, with an annual limit of $80 million for TAA and $30 million for NAFTA-TAA.  According to the Trade Act Coordinator in North Carolina, funding the trade programs has been an \u201cadministrative nightmare\u201d and that state funds frequently must be used. Generally, federal funding is provided to states quarterly and is based on prior expenditures. Because TAA and NAFTA-TAA certifications fluctuate, in some cases, states may not have received sufficient funding to cover workers enrolled during a quarter. In addition, state and local officials reported that insufficient federal funds are available for the programs toward the end of the fiscal year (Department of Labor officials said these problems primarily occur in the first and last quarters of the fiscal year). High levels of certifications from unanticipated layoffs and plant closures have resulted in states\u2014Texas and North Carolina, for example\u2014with large numbers of workers enrolled in training at the same time that program officials were informed that no additional federal funds remained. As we noted in our recent report, although Labor has issued formal guidance that states should not stop enrolling workers in program services and benefits when funding is temporarily unavailable, agency officials report that few states have done so.", "In some cases, when federal training funds are depleted, states use Workforce Investment Act(WIA) or other state monies. According to officials from case study communities, dislocated workers were frequently enrolled in training under WIA and then shifted to TAA or NAFTA-TAA after Labor approved their petitions and certified them as eligible for benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Difficulties Stemming From Maintaining Separate Trade Programs", "paragraphs": ["A basic structural problem exists from maintaining separate TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs, resulting in inefficiency, problems in administration, and confusion, according to state program administrators and program participants. Officials in every state administrative office and case study community we visited stated that the certification and training enrollment procedures of the two programs are different. They claimed this hinders effective program administration\u2014particularly because many workers are certified for benefits under both programs and must select one under which to take benefits. Officials said standardized requirements would make the program easier to administer. This reaffirms what state administrators from the 20 states with the largest TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs told us in 2000. Maintaining two separate trade programs, with differing timeframes and provisions for training waivers (available under TAA but not NAFTA-TAA) is confusing to both program administrators and dislocated workers. Dislocated workers in El Paso and Owosso stated that the explanations about the differences that were provided by program officials before they had to choose between programs were inadequate and did not sufficiently clarify their questions. Officials in every state administrative office and case study community we visited thus consistently supported the consolidation of the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs. These officials believed that consolidation would simplify program administration and rules and would be more efficient. The Department of Labor agreed with this position in its letter of October 5, 2000, commenting on our evaluation of these programs, stating that it supported measures to harmonize the requirements of the two programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Program Requirements Hinder Delivery of Benefits and Services", "paragraphs": ["Other program requirements can also impede dislocated workers from successfully completing training, according to state program administrators and program participants. For example, to obtain income support assistance, the NAFTA-TAA program generally requires that the dislocated worker enroll in training by the last day of the 16th week following their layoff or by the last day of the 6th week after publication of the certification, whichever is later. State program administrators said this requirement can limit training options for workers seeking to study at community colleges because training courses may be semester-based and not begin within the enrollment deadline. As a result, according to program administrators, workers must sometimes enroll in less suitable courses to retain their eligibility for income support. The TAA and NAFTA- TAA programs also prohibit dislocated workers from receiving income support if there is a break in training exceeding 14 days. Program administrators we interviewed explained that community colleges generally have semester breaks lasting longer than 14 days, which means that dislocated workers cannot receive any financial assistance during that period.", "Other factors complicating service and benefit delivery include certification delays at the Department of Labor and federal paperwork requirements. As noted in our recent report, Department of Labor delays in certifying TAA and NAFTA-TAA petitions or state program administrative office delays in approving workers\u2019 training plans can limit workers\u2019 options. Dislocated workers we interviewed in El Paso said that acquiring approval for their training plans had taken months. Training providers in North Carolina and Texas told us federal administrative and paperwork requirements were cumbersome, rigid, and highly bureaucratic. In North Carolina, the Trade Act Coordinator at the state Employment Security Commission must approve any request for a dislocated worker to change a community college class. Department of Labor officials said that nearly all states have centralized approval of workers\u2019 training plans because local officials have less experience with TAA and NAFTA-TAA regulations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Communities Face Significant Challenges in Improving Dislocated Workers\u2019 Skills", "paragraphs": ["A number of challenges influenced implementation of TAA and NAFTA- TAA training benefits in our case study communities. One issue is related to the profile of the dislocated workers, a significant percentage of whom were in their 40\u2019s, had not finished high school, and needed remedial courses before they could start a degree or certificate program. Many in El Paso, Tex., and Watsonville, Calif., also had limited English proficiency. Given this dislocated worker profile, there was a debate in most communities about whether workers should enroll in 2-year degree programs or take shorter certificate programs and return to the workforce as quickly as possible.

The Department\u2019s data on these programs suggest that, nationwide, almost two-thirds of the participants were women, with an average age of 43, and generally low levels of education. Twenty-five percent had less than a high school education when laid off. According to available data and discussions with program administrators in El Paso and Watsonville, many program participants in their communities also had limited English proficiency. Officials in these two communities told us that the majority of these workers were Hispanic, spoke little or no English, and many had not gone much further than elementary or middle school. In Owosso, Mich., most dislocated workers were high school graduates. However, in Coushatta, La.; Washington and Chocowinity, N.C.; and Martinsville, Va., significant numbers of the dislocated workers had not finished high school, according to local officials.", "Many dislocated workers had been with their employers for a considerable number of years. We interviewed some dislocated workers in El Paso who had worked for Levi-Strauss\u2014one for almost 30 years. Similarly, many workers at the Sunbeam plant in Coushatta and the Hamilton Beach/Proctor-Silex, Inc., plant in Washington had worked there for more than 20 years when they were laid off. Program officials and training providers stated that these dislocated workers generally had an excellent work ethic and wanted to reenter the workforce as quickly as possible. However, many did not have a high school diploma or a General Equivalency Degree (GED), and few businesses would hire them without one or the other. Thus, many dislocated workers needed GED classes and sometimes English as a Second Language classes before entering occupational training and obtaining a job.", "As a result of these factors, moving these workers further on the educational or job skill continuum is a challenge. Moreover, considering that the participants who did complete high school may have been in the workforce for 2 decades, it is difficult for them to reenter the educational system.

In El Paso, the County Judge and the director of a community-based training advocacy group told us that they believe the central problem facing these workers was underemployment and that training should ensure that dislocated workers have basic language skills and a 2-year degree so that they can get a better job with a living wage. They saw training as a way to help dislocated workers climb the employment ladder, rather than ending up in another low-skilled, low-wage job with little hope of advancement. The training advocacy group official said training should be viewed as an investment that would provide a good return to the local economy.", "Others pointed out that many dislocated workers need remedial courses to earn a GED, and in some cases they also need courses to gain proficiency in English, which would take up most, if not all, the allotted training time. They also pointed out that most dislocated workers need to complete training in 18 months, rather than the 24 months allowable, because income support ends at 18 months. They stated that it was important to ensure that dislocated workers could complete their training program and that shorter programs resulting in certification, such as those for certified nursing assistants or truck drivers, were more practical. Finally, an instructor we interviewed at El Paso Community College said it was best to take a flexible approach in meeting workers\u2019 needs. Some workers could manage a 2-year degree program, but most needed a realistic assessment of what they could accomplish in 18 or 24 months. For most, she believed a shorter certificate course was the best option.", "Program data suggest that most dislocated workers in these communities are taking shorter training courses. While 11,945 workers enrolled in training during fiscal years 1995 through 2000, only 3,536 workers (30 percent) received additional allowances, which provide income support during the 12 to 18 months of program participation.  (See table 2.) According to program administrators and training providers, workers generally do not continue training after income support benefits have stopped.", "Determining how well various training alternatives assist dislocated workers is difficult, due to the lack of outcome data on wages and reemployment. Although the Labor Department instituted a system to measure performance in fiscal year 1999, the level of responses from workers who have left the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs has been low.

According to Texas Workforce Commission data, from January 1994 to February 2001, a total of 17,069 workers in El Paso were certified by the Labor Department for the TAA or NAFTA-TAA programs, with the majority of these jobs in the apparel and textile industry.

Community leaders working at economic adjustment efforts had a harder time drawing lessons from their experiences and have faced difficult choices and found few off-the-shelf answers. One of the fundamental challenges facing trade-impacted communities is helping dislocated workers\u2014generally older workers with a high school degree or less\u2014adjust to an increasingly globalized economy that requires different skills than were needed when these individuals entered the workforce. Trade adjustment assistance program administrators and training providers in the communities said that program rules regarding income support benefits limit their flexibility in addressing dislocated workers\u2019 training needs. Although administrators believed that limiting income support to 18 months presented financial hardships that discouraged workers from completing 2-year training programs, available data indicate that most workers leave training after 1 year. However, even if these programs were more flexible, these relatively short-term training programs may not bridge the gap between these workers\u2019 current skills and the skills they need to enter the new economy workforce. Our discussions with training providers and workers indicated that enormous sacrifices are necessary for dislocated workers \u2014 many of whom have been out of school for 20 years or more \u2014 to be successful in an educational system that has become significantly more challenging while maintaining family and other responsibilities.", "Still, additional funding does not mean that these challenges are easily addressed, as indicated by El Paso\u2019s experience with a $45 million supplemental grant from the Department of Labor.

According to community leaders, supplemental grant funds were used to place many workers in training programs that had not been evaluated. Further, insufficient bilingual training designed for adults was available. With no clear sense that training would improve their job prospects, some workers stayed in training to continue receiving income support benefits. Eventually, grant managers began offering workers monetary incentives to leave training and take available low- skilled jobs.", "One of the lessons that emerged from our discussions is the central role of education and training, which included training to provide basic language skills to laid off workers, strengthening the links between business and educational institutions, or emphasizing education for the next generation of workers. In Martinsville, the local planning authority, in conjunction with businesses, has contracted for a workforce survey that will identify the human capital needed to attract and retain businesses.

The council has financed these projects through a $350,000 grant it received from the Department of Housing and Urban Development.", "Martinsville and Henry County have seen a net increase in jobs in recent years, according to the Economic Development District, but local officials are quick to point out that many new jobs are low skilled and low wage. Since 1993, Martinsville and Henry County have lost 6,364 jobs, mostly in the textile and furniture industries.  During the same period, 7,043 new jobs were announced for a net gain of 679."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Finance asked us to follow up on our prior evaluations of federal trade adjustment assistance programs with case studies focused on the experiences of trade-impacted communities. Specifically, we examined (1) the impact of trade-related layoffs on these communities, (2) the experiences of these communities with dislocated worker assistance, (3) their experiences with economic adjustment assistance, and (4) the lessons learned from these communities\u2019 experiences.", "To address all of these objectives, we conducted case studies in six communities. Between January and March 2001, we visited Watsonville, California; Coushatta, Louisiana; Owosso, Michigan; Washington and Chocowinity, North Carolina; El Paso, Texas; and Martinsville and Henry County, Virginia. We chose these locations on the basis of criteria designed to identify communities hardest hit by trade-related layoffs. First, we identified the total number of workers certified for trade adjustment assistance for fiscal years 1994 to 1999. We then analyzed the top industry sectors and divided cases by community, state, economic sector, and number of certified workers from fiscal years 1994 to 1999. We then added the number of workers certified across communities for these fiscal years; this yielded a list of about 300 communities that had more than 500 workers certified to receive TAA benefits. Next, we obtained 1999 population data for these communities from the Bureau of the Census Web site and calculated the percentage of individuals potentially affected by trade-related layoffs. Then by considering this factor, as well as region, industry sector, and presence of federal program activity such as CAIP, we pared the list to 48 communities. After that, we obtained city and county unemployment data for fiscal years 1994 to 1999 and October 2000 from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site in order to determine whether the trade-related layoffs had influenced local unemployment levels and the current local unemployment level. We then ranked the communities on three dimensions: (1) the current unemployment rate, (2) the percentage of the local population that was covered by a Department of Labor certification, and (3) the communities with the biggest change in their peak unemployment rate following a trade-related layoff from 1994 to the present. We called state and local officials to verify the nature and extent of trade-related job losses in these communities and the types of assistance that had been used, that is, training, community assistance, or grants provided by Commerce\u2019s Economic Development Administration, CAIP, and the Department of Labor. We dropped one community from our list because their employer had recalled the trade-certified workers.", "When we visited each community, we interviewed local government officials; community leaders; training providers; and, if available, workers receiving benefits from trade adjustment assistance programs. During our visit to Watsonville, we also interviewed Department of Agriculture field officials regarding Agriculture\u2019s economic assistance in the area. We also obtained in each of these communities, if available, information on worker training programs, economic planning documents, and documentation regarding state and federal economic assistance.", "To further address the first three objectives, we met with federal and state officials who administer trade adjustment assistance programs for workers and economic assistance programs for communities and reviewed reports on worker and economic adjustment assistance. In Washington, D.C., we met with officials from several agencies, including the Department of Labor, which administers the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs; the Department of the Treasury, which is the lead agency administering CAIP; and the Economic Development Administration, which administers the Trade Adjustment Assistance program for firms and provides economic assistance to distressed communities. We also discussed economic adjustment efforts in communities affected by military base closures with staff from the Office of Economic Adjustment in the Department of Defense to determine lessons learned that could be applied to our case study communities. In addition, we met with the Director of CAIP\u2019s Los Angeles office to discuss CAIP assistance to potential case study sites. We also interviewed a number of state officials to discuss their administration of the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs, as well as the state economic assistance available to case study communities. We reviewed our prior reports on trade adjustment assistance to workers and economic assistance to communities, as well as reports by other organizations on the impact of trade on workers and communities.", "In addressing the first three objectives, we also obtained and analyzed data from several sources. For the first objective on the impact of trade-related layoffs on the case study communities, we first obtained and analyzed Department of Labor data on the number of workers certified for TAA benefits in the six communities from 1995 through 2000. These data only represents workers potentially displaced for trade-related reasons, not actual jobs lost. However, it is the best indicator available on the potential effect of trade on workers. As an indicator of the impact of trade-related layoffs on the communities, we examined Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment data for the periods before and after trade-related layoffs in the communities. For the second objective on the experiences of the case study communities with dislocated worker assistance, we obtained and analyzed information from two other Department of Labor databases. To determine the number of recipients and costs of trade readjustment allowance payments and training under TAA and NAFTA-TAA in the six communities, we obtained and analyzed Department of Labor data on services provided to participants under the programs for fiscal years 1995 to 2000. We also obtained participant outcome data for the six communities and nationwide collected by Labor for 1999 and 2000 and analyzed it, focusing on demographic characteristics, wages, training, and reemployment. For the third objective on the communities\u2019 experiences with economic adjustment assistance, we obtained and analyzed information from EDA, the Department of Agriculture, and Department of Housing and Urban Development on the amount and types of assistance that the agencies provided to each community. We did the same with information from the Treasury on CAIP assistance to the communities.", "We conducted our work from November 2000 through June 2001 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments From the Department of Commerce", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Commerce\u2019s      letter dated August 17, 2001."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1.
