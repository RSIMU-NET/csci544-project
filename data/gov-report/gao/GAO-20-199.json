In addition, the office did not document project cybersecurity risks, such as the office's reliance on external parties to implement responsibilities on its behalf. These weaknesses were due, in part, to a lack of policies and procedures for IT project planning.

For example, important security controls needed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system were not fully tested before the system was deployed. In addition, penetration testing\u2014where evaluators mimic real-world attacks in an attempt to identify ways to circumvent the security features of the system\u2014was not fully completed before deployment. GAO plans to issue a separate report with limited distribution on its assessment of security controls intended to, among other things, prevent successful attacks.", "Although OCWR's strategic plan includes a goal of developing cybersecurity policies and procedures, the office had not fully established an effective approach for managing organization-wide cybersecurity risk.

OCWR  communicated certain security and privacy requirements to its  external partners for these two systems. For example, the  office\u2019s agreements with the Library for SOCRATES stated  that the system will be secured in accordance with NIST  security guidelines, including Special Publication 800-37,  and the Library\u2019s security policy guidelines.", "However, OCWR did not always include language in  agreements in sufficient detail to ensure that requirements  were communicated effectively. For example, the office did not  always provide sufficient language to communicate privacy  requirements related to the protection of personally identifiable  information within its SOCRATES or FMA agreements.  Further, OCWR\u2019s agreements\u2014related to FMA\u2014expired  during our review and contained references to retired Library  guidelines that are no longer applicable or enforceable with  regard to OCWR\u2019s external contractor.", "Select and document security and privacy controls. OCWR  worked with the Library to select and document about 300  security and privacy controls and control enhancements for  SOCRATES within a system security plan. Further, the office  worked with the Library to support the selection of controls by  documenting privacy risks and impacts to SOCRATES within a  privacy impact assessment\u2014as called for by NIST to assess  the privacy risks associated with collecting and using personal  information\u2014that was referred to in the system security plan.", "However, OCWR did not adequately oversee the selection and  documentation of security and privacy controls in the system  security plan that was used to plan and conduct initial control  assessments for SOCRATES. In particular, the office did not  always ensure that the system security plan for SOCRATES  provided an appropriate description of controls to be  implemented to meet the security and privacy requirements.  For example, in certain instances, the system security plan  described SOCRATES as a low-impact system when  describing the security controls used to protect the system.  These descriptions differed though from its actual classification  as a moderate-impact system, as documented within an  interagency agreement between OCWR and the Library. As  another example, the system security plan for SOCRATES  incorrectly described a security control related to the  maintenance of SOCRATES as not applicable to moderate- impact systems. However, NIST\u2019s classification of this control  describes it as applicable to moderate-impact systems.", "For the FMA system, OCWR relied on its external contractor to  document a system security plan that generally described  security requirements for the system. However, the plan did  not document the privacy requirements or the specific security  and privacy controls that were expected to be implemented for  FMA as a low-impact system. For example, the plan did not  specify an authority to report information to in the event of a  security incident. Further, the plan did not include or refer to  other necessary security and privacy documentation, such as  a privacy impact assessment. As a result, OCWR did not  adequately oversee the completion of this key step for its FMA  system.", "Plan assessment of security controls. OCWR partially  implemented this oversight activity for SOCRATES and did not  implement it for FMA.", "Select an independent assessor. OCWR relied on the Library to  select an assessor for SOCRATES who was independent. For  example, for SOCRATES, the Library used an external contractor  to initially assess the system and reported taking steps to verify  that the assessor was independent from the Library. However, the  office did not adequately oversee the completion of this key step  for SOCRATES and did not ensure that the assessor used for the  system was independent from the office. Specifically, OCWR  allowed the Library to select the assessor for SOCRATES and did  not take steps to verify the assessor\u2019s independence. Further,  for FMA, OCWR did not select an assessor to review the system.", "Develop a test plan. Although OCWR relied on the Library to  develop a test plan for SOCRATES, the test plan used to conduct  initial control testing was not approved by the office and did not  specify the procedures that were to be followed to test each  control from the SOCRATES system security plan. For example,  the SOCRATES test plan specified a high-level procedure for  collecting relevant artifacts but did not specify what particular  documentation would be collected or reviewed for each control  identified in the system security plan. Regarding FMA, OCWR and  its external contractor did not develop a test plan.", "Conduct assessment. OCWR partially implemented this oversight  activity, which includes executing the test plan, for SOCRATES and  did not implement it for FMA. Specifically, OCWR worked with the  Library to perform initial control testing for SOCRATES and document  the results in an online tracking system; however, as previously  mentioned, the office did not ensure that a test plan with detailed  procedures to test each control was developed and approved prior to  the initial testing of SOCRATES. As a result, the office did not  adequately oversee the execution of the test plan by the Library to  ensure that controls that were assessed as implemented were  effectively operating as intended. For FMA, OCWR and its external  contractor did not execute a test plan or document the results of any  tests for the system.", "Review assessment. OCWR partially implemented this oversight  activity, which includes developing POA&Ms for remediation of  weaknesses, for SOCRATES and did not implement it for FMA.  Specifically, OCWR worked with the Library to develop POA&M data  for SOCRATES that included many of the recommended NIST  elements, such as estimated completion dates and issue  identification. For example, following initial control testing in March  2019, OCWR and the Library worked to develop POA&M data for 62  security control weaknesses, including 24 high-risk and 38 moderate- risk weaknesses. As of November 2019, there were seven POA&Ms,  including six categorized as high-risk and one as moderate-risk, that  OCWR and the Library had not yet addressed.", "However, as previously mentioned, the office did not ensure that a  test plan that included detailed procedures to test each control was  developed and approved prior to the initial testing of SOCRATES.  Therefore, the office could not ensure that controls were tested  appropriately to identify necessary remedial actions in POA&Ms. As a  result, OCWR did not adequately oversee the completion of this step  and ensure that key POA&Ms were appropriately documented. For  FMA, without an executed test plan, OCWR and its external  contractor could not complete or update POA&Ms for the system.", "According to OCWR officials, including the office\u2019s Deputy Executive  Director, part of the reason for these shortfalls was that the office did not  obtain expertise in security to aid in the completion of these oversight  activities until September 2018 when the office hired a new IT Manager.  In addition, OCWR officials, including the Deputy Executive Director,  could not explain why the contractor did not produce key oversight related  artifacts, such as those related to the security testing of controls, as  agreed upon in contracts covering FMA during the performance period.  However, a key contributing reason that we identified for the shortfalls in  OCWR\u2019s oversight of external partners was that OCWR had not  documented procedures to direct the office in performing such oversight  activities effectively.", "The lack of documented oversight procedures and shortfalls in OCWR\u2019s  oversight of its external partners contributed to concerns with the  deployment of SOCRATES. For example:", "As previously discussed, OCWR did not ensure that all moderate- level security controls for the SOCRATES web-based form and  secure information sharing platform were tested before the system  was deployed in June 2019. For example, a control related to testing  contingency plans for the SOCRATES web-based form was not  assessed until August 2019, approximately 2 months after the system  was deployed.", "Although penetration testing of the CMS portion of SOCRATES was  completed in May 2019, OCWR did not ensure that penetration  testing of the SOCRATES web-based form and secure information  sharing platform was conducted before deployment. Penetration  testing for the SOCRATES web-based form and secure information  sharing platform was subsequently completed in December 2019,  approximately 6 months after the system was deployed.", "Until OCWR develops and implements effective oversight procedures  over its external partners, it may not be able to mitigate risks that could  result in the loss of sensitive data or compromise of the office\u2019s external  systems.", "We also assessed selected security controls in place for SOCRATES and  FMA including, but not limited to, configuration management, patch  management, and personnel security.

If properly implemented, these  policies and procedures may be able to effectively reduce the risk that  could come from cybersecurity threats such as unauthorized access  or disruption of services. For example, establishing policies and  procedures that incorporate NIST\u2019s risk management framework can  help to ensure that a consistent approach is used to conduct a  complete security assessment before a system is deployed and that a  designated agency official certifies the system for operation based on  progress in remediating control weaknesses and an assessment of  residual risk.", "To its credit, OCWR\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2019 through 2023  includes a goal of developing, among other things, cybersecurity risk  policies and procedures.

Additionally, the official stated that OCWR  considers development of documentation to be a continual process, and  that the office would like to develop and build procedures to lay a  foundation for effective risk management.", "However, until OCWR establishes the role and responsibilities of the risk  executive function in policy, the office will lack an understanding of who is  ultimately responsible for overseeing the cybersecurity risk activities of  the organization and what those responsibilities include. Further, until  OCWR establishes and implements a strategy for managing its  cybersecurity risks using NIST\u2019s framework, its ability to make operational  decisions that adequately address security risks and prioritize IT security  investments will be hindered.

As a result,  OCWR was left without a complete understanding of potential schedule  issues, the system\u2019s planned security requirements, and cybersecurity- related risks to the success of the project. These shortcomings existed, at  least in part, because of a lack of OCWR policies and procedures that  required cybersecurity management activities be incorporated into project  scheduling, requirements management, and risk management. Until  OCWR develops and implements such policies and procedures, future IT  projects\u2014such as the office\u2019s planned transition of its FMA system to the  Library\u2014may face unnecessary cybersecurity risks and may not be  carried out in an efficient and effective manner.", "OCWR made initial efforts to assess the implementation of security and  privacy controls for the two selected externally-operated systems, but did  not fully implement critical oversight activities. A contributing reason for  these shortfalls is that OCWR had not documented procedures for the  office to follow in order to perform such oversight of its external entities  effectively. This ultimately contributed to OCWR not being able to first test  important system security controls for ensuring the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of the system before it was deployed. Until  OCWR establishes and implements specific procedures for overseeing  external entities, it will have reduced assurance that external entities are  adequately securing and protecting the office\u2019s information. In addition,  the office will face increased risks that system weaknesses may go  undetected and unresolved, which could result in the loss of sensitive  data or compromise of its systems.", "Given the increasing number and sophistication of cyber threats facing  federal agencies, it is critical that organizations such as OCWR are well  positioned to make consistent, informed risk-based decisions in protecting  their systems and information against these threats. To its credit, OCWR  has recognized the need for an improved organization-wide approach to  its cybersecurity policies and IT governance in its most recent strategic  plan. However, important elements of an effective organization-wide  cybersecurity approach have not been fully implemented, including  establishing the roles and responsibilities for the risk executive function in  policy, a cybersecurity risk management strategy, and policies and  procedures for managing cybersecurity risks. Until OCWR fully addresses  these organization-wide cybersecurity risk management practices, its  ability to ensure effective oversight and management of IT will remain  limited.
