These states used the flexibility allowed by the legislation to raise income eligibility and asset limits as well as cost-sharing fees. Across the 12 states, income eligibility levels ranged from 100 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) in Wyoming to no income limit in Minnesota, with 11 states setting income eligibility limits at twice the FPL or higher. In addition to increasing income and asset levels, these states required participants to buy in to the program by charging premiums, ranging from $26 to $82 a month, and co-payments, generally ranging from $0.50 to $3 for office visits and prescription drugs. In detailed analysis of four states--Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota, and New Jersey--GAO found that most Buy-In participants had prior insurance coverage by Medicaid and Medicare, few had prior coverage by private health insurance, and many earned low wages--most making less than $800 per month. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services noted that it expects to report in 2004 on its current study of states' experiences in 2001 and 2002 with the Medicaid Buy-In programs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["During fiscal year 2000, over 7 million individuals with disabilities were  enrolled in Medicaid, a federal-state program that finances health care for  certain low-income Americans. For these individuals, Medicaid gives  states the option to cover a wide array of medical and supportive services,  including assistance with basic daily activities such as bathing, dressing,  and eating. Depending on state Medicaid rules, individuals with disabilities  who qualify for cash assistance from the Supplemental Security Income  (SSI) or Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) programs may qualify for  Medicaid. Nearly all individuals who qualify for SSI, which primarily  covers low-income individuals who are disabled and have little or no work  experience, are assured eligibility for Medicaid coverage. Under DI, which  assists people who worked but became disabled before their retirement  age, individuals are eligible for Medicare, a federal health insurance  program for elderly individuals and some individuals with disabilities.  Depending on their income and assets, individuals eligible for DI also may  qualify for Medicaid and thus receive coverage for some services not  covered by Medicare, such as most outpatient prescription drugs.", "Because eligibility for Medicaid is generally linked to individuals\u2019 income  and assets, working-age individuals\u2014aged 16 to 64\u2014with disabilities who  live in the community and work may jeopardize their Medicaid coverage  due to earnings from work, possibly leaving them without an adequate  health insurance alternative. The loss of Medicaid may be of particular  concern for working-age individuals with disabilities because some  benefits\u2014including personal assistance with daily activities and adaptive  equipment (such as household items modified for use by those with  disabilities)\u2014may not be available through other sources of health  insurance. For example, private health insurance, such as that offered by  employers, often does not cover personal assistance with basic daily  activities or adaptive equipment. As a result, working-age individuals with  disabilities may forgo employment and associated earnings in order to  ensure their continued financial eligibility for Medicaid coverage of their  health care needs.", "In an effort to help extend Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with  disabilities who desire to work, the Congress passed the Ticket to Work  and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 (Pub.

A Medicaid Buy-In program is intended to assist  individuals by allowing them to work and thereby increase their  independence and self-sufficiency, while at the same time enabling them  to obtain or maintain health care coverage. The act directed that we report  to the Congress on characteristics of individuals with disabilities,  including their health care costs and health insurance coverage, as well as  states\u2019 progress in designing and implementing the Medicaid Buy-In  program. Accordingly, as agreed with the committees of jurisdiction, we  examined  1.  characteristics of working-age individuals with disabilities compared  with the rest of the working-age U.S. population with regard to  employment, education, income, health insurance status, and health  care expenditures,  2.  how states that have chosen to establish a Ticket to Work Medicaid  Buy-In program have designed their programs, including income  eligibility limits and any cost-sharing provisions, and  3.  characteristics of selected states\u2019 Ticket to Work Medicaid Buy-In  participants, including previous health insurance coverage and income  from employment.", "To compare characteristics of working-age individuals with disabilities to  individuals in the rest of the working-age population, we analyzed data  available from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality\u2019s (AHRQ)  Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS)\u2014the survey of individuals\u2019  demographics, employment, health characteristics, and medical spending  (household component) for 1997 and 1998, the most recent years for  which relevant data were available. We analyzed data from MEPS because  such data provided both a way to identify working-age individuals with  disabilities and details on their health care expenditures. Our estimates  based on MEPS resulted in a relatively broad definition of disability for  individuals aged 16 to 64 because it included individuals who reported one  or both of the following conditions: (1) needing help or supervision in  performing activities of daily living (ADL) (such as bathing or dressing) or  instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) (such as taking medications  or preparing meals) because of an impairment or a physical or mental  health problem, or (2) being completely unable to work at a job, do  housework, or go to school. For individuals meeting this definition of  disability, we compared characteristics such as income level, insurance  status, and health care expenditures to those of the rest of the U.S.  population aged 16 to 64. AHRQ collected these data prior to  implementation of Ticket to Work Medicaid Buy-In programs and thus the  data do not reflect any effects of states\u2019 Buy-In programs. (App. I provides  detailed information on our methodology for developing estimates and  characteristics of working-age individuals with disabilities.) To examine  the designs of the Buy-In programs for states that had chosen to establish  a Buy-In program and whose programs were in effect as of December  2002, we reviewed state Medicaid plan amendments describing the Buy- Ins, analyzed published state documents, and conducted telephone  interviews with state Medicaid officials. Additionally, we analyzed the Buy- In implementation experience of four states\u2014Connecticut, Illinois,  Minnesota, and New Jersey\u2014that were among the most experienced in  implementing the program. At the federal level, we interviewed officials at  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees  states\u2019 Medicaid programs, to gather information about states\u2019 programs.

The  Ticket to Work Buy-In builds on the BBA option by giving states unlimited  flexibility to set higher income and asset levels for two new eligibility  groups\u2014Basic Coverage Group and Medical Improvement Group\u2014for  working individuals with disabilities.

States may establish their own income and asset  standards or elect to have no standards at all.

However, for individuals with  annual incomes less than 450 percent of the FPL, states may not impose  premiums that exceed 7.5 percent of income. Additionally, if the  individual\u2019s adjusted gross income for federal income tax purposes  exceeds $75,000, the state must require the individual to pay the highest  amount of premiums that an individual would be required to pay under the  state\u2019s premium structure, although a state is allowed to subsidize this cost  with its own funds. While the Basic Coverage Group Buy-In participants  must have earnings, the Ticket to Work legislation does not specify a  minimum level of employment for this group.

If a state elects to cover the Medical  Improvement Group, it must also cover the Basic Coverage Group.

Prior to the Ticket to Work  legislation, DI individuals in 11 of the 12 states could qualify for Medicaid  by spending down their incomes to specified levels (Wyoming did not offer  a spend-down option). In these 11 states, the spend-down income  eligibility levels ranged from 15 percent to 100 percent of the FPL. Under  the new Buy-In programs, the income eligibility levels significantly  exceeded those established under the spend-down categories (see fig. 2),  thus allowing individuals to qualify for the Medicaid Buy-In directly\u2014 rather than spending down their incomes to qualify for Medicaid coverage.  For example, an individual receiving DI in Arkansas could obtain Medicaid  coverage through the Buy-In program with an income up to 250 percent of  the FPL; prior to the Buy-In, the individual would have had to incur  medical expenses that reduced his or her income to approximately 15  percent of the FPL in order to qualify for the spend-down category of  Medicaid.

In addition to relieving  individuals of the requirement to spend down their income to qualify for  Medicaid, DI individuals, who are not entitled to receive Medicare  coverage until they have been receiving DI cash benefits for 24 months,  also received more immediate health insurance coverage through the  Medicaid Buy-In. Buy-In participants may also have access to a more  expanded benefit package than individuals who receive Medicaid through  a state\u2019s medically needy program.", "However, when considering participation in the Buy-In program, DI  beneficiaries must weigh the benefits of the higher earnings allowed under  the program against the possible loss of DI cash benefits and Medicare  coverage if their earnings increase beyond a certain threshold.  Specifically, after a 9-month trial work period and a 36-month extended  period of eligibility, if a DI beneficiary\u2019s earnings increase over the SGA  limit in any month, the individual loses DI eligibility entirely. Additionally,  DI beneficiaries who earn more than the SGA level after the initial 9-month  trial period could lose Medicare coverage after 8-1/2 years. The loss of  entitlement for Medicare may be of concern for those individuals with  disabilities who would not reach age 65 by the end of the 8-1/2-year time  period.

Most SSI beneficiaries were assured eligibility for  Medicaid and thus did not need the Buy-In program or to spend down their  incomes in order to qualify for Medicaid. SSI beneficiaries in Medicaid  would receive the same benefit package as those in a Buy-In program.  Even SSI beneficiaries who worked could remain eligible for Medicaid as  participants in a work incentive program, which allowed individuals to  increase their incomes while maintaining their Medicaid coverage. In 5 of  the 12 states, Buy-In income eligibility levels were lower than the Medicaid  eligibility levels for individuals in the SSI work incentive program, and  Buy-In eligibility levels only slightly exceeded those for the SSI work  incentive beneficiaries in another 5 states.

If a  Buy-In participant were paying a Medicare part B premium of $54 a month,  his or her Medicaid Buy-In premium would be discounted by that amount.  Thus, if a participant\u2019s Buy-In premium were $80 a month, the monthly  premium for the Buy-In program would be discounted to $26 a month. In  Connecticut, any amount that participants pay for Medicare part B  premiums, employer-sponsored coverage, or other out-of-pocket medical  insurance is deducted from their premium liability.

While not offering a specific estimate, a  New Jersey official indicated that most of the Buy-In participants who  were enrolled in Medicaid before switching to the Buy-In category also  had spent down their income to qualify for Medicaid.

For example, Minnesota and New Jersey state officials  said they did not view crowd-out as a significant issue for this population  because many of the participants worked part-time and were rarely  offered private insurance coverage. Additionally, both Minnesota and  Connecticut required individuals to either enroll or remain enrolled in  employer-sponsored coverage if it was offered. As of December 2002,  these states had not formally analyzed whether Buy-In participants  withdrew from private health insurance coverage prior to obtaining  Medicaid coverage.

(See table 6.) While one purpose of the Ticket to Work  legislation was to enable individuals with disabilities to reduce their  dependency on federal cash benefit programs through earnings from  work, available data from Connecticut, Illinois, Minnesota showed that  few participants earned more than the SGA limit, which was $780 in  December 2002. Sixty-four percent of participants in Connecticut, 61  percent of participants in Illinois, and 77 percent of participants in  Minnesota had earned income well below the SGA limit. None of these  states had asked participants to identify their occupation or the industry in  which they were employed on their Medicaid Buy-In applications;  however, some states may conduct broader analyses of participants\u2019  employment as part of required evaluations under a related Ticket to Work  grant program.", "Two of the four states we reviewed could identify whether participants  had increased their earnings once enrolled in the Buy-In. Forty percent of  Minnesota participants and 28 percent of Connecticut participants  increased their earnings between the time of initial enrollment and  December 2001, the most recent date for which these data were available.  Average monthly increases over previous earnings were $306 in Minnesota  and $332 in Connecticut. New Jersey and Illinois were not able to provide  this information. Minnesota found that 64 percent of those in the state\u2019s  Buy-In program as of December 2001 earned wages for at least one 3- month period in the 2-year period prior to enrollment.

In its comments, CMS said that, in addition to the states with  existing BBA and Ticket to Work Buy-In programs, at least three more  states are planning to implement a Medicaid Buy-In program within the  coming year, which would result in over half of the states offering health  insurance to workers with disabilities. CMS noted that the expansion of  Medicaid coverage to these individuals is encouraging particularly because  states are experiencing fiscal budget constraints. CMS also said that it is  collecting information on Medicaid Buy-In participants\u2019 earnings and  Medicaid costs for the first 2 years of operation. In addition, CMS expects  to complete an extensive study of states\u2019 experiences for 2001 and 2002  with the Buy-In programs authorized under both the BBA and the Ticket to  Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 in the fall of 2003 and  to report its findings in 2004.", "CMS also suggested that, in view of general concerns over racial  disparities and access to care in rural areas, it might be helpful for us to  comment on these demographic factors as part of our findings. We did not  include these factors in our scope of work, even for the four states where  we did more detailed work, and therefore cannot comment on them.
