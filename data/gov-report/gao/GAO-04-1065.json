The cargo preference program is open to all U.S.-flagged vessels, while the Maritime Security Fleet (MSF) subsidy is only available to certain militarily useful vessels. Of the 47 ships currently in the MSF, 37 have participated in cargo preference food aid shipments. MSF and non-MSF carriers compete for food aid shipped as bagged cargo, which averaged 33 percent of food aid shipments by tonnage from fiscal years 1999 to 2003. There is no competition for bulk food aid shipments because MSF carriers do not carry bulk cargo. Changes in food aid spending have contributed to a shift from bulk to bagged cargo and increased reliance on bagged cargo by some non-MSF carriers. From 1999 to 2003, MSF carriers shipped about 45 percent and non-MSF carriers 55 percent of bagged food aid cargo. Competition between MSF and non-MSF carriers for bagged food aid is affected by certain cargo preference requirements. Establishing a tonnage limitation on MSF vessels would likely reduce their share of food aid shipments, but the extent would depend on factors such as the level of the limit and the options MSF carriers have in responding to it. We examined three proposed limits and found that the percentage of food aid voyages carrying more than the proposed limit rises from 3 percent with a limit of 7,500 tons to 19 percent above 2,500 tons, according to fiscal year 2001 to 2003 data. The actual impact on MSF carriers will be smaller if they are able to (1) carry some food aid up to the limit, (2) replace some food aid above the limit with other cargo, and/or (3) elect to carry food aid even without the subsidy. Food aid agencies are concerned about the impacts of a tonnage limit, including increased delays in providing food aid, administrative burdens, and higher shipping costs. Major ports would generally experience a limited overall impact of a tonnage limitation, but specific food aid terminals could be affected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Food aid shipments must generally be transported on U.S.-flag ships under  the requirements set by the cargo preference program.

They  supported a provision to limit the amount of bagged cargo that MSF ships  could carry so that, on days when the limit was exceeded, MSF ships would  have to forfeit their subsidy. Since no analysis had been conducted on the  effects of such a change, the Maritime Security Program was authorized  without this provision, and we were directed to study the impact of placing  a limitation on MSF transportation of bagged food aid preference cargo.", "As discussed with representatives of the House and Senate Committees on  Armed Services and the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation, we have focused on answering the following questions: 1.

What are the nature and extent of MSF and non-MSF carrier  participation and competition in the food aid program? 3. How would establishing a bagged cargo preference tonnage limitation  on MSF vessels be expected to affect MSF, other U.S.-flag ships, the  cargo preference food aid program, and the ports servicing these ships?", "To answer these questions, we gathered and analyzed food aid shipment  data for fiscal years 1999 to 2003 from the U.S. Agency for International  Development (USAID), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the  Maritime Administration (MARAD), as well as MSF and cargo preference  vessel data from MARAD and military contingency participation data from  MARAD and the Department of Defense (DOD). Through electronic data  testing, verification of data against other sources, and interviews with  agency officials managing the data, we found the data to be sufficiently  reliable and appropriate for our purposes. We conducted interviews and  obtained financial data for fiscal years 2001 to 2003 from representatives of  15 carriers that transported the majority of cargo preference food aid,  including 5 MSF and 10 non-MSF carriers.

Charter  service means that vessels are hired to carry a cargo to specific ports at a  specific time; these vessels do not provide regularly scheduled service on a  fixed route but typically carry a shipload of cargo for only one or a few  customers at a time. Charter service is primarily provided by bulk, break- bulk, and tug-barge vessels that can carry either bulk or bagged cargo. Bulk  vessels are designed to carry dry bulk commodities, such as rice or wheat,  in large interior holds. The benefit of bulk shipments is the economies of  scale that can be gained from shipping large amounts of a single  commodity. Figure 1 shows a photograph of a bulk vessel. Break-bulk  vessels are general cargo ships that are designed to carry nonuniform items  packaged as single parcels or assembled together on pallet boards.

Liner service is primarily provided by  containerships that carry bagged cargo; they do not carry bulk cargo.  Containerships are designed to carry cargo in standard-size, preloaded  containers that are stacked next to and on top of each other on the ship.  The benefit of containers is that they permit rapid loading and unloading  and efficient transportation of cargo to and from the port area. Containers  facilitate intermodal transportation because they can be loaded by the  supplier and sealed, taken by truck or railcar to the port, then loaded onto  the containership without the cargo being handled. In the case of food aid,  generally the suppliers do not load the containers but instead ship bagged  commodities by rail or truck to the port of loading, where they are loaded  into the containers. Figure 2 shows a photograph of a containership. Liner  service is also provided by Lighter Aboard Ships (LASH), which are barge- carrying vessels that use barges like containers.

As the figure indicates, an ocean carrier that offers to  carry preference cargo on a U.S.-flag vessel can be counted as either  Priority 1 or Priority 2 service.

However,  vessels that operate in liner service, such as MSF containerships, often  qualify for Priority 2 service because they transfer shipment of (transship)  food aid cargo to a foreign-flag vessel for a leg of the voyage. In some  locations, however, some MSF carriers have started to transship food aid  cargo to prepositioned U.S.-flag vessels instead of foreign-flag vessels so  that they can qualify as Priority 1 service. In fact, as figure 7 shows, liner  vessels that carried Title II food aid cargo from fiscal years 1999 to 2003  qualified for Priority 1 service about 48 percent of the time. Liner vessels  counted as Priority 1 service by default about 23 percent of the time and  Priority 2 or 3 service about 29 percent of the time. Under the cargo  preference program, agencies are required to award food aid shipments to  carriers that offer Priority 1 service over carriers that offer Priority 2 or 3  service, even if the freight rate charged by the carrier offering Priority 1  service is higher, unless the rate exceeds MARAD\u2019s fair and reasonable rate  calculation.", "Other cargo preference requirements tend to favor MSF carriers.

They  have created a system for transporting this cargo intermodally in  containers by rail to U.S. ports on the East and West Coast, where the cargo  is ultimately exported. MSF carriers have been successful in winning  much of this cargo because these intermodal shipments allow them to offer  competitive freight rates, according to USAID and USDA officials.

However, setting a limit at this  level may not mean a reduction of 160,000 tons that MSF vessels carry, to  the extent they are able to continue to carry some food aid on affected  voyages, replace some food aid with other cargo, and forfeit their subsidy  for food aid shipments that are sufficiently profitable. A simulation analysis  we performed for MSF containerships suggests that, at a limit of 2,500 tons  for example, the total annual decrease in food aid carried by these vessels  could, under certain assumptions incorporating those options, range from  about 17,000 to about 63,000 tons. Structured interviews with the carriers  suggest that considerations such as vessel sharing arrangements could also  affect the outcome and impacts on non-MSF carriers may depend on their  market niche. Further, if the terms of MSF and non-MSF carriers\u2019  participation in cargo preference change, program agencies are concerned  that they could face increased delivery delays, administrative burdens, and  shipping costs. The major food aid ports would generally experience a  limited impact on their overall port activity from a bagged tonnage limit,  although specific food aid terminals could potentially be affected,  depending on the extent of any limitation and the MSF carriers\u2019 responses  to it."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Share of MSF Food Aid Voyages Affected Would Increase Substantially as Limitation Level Decreases", "paragraphs": ["While more than 80 percent of MSF food aid voyages fall below a 2,500-ton  limit, establishing a limit at 2,500 tons would be substantially more  constraining for the majority of the fleet than limits at 5,000 or 7,500 tons.  According to USDA data from fiscal years 2001 to 2003, only 3 percent of  MSF food aid voyages carried more than 7,500 tons, almost all of which  occurred on the five LASH vessels that have participated in the MSF.   However, another 16 percent of MSF food aid voyages carried food aid  tonnage between 2,500 and 7,500 tons. All of these voyages occurred on  containerships, which comprise the majority of current MSF vessels.  Figure 8 shows the number of MSF food aid voyages at different tonnage  levels. The average annual tonnage carried by both MSF LASH vessels and  containerships on voyages in excess of 2,500 tons was around 322,000 tons,  of which around 160,000 tons were carried on the containerships.", "Similar to the percentage of MSF food aid voyages, the share of MSF food  aid revenues affected by a tonnage limit rises substantially as the level is  decreased. As shown in figure 9, 37 percent of MSF total food aid revenues  were earned on voyages carrying more than 7,500 tons of food aid while 68  percent of MSF total food aid revenues were earned on voyages with more  than 2,500 tons of food aid. In comparison to the percentage of voyages  affected, these revenue shares reflect that MSF voyages above a potential  tonnage limit are earning proportionally more food aid revenues than those  with smaller cargo volumes. MSF food aid revenues earned on the  primarily LASH vessels that carried more than 7,500 tons were around $26  million annually, or $8.5 million per vessel. Not including LASH vessels,  MSF food aid revenues earned on containerships that carried more than  2,500 tons were around $22 million annually, or $1.3 million per vessel.  Nonetheless, while these data indicate how often an MSF vessel could be  restricted by a tonnage limitation, they indicate the potential loss in  revenue from food aid only under the assumption that MSF carriers were to  no longer carry any food aid on these voyages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Various Factors Will Affect Actual Impact on MSF", "paragraphs": ["The actual food aid tonnage and net revenue impact for MSF vessels under  a tonnage limitation will depend on options available to the carriers and  how they respond to them. Numerous considerations relating to market  conditions, food aid logistics, and carrier characteristics would ultimately  shape the impact of any tonnage limitation. We identified three factors to  explicitly consider in an analysis of a tonnage limitation. Each of these  factors, under certain assumptions, has the potential to make the impact of  a tonnage limit on MSF vessels smaller than suggested by the share of MSF  voyages affected.", "First, affected MSF vessels might be able to carry some food aid,  potentially up to the level of the limit, and may not have to give up the  entire tonnage for that voyage to keep their subsidy. This situation can  occur if a carrier can bid on a portion of an offered shipment or if the food  aid tonnage on a voyage comprises multiple shipments, such that the  carrier could bid on those shipments providing tonnage under the limit.   For example, a carrier that would normally have a voyage with 3,700 tons  of food aid may be able to carry two food aid contracts for 1,000 tons each  and, under a tonnage limit of 2,500 tons, face a potential loss of food aid  cargo of only 1,700 tons.", "Second, depending on market conditions, affected MSF carriers may be  able to replace a portion of the food aid above the limit with commercial or  nonfood preference cargo, diminishing their loss in total revenues. For  example, if an MSF vessel were to carry 1,700 tons less food aid due to a  tonnage limit, the carrier may be able to replace a portion of that tonnage  with nonfood aid cargo.", "Third, there may be occasions when carrying food aid cargoes above a  tonnage limit is more profitable than reducing food aid to receive the  subsidy for a voyage, thus providing an incentive to carry food aid above  the limit. This may occur for food aid shipments that are particularly large  or earn a particularly high freight rate such that an affected MSF carrier  might choose to carry the food aid, even if it entailed forfeiting the subsidy  otherwise earned during the days of that voyage, as well as forgoing any net  revenues from available replacement cargo.  For example, if an MSF  vessel were to normally carry 7,000 tons of food aid on a voyage that lasted  15 days, the carrier would have to give up a subsidy payment of around  $107,000 to carry that entire tonnage. The carrier might choose to forfeit  the subsidy payment if the net revenues from the food aid effectively above  the 2,500-ton limit exceeded the $107,000 plus potential net revenues from  replacement cargo.", "To illustrate the impact of a tonnage limitation when accounting for these  three factors, we created a simulation model that suggests ranges of  possible tonnage and net revenue changes for MSF vessels at different  tonnage limits. The model uses estimates of average freight rates, average  cargo volumes, and average vessel costs for voyages from fiscal years 2001  to 2003, and includes probability distributions that reflect certain  assumptions about carrier options and behavior. Table 3 provides the  annual average simulation estimates for MSF containership voyages that  carried more than 2,500 tons of food aid.", "The estimates illustrate that, under the assumption that carriers could  respond to a tonnage limit in the ways we have discussed, impacts on MSF  vessels could be reduced. While the total food aid tonnage on voyages  affected by the limit is around 160,000 tons, to the degree that carriers can  keep some food aid on voyages where the total food aid tonnage has been  above the limit, the amount of food aid that they could lose due to the limit  would, under certain assumptions, range from around 61,000 to 138,000  tons. This food aid tonnage that is effectively above the limit would  correspond to estimated net revenues of around $7 million to $16 million.  Based on our assumptions about how much other cargo MSF carriers are  able to secure to replace the food aid, MSF net revenues from additional  cargo might range from an estimated $200 thousand to an estimated $4  million. Based on our assumptions about net revenues for food aid and  other cargo, the food aid tonnage above the limit that MSF vessels continue  to carry might range from an estimated 24,000 to an estimated 102,000 tons.  The net revenues from this food aid tonnage minus the forfeited subsidy  payments would then range from around $3 million to $9 million. Taking all  three factors into account, the total decline in MSF net revenues under a  limitation of 2,500 tons of food aid might range from around $2 million to $5  million a year. On a per vessel basis, this amounts to roughly $120,000 to  $270,000. By estimating the food aid tonnage effectively above the limit and  subtracting the tonnage that MSF vessels might continue to carry while  forfeiting their subsidy payments, the annual food aid tonnage available to  non-MSF carriers might range from around 17,000 to 63,000 tons.", "Impacts on carriers could fall toward the ends of the simulation ranges  reported in table 3 or, in some cases, outside those ranges if carrier options  and responses differ from those simulated. An important consideration is  that certain key assumptions in the simulation are based on information  from fiscal years 2001 to 2003. To the extent that future market conditions  differ from those reflected in recent years, or carriers respond in different  ways than we have considered, the impacts of a tonnage limitation could be  affected. For example, if future food aid program levels decline, then the  overall tonnage and revenue changes from a shift in MSF\u2019s food aid market  share would also likely decline. If, however, future nonfood preference  cargo levels decline, then MSF may be able to replace a smaller share of the  food aid tonnage above a limit with other cargo, and the revenue impacts  from a tonnage limit would be greater. If MSF carriers decide never to carry  food aid above a limit\u2014even when it is profitable to do so, net of a forfeited  subsidy payment\u2014then the total decline in food aid tonnage they carry and  the revenue loss to MSF vessels would increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Carriers Reported that Structural Challenges Would Impede Their Ability to Adapt to Tonnage Limits", "paragraphs": ["MSF carriers told us they face certain logistical constraints that challenge  them in being able to effectively respond to a tonnage limit at any level.", "One challenge is the difficulty in planning vessel tonnages around a  limit. The MSF carriers cited their lack of control over when they  receive food aid cargoes from suppliers, which makes it difficult to  distribute the food aid tonnage onto vessel sailings to stay under the  limit and meet delivery deadlines. They stated they could face additional  expenses for cargo storage at ports as well as loading penalties and  charges for delayed delivery.  MSF carriers also cited the fact that they  may bid on multiple food aid shipments concurrently as a complication  in planning vessel tonnages around a limit.", "A second challenge cited by two MSF carriers was that they have  agreements with other carriers to share space on their vessels that could  be at risk if a carrier is concerned with shipping food aid above a certain  tonnage.  USDA and MARAD corroborated this view and expressed  concern that eliminating vessel-sharing agreements would increase  inefficiency in the market.", "A third challenge noted by some MSF carriers was that the costs they  incur to maintain an infrastructure to support food aid cargo might  become too high if their food aid tonnage should be reduced. Such  infrastructure might include a U.S.-flag vessel stationed abroad to  transfer food aid from major ports to more remote destinations or the  container loading operations some MSF carriers have set up in the Great  Lakes region.", "The ability of the non-MSF carriers to benefit from a tonnage limitation  would depend on their market niche, according to our interviews with 10  non-MSF carriers. The simulation we discussed above suggests that, under  certain assumptions, the additional bagged food aid available to all non- MSF carriers might range from less than 1 percent to 8 percent of this  segment\u2019s current bagged tonnage for tonnage limits at 5,000 and 2,500  tons, respectively. However, each non-MSF carrier\u2019s ability to bid for and  win that cargo would be differentially affected by (1) whether it carries  bagged food aid; (2) whether it services food aid destinations where cargo  has become available; and (3) the tonnage of cargo available, compared  with its vessel capacity. For example, while seven of the non-MSF carriers  we interviewed said they would benefit from a tonnage limitation, two non- MSF carriers said they would be unaffected because they do not carry  bagged food aid. Three non-MSF carriers supported a lower tonnage  limitation limit, but two of them mentioned being constrained by the  geographic routes they service in their ability to pick up new business.   Moreover, two other non-MSF carriers responded that a lower tonnage  limitation would actually hurt them because it would encourage MSF  carriers to more intensely compete in their market niche that services  smaller shipments. Three other non-MSF carriers with larger vessels were  satisfied with a higher tonnage limitation because it would reduce MSF  competition in the market niche for large shipments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect on Program Agencies Will Depend on MSF and Non-MSF Carrier Responses", "paragraphs": ["The impact of a bagged tonnage limitation on program agencies is hard to  predict and will ultimately depend on the degree to which both MSF and  non-MSF carriers alter the terms in which they participate in the Maritime  Security Program and cargo preference.  According to DOD, a tonnage limit  could cause some MSF carriers to withdraw from the Maritime Security  Program, though DOD officials indicated that they expect to receive more  applications for the next program than available slots.  USDA, USAID, and  MARAD also reported several concerns about a tonnage limit at any level.  These concerns include:  Decreased food aid timeliness:  USDA and USAID noted concern that  food aid shipments could be delayed if the non-MSF vessels do not have  sufficient capacity to quickly carry the additional food aid shipments  above a limit or if MSF carriers responded to the limitation by spreading  food aid tonnage over several sailings to stay under the limit.", "Increased administrative burdens: USDA and USAID noted concern  about additional administrative burdens if MSF carriers responded to  the limit by submitting partial bids or dividing up shipments and if non- MSF carriers increasingly submitted bids for bagged cargo that were  contingent on getting numerous contracts in order to fill larger vessels.  MARAD noted concern that a tonnage limit would negatively affect their  initiative to implement service contracts. Additionally, both food aid  agencies and MARAD will face the administrative burden of having to  track volumes on a voyage basis\u2014something they do not currently do.", "Increased shipping costs: USDA, USAID, and MARAD noted concern  over the possibility of increased freight rates if (1) non-MSF carriers  raised prices in response to decreased competition, (2) freight rates bid  by non-MSF vessels for contracts that would have otherwise been  carried by MSF vessels are higher because of charter service rather than  liner service or because the non-MSF carrier may not regularly sail to  that location, (3) MSF carriers raised prices in response to losses  associated with carrying less food aid, receiving fewer subsidy  payments, or incurring costs for delayed delivery charges, and/or (4)  freight rates bid by MSF carriers for food aid shipments below a tonnage  limitation are higher than their bid otherwise would have been for a  larger shipment due to the loss of economies of scale."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tonnage Limitation Generally Would Have Limited Overall Impact on Ports, with Greater Potential Effects on Certain Terminals", "paragraphs": ["A bagged food aid tonnage limitation on MSF carriers generally would have  limited impact on the overall activity of the major food aid ports, based on  our analysis of the food aid shipment data and the interviews we conducted  with port representatives. Some ports may experience some shift in the  type of food aid handled, which could affect participating terminals within  these ports. For example, if bagged cargo shipments by MSF  containerships were seriously affected, this would likely have a greater  impact on terminals that predominantly stuff bagged food aid cargo into  containers. However, any impact would depend on the extent of the  limitation imposed and the MSF carriers\u2019 responses to it.", "The major Gulf ports, from which most food aid cargo is shipped, would  likely experience little impact if a bagged food aid limitation were imposed  on MSF carriers because they service both MSF and non-MSF vessels that  carry bagged cargo. The result would be a shift among their customers,  according to port officials. The ports of Lake Charles and Jacintoport are  specialized agricultural commodity ports that handle only bagged food aid  cargo, and they anticipate that any loss of bagged cargo by MSF carriers  would likely be picked up by the non-MSF carriers who are their biggest  customers. The ports of New Orleans and Houston service both MSF and  non-MSF customers at different terminals. These large ports handle all  kinds of cargo in addition to food aid shipments, and port officials  anticipate that there would be no net loss in overall business for the port.  While officials said there could be some impact on individual terminals,  they estimated that the terminals could likely replace any lost food aid  container cargo with other container cargo.", "The large coastal container ports like Norfolk, Charleston, and Seattle  would also likely experience little impact since the volumes of food aid  cargo involved comprise a very small percentage of their total business.  For instance, Norfolk handled 12 million tons of cargo in 2003, of which  70,000 tons were food aid that they stuffed into containers at the port,  according to a port official. Norfolk did not track how much food aid it  handled that was already in containers. The port official in Charleston  estimated that food aid was about 1 percent of its cargo, while the official  in Seattle estimated about 3 to 4 percent. These ports would experience  little impact from a bagged tonnage limitation on MSF carriers, according  to these officials. However, they said that the terminals at the ports that  stuff the bagged food aid into the containers might be affected.", "A port of Chicago representative expressed the greatest concern about the  potential impact from a tonnage limitation, although food aid cargo is a  small portion of Chicago\u2019s total cargo. MSF carriers transport most of the  section 17 cargo reserved for Great Lakes ports, and the majority of it goes  through the port of Chicago. The port official said that the port valued food  aid cargo because it was relatively more labor intensive and generated  more jobs than other types of cargo. The preponderance of food aid cargo  going through the port of Chicago is handled at a single terminal, whose  business could be damaged, depending on the nature and extent of the  impact. If MSF carrier participation in food aid shipments is severely  curtailed and other carriers do not step in to carry section 17 cargo, the  terminal could be seriously affected. In addition, the port official said that  one benefit of the section 17 provision was that it helped make Midwestern  commodity suppliers more competitive when their cargo could be loaded  in nearby Great Lakes ports instead of being transported to Gulf ports. The  official said that the regional effort to encourage more food aid commodity  sourcing from Midwestern suppliers could also be affected if section 17  bagged cargo was curtailed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["While we make no recommendations in this report, we believe that our  analysis provides important insights into the nature of competition  between MSF and non-MSF carriers for food aid shipments. A sharp drop in  bulk food aid shipments in fiscal years 2000 and 2001 suggests that  competition for bagged food aid has become more intense. In those years,  MSF carriers captured a large share of the business, but market share of  bagged shipments shifted toward the non-MSF carriers in fiscal years 2002  and 2003. The two segments of the industry appear to be finding ways to  respond to the changes in food aid, but this time frame is too short to  determine any clear trends.", "We also believe that our analysis of a potential limit on the MSF carriers\u2019  food aid shipments provides some findings that are not obvious without a  close examination of the system. One finding is that, if MSF carriers have  certain options in responding to a tonnage limit that would mitigate the  impacts of that limit, the potential decline in food aid shipments by this  group would be less than the total volume of food aid carried on voyages  over the limit. This result would occur if MSF vessels carry some food aid  up to the limit on affected voyages, and in some cases choose to forfeit  subsidy payments in favor of carrying profitable shipments above the limit.  To the extent that MSF carriers do choose to carry food aid over the limit  and forfeit the subsidies, a tonnage limit may not lead to a large shift in  food aid shipments and financial benefits to non-MSF vessels. Where any  financial effects of food tonnage limitations would accrue remains  uncertain. For example, MARAD subsidy payments could be lower if MSF  carriers continue to carry food aid. However, food aid agencies could face  higher costs if the limits resulted in fewer and more expensive options for  some shipments, and these agencies have emphasized their concerns that  additional constraints on food aid shipments could impede their ability to  provide food aid to meet critical humanitarian needs.", "Finally, it is important to recognize the limits of any effort to predict the  future course of events in an area in which key factors are so volatile. For  example, the volume of food aid shipments has varied greatly over recent  years, and the relationship between food aid and export subsidies is also  under discussion in the WTO negotiations. The outcome of MARAD\u2019s  efforts to support the two key maritime sectors is clearly influenced by the  level and composition of food aid, so long-term trends and even  fluctuations in food aid shipments will affect the program. Second, the  importance and profitability of food aid, compared with other commercial  or preference cargo, has a large influence on the health of the various firms  and components of the industry, and the volume and prices for these  alternative cargoes can also change significantly. In these cases, firms may  decide to move vessels into or out of the program, which will have an effect  on the existing operators."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["USAID, USDA, and DOD provided written comments on a draft of this  report, which are reproduced in appendixes IV, V, and VI. USAID stated that  we used sound and logical methodologies to analyze the data and  accurately identified trends pertaining to MSF and non-MSF carriers that  carried food aid over a 5-year period. USAID agreed that predicting the  impact of a tonnage limitation is difficult and said it takes a cautious  approach to changes, citing concerns regarding impacts on administrative  systems and the ability to meet foreign assistance objectives. USDA said  that the report adequately summarized USDA\u2019s major concerns over the  impact on food aid programs that could result from a bagged cargo tonnage  limitation placed on MSF carriers, including decreased food aid timeliness,  increased administrative burdens, and increased shipping costs. DOD  generally concurred with our findings. It stated that it would oppose any  change in cargo preference that would adversely impact the U.S. merchant  marine because it believed there would be negative impacts on DOD  mobilization capabilities. DOT provided oral comments. DOT said that the  draft report provided a thoughtful analysis of the potential impact of  tonnage limits on food aid shipments and how they might affect the U.S.- flag shipping industry. However, DOT identified issues with some factors,  and the way they are considered, in the simulation model we used to  estimate the range of impacts from different tonnage limits. In addition,  USAID and DOT provided technical comments, which we incorporated in  the report as appropriate.", "DOT officials, including the Director of MARAD\u2019s Cargo Preference  Program, said that they identified issues with some factors and the way  they are considered in the simulation model used in our analysis of  potential impacts of a tonnage limitation. In particular, these officials  suggested that the draft report and its simulation model could have more  thoroughly explored the effects of three factors: (1) MSF carriers\u2019 ability to  replace food aid cargo with commercial cargo, (2) the industry\u2019s reluctance  to carry cargo over the limit and forfeit the subsidy, and (3) the logistical  constraints on carriers\u2019 ability to operate under a low tonnage limit.  Specifically, with respect to replacing food aid cargo, DOT officials  questioned whether sufficient commercial cargo is actually available in the  marketplace to replace food aid cargo for MSF vessels. With respect to  carrying cargo above the limit and forfeiting the subsidy, DOT emphasized  that all five MSF carriers stated they would not give up their subsidy to  carry food aid. DOT officials stated their view that logistical limitations,  which would further constrain MSF carriers\u2019 ability to carry food aid  shipments under low tonnage limits, may be underestimated in the model.  While the DOT officials recognized these factors are acknowledged in the  draft report as limitations on the model\u2019s predictive value, they emphasized  their view that the cumulative effect of more thoroughly exploring them in  the model might have led us to conclude that the imposition of tonnage  limits could be more detrimental to MSF than the results otherwise  indicated. As a result, the officials suggested the model\u2019s limitations be  more extensively and prominently recognized in the body of the report.  Finally, the DOT officials emphasized their agreement with the aspect of  our observations that the imposition of any tonnage limit on MSF vessels  could drive up costs for the food aid program and decrease efficiency by  limiting competition and increasing freight charges.", "We agree that MSF carriers may face constraints in terms of their options in  responding to a tonnage limitation. Specifically, we agree that carriers may  have restricted flexibility in managing contract amounts to keep food aid  shipments below limits and still carry food aid, and in replacing lost food  aid with other cargo. Our simulation analysis specifically incorporates  uncertainty in these factors, and we have modified our report language in  several places to clarify the range of assumptions concerning those and  other variables, and the implications of the uncertainty regarding our  results. Additional detail about how these factors are treated in our  analysis is presented in the following paragraphs. With respect to whether  carriers would in some cases carry food aid above a tonnage limit and forgo  the subsidy for affected days, we agree that including that assumption is  important to our simulation model results. Our simulation model  represents the outcome when carriers choose the most profitable option  available on each voyage, and vessel data reported by MSF carriers suggest  that there are times when carriers would have the financial incentive to  carry food aid above the limit and forfeit their subsidy payment for that  voyage. The presentation of our simulation model results makes it clear  that option is an important one in carriers being able to mitigate the impact  of a tonnage limitation. If carriers never forgo the subsidy, the impacts of a  limitation on MSF carriers would be greater. Neither carriers nor MARAD  provided us a reason why they would not ever forgo a subsidy.", "The simulation model incorporates the likelihood that MSF carriers would  face logistical constraints in managing food aid contracts to continue  carrying food aid amounts near but under the limit. It reflects possibilities  ranging from carriers being able to carry food aid exactly up to the limit  amount\u2014for example 2,500 tons\u2014to not being able to carry any food aid  on the share of voyages above the limit. We tested the sensitivity of our  simulation results to the particular probability distribution assumed for this  variable; and we found that if carriers are assumed to have less flexibility in  managing food aid tonnage below a limit, the average values for the  impacts would differ somewhat from the averages we reported. For  example, for one alternative distribution assuming less flexibility, the  average value of food aid tonnage that carriers would have to give up or  lose the subsidy for the voyage increased from about 92,000 tons to about  109,000 tons.", "Similarly, our simulation model allows for the possibility that MSF carriers  would be unable to replace any food aid above a limit with commercial or  nonfood preference cargo. However, most MSF carriers reported that they  are currently sailing near full capacity, with a range of capacity utilization  rates that together average 90 percent. The simulation model relies on  these reported capacity utilization rates to determine the most likely value  for the share of food aid effectively above the limit that carriers might be  able to replace with other cargo. However, the simulation model reflects a  range of probabilities with respect to carriers being able to replace lost  food aid cargo and achieve their current (based on the fiscal year 2001 to  2003 data we analyzed) average capacity utilization, and includes at one  extreme the possibility that no lost food aid tonnage will be replaced.", "To the extent that these constraints strongly affect MSF carriers\u2019 ability to  respond to tonnage limits, then the high end of the range of possible results  suggested by the simulation model should be considered. For example, if  MSF carriers face significant logistical constraints to carrying food aid up  to the limit, then, under a tonnage limit of 2,500 tons, they are more likely  to have an annual 138,000 tons of food aid effectively above the limit,  compared with the annual 61,000 tons of food aid effectively above the  limit as estimated by the simulation\u2019s low value results.", "In addition to the potential impacts of a tonnage limit that are suggested by  the simulation model under certain assumptions, there are potential  structural constraints we were not able to reliably quantify and include in  the model. One example is the potential impact on MSF carriers\u2019 total  tonnage and revenues if a tonnage limit were to jeopardize their vessel  sharing agreements. As we stated in the report, these types of structural  constraints could challenge MSF carriers in being able to effectively  respond to a tonnage limit at any level.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretaries of USDA, DOD, and DOT, and the  Administrator of USAID.

To account for  variation in the values of our estimates, we performed a Monte Carlo  simulation that varied the impact model approximately 20,000 times from  probability distributions characterizing possible values for variables, such  as the percent of food aid above the limit that carriers replace with other  cargo, the freight rate for other cargo, and the cost differential between  food aid and other cargo. This simulation resulted in a range of estimates,  under certain assumptions, for the likely total decline in MSF food aid  tonnage and net revenues on an annual basis. A technical discussion of the  simulation model and the results at a 5,000-ton limitation is provided in  appendix II. We examined USDA\u2019s food aid shipment data and carrier\u2019s  vessel estimates for their reliability and appropriateness for our purposes.  For USDA\u2019s data, we performed electronic testing of the data, verification  of the data against other sources, and interviews with agency officials that  manage the data. Although we were able to do only limited verification of  the self-reported data from carriers, we found both sources to be  sufficiently reliable to inform our simulation model. In addition, we  supplemented our simulation results with information that both MSF and  non-MSF carriers provided in interviews pertaining to any structural  constraints they may face in responding to a tonnage limitation.", "To examine how establishing a bagged cargo preference tonnage limitation  on MSF vessels would potentially affect the program agencies, we  reviewed the current extent of data collection and procedures for tracking  food aid shipments to see if additional administrative burdens would be  entailed. We also interviewed agency officials at USDA, USAID, MARAD,  and DOD.", "To examine how establishing a bagged cargo preference tonnage limitation  on MSF vessels would potentially affect the ports that service food aid  shipments by MSF and non-MSF carriers, we analyzed food aid shipment  data from USDA that identified the ports used for each shipment for fiscal  years 1999 to 2003. We also conducted telephone interviews with  representatives of eight major food aid ports (Charleston, South Carolina;  Chicago, Illinois; Houston and Jacintoport, Texas; Lake Charles and New  Orleans, Louisiana; Norfolk, Virginia; and Seattle, Washington) to obtain  additional information, including their assessment of the potential impact  of a limitation on their port.", "We performed our work from February through August 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Simulating Potential Impacts of a Bagged Tonnage Limitation", "paragraphs": ["This appendix describes the data and methodology that we used to analyze  the impact of a bagged tonnage limitation on MSF and presents some  additional estimates not contained in the letter portion of this report. This  simulation analysis is based on certain assumptions regarding carrier  options and responses and makes use of food aid data from agencies,  reported vessel revenue and cost estimates for recent years, and  information from interviews about the food aid industry. The three  potential carrier responses incorporated into our model include an MSF  vessel\u2019s potential ability to continue carrying some food aid on affected  voyages, replace some food aid with other cargo, and forfeit its subsidy for  food aid contracts that are sufficiently profitable. Our methodology  illustrates that, depending on the degree to which these options exist for  MSF, carriers may reduce the overall tonnage and net revenue impacts of a  limit. These estimates reflect some probability that carriers will face  constraints in how they respond to limits, however, there is uncertainty  associated with some of the assumptions of the model. Carriers may face  additional logistical or structural constraints relating to program  requirements or company characteristics that would limit their responses  to a greater degree than our simulation reflects. Moreover, future market  conditions may differ from those reflected in recent data, such that our  analysis could not be used as a forecast. Thus, while our simulation can  help decision-makers understand important factors that should be taken  into account when considering tonnage limits\u2014and develops a range of  impact estimates based on recent years that reflect those factors\u2014actual  impacts could be near the outer limits of or fall outside our estimated  ranges."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To analyze the impacts of a tonnage limit on MSF vessels, we collected data  on key tonnage and revenue variables from a variety of sources for fiscal  years 2001 to 2003. To create a list of MSF vessel voyages that carried food  aid tonnage above a potential limit, we examined USDA\u2019s food aid shipment  data and identified 123 vessel voyages. We paired this voyage list with  estimates we collected from the MSF carriers on each vessel\u2019s annual costs  and annual tonnage and freight rates for commercial cargo, food aid cargo,  and nonfood aid preference cargo. We also calculated the subsidy per  voyage each MSF vessel earns, based on the number of days per voyage in  that vessel\u2019s regularly scheduled outbound service.", "To estimate a range of impacts for a tonnage limitation under certain  assumptions, we explicitly consider three options that MSF carriers may  potentially have in responding to such a limit. For affected voyages, an MSF  carrier may be able to (1) continue carrying some food aid up to the limit,  (2) replace some food aid above a limit with other cargo, and (3) continue  carrying food aid above a limit if it were more profitable than the subsidy  payment for that voyage plus any net revenue from replacing the food aid  with other cargo. As discussed below, we rely on assumptions about the  degree to which carriers may be able to respond in these three ways to  assign probabilities to a probability distribution. Table 4 shows that we use  the following five probability distributions to calculate a range of impacts  for MSF carriers under a tonnage limitation. Each of these distributions is  discussed further in the text following table 4. 1. USDA and USAID reported that the food aid tonnage on a voyage often  comprises multiple food aid contracts such that carriers may be able to  continue to bid only on those shipments providing tonnage under the  limit. However, since food aid contract terms vary, the degree to which  MSF carriers can maximize carrying food aid up to the limit will also  vary. As a result, we include in our simulation an assumption that  carriers will most likely be able to carry tonnage up to the level of the  limit (based on profit maximization principles), but we use a  probability distribution that includes a range of values for the amount  of food aid that the vessel could potentially lose\u2014otherwise stated as  the amount of food aid effectively above the limit. For example, at a  limit of 5,000 tons, for an MSF voyage with 6,000 tons of food aid, only  1,000 tons of food aid could be effectively above the limit. However, if  MSF carriers had less flexibility in managing food aid tonnage, up to the  entire 6,000 tons could be effectively above the tonnage limit.  2. We asked carriers to provide information about their current capacity  utilization as an indication of the most likely value for the share of food  aid they may be able to replace. Reported capacity utilization rates  were high for all carriers with a range of values averaging 90 percent.  However, we note the uncertainty regarding how close to the reported  capacity utilization rates carriers would be able to come through  replacing lost food aid tonnage with other cargo. We use a probability  distribution to incorporate this uncertainty that allows for the  possibility that carriers would not be able to replace any lost food aid  with other cargo.  3. We asked carriers to provide their average freight rates for commercial  cargo and nonfood aid preference cargo as an indication of the most  likely freight rate they may receive on replacement cargo. Using  annually weighted information from the five MSF carriers on all of their  vessel voyages, we calculated a standard deviation and used this  variation to apply a range of values for each voyage to reflect likely  freight rates for other cargo, subject to certain constraints.", "4.", "If MSF carriers replace food aid above a limit with other cargo, they are  also likely to experience a change in costs. We found that it is generally  more costly for the MSF to carry a ton of food aid than it is to carry a  ton of commercial cargo. Based on interviews with carriers and  industry experts, we incorporate, across the model, a range of values  for this additional food aid cost differential around a most likely  estimate of $30 per ton.", "If carriers alter the total tonnage on a vessel voyage, their costs will also  vary. We do not have data pertaining to the percentage of MSF total vessel  costs that vary with tonnage levels. Based on broad estimates from MARAD  that around 40 percent of vessel costs are for overhead or fixed items, we  consider a wide range of values around the remaining 60 percent of total  costs.", "To incorporate these five assumptions into our impact estimates, we  performed a Monte Carlo simulation. In this simulation, values were  randomly drawn 20,000 times from probability distributions characterizing  possible values for impact variables discussed above and listed in table 4.  Under assumptions described by probability distributions selected for  these impact variables, the simulation yields estimates for the total decline  in both MSF food aid tonnage and net revenues on an annual basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Summary of Results", "paragraphs": ["Using our simulation model, we analyzed the tonnage and net revenue  impacts on MSF of a food aid limit at 5,000 and 2,500 tons. Results for a  2,500-ton limit are presented in the letter portion of this report while table 5  provides the results for a 5,000-ton limit. As shown in table 5, the estimated  decline in MSF food aid tonnage under this limitation ranges from around  3,000 to 13,000 tons, a decline significantly less than the total tonnage on  voyages affected by the limit\u201446,000 tons. In this analysis, carriers are  estimated to replace food aid above the limit with 1,000 to 11,000 tons of  other cargo and continue to carry 5,000 tons to 31,000 tons of food aid  above the tonnage limit. The total decline in net revenues for this group  would range from roughly $500,000 to $1 million.", "According to this analysis, the impact estimates for a limit at both 2,500 and  5,000 tons are influenced most by variations in assumptions pertaining to  the amount of food aid effectively above the limit for each voyage, and the  share of food aid above the limit that carriers may be able to replace with  other cargo. A higher value for the amount of food aid effectively above the  limit tends to increase the estimate for the total decline in MSF net  revenues because MSF carriers are less able to maximize carrying food aid  up to the limit. A higher value for the share of food aid above the limit that  carriers might replace with other cargo tends to lower the estimate for the  total decline in MSF net revenues because carriers are earning more money  from replacement cargo. However, this assumption tends to raise the  estimate for the total decline in MSF food aid tonnage carried because it  makes the option of forfeiting the subsidy payment to carry food aid above  the limit less profitable.", "This simulation model has certain limitations resulting from two broad  areas of uncertainty not incorporated into the estimates. First, MSF  carriers may face logistical or structural constraints as imposed by  program requirements or company characteristics that would alter their  response to a tonnage limit in ways our simulation does not reflect. For  example, if an MSF carrier decides never to carry food aid above a limit\u2014-  even if it is profitable to do so, net of a forfeited subsidy payment\u2014then the  total food aid tonnage available to the non-MSF carriers would also  increase. In addition, vessel financial data are based on estimates of annual  averages and may not incorporate the entire range of variation for every  variable. One example might include a higher food aid cost differential  associated with an emergency food aid shipment to a remote area with  particularly expensive contract terms.", "Second, our model relies on data from fiscal years 2001 to 2003, which may  not be an accurate indicator of future food aid program levels, future food  aid program requirements, or the future number of U.S.-flag vessels  participating in cargo preference. For example, if future food aid program  levels decline, then the overall tonnage and revenue changes from a shift in  the MSF\u2019s food aid market share would also likely decline. Therefore, to the  extent that our model\u2019s assumptions do not adequately reflect these two  broad areas of uncertainty, the impacts of a tonnage limit could lie outside  our estimated ranges."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Profile of Maritime Security Fleet", "paragraphs": ["The Maritime Security Fleet currently comprises 47 vessels operated by 12  companies.
