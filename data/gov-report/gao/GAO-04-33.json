As requested, GAO addressed (1) the regulatory actions that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has taken and the technological and operational improvements, called advancements, that are available or are being developed to address common safety and health issues in large commercial airliner cabins and (2) the barriers, if any, that the United States faces in implementing such advancements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FAA has taken a number of regulatory actions over the past several decades to address safety and health issues faced by passengers and flight attendants in large commercial airliner cabins. GAO identified 18 completed actions, including those that require safer seats, cushions with better fire-blocking properties, better floor emergency lighting, and emergency medical kits. GAO also identified 28 advancements that show potential to further improve cabin safety and health. These advancements vary in their readiness for deployment. Fourteen are mature, currently available, and used in some airliners. Among these are inflatable lap seat belts, exit doors over the wings that swing out on hinges instead of requiring manual removal, and photoluminescent floor lighting. The other 14 advancements are in various stages of research, engineering, and development in the United States, Canada, or Europe. Several factors have slowed the implementation of airliner cabin safety and health advancements. For example, when advancements are ready for commercial use, factors that may hinder their implementation include the time it takes for (1) FAA to complete the rule-making process, (2) U.S. and foreign aviation authorities to resolve differences between their respective requirements, and (3) the airlines to adopt or install advancements after FAA has approved their use. When advancements are not ready for commercial use because they require further research, FAA's processes for setting research priorities and selecting research projects may not ensure that the limited federal funding for cabin safety and health research is allocated to the most critical and cost-effective projects. In particular, FAA does not obtain autopsy and survivor information from NTSB after it investigates a crash. This information could help FAA identify and target research to the primary causes of death and injury. In addition, FAA does not typically perform detailed analyses of the costs and effectiveness of potential cabin occupant safety and health advancements, which could help it identify and target research to the most cost-effective projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Airline travel is one of the safest modes of public transportation in the  United States, in large part because of the Congress\u2019s, Federal Aviation  Administration\u2019s (FAA), commercial airlines\u2019, aircraft manufacturers\u2019, and  airports\u2019 combined efforts to prevent commercial airliner accidents.  Furthermore, although a few airliner accidents are catastrophic, there are  survivors in a majority of crashes. According to the National  Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), passengers survived in 19 of the 26  U.S. large commercial airliner accidents that occurred from 1982 through  2001, and in these 19 accidents, over 76 percent of the passengers (1,523 of  1,988) survived. Additionally, some of the passengers who died in these  accidents might have survived if they had been better protected from the  impact of the crash or from the effects of smoke and fire and had been  better able to evacuate the airliner. This possibility of survival has led  federal safety officials to focus their efforts not only on preventing airliner  accidents, but also on increasing the chances of surviving them.", "Over the past several decades, FAA has been taking regulatory actions to  require the implementation of technological and operational improvements  in cabin occupant safety and health to help increase passengers\u2019 chances of  surviving large commercial airliner accidents. In addition, FAA and the  aviation community have been conducting research on new technological  and operational improvements, which we refer to in this report as  advancements, whose implementation could further increase passengers\u2019  chances of survival and improve the safety and health of passengers and  flight attendants. This report discusses regulatory actions that FAA has  taken as well as potential advancements in cabin occupant safety and  health that are (1) currently available but not yet implemented or installed,  and (2) not yet available and subject to additional research to advance the  technology or lower costs. For implementation of these advancements to  occur, FAA often has to take regulatory action, that is, issuing regulations  or airworthiness directives that require the implementation of  technological and operational improvements in cabin occupant safety and  health. FAA continues to pursue regulatory initiatives as well as conduct  research to improve cabin occupant safety and health. The aviation  community is also attempting to enhance the safety and health of those  traveling and working in airliner cabins through such measures as  providing earlier warnings of turbulence and information on the potential  to develop blood clots on long-distance flights. Besides increasing cabin  occupants\u2019 safety and health, these actions and efforts could benefit the  airlines by helping to restore passengers\u2019 confidence in the safety of flight  and thereby increasing the demand for air travel, which fell sharply after  September 11, 2001, and still remains below fiscal year 2000 levels.", "In response to your request, this report addresses the following questions:  (1) What regulatory actions has FAA taken, and what key advancements  are available or being developed by FAA and others to address safety and  health issues faced by passengers and flight attendants in large commercial  airliner cabins?

As part of this effort, FAA officials identified  key regulatory actions that had been completed in this area. In addition, we  interviewed other aviation safety experts in government, industry, and  academia from the United States, Canada, and Europe. (See app. I for  additional information.) Through our reviews and interviews, we found  that FAA\u2019s regulatory actions and advancements fell into four broad  categories\u2014three related to safety in the event of a crash and one related  to general cabin occupant safety and health. The regulatory actions and  advancements related to safety in the event of a crash are those actions  taken to (1) minimize injuries from the impact of a crash, (2) prevent fire or  mitigate its effects, and (3) improve the chances and speed of evacuation.  In addition, we discuss the regulatory actions and advancements FAA has  taken to address a fourth category\u2014improving the safety and health of  cabin occupants. Using the results of our reviews and interviews, we  identified and categorized 28 advancements that are currently available or  being developed, including 5 impact advancements, 8 fire advancements,  10 evacuation advancements, and 5 cabin occupant safety and health  advancements. For each of these advancements, we discuss the  background, research, and regulatory status. We also discuss each  advancement\u2019s technological readiness for use in the existing commercial  airliner fleet or in newly produced commercial airplanes. To identify  factors that have slowed implementation of airliner cabin occupant safety  and health advancements, we interviewed FAA, NTSB, and industry  officials. In addition, we analyzed documentation from FAA, NTSB, and  aviation safety experts to identify factors relating to key issues within FAA  and the aviation community related to prioritizing and funding research,  choosing advancements for regulatory implementation, and gaining the  aviation community\u2019s acceptance of these advancements.", "This report does not address cabin air quality because we are doing work in  this area for another congressional requester.

Aircraft manufacturers are responsible for designing aircraft that  meet FAA\u2019s safety standards, and air carriers are responsible for operating  and maintaining their aircraft in accordance with the standards for safety  and maintenance established in FAA\u2019s regulations. FAA, in turn, certifies  aircraft designs and monitors the industry\u2019s compliance with the  regulations.", "FAA\u2019s general process for issuing a regulation, or rule, includes several  steps. When the regulation would require the implementation of a  technology or operation, FAA first certifies that the technology or  operation is safe. Then, FAA publishes a notice of proposed rule-making in  the Federal Register, which sets forth the terms of the rule and establishes  a period for the public to comment on it.  Next, FAA reviews the comments  by incorporating changes into the rule that it believes are warranted, and,  in some instances, it repeats these steps one or more times. Finally, FAA  publishes a final rule in the Federal Register.  The final rule includes the  date when it will go into effect and a time line for compliance.", "Within FAA, the Aircraft Certification Service is responsible for certifying  that technologies are safe, including improvements to cabin occupant  safety and health, generally through the issuance of new regulations, a  finding certifying an equivalent level of safety, or a special condition when  no rule covers the new technology. The Certification Service is also  responsible for taking enforcement action to ensure the continued safety of  aircraft by prescribing standards for aircraft manufacturers governing the  design, production, and airworthiness of aeronautical products, such as  cabin interiors. The Flight Standards Service is primarily responsible for  certifying an airline\u2019s operations (assessing the airline\u2019s ability to carry out  its operations and maintain the airworthiness of the aircraft) and for  monitoring the operations and maintenance of the airline\u2019s fleet.", "FAA conducts research on cabin occupant safety and health issues in two  research facilities, the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center/Civil  Aerospace Medical Institute in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and the William  J. Hughes Technical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The institute  focuses on the impact of flight operations on human health, while the  technical center focuses on improvements in aircraft design, operation, and  maintenance and inspection to prevent accidents and improve survivability.  For the institute or the technical center to conduct research on a project,  an internal FAA requester must sponsor the project. For example, FAA\u2019s  Office of Regulation and Certification sponsors much of the two facilities\u2019  work in support of FAA\u2019s rule-making activities. FAA also cooperates on  cabin safety research with the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA), academic institutions, and private research  organizations.", "Until recently, NASA conducted research on airplane crashworthiness at its  Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. However, because of  internal budget reallocations and a decision to devote more of its funds to  aviation security, NASA terminated the Langley Center\u2019s research on the  crashworthiness of commercial aircraft in 2002. NASA continues to  conduct fire-related research on cabin safety issues at its Glenn Research  Center in Cleveland, Ohio.", "NTSB has the authority to investigate civil aviation accidents and collects  data on the causes of injuries and death for the victims of commercial  airliner accidents. According to NTSB, the majority of fatalities in  commercial airliner accidents are attributable to crash impact forces and  the effects of fire and smoke. Specifically, 306 (66 percent) of the 465  fatalities in partially survivable U.S. aviation accidents from 1983 through  2000 died from impact forces, 131 (28 percent) died from fire and smoke,  and 28 (6 percent) died from other causes.", "Surviving an airplane crash depends on a number of factors. The space  surrounding a passenger must remain large enough to prevent the  passenger from being crushed. The force of impact must also be reduced to  levels that the passenger can withstand, either by spreading the impact  over a larger part of the body or by increasing the duration of the impact  through an energy-absorbing seat or fuselage. The passenger must be  restrained in a seat to avoid striking the interior of the airplane, and the  seat must not become detached from the floor. Objects within the airplane,  such as debris, overhead luggage bins, luggage, and galley equipment, must  not strike the passenger. A fire in the cabin must be prevented, or, if one  does start, it must burn slowly enough and produce low enough levels of  toxic gases to allow the passenger to escape from the airplane. If there is a  fire, the passenger must not have sustained injuries that prevent him or her  from escaping quickly. Finally, if the passenger escapes serious injury from  impact and fire, he or she must have access to exit doors and slides or  other means of evacuation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulatory Actions Have Been Taken and Additional Advancements Are Under Way to Improve Cabin Occupants\u2019 Safety and Health", "paragraphs": ["Over the past several decades, FAA has taken a number of regulatory  actions designed to improve the safety and health of airline passengers and  flight attendants by (1) minimizing injuries from the impact of a crash, (2)  preventing fire or mitigating its effects, (3) improving the chances and  speed of evacuation, or (4) improving the safety and health of cabin  occupants. (See app. III for more information on the regulatory actions  FAA has taken to improve cabin occupant safety and health.) Specifically,  we identified 18 completed regulatory actions that FAA has taken since  1984. In addition to these past actions, FAA and others in the aviation  community are pursuing advancements in these four areas to improve  cabin occupant safety and health in the future. We identified and reviewed  28 such advancements\u20145 to reduce the impact of a crash on occupants, 8  to prevent or mitigate fire and its effects, 10 to facilitate evacuation from  aircraft, and 5 to address general cabin occupant safety and health issues.", "Minimizing Injuries from the  The primary cause of injury and death for cabin occupants in an airliner  Impact of a Crash \t accident is the impact of the crash itself. We identified two key regulatory  actions that FAA has taken to better protect passengers from impact  forces. For example, in 1988, FAA required stronger passenger seats for  newly manufactured commercial airplanes to improve protection in  survivable crashes. These new seats are capable, for example, of  withstanding an impact force that is approximately 16 times a passenger\u2019s  body weight (16g), rather than 9 times (9g), and must be tested dynamically  (in multiple directions to simulate crash conditions), rather than statically  (e.g., drop testing to assess the damage from the force of the weight alone  without motion). In addition, in 1992, FAA issued a requirement for  corrective action (airworthiness directive) for designs found not to meet  the existing rules for overhead storage bins on certain Boeing aircraft, to  improve their crashworthiness after bin failures were observed in the 1989  crash of an airliner in Kegworth, England, and a 1991 crash near  Stockholm, Sweden.", "We also identified five key advancements that are being pursued to provide  cabin occupants with greater impact protection in the future. These  advancements are either under development or currently available.  Examples include the following:", "Lap seat belts with inflatable air bags: Lap seat belts that contain  inflatable air bags have been developed by private companies and are  currently available to provide passengers with added protection during  a crash. About 1,000 of these lap seat belts have been installed on  commercial airplanes, primarily in the seats facing wall dividers  (bulkheads) to prevent passengers from sustaining head injuries during  a crash. (See fig. 1.)", "Improved seating systems: Seat safety depends on several interrelated  systems operating properly, and, therefore, an airline seat is most  accurately discussed as a system. New seating system designs are being  developed by manufacturers to incorporate new safety and aesthetic  designs as well as meet FAA\u2019s 16g seat regulations to better protect  passengers from impact forces. These seating systems would help to  ensure that the seats themselves perform as expected (i.e., they stay  attached to the floor tracks); the space between the seats remains  adequate in a crash; and the equipment in the seating area, such as  phones and video screens, does not increase the impact hazard.", "Child safety seats: Child safety seats could provide small children with  additional protection in the event of an airliner crash. NTSB and others  have recommended their use, and FAA has been involved in this issue  for at least 15 years. While it has used its rule-making process to  consider requiring their use, FAA decided not to require child safety  restraints because its analysis found that if passengers were required to  pay full fare for children under the age of 2, some parents would choose  to travel by automobile and, statistically, the chances would increase  that both the children and the adults would be killed. FAA is continuing  to consider a child safety seat requirement.", "Appendix IV contains additional information on the impact advancements  we have identified."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Preventing Fire or Mitigating Its Effect", "paragraphs": ["Fire prevention and mitigation efforts have given passengers additional  time to evacuate an airliner following a crash or cabin fire. FAA has taken  seven key regulatory actions to improve fire detection, eliminate potential  fire hazards, prevent the spread of fires, and better extinguish them. For  example, to help prevent the spread of fire and give passengers more time  to escape, FAA upgraded fire safety standards to require that seat cushions  have fire-blocking layers, which resulted in airlines retrofitting 650,000  seats over a 3-year period. The agency also set new low heat/smoke  standards for materials used for large interior surfaces (e.g., sidewalls,  ceilings, and overhead bins), which FAA officials told us resulted in a  significant improvement in postcrash fire survivability. FAA also required  smoke detectors to be placed in lavatories and automatic fire extinguishers  in lavatory waste receptacles in 1986 and 1987, respectively. In addition, the  agency required airlines to retrofit their fleets with fire detection and  suppression systems in cargo compartments, which according to FAA,  applied to over 3,700 aircraft at a cost to airlines of $300 million. To better  extinguish fires when they do start, FAA also required, in 1985, that  commercial airliners carry two Halon fire extinguishers in addition to other  required extinguishers because of Halon\u2019s superior fire suppression  capabilities.", "We also identified 8 key advancements that are currently available and  awaiting implementation or are under development to provide additional  fire protection for cabin occupants in the future. Examples include the  following:", "Reduced flammability of insulation materials: To eliminate a potential  fire hazard, in May 2000, FAA required that air carriers replace  insulation blankets covered with a type of insulation known as  metalized Mylar\u00ae on specific aircraft by 2005, after it was found that the  material had ignited and contributed to the crash of Swiss Air Flight  111. Over 700 aircraft were affected by this requirement. In addition,  FAA issued a rule in July 2003 requiring that large commercial airplanes  manufactured after September 2, 2005, be equipped with thermal  acoustic insulation designed to an upgraded fire test standard that will  reduce the incidence and intensity of in-flight fires. In addition, after  September 2, 2007, newly manufactured aircraft must be equipped with  thermal acoustic materials designed to meet a new standard for burn- through resistance, providing passengers more time to escape during a  postcrash fire.", "Reduced fuel tank flammability: Flammable vapors in aircraft fuel  tanks can ignite. However, currently available technology can greatly  reduce this hazard by \u201cblanketing\u201d the fuel tank with nonexplosive  nitrogen-enriched air to suppress (\u201cinert\u201d) the potential for explosion of  the tank. The U.S. military has used this technology on selected aircraft  for 20 years, but U.S. commercial airlines have not adopted the  technology because of its cost and weight. FAA officials told us that the  military\u2019s technology was also unreliable and designed to meet military  rather than civilian airplane design requirements. FAA fire safety  experts have developed a lighter-weight inerting system for center fuel  tanks, which is simpler than the military system and potentially more  reliable. Reliability of this technology is a major concern for the aviation  industry. According to FAA officials, Boeing and Airbus began flight  testing this technology in July 2003 and August 2003, respectively. In  addition, the Air Transport Association (ATA) noted that inerting is only  one prospective component of an ongoing major program for fuel tank  safety, and that it has yet to be justified as feasible and cost-effective.", "Sensor technology: Sensors are currently being developed to better  detect overheated or burning materials. According to FAA and the  National Institute of Standards and Technology, many current smoke  and fire detectors are not reliable. For example, a recent FAA study  reported at least one false alarm per week in cargo compartment fire  detection systems. The new detectors are being developed by Airbus  and others in private industry to reduce the number of false alarms. In  addition, FAA is developing standards that would be used to approve  new, reduced false alarm sensors. NASA is also developing new sensors  and detectors.", "Water mist for extinguishing fires: Technology has been under  development for over two decades to dispense water mist during a fire  to protect passengers from heat and smoke and prevent the spread of  fire in the cabin. The most significant development effort has been made  by a European public-private consortium, FIREDETEX, with over 5  million euros of European Community funding and a total project cost  of over 10 million euros (over 10 million U.S. dollars). The development  of this system was prompted, in part, by the need to replace Halon,  when it was determined that this main firefighting agent used in fire  extinguishers aboard commercial airliners depletes ozone in the  atmosphere.", "Appendix V contains additional information on advancements that address  fire prevention and mitigation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving the Chances and Speed of Evacuation", "paragraphs": ["Enabling passengers to evacuate more quickly during an emergency has  saved lives.

Research has found that passengers often ignore the oral  briefings and do not familiarize themselves with the safety briefing  cards. FAA has requested that air carriers explore different ways to  present safety information to passengers, but FAA regulates only the  content of briefings. The presentation style of safety briefings is left up  to air carriers.", "Over-wing exit doors: Exit doors located over the wings of some  commercial airliners have been redesigned to \u201cswing out\u201d and away  from the aircraft so that cabin occupants can exit more easily during an  emergency. Currently, the over-wing exit doors on most U.S. commercial  airliners are \u201cself help\u201d doors and must be lifted and stowed by a  passenger, which can impede evacuation. (See fig. 2.) The redesigned  doors are now used on new-generation B-737 aircraft operated by one  U.S. and most European airlines. FAA does not currently require the use  of over-wing exit doors that swing out because the exit doors that are  removed manually meet the agency\u2019s safety standards. However, FAA is  working with the Europeans to develop common requirements for the  use of this type of exit door.", "Audio attraction signals: The United Kingdom\u2019s Civil Aviation  Authority and the manufacturer are testing audio attraction signals to  determine their usefulness to passengers in locating exit doors during  an evacuation.

For example, to prevent  passengers from being injured during turbulent conditions, FAA initiated  the Turbulence Happens campaign in 2000 to increase public awareness of  the importance of wearing seatbelts. The agency has advised the airlines to  warn passengers to fasten their seatbelts when turbulence is expected, and  the airlines generally advise or require passengers to keep their seat belts  fastened while seated to help avoid injuries from unexpected turbulence.  FAA has also required the airlines to equip their fleets with emergency  medical kits since 1986.

According to ATA, most airlines have already done so.", "Enhanced emergency medical kits: In 1998, the Congress directed FAA  to collect data for 1 year on the types of in-flight medical emergencies  that occurred to determine if existing medical kits should be upgraded.  On the basis of the data collected, FAA issued a rule that required the  contents of existing emergency medical kits to be expanded to deal with  a broader range of emergencies. U.S. commercial airliners are required  to carry these enhanced emergency medical kits by 2004. Most U.S.  airlines have already completed this upgrade, according to ATA.", "Advance warning of turbulence: New airborne weather radar and other  technologies are currently being developed and evaluated to improve  the detection of turbulence and increase the time available to cabin  occupants to avert potential injuries. FAA\u2019s July 2003 draft strategic plan  established a performance target of reducing injuries to cabin occupants  caused by turbulence. To achieve this objective, FAA plans to continue  evaluating new airborne weather radars and other technologies that  broadly address weather issues, including turbulence. In addition, the  draft strategic plan set a performance target of reducing serious injuries  caused by turbulence by 33 percent by fiscal year 2008--using the  average for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 of 15 injuries per year as the  baseline and reducing this average to no more than 10 per year.", "Improve awareness of radiation exposure: Flight attendants and  passengers who fly frequently can be exposed to higher levels of  radiation on a cumulative basis than the general public. High levels of  radiation have been linked to an increased risk of cancer and potential  harm to fetuses. To help passengers and crew members estimate their  past and future radiation exposure levels, FAA developed a computer  model, which is publicly available on its Web site  http://www.jag.cami.jccbi.gov/cariprofile.asp. However, the extent to  which flight attendants and frequent flyers are aware of cosmic  radiation\u2019s risks and make use of FAA\u2019s computer model is unclear.  Agency officials told us that they plan to install a counter capability on  its Civil Aerospace Medical Institute Web site to track the number of  visits to its aircrew and passenger health and safety Web site. FAA also  plans to issue an Advisory Circular by early next year, which  incorporates the findings of a just completed FAA report, \u201cWhat  Aircrews Should Know About Their Occupational Exposure to Ionizing  Radiation.\u201d This Advisory Circular will include recommended actions  for aircrews and information on solar flare event notification of  aircrews. In contrast, airlines in Europe abide by more stringent  requirements for helping to ensure that cabin and flight crew members  do not receive excessive doses of radiation from performing their flight  duties during a given year. For example, in May 1996, the European  Union issued a directive for workers, including air carrier crew  members (cabin and flight crews) and the general public, on basic safety  and health protections against dangers arising from ionizing radiation.  This directive set dose limits and required air carriers to (1) assess and  monitor the exposure of all crew members to avoid exceeding exposure  limits, (2) work with those individuals at risk of high exposure levels to  adjust their work or flight schedules to reduce those levels, and (3)  inform crew members of the health risks that their work involves from  exposure to radiation. It also required airlines to work with female crew  members, when they announce a pregnancy, to avoid exposing the fetus  to harmful levels of radiation. This directive was binding for all  European Union member states and became effective in May 2000.", "Improved awareness of potential health effects related to flying: Air  travel may exacerbate some medical conditions.

In 1992, FAA and JAA began  harmonizing their requirements for (1) the design, manufacture, operation,  and maintenance of civil aircraft and related product parts; (2) noise and  emissions from aircraft; and (3) flight crew licensing. Harmonizing the U.S.  Federal Aviation Regulations with the European Joint Aviation Regulations  is viewed by FAA as its most comprehensive long-term rule-making effort  and is considered critical to ensuring common safety standards and  minimizing the economic burden on the aviation industry that can result  from redundant inspection, evaluation, and testing requirements.", "According to both FAA and JAA, the process they have used to date to  harmonize their requirements for commercial aircraft has not effectively  prioritized their joint recommendations for harmonizing U.S. and European  aviation requirements, and led to many recommendations going  unpublished for years.

The agency subsequently permitted the use of this  material for floor lighting. In addition, FAA finalized a rule in July 2003 to  require a new type of insulation designed to delay fire burning though the  fuselage into the cabin during an accident. JAA favors a performance-based  standard that would specify a minimum delay in burn-through time, but  allow the use of different technologies to achieve the standard. FAA  officials said that the agency would consider other technologies besides  insulation to achieve burn-through protection but that it would be the  responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate that the technology provided  performance equivalent to that stipulated in the insulation rule.

NTSB makes  summary information on the crashes publicly available on its Web site, but  according to the FAA researchers, this information is not detailed enough  for their needs. For example, the researchers would like to develop a  complete autopsy database that would allow them to look for common  trends in accidents, among other things. In addition, the researchers would  like to know where survivors sat on the airplane, what routes they took to  exit, what problems they encountered, and what injuries they sustained.

Recognizing that it is less difficult to develop cost and  effectiveness information as research progresses, we are recommending  that FAA develop and use cost and effectiveness analyses to supplement its  current process. At later stages in the development process, we found that  this information can be developed fairly easily through cost and  effectiveness analyses using currently available data. For example, we  performed an analysis of the cost to implement inflatable lap seat belts  using a cost analysis methodology we developed (see app. VIII).

However, because FAA lacks detailed  autopsy and survivor information, it is hampered in its ability to identify the  principal causes of death and survival in commercial airliner crashes.  Without an agreement with the National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) to receive detailed autopsy and survivor information, FAA lacks  information that could be helpful in understanding the factors that  contribute to surviving a crash.

Two approaches are  being used to develop the agenda:", "The \u201chistoric approach\u201d is based on analyses of past accidents and has  led to the identification of seven initial focus areas\u2014controlled flight  into terrain, approach and landing, loss of control, design related,  weather, occupant safety and survivability, and runway safety.", "The \u201cpredictive approach\u201d or \u201cfuture hazards approach\u201d is based on an  identification of changes in the aviation system.", "JAA is cooperating in this effort with FAA and other regulatory bodies to  develop a worldwide safety agenda and avoid duplication of effort.

While JAA has no funding of its own  for research and development, it recommends research priorities to its  member states. However, JAA officials told us that member states\u2019 research  and development efforts are often driven by recent airliner accidents in the  member states, rather than by JAA\u2019s priorities. The planned shift from  expert judgment to a more data-driven approach will require more  coordination of aviation research and development across Europe. For  example, in January 2001, a stakeholder group formed by the European  Commissioner for Research issued a planning document entitled European  Aeronautics: A Vision for 2020, which, among other things, characterized  European aeronautics as a cross-border industry, whose research strategy  is shaped within national borders, leading to fragmentation rather than  coherence. The document called for better decision-making and more  efficient and effective research by the European Union, its member states,  and aeronautics stakeholders. JAA officials concurred with this  characterization of European aviation research and development.", "Changes lie ahead for JAA and aviation safety in Europe. The European  Union recently created a European Aviation Safety Agency, which will  gradually assume responsibility for rule-making, certification, and  standardization of the application of rules by the national aviation  authorities. This organization will eventually absorb all of JAA\u2019s functions  and activities.

In  a 1996 study by R.G.W Cherry & Associates, enhancing occupant restraint  was ranked as the second most important of 33 potential ways to improve  air crash survivability.

In other words, the \u201ctie-down\u201d  chain must remain intact. Although aircraft seat systems are designed to  withstand about 9 to 16 times the force of gravity, the limits of human  tolerance to impact substantially exceed the aircraft and seat design limits.  A number of seat and restraint devices have been shown in testing to  improve survivability in aviation accidents. Several options are to retrofit  the entire current fleet with fully tested 16g seats, use rearward-facing  seats, require three-point auto-style seat belts with shoulder harnesses, and  install auto-style air bags.", "FAA regulations require seats for newly certified airplane designs to pass  more extensive tests than were previously required to protect occupants  from impact forces of up to 16 times the force of normal gravity in the  forward direction; seat certification standards include specific  requirements to protect against head, spine, and leg injuries (see fig. 5).FAA first required 16g seats and tests for newly designed, certificated  airplanes in 1988; new versions of existing designs were not required to  carry 16g seats. Since 1988, however, in anticipation of a fleetwide retrofit  rule, manufacturers have increasingly equipped new airplanes with \u201c16g- compatible\u201d seats that have some of the characteristics of fully certified  16g seats. Certifying a narrow-body airplane type to full 16g seat  certification standards can cost $250,000.", "In 1998 FAA estimated that 16g seats would avoid between about 210 to 410  fatalities and 220 to 240 serious injuries over the 20-year period from 1999  through 2018. A 2000 study funded by FAA and the British Civil Aviation  Authority estimated that if 16g seats had been installed in all airplanes that  crashed from 1984 through 1998, between 23 to 51 fewer U.S. fatalities and  18 to 54 fewer U.S. serious injuries would have occurred over the period. A  number of accidents analyzed in that study showed no benefit from 16g  seats because it was assumed that 16g seats would have detached from the  floor, offering no additional benefits compared with older seats.Worldwide, the study estimated, about 333 fewer fatalities and 354 fewer  serious injuries would have occurred during the period had the improved  seats been installed. Moreover, if fire risks had been reduced, the estimated  benefits of 16g seats might have increased dramatically, as more occupants  who were assumed to survive the impact but die in the ensuing fire would  then have survived both the impact and fire."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status", "paragraphs": ["Seats that meet the 16g certification requirements are currently available  and have been required on newly certificated aircraft designs since 1988.

Recently, FAA has negotiated with manufacturers to install  full 16g seats on new versions of older designs, such as all newly produced  737s.In October 2002, FAA published a new proposal to create a timetable  for all airplanes to carry fully certified 16g seats within 14 years.

The 16g-compatible or partial 16g seats span a wide range of  capabilities; some are nearly identical to full 16g seats but have been  labeled as 16g-compatible to avoid more costly certification, and other  partial 16g seats offer only minor improvements over the older generation  of 9g seats. To determine whether these seats have the same performance  characteristics as full 16g seats, it may be sufficient, in some cases, to  review the company\u2019s certification paperwork; in other cases, however, full  crash testing of actual 16g seats may be necessary to determine the level of  protection provided.", "FAA is currently considering the comments it received on its October 2002  proposal.

New 16g seat requirements were developed in the 1980s. 16g  seats were intended to be retrofitted on aircraft with traditional 9g floors  and were designed to maximize the capabilities of existing floor strength.  While 16g seats might be strong, they could also be inflexible and thus fail if  the floor deformed in a crash. Under the current 16g requirement, the seats  must remain attached to a deformed seat track and floor structure  representative of that used in the airplane. To meet these requirements,  the seat was expected to permanently deform to absorb and limit impact  forces even if the 16g test conditions were exceeded during a crash.", "A major accident related to floor deformation occurred at Kegworth,  England, in 1989. A Boeing 737-400 airplane flew into an embankment on  approach to landing. In total, only 21 of the 52 triple seats\u2014all \u201c16g- compatible\u201d \u2014remained fully attached to the cabin floor; 14 of those that  remained attached were in the area where the wing passes through the  cabin and the area is stronger than other areas to support the wing. In this  section of the airplane, the occupants generally survived, even though they  were exposed to an estimated peak level of 26gs. The front part of the  airplane was destroyed, including the floor; most of these seats separated  from the airplane, killing or seriously injuring the occupants. An FAA  expert noted that the impact was too severe for the airplane to maintain its  structural integrity and that 16g seats were not designed for an accident of  that severity. The British Air Accidents Investigation Branch noted that  fewer injuries occurred in the accident than would probably have been the  case with earlier-generation seats. However, the Branch also noted that  \u201crelatively minor engineering changes could significantly improve the  resilience and toughness of cabin floors . . . and take fuller advantage of the  improved passenger seats.\u201d  The Branch reported that where failures  occurred, it was generally the seat track along the floor that failed, and not  the seat, and that the rear attachments generally remained engaged with  the floor, \u201cat least partially due to the articulated joint built into the rear  attachment, an innovation largely stemming from the FAA dynamic test  requirements.\u201d  The Branch concluded that \u201cseats designed to these  dynamic requirements will certainly increase survivability\u201d but \u201cdo not  necessarily represent an optimum for the long term . . . if matched with  cabin floors of improved strength and toughness.\u201d"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status", "paragraphs": ["Several reports have recommended structural improvements to floors.

NTSB noted in 1996 that airlines would offer  various discounts and free seats for infants in order to retain $6 billion in  revenue that would otherwise be lost to auto travel.

According to European safety officials, pregnant crewmembers are often  given the option of an alternative job with the airline on the ground to avoid  radiation exposure to their fetuses. Furthermore, when flight attendants  and pilots reach recommended exposure limits, European air carriers work  with crewmembers to limits or change their subsequent flights and  destinations to minimize exposure levels for the balance of the year.

On September 29, 2001, the DOT Office of the Inspector General (DOT IG)  reported that FAA had made little progress toward providing flight  attendants with workplace protections and urged FAA to address the  recommendations in the December 2000 report and move forward with  setting safety and health standards for the flight attendant workforce. In  April 2002, the DOT IG reported that FAA and OSHA had made no progress  since it issued its report in September 2001.
