OPM has held two competitive processes to select contractors to insure enrollees and administer FLTCIP, although interest in and competition for these contracts has been limited. In 2009, soon after OPM's award of FLTCIP's second 7-year contract to John Hancock Life Insurance Company (John Hancock), 66 percent of enrollees were notified that their premiums would increase up to 25 percent in order to compensate for how the actuarial assumptions used to set premiums differed from the program's experience. GAO was asked to review FLTCIP. In this report, GAO describes (1) factors affecting carriers' interest in FLTCIP, (2) how the actuarial assumptions used to set FLTCIP premiums have changed since the program's inception, and (3) OPM's oversight of actuarial assumptions and experience and program communications. To do so, GAO interviewed officials from six carriers that in 2009 insured over 60 percent of all long-term care insurance policyholders. GAO also interviewed officials from OPM and John Hancock and reviewed program documentation, including FLTCIP contracts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A variety of factors influenced carriers' interest in FLTCIP. Carriers' business strategies had the most significant influence on their interest, though in different ways. Some carriers wanted to increase their market share and thus were attracted to FLTCIP. In contrast, some carriers wanted to grow their long-term care insurance business at a slower pace, which detracted from their interest in FLTCIP. At the time of FLTCIP's second contract, factors relating to the program's history had the second-most significant influence on carriers' interest, and generally detracted from it as a result of FLTCIP's need for a premium increase and concerns about transitioning a large, complex program from another carrier. A variety of other factors also affected carriers' interest. For example, the large number of eligible individuals and the lack of a requirement to guarantee coverage to them positively influenced carriers' interest, while the lack of a list of home addresses for the eligible population--which could have been used to market the program--and the relatively large portion of eligible individuals who were disabled detracted from carriers' interest. Since FLTCIP's inception in 2002, John Hancock has revised the program's actuarial assumptions. When setting premiums for the second contract period, John Hancock updated FLTCIP's assumptions to reflect an expectation that a larger portion of enrollees will voluntarily maintain their coverage longer and will live longer than initially expected. The carrier also reduced the amount of claims costs the program expects for enrollees of any given age. Although FLTCIP yielded a lower-than-expected return on investment during the first contract period, John Hancock did not revise this assumption when setting premiums for the second contract period. Instead, it revised the investment strategy to include considerable investments in public equities--such as stocks--which the carrier said have a higher expected rate of return. Altogether, John Hancock expects that more enrollees will continue their coverage, reach older ages, and submit claims than initially assumed. As such, the carrier increased projections for the total amount of future FLTCIP claims. As part of its assessment of carriers' proposals to insure FLTCIP enrollees and administer the program, OPM evaluated the actuarial assumptions carriers proposed for the program to ensure that the assumptions were reasonable and collectively supported the proposed premiums. Once the program's premiums were finalized with the award of the contract, OPM has monitored the program's experience by reviewing regular reports comparing the experience of the program to the actuarial assumptions used to set premiums. OPM's oversight has also included a review of all program communications for accuracy and clarity prior to their use. OPM and John Hancock provided technical comments, which have been incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, about $253 billion was spent nationwide on long-term care  services, including nursing home and other assisted-living services. Most  of this care was financed by government programs, primarily Medicaid,  and a small share of these costs\u2014about 6 percent\u2014was paid for by  private insurance. Elderly people\u2014those aged 65 and older\u2014account for  the majority of spending on long-term care services. As the number of  elderly Americans continues to grow, particularly with the aging of the  baby boom population, the growing demand for long-term care services  will strain federal and state resources. Policymakers and experts have  proposed an increased use of long-term care insurance as a means of  reducing the future share of long-term care services financed by public  programs.", "Since 2002, the federal government has offered long-term care insurance  to its employees, retirees, and certain others through the Federal Long  Term Care Insurance Program (FLTCIP), in accordance with the Long- Term Care Security Act. FLTCIP enrollees are required to pay the full  cost of their premiums, unlike some other employee benefits\u2014such as  health insurance\u2014offered by the federal government. The Office of  Personnel Management (OPM), the federal agency that administers  governmentwide compensation and benefit programs, oversees FLTCIP  and contracts with private companies to insure FLTCIP enrollees and  administer the program. To date, OPM has held two competitive  processes to select contractors for FLTCIP; however, only a few  companies have submitted proposals, resulting in limited competition for  the FLTCIP contracts. After the conclusion of the first competitive process  in 2001, OPM selected a consortium of two large insurance carriers\u2014 John Hancock Life Insurance Company (John Hancock) and Metropolitan  Life Insurance Company (MetLife)\u2014to insure program enrollees for the  duration of the program\u2019s initial 7-year contract. This consortium jointly  formed Long Term Care Partners, LLC (Partners) to administer the  program. As the end of the first contract period grew near, OPM  conducted its second competitive process for FLTCIP\u2019s next 7-year  contract. In April 2009, the agency selected John Hancock as the insurer,  with Partners\u2014which became a wholly owned subsidiary of John  Hancock\u2014continuing to administer the program.", "With 268,204 enrollees as of June 30, 2011, FLTCIP is the largest private  long-term care insurance program in the nation. As we previously  reported, the benefits and premiums offered under FLTCIP compared  favorably with those of other long-term care insurance plans. These  benefits and premiums did not change during FLTCIP\u2019s first 7-year  contract period. However, in 2009, soon after OPM awarded the  program\u2019s second contract, 146,415 individuals (66 percent of enrollees  at that time) were notified that their premiums were subject to an increase  of up to 25 percent. All of these enrollees had selected a particular  inflation protection option\u2014the 5 percent automatic compound inflation  option (ACIO)\u2014that was intended to keep enrollees\u2019 benefits  commensurate with the cost of long-term care services by increasing their  benefits each year by 5 percent without a routine increase in premiums.  Although FLTCIP had not guaranteed that enrollees\u2019 premiums would  remain stable, the announcement of a premium increase surprised some  FLTCIP enrollees, who thought that the program\u2019s marketing materials  indicated that selecting the ACIO would result in premiums that would  remain constant over the life of their policies. However, FLTCIP was not  unique in raising enrollee premiums. Long-term care insurance is a  relatively new product, and carriers throughout the industry have  struggled with setting premiums at a rate sufficient to cover future costs.  Over the last decade, many carriers\u2014including the largest in the  market\u2014have raised premiums to compensate for how the assumptions  they used in setting premiums for this insurance product differed from  their experience.", "You requested that we review FLTCIP. In this report, we describe   (1) factors affecting insurance carriers\u2019 interest in contracting to insure  FLTCIP enrollees and administer the program; (2) key changes made to  FLTCIP since the second contract was awarded; (3) the benefit options  offered to enrollees who faced a premium increase and the options they  selected; (4) how actuarial assumptions used to set premiums for FLTCIP  have changed since the program\u2019s inception; and (5) OPM\u2019s oversight of  FLTCIP\u2019s actuarial assumptions and experience, and its communications  with current and prospective enrollees.", "To describe information on the factors that affected insurance carriers\u2019  interest in FLTCIP, we interviewed officials from six of the nation\u2019s largest  long-term care insurance carriers\u2014Genworth Financial, John Hancock,  MetLife, Prudential Financial Inc., Transamerica Life Insurance Company,  and Unum. In 2009, these six carriers insured 61 percent of all long-term  care insurance policyholders and 79 percent of those who purchased  coverage through employers or other sponsors in the group market. In  addition, these carriers varied with respect to their interest in FLTCIP;  some submitted proposals to insure FLTCIP enrollees and administer the  program, while others had not. We asked officials from these carriers to  identify the factors that influenced the carriers\u2019 interest in FLTCIP at the  time of the program\u2019s first and second contracts. Specifically, we asked  these officials how factors related to carriers\u2019 business strategies and  capabilities, FLTCIP\u2019s history, and other aspects of the program\u2014such as  statutory requirements\u2014affected their interest in the program. We also  asked these officials to explain how and to what extent such factors  influenced carriers\u2019 interest.", "To describe the key changes that have been made to FLTCIP since the  second contract was awarded, we interviewed officials from OPM and  John Hancock about the changes made to the program and reviewed  program documentation, including FLTCIP contracts. We considered  changes to be key changes if officials from both OPM and John Hancock  identified them as significant and if they directly affected current or future  enrollees.", "To describe the benefit options that were offered to enrollees facing a  premium increase, we interviewed OPM and John Hancock officials and  reviewed program documentation. We also assessed the extent to which  the benefit options were similar to those offered by other long-term care  insurance carriers. To do so, we interviewed officials from the six  insurance carriers noted above to obtain information on the benefit  options they have typically offered to enrollees facing a premium  increase. To describe the benefit options that FLTCIP enrollees selected  and the impact of those selections on enrollees\u2019 premiums, we analyzed  John Hancock data. These data summarized the benefits selected by  FLTCIP enrollees facing the premium increase and the amount by which  their premiums changed as a result of those selections. We discussed the  data with knowledgeable officials from John Hancock and reviewed all  data for reasonableness and consistency; we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To describe how the actuarial assumptions used to set premiums for  FLTCIP have changed since the program\u2019s inception, we interviewed  OPM and John Hancock officials and reviewed program documentation,  including FLTCIP contracts. We compared the actuarial assumptions  used to set premiums for the first contract period to those used to set  premiums for the second contract period. We also examined the extent to  which the assumptions had changed since premiums for the second  contract period were set. In addition, we assessed how changes in  FLTCIP assumptions compare to those used in setting premiums for  other long-term care insurance plans. To do so, we interviewed officials  from the six insurance carriers in our analysis about the actuarial  assumptions they use, and how their assumptions have changed since  FLTCIP began in 2002. We also interviewed insurance regulators from  three states\u2014California, Florida, and New York\u2014about the actuarial  assumptions used in setting premiums for long-term care insurance plans  offered in their states. In 2009, these were the top three states in terms of  the amount of long-term care insurance premiums earned; they were  collectively responsible for overseeing 20 percent of all long-term care  insurance policies.", "To describe OPM oversight of actuarial assumptions and experience and  program communications with current and prospective enrollees, we  interviewed officials from OPM, John Hancock, and MetLife. For context,  we interviewed officials from the six insurance carriers to gather  information regarding the oversight conducted by other employers and  state regulators.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2010 to July 2011  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

For example, in 2010, the  average annual cost for care in a nursing home exceeded $83,000 and  the average annual cost for care in an assisted-living facility was nearly  $40,000. In addition, the average hourly rate for a home health aide was  $21; for example, 10 hours of such care a week would average about  $11,000 per year.", "Most of the nation\u2019s spending on long-term care services is paid for by  government programs. About $253 billion was spent nationwide on long- term care services in 2009, according to the most recently available data.  Nearly three-quarters of this amount\u2014$183 billion\u2014was paid for by  government programs, primarily Medicaid, and to a lesser extent,  Medicare and other government programs. Individuals paid 18 percent of  the total, or $46 billion, out of pocket, and private insurance paid for a  small portion of the total, 6 percent, or about $16 billion. (See fig. 1.)", "Individuals may purchase long-term care insurance policies directly from  carriers in the individual market, or they can enroll in those offered by  groups, such as their employers. At the end of calendar year 2009,   6.7 million individuals had long-term care insurance policies, according to  data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).  Nearly 70 percent of these policies were purchased in the individual  market, with the remaining portion purchased through employers or other  group sponsors.", "States are generally responsible for overseeing long-term care insurance.  Through laws and regulations, states establish standards governing long- term care insurance and state insurance departments enforce those  standards. NAIC has issued model laws and regulations to assist states  in formulating their laws and regulations for long-term care insurance;  many states have adopted NAIC\u2019s models. State regulators perform a  variety of oversight tasks that are intended to protect consumers from  unfair practices, including reviewing premiums and marketing materials  and responding to consumer complaints.", "Long-term care insurance is generally structured around a number of  benefit options that applicants select. These include  the types of services covered, such as nursing home services, care in  home and community settings, or both;  the daily benefit amount, which is the maximum amount insurance will  pay on a single day;  the benefit period (or duration of coverage), which can range from   1 year to unlimited (i.e., lifetime) coverage; and  the length of the elimination or waiting period, which is the length of  time an individual has to wait before insurance will provide coverage  toward the cost of care.", "An applicant can also select an inflation protection benefit to help ensure  that over time, his or her daily benefit amount remains commensurate  with the costs of care. Inflation protection benefits increase the enrollee\u2019s  daily benefit amount at specified intervals\u2014for example, annually.  Carriers typically provide multiple inflation protection options, including a  5 percent ACIO. Under this option, an enrollee\u2019s daily benefit amount is  increased each year by 5 percent of the prior year\u2019s amount without a  routine increase in premiums. For example, an individual who selected a  daily benefit amount of $100 at enrollment would have accrued a   $105 daily benefit amount that would be available to him or her at the  beginning of the second year of coverage. At the beginning of the third  year of coverage, the enrollee\u2019s daily benefit amount would accrue by an  additional 5 percent to $110.25. Inflation protection is important because  many purchasers of long-term care insurance do not expect to need long- term care services until some time in the future; they pay premiums over  a period of years in return for a promise of future protection. This benefit  allows enrollees to take advantage of lower premium rates available to  younger enrollees, while allowing their benefits to grow over time.", "Long-term care insurance premiums are affected by many factors.  Carriers charge higher premiums for richer benefits; for example, higher  daily benefit amounts, longer benefit periods, and higher levels of inflation  protection will increase premiums. In addition, premium rates vary based  on enrollees\u2019 age at enrollment, with older individuals subject to higher  premiums than younger individuals who select the same benefits.  Premiums for some policies may also be based on the health status of  the applicant. For example, policies sold in the individual market are  generally subject to full underwriting, which entails an extensive review  of the applicant\u2019s health and may result in premiums that vary based on  health status. In contrast, premiums for policies sold in the group market  usually do not vary based on individuals\u2019 health status. Such policies may  be offered, during at least some periods, on a guaranteed issue basis  with no underwriting\u2014meaning that coverage is guaranteed to all eligible  individuals. For example, some carriers guarantee coverage to a group of  eligible individuals, such as active employees, during an open enrollment  period.", "In addition, carriers establish premiums on the basis of actuarial  assumptions\u2014including lapse, mortality, morbidity, and return on  investment assumptions.  \uf0b7  The lapse assumption reflects the expected portion of enrollees who  drop their coverage each year, for example, by voluntarily canceling  their policies. Lapse assumptions can vary based on a variety of  factors, including the enrollees\u2019 age at enrollment and the number of  years enrollees have had their policies. In general, it is assumed that  the longer that enrollees keep their policies, the less likely they are to  lapse. After enrollees have maintained their policies for a certain  number of years\u2014for example, after 6 or 8 years\u2014carriers may  assume that the lapse rate will remain constant. This rate is referred  to as the ultimate lapse rate. Lapse rate assumptions greatly affect  long-term care insurance premiums because when individuals lapse,  future liabilities are immediately reduced although current assets are  not affected. Premiums that have already been paid by those who  lapse generally remain with the carrier and are used to subsidize the  cost of future claims by other enrollees.  \uf0b7  The mortality assumption summarizes the expected death rate of the  enrollee population, by age. Similar to the lapse assumption, mortality  reduces future liabilities without affecting assets.  \uf0b7  The morbidity assumption reflects the amount of claims costs  expected for enrollees, by age, and accounts for the portion of  enrollees of each age who file a claim and the duration of those  claims. Because carriers assume that older enrollees are more likely  to file a claim, the expected amount of claims costs increases with  age.  \uf0b7  The return on investment assumption reflects the expected interest  rate earned on invested assets.", "Because actuarial assumptions are projections about the future, they can  change over time as carriers gain more experience, especially with  relatively new products such as long-term care insurance. In addition,  these assumptions are developed based on the professional judgment of  carriers\u2019 actuaries; therefore, actuarial assumptions\u2014and the resulting  premiums\u2014can differ across actuaries and carriers.", "A key feature of long-term care insurance is that premiums are  designed\u2014although not guaranteed\u2014to remain level over time. Carriers  calculate premium rates with a goal of ensuring that the total amount of  premiums paid by all enrollees plus the interest earned on the invested  assets over the lifetime of the policy are sufficient to cover the cost of  future claims and expenses. Setting premiums at an adequate level to  cover future costs has been a challenge for some carriers. Long-term  care insurance is a relatively new product. In addition, several decades  may elapse before enrollees submit claims and carriers obtain data on  how their enrollees use their policies. As a result, many carriers have  lacked (and may continue to lack) sufficient data to accurately estimate  the revenue needed to cover costs. This has led to changes in the  marketplace as many companies have raised premiums, left the  marketplace, or consolidated to form larger companies.", "In response to the growing number of premium increases for long-term  care insurance, NAIC issued revisions to its model long-term care  insurance regulation in 2000. The new model regulation established more  rigorous requirements that carriers must meet when setting initial  premium rates and when requesting premium increases. For example,  the model regulation introduced a new requirement for insurance carriers\u2019  actuaries to certify that premiums are adequate to cover anticipated costs  over the life of a policy, even under \u201cmoderately adverse conditions,\u201d with  no future premium increases anticipated. Moderately adverse conditions  could include, for example, below average returns on invested assets. To  fulfill this requirement, insurance carriers\u2019 actuaries must include a margin  for error when setting premiums."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FLTCIP Oversight and Administration", "paragraphs": ["The Long-Term Care Security Act authorizes OPM to enter into 7-year  contracts with one or more private entities to insure FLTCIP enrollees and  administer the program.

The agency\u2019s RFPs  summarized information about the program, including information about  the population eligible to apply for coverage, as well as program  requirements, such as covered services and benefit options that were to  be offered.

The RFPs for both contracts also outlined OPM\u2019s  expectations for the program. For example, OPM\u2019s RFP for the first  contract stated that because of efficiencies in marketing to a large group,  the agency expected that carriers would offer premiums that were 15 to  20 percent below those charged for comparable benefits in the individual  market. In its RFP for the second contract, OPM stated that carriers  should adjust premiums to ensure that they were adequate, but that  premium increases should not exceed 25 percent per enrollee. In  addition, in its RFPs for both contracts, OPM stated that it expected  carriers to follow NAIC\u2019s 2000 model long-term care insurance regulation  by including a margin for moderately adverse conditions when setting  premiums for FLTCIP.

Almost 19 million people were estimated  to be eligible to apply for coverage as of October 15, 2001. While the Act  specifies who is eligible to apply for FLTCIP coverage, it does not require  that coverage be guaranteed to all eligible individuals. Eligibility for  coverage has been subject to underwriting, though the level of  underwriting used by the program varies. During FLTCIP open enrollment  periods, an abbreviated underwriting application has been used for active  federal employees and their spouses or same-sex domestic partners and  active members of the uniformed services and their spouses.

They  also stated that insuring FLTCIP would lend them credibility, assist them  in gaining name recognition in the marketplace, and further their goals of  expanding sales of their other (nonfederal) long-term care insurance  policies. In contrast, officials from the carriers who indicated that their  business strategy detracted from their interest in FLTCIP said that they  wanted to grow their long-term care insurance business at a slower pace  or focus on other segments of the market, such as the individual market.  Officials from three carriers noted that FLTCIP had the potential to be so  large that the carrier may not have been able to insure enrollees or  administer the program independently, and some carriers also noted  concerns about partnering with other insurance carriers to do so. Finally,  two carriers told us that they had less interest in selling long-term care  insurance overall at the time of the second contract. Officials from these  carriers told us that they were uncertain about the risks associated with  long-term care insurance because of industrywide challenges in setting  actuarial assumptions that lead to adequate premium rates. As of January  2011, three of the six carriers whose officials we interviewed had  suspended sales of some or all of their long-term care insurance  policies.

When asked about how FLTCIP\u2019s history  affected the carrier\u2019s interest at the time of the second contract, officials  from four of the carriers noted that as a result of the program\u2019s history\u2014 including the premiums charged for the benefits offered during the first  contract period and the actuarial experience of the program\u2014a premium  increase was warranted. These officials raised concerns about having to  implement a premium increase for FLTCIP. Specifically, officials from  three of the carriers, none of which were involved in the program\u2019s first  contract, raised concerns that implementing a premium increase as the  program\u2019s new carrier would result in negative implications for the  carrier\u2019s reputation. Additionally, officials from two carriers told us that  OPM\u2019s 25 percent cap on premium increases was a concern because  they estimated that a larger premium increase was warranted.", "Four carriers also cited concerns about transitioning the program from  other carriers. Specifically, officials from some of these carriers stated  that transitions are difficult for the smallest programs, and the large size  and complexity of FLTCIP would add to other challenges related to  transitioning the program. In addition, officials from two carriers explained  that their concerns over transitioning FLTCIP were linked to taking on the  risk of insuring a population that the carrier had no involvement in  underwriting.

The large size of the eligible  population had a positive influence on carriers\u2019 interest in FLTCIP, but the  lack of a list of home addresses for the eligible population and the  voluntary nature of the program had a negative influence. Officials from  four of the six carriers we interviewed noted that the large number of  people eligible for FLTCIP positively influenced their interest in the  program. These officials explained that a large eligible population  increases the likelihood for a larger number of enrollees and provides a  greater potential for enrolling healthy individuals who represent a lower  risk of submitting claims. However, as OPM noted in its RFPs for both  contracts, the agency does not have a list of home addresses of active  federal employees for the carrier to use in marketing FLTCIP. All of the  carriers we interviewed noted that not having this information significantly  detracted from their interest in the program. These officials explained  that marketing directly to eligible individuals at their homes is critical for  ensuring that a large number of individuals\u2014including a high proportion of  healthy individuals\u2014apply for coverage. As such, not having this list  resulted in concerns that FLTCIP would attract a disproportionate share  of individuals who knew they needed coverage, which would result in a  higher risk for the program. Likewise, officials from three carriers we  interviewed also noted that offering FLTCIP as a voluntary benefit with no  government contribution to premiums detracted from their interest in the  program because carriers had concerns that the program\u2019s enrollment  would not be as large as it could have been. In addition, officials noted  that this aspect of the program would likely attract a disproportionate  share of individuals who expected to incur long-term care costs and  would likely submit claims earlier than was typically expected. These  officials explained that if all active federal employees were automatically  enrolled in FLTCIP, or if the government paid for a portion of all active  federal employees\u2019 premiums, FLTCIP would benefit from a larger  number of enrollees as well as a larger portion of healthy enrollees who  would have a lower risk of submitting claims.", "Similarly, characteristics of the eligible population negatively affected  carriers\u2019 interest in FLTCIP, but this was at least somewhat offset by the  fact that eligible individuals are not guaranteed coverage. Officials from all  of the carriers we interviewed cited concerns about the relatively high  portion of active federal employees who were disabled and eligible to  apply for FLTCIP coverage. In its RFP for the first contract, OPM notified  insurance carriers that the federal government employs a large  percentage of persons with self-reported disabilities. Specifically, OPM  reported that approximately 7 percent of active federal employees self- identified as disabled, noting that this estimate did not include active  postal or military employees. Insurance carrier officials told us that the  relatively large portion of disabled individuals increased the risk to  FLTCIP because disabled individuals were more likely to seek coverage  and submit claims sooner than nondisabled individuals. Officials from five  of the six carriers we interviewed said that the fact that FLTCIP has not  guaranteed coverage for all eligible individuals\u2014and is not required to do  so\u2014had a large positive influence on the carriers\u2019 interest at the time of  the first and second contracts. These officials explained that the ability to  conduct at least some underwriting for applicants would enable them to  better manage the risks of the program, especially given the relatively  large portion of disabled employees. Officials from several carriers also  said that if FLTCIP guaranteed coverage to all eligible individuals at any  point in time, carrier interest in FLTCIP would likely diminish and officials  from two carriers we interviewed noted that they would not have  considered submitting a proposal for FLTCIP if the program were required  to offer coverage on a guaranteed issue basis.", "Five of the six carriers we interviewed stated that having FLTCIP subject  to OPM oversight rather than states\u2019 oversight influenced their interest in  the program, but the carriers varied with regard to how this affected their  interest. Officials from three of these carriers said that OPM\u2019s role was  unusual, because the agency would be acting as both the employer  sponsor and insurance regulator. Officials also raised related questions  and concerns about OPM\u2019s ability to adequately oversee such a  complicated insurance product as well as the potential for FLTCIP to be  subject to political pressure. In addition, officials from three of the carriers  we interviewed expressed concerns regarding the potential for having a  difference of opinion with OPM during the contract period regarding key  elements of the program, such as the need for a premium increase.  However, officials from four of the carriers we spoke with noted that OPM  oversight positively influenced their interest in FLTCIP, in part because it  had the potential to produce a single, large, uniform program as a result  of a more streamlined oversight process than what would otherwise be  available through state oversight. Appendix III provides more information  about how a variety of factors influenced carriers\u2019 interest in FLTCIP."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Changes Have Been Made to FLTCIP Benefits, Investment Strategy, and Profit Payment Formula since the Second Contract Was Awarded", "paragraphs": ["Since the second contract was awarded, three key changes have been  made to FLTCIP, in addition to the implementation of a premium increase  for certain enrollees. These key changes were the introduction of new  benefits for current and new enrollees, modifications to the program\u2019s  investment strategy, and revisions to the formula used to calculate the  carrier\u2019s profit payment.", "Regarding the program\u2019s benefit changes, FLTCIP introduced a new  benefit plan and a new inflation protection option for enrollees.  \uf0b7  The new benefit plan\u2014referred to as FLTCIP 2.0\u2014was made  available to all program enrollees. In comparison to the FLTCIP   1.0 plan that was previously offered, the FLTCIP 2.0 plan provides  enhanced coverage. It offers additional benefit options, for example,  by expanding the range of daily benefit amounts and benefit periods  available to enrollees. The FLTCIP 2.0 plan also covers a greater  portion of the cost of care for some long-term care services. For  instance, the FLTCIP 2.0 plan covers 100 percent of the cost of home  care and adult day care, up to the enrollee\u2019s accrued daily benefit  amount. This represents an increase over the FLTCIP 1.0 plan, which  covered these costs up to 75 percent of the enrollee\u2019s accrued daily  benefit amount for those who selected comprehensive coverage. In  addition, the FLTCIP 2.0 plan provided coverage for a broader range  of services than the FLTCIP 1.0 plan. Specifically, the FLTCIP   2.0 plan expanded the services covered under its stay-at-home  benefit. This benefit pays for costs that enable enrollees to receive  long-term care services in the home, including those incurred for  home modifications and caregiver training. (See app. IV for a  comparison of selected benefits available under the FLTCIP 1.0 and  FLTCIP 2.0 plans.) John Hancock officials told us that they proposed  changes to FLTCIP\u2019s benefits to make the program\u2019s benefits  comparable to those offered by other long-term care insurance plans  available in the market. They further noted that these changes were  intended to ensure that FLTCIP remains competitive with other long- term care insurance plans.  \uf0b7  FLTCIP also introduced a new inflation protection option for  enrollees\u2014a 4 percent ACIO. This option was made available to  enrollees in addition to the other inflation protection options that  FLTCIP has offered since its inception, such as the 5 percent ACIO.  Compared with a 5 percent ACIO, a 4 percent option results in  reduced protection against increases in the cost of long-term care  services. However, a 4 percent ACIO allows enrollees to obtain a  package of benefits at a cost that is lower than that available with a   5 percent ACIO. John Hancock officials told us that they offered a   4 percent ACIO to provide enrollees with an additional inflation  protection option, and they were comfortable that this option provides  enrollees with adequate protection against inflation based on historical  increases in the cost of long-term care services. (See app. V for an  analysis of how the 4 and 5 percent ACIOs compare to changes in the  cost of long-term care services since 2002.)", "Another key change made to FLTCIP was the modification of the  program\u2019s investment strategy. John Hancock proposed a new, less  conservative investment strategy in its response to OPM\u2019s RFP for  FLTCIP\u2019s second contract, which later became part of the terms of the  carrier\u2019s contract with OPM. According to John Hancock officials, the  revised strategy has a higher expected rate of return than the former  strategy. During the first contract period, FLTCIP invested 100 percent of  its assets in short-duration fixed-income bonds. FLTCIP\u2019s new investment  strategy involves investing a portion of the program\u2019s assets in fixed- income bonds of a longer duration, while investing another portion in  public equities. Specifically, all of the assets corresponding to the  program\u2019s short-term liabilities\u2014those expected to be incurred within the  next 20 years\u2014would be invested in fixed-income bonds. However, most  of the assets corresponding to the program\u2019s long-term liabilities\u2014those  expected to be incurred in more than 20 years\u2014would be invested in  public equities, which have the potential to earn a higher rate of return  than fixed-income bonds. John Hancock proposed modifications to the  investment strategy to enable FLTCIP to earn a potentially higher rate of  return on its investments over time without subjecting short-term  investments to possible fluctuations in investment returns. According to  John Hancock officials, the new strategy would also better align the  duration of the program\u2019s investments with the program\u2019s liabilities. John  Hancock officials told us that they hoped these changes would enable  FLTCIP to maintain more stable premiums over time.", "The third key change made to FLTCIP since the second contract was  awarded was a revision to the formula used to calculate the insurance  carrier\u2019s profit payment. While the structure of the formula remained the  same, the portion of premiums and assets used in calculating the profit  payment was reduced. Both FLTCIP contracts have explicitly defined a  profit payment that is to be paid to the program\u2019s carrier each year of the  program\u2019s 7-year contract period. For both contract periods, this profit  payment has consisted of three distinct payments; two of these are based  on a percentage of the premiums collected during the fiscal year, and one  is based on the average annual assets of the program. One of the  premium-based payments is subject to OPM\u2019s evaluation of the carrier\u2019s  performance, while the other premium-based payment is guaranteed to  the carrier. With the second contract, FLTCIP reduced the maximum  portion of premium-based profit payments from 6.5 percent of premiums  collected in each fiscal year to 4.0 percent of premiums collected in each  fiscal year. To do so, the program decreased both the portion of premium- based payments that were guaranteed and those that were subject to  OPM\u2019s evaluation of John Hancock\u2019s performance. In addition, FLTCIP  also reduced the portion of average annual assets used to calculate the  profit payment, from 0.3 percent to 0.15 percent. (See table 1.) John  Hancock officials told us that they proposed modifications to the profit  payment formula in order to provide greater premium stability for  enrollees over time. They also stated that had they not reduced the profit  payment formula, FLTCIP would have needed to implement a greater  increase in enrollee premiums. While the portion of premiums and assets  used in calculating the profit payment decreased with the second  contract, John Hancock\u2019s profit payments will likely grow during the  contract period because the number of enrollees paying premiums and  the value of the program\u2019s assets is also expected to increase over time.", "In addition to the three key changes noted above, several other changes  were made to FLTCIP since the second contract was awarded. For  instance, FLTCIP eligibility was expanded in 2010 to provide coverage for  same-sex domestic partners of active and retired federal and Postal  Service employees. In addition, the performance metrics that OPM uses  to evaluate the carrier\u2014and on which a certain percentage of profit  payment depends\u2014were updated. Changes to these metrics included  adding a requirement that FLTCIP customer service representatives  become certified long-term care insurance specialists within 9 months of  employment and reducing the amount of time available to make benefits  determinations and to pay claims, from 10 business days to 5 business  days.

Specifically, in October 2009, FLTCIP  sent personalized letters to enrollees facing the premium increase to  inform them of the increase, to offer them options to adjust their benefits,  and to illustrate how these options would affect their premiums. The  enrollees who faced a premium increase\u2014all of whom had the FLTCIP  1.0 plan with 5 percent ACIO\u2014were offered the option to reduce their  ACIO to 4 percent while maintaining their accrued benefits. This option  would result in a premium that was similar to\u2014within a few dollars of\u2014 enrollees\u2019 existing monthly premiums, so long as enrollees made no  additional changes to their benefits. In addition to the option to reduce  their inflation protection benefit, enrollees were offered the option to  switch their benefits package to the new FLTCIP 2.0 plan without  additional underwriting, although such a change could lead to an increase  in their premiums. In addition, FLTCIP enrollees were reminded of their  ability to make other changes to their benefits at any time\u2014for example,  by modifying their daily benefit amount\u2014although those who wanted to  increase their benefits in ways other than switching to the FLTCIP   2.0 plan had to undergo underwriting.", "John Hancock officials stated that they offered enrollees the option to  reduce their inflation protection coverage because this enabled them to  maintain relatively stable premiums while affecting future\u2014but not  current\u2014benefits. Reducing inflation protection affects the rate at which  future benefits grow over time. As such, FLTCIP enrollees who decreased  their ACIO protection to 4 percent retained their accrued daily benefit  amount; that amount would then increase at the reduced ACIO rate. In  contrast, other reductions in coverage\u2014such as decreasing the daily  benefit amount or increasing the waiting period\u2014result in an immediate  reduction in benefits.", "Similar to FLTCIP, officials from other carriers we interviewed told us that  they have typically offered enrollees multiple options to reduce their  benefits at the time of a premium increase. These options have included  reducing their daily benefit amount or benefit period or reducing inflation  protection coverage. In addition to these options, officials from several  carriers told us that they have offered a nonforfeiture benefit to enrollees  facing a premium increase. This benefit allows enrollees who lapse to  maintain long-term care insurance coverage equal to the total amount of  premiums paid to date; the coverage will be provided in the future once  the individual becomes eligible for benefits.

These enrollees elected to pay the premium increase. Many enrollees  chose to reduce their inflation protection benefits to a 4 percent ACIO,  while either switching to the FLTCIP 2.0 plan (26 percent) or retaining the  FLTCIP 1.0 plan (20 percent). In addition, 1.6 percent of enrollees facing  the premium increase, or 2,344 individuals, lapsed their coverage and as  such are no longer enrolled in FLTCIP.

Premiums did not change for the remaining enrollees. The extent to which  enrollees\u2019 premiums changed varied considerably based on their benefit  selections.

Collectively, changes to FLTCIP\u2019s actuarial assumptions  resulted in a projected increase in the total amount of future claims  payments.", "Changes to FLTCIP\u2019s lapse and mortality assumptions reflect an  expectation that a larger portion of enrollees will voluntarily maintain their  coverage over time and will live longer than originally expected.  Specifically, John Hancock decreased FLTCIP\u2019s lapse assumption for the  first few years an enrollee had a policy as well as for later years, as  reflected in the ultimate lapse rate. For example, between the first and  second contract, the assumption for FLTCIP\u2019s ultimate lapse rate  decreased from 2 percent of enrollees lapsing per year to between   0.25 and 1.25 percent per year, with variations based on the enrollee\u2019s  age at enrollment. John Hancock also decreased FLTCIP\u2019s mortality  assumptions, reflecting an expectation that more FLTCIP enrollees will  reach older ages than the program originally expected. In addition to the  changes in the lapse and mortality assumptions, John Hancock revised  FLTCIP\u2019s morbidity assumption to reflect a reduction in the amount of  claims costs FLTCIP expects for enrollees of any given age. John  Hancock officials we interviewed explained that they revised the  program\u2019s lapse, mortality, and morbidity assumptions to reflect FLTCIP\u2019s  experience during the first contract period. In addition, the morbidity  assumption was also updated to reflect the carrier\u2019s experience, and  knowledge of industry experience, with long-term care insurance policies.", "When setting premiums for FLTCIP\u2019s second contract period, John  Hancock used the same return on investment assumption\u20146.5 percent\u2014 that it used when setting premiums for the first contract period. Despite  FLTCIP\u2019s lower-than-expected return on investment experience during  the first contract period, John Hancock officials told us that they used the  same return on investment assumption because they revised the  program\u2019s investment strategy.

While John Hancock expects that the amount of  claims payments made for enrollees of each age will be less than initially  assumed, it also expects more enrollees to continue their coverage and  reach older ages. Consequently, FLTCIP expects to pay claims for a  greater number of enrollees than initially expected. Additionally, since the  expected amount of claims payments increases with age, the total  amount of future claims payments is projected to be greater than initially  expected. Finally, while the amount of premiums collected each year is  also projected to grow as more enrollees maintain their coverage, John  Hancock officials told us that this additional income will likely be offset by  the higher total costs associated with future claims.", "Since setting premiums for FLTCIP\u2019s second contract period, John  Hancock has not changed the program\u2019s lapse, mortality, or morbidity  assumptions, although it has decreased its assumptions for FLTCIP\u2019s  return on investment. John Hancock officials stated that they reduced  FLTCIP\u2019s return on investment assumption, from 6.5 percent (at the time  they set premiums for the second contract period) to 6.25 percent (as of  September 30, 2010), to reflect an overall decrease in investment returns  earned throughout the financial industry. John Hancock officials noted  that this change does not raise concerns about the adequacy of current  premiums and does not itself warrant an additional increase in premiums  because they had included margins for moderately adverse conditions  when setting FLTCIP premiums for the second contract period.", "The changes made to FLTCIP actuarial assumptions since its inception in  2002 are generally similar to those made throughout the long-term care  insurance industry during that time frame.

For example,  in response to concerns that were raised at the time of FLTCIP\u2019s premium  increase\u2014namely, that some enrollees with ACIO coverage did not think  their premiums could ever increase\u2014OPM required John Hancock to  include more prominent disclaimers on its marketing materials and  applications for enrollment to ensure that prospective enrollees  understood the potential for future premium increases.", "Unlike OPM, state regulators and employers may not review and approve  all long-term care insurance communication materials prior to their use by  carriers. Not all states receive communication materials for review.  Specifically, according to officials from several carriers we interviewed,  more than half of states require carriers to submit at least some  communication materials, such as marketing materials, prior to their use.  However, not all of these states require that the materials be approved  before they are used. Additionally, according to the carriers we  interviewed, employers offering long-term care insurance generally have  a limited ability to modify the communication materials sent to their  employees. Carriers generally make a number of standard  communication materials available from which each employer can select.  Officials from the carriers we interviewed stated that some employers  review these materials, but they generally do not suggest substantive  changes to the materials since doing so would require the carrier to refile  the materials with at least some states and could thus potentially delay  program time frames, including enrollments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency and Third- Party Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided OPM with a draft of this report and provided John Hancock  with portions of the draft report for review.

The nursing home care index provides information about changes  in the cost of long-term care services provided in a residential setting,  such as a nursing home or an assisted-living facility. The home care  index provides information about changes in the cost of nonmedical long- term care services provided in the home, such as agency or individual  assistance with bathing, food preparation, or toileting. Using data from  these indexes, we compared the rate of growth in long-term care costs  from 2002 (the year that FLTCIP began) through 2010 to the inflation  protection offered by FLTCIP\u2019s automatic compound inflation options  (ACIO)\u20145 percent ACIO and 4 percent ACIO.", "We found that FLTCIP\u2019s 4 percent and 5 percent ACIOs would both have  provided substantial protection against increases in long-term care costs  from 2002 through 2010. Specifically, according to our analysis of  consumer price index data, the cost of nursing home care increased   38 percent from 2002 through 2010, which equates to an average annual  increase of 4.1 percent. In comparison, a 5 percent ACIO would have  increased an enrollees\u2019 daily benefit amount by 48 percent during the  same time frame, while a 4 percent ACIO would have increased an  enrollees\u2019 benefit amount by 37 percent.
