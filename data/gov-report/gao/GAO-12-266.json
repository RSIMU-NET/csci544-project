This includes, among other things, the integration of baggage screening equipment into baggage handling systems, referred to as in-line systems. Installing in-line systems typically requires airports to undertake costly facility modification projects, for which TSA will generally reimburse up to the applicable federal cost share. As requested, GAO examined (1) the status of TSA\u0092s efforts to install optimal checked baggage screening systems in collaboration with airports, (2) how reducing the federal cost share for eligible airport modification projects from 90 percent to its previous level of 75 percent would affect the amount that TSA pays for modifications, and (3) whether TSA\u0092s methods for estimating and validating costs for the EBSP are consistent with best practices. GAO reviewed EBSP planning and status documents, compared TSA\u0092s cost estimation approach against GAO best practices, and visited 10 airports selected in part based on the status of the EBSP optimization at these airports. Although the results from these visits are not generalizable, they provided insights into the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Transportation Security Administration\u0092s (TSA) Electronic Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) reports that 76 percent of the airports (337 of 446) the agency regulates for security have a mix of in-line and stand-alone baggage screening configurations that best meet airport needs (i.e., optimal systems). However, only 36 percent (10 of 28) of the nation\u0092s larger airports\u0097based on factors such as the total number of takeoffs and landings annually\u0097have complete optimal systems. This is because the larger airports generally need more complex in-line systems and often require a significant amount of airport infrastructure modification and construction. In August 2011, TSA shifted its focus from installing optimal baggage screening systems to replacing aging machines (recapitalization). However, TSA plans to continue to optimize systems during many of its recapitalization projects.", "Using TSA cost estimates, GAO estimates that reducing the portion of costs that TSA pays for facility modifications associated with the installation of optimal baggage screening systems, from 90 percent to 75 percent, would lower the federal government\u0092s cost for airport modification projects it supports by roughly $300 million from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2030. Officials from all 10 airports with whom GAO spoke stated that airports benefit from the installation of integrated, in-line baggage screening systems. The primary benefit\u0097cited by representatives from 9 of the airports GAO visited\u0097is that passenger congestion is reduced by removing stand-alone machines from lobbies or ticketing areas. Other benefits cited by airports included a reduction in lost baggage and increased screening and passenger throughput. However, for a variety of reasons, representatives from 8 of 10 airports GAO visited opposed a reduction in the federal cost share for related airport modifications.", "TSA established cost estimates for the EBSP to help identify total program cost, recapitalization cost, and potential savings resulting from installing optimal systems, but its processes for developing these estimates do not fully comply with best practices. These include, among other things, ensuring that the estimates comprise all costs and are well documented. For example, TSA\u0092s estimates were properly adjusted for inflation and were developed using relevant data, such as existing contracts for equipment purchases and maintenance costs. However, the estimates did not include all costs, for example, the costs associated with detecting all security threats, and many assumptions and methodologies underlying the cost model were not clearly documented. As highlighted in GAO\u0092s past work, a high-quality, reliable cost estimation process provides a sound basis for making accurate and well-informed decisions about resource investments and budgets and thus is critical to the success of a program. Developing accurate cost estimates would help ensure that the program does not experience unanticipated cost growth and program funding needs resulting from future recapitalization and facility modification activities. In addition, TSA is working with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to develop an approved acquisition program baseline, which according to DHS guidance is the contract between program and departmental oversight officials for what will be delivered, how it will perform, and what it will cost. TSA expects the baseline to be approved in May 2012."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that TSA ensure that its life cycle cost estimates conform to cost estimating best practices.

The 1988 bombing of  a U.S. airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, further demonstrates that  explosive devices placed in checked baggage have long been an area of  concern. The Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), enacted  on November 19, 2001, created the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA), now a component of the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), and mandated, among other things, that it provide for the  screening of all checked baggage using explosive detection systems. To  satisfy this mandate, TSA has deployed two types of screening  equipment to airports in the United States where screening is required:  (1) explosives detection systems (EDS), which use X-rays with computer- aided imaging to automatically recognize the characteristic signatures of  threat explosives, and (2) explosives trace detection (ETD) machines, in  which a human operator (baggage screener) uses chemical analysis to  manually detect traces of explosive materials\u2019 vapors and residue.", "As amended, ATSA mandated that TSA provide for the screening of all  checked baggage using EDS machines no later than December 31,  2003. To meet the 100 percent checked baggage screening  requirement, TSA deployed screening equipment in a variety of  temporary screening solutions, including EDS machines placed in stand- alone configurations in airport terminal lobbies, and solutions that relied  on ETD machines for primary screening. According to TSA, these initial  stand-alone EDS machines have higher operating costs and can screen  fewer bags per hour than EDS machines that are integrated into a single,  coordinated \u201cin-line\u201d baggage handling system. To improve the efficiency  and effectiveness of baggage screening at airports, TSA\u2019s Electronic  Baggage Screening Program (EBSP) aims to, among other goals, (1)  replace, reconfigure, and deploy equipment to increase throughput,  system capacity, and effectiveness while reducing staffing requirements  and airport lobby installations; (2) increase equipment reliability, reduce  equipment downtime, and extend service life; and (3) achieve new  capabilities to better detect changing terrorist threats.", "Pursuant to ATSA, providing for checked baggage screening is a federal  responsibility, but airports must be capable of accommodating the  screening systems to secure safe travel for the nation\u2019s passengers.

Such optimal baggage screening systems may have a  mix of detection systems (EDS or ETD) and configurations (in-line or  stand-alone systems), depending on the airport\u2019s needs, and may help  streamline airport and TSA operations, reduce screening costs, and  enhance security. However, in-line solutions may not be appropriate or  cost effective in airports or terminals with fewer bags per week to screen.  From fiscal years 2008 through 2011, TSA reported that it obligated  approximately $1.9 billion to support airport facility modification projects  required to install more efficient optimal baggage screening systems, and  estimates that it will obligate an additional $1.15 billion for this purpose  through fiscal year 2030.

In accordance with ATSA, TSA is  responsible for the procurement, installation, and maintenance of  explosive detection systems, including EDS and ETD, used to screen  checked baggage for explosives (see figs. 1 and 2) at TSA-regulated  airports. EDS machines identify suspicious items or anomalies in  checked baggage that could indicate the presence of explosives or  detonation devices. At airports with EDS, EDS machines are generally  employed for primary screening of checked baggage while ETD machines  are used for secondary screening to help resolve questions raised by  EDS screening. At airports without EDS, ETD machines are used as the  primary method for screening checked baggage.", "TSA deploys EDS machines in stand-alone and in-line configurations. In  a stand-alone configuration, checked baggage is manually loaded and  unloaded by screeners (see fig. 1). In contrast, an in-line configuration  integrates EDS machines with a baggage handling system\u2014a conveyor  system that transports and sorts baggage from the ticket counter through  the baggage screening system. (See fig. 3, which shows an in-line  configuration with three EDS machines.)", "Generally, an in-line checked baggage inspection system employs three  levels of screening (see fig. 4). EDS machines perform automated (Level  1) screening. If the EDS machine is unable to clear a bag, it sends an  alarm to a screener who performs a secondary (Level 2) inspection  known as On-Screen Resolution by reviewing an image of the contents of  the bag via computer monitor. If the screener cannot resolve the alarm  using on-screen resolution tools, the bag goes to the Checked Baggage  Resolution Area (Level 3) where another screener will perform manual  inspection of the bag assisted by an ETD machine.", "TSA officials stated that deployment of an integrated, centralized in-line  system of EDS machines can enhance security, increase screening  efficiencies, and lower screening costs by, among other things, reducing  the number of screeners needed to conduct baggage screening and  reducing work-related injuries caused by lifting heavy bags. Installing an  in-line system can require modification of an airport terminal, including  removal of the existing system, installation of a new baggage handling  system and EDS machines, and the use of an interim solution to screen  checked baggage while the in-line system is built. TSA estimates that  depending on the size and complexity of an in-line project, installing an in- line system can take one to four years at larger (category X and I)  airports.", "In 2005, we reported that although TSA made substantial progress in  installing EDS machines, the agency had not conducted a systematic,  prospective analysis to determine which airports could achieve long-term  savings and improve efficiencies and security by installing in-line systems  or, where in-line systems may not be economically justifiable, by making  greater use of stand-alone EDS rather than relying on the labor-intensive  and less efficient ETD screening processes. We recommended that  TSA systematically evaluate baggage screening needs at airports,  including identifying and prioritizing the airports where the benefits\u2014such  as cost savings of screening operations and improved security\u2014of  replacing stand-alone baggage screening machines with in-line systems  are likely to exceed the costs of the systems.

For example, as enacted,  ATSA authorized the use of Airport Improvement Program (AIP) funds for  projects to support the installation of explosive detection systems.  Subsequently enacted statutes, such as the Vision 100\u2014Century of  Aviation Reauthorization Act (Vision 100), however, either limited or  precluded the use of AIP to fund projects related to the installation of in- line systems. TSA, which is solely responsible for procuring and  deploying equipment to screen checked baggage for explosives, also  provides funding in support of related facility modifications. The  Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003, first authorized the use of  LOIs by TSA for airport facility modification projects related to the  installation of in-line baggage screening systems. Although not a  binding commitment of federal funding, LOIs are agreements providing  that TSA will reimburse airports or airlines for a specified percentage of  an eligible project\u2019s cost, subject to the availability of appropriations. This  in turn enables an airport to proceed with a project because the airport  and any investors are aware that the agreed-upon percentage of  allowable costs will likely be reimbursed. The airport or airline is  responsible for its share of the total funding needed to complete the  project and generally must be capable of funding the project in its entirety.", "From fiscal years 2003 through 2007, TSA entered into 8 LOI agreements  covering 9 airports. Pursuant to the law then in effect, these LOI agreements provided for a 75 percent federal cost share of allowable  project costs. Beginning in fiscal year 2008 and in accordance with  Vision 100, any LOI entered into by TSA was to reflect a 90 percent  federal cost share. Since 2008, TSA has entered into 4 more LOIs at a  90 percent federal cost share. As of December 13, 2011, TSA reported  that its net cumulative obligations for all 12 LOIs were $1.46 billion. TSA  also uses OTAs to support airport facility modification projects related to  the installation of checked baggage screening equipment. TSA describes  OTAs, which have become the primary administrative vehicles through  which TSA financially supports such projects, generally as single-year  reimbursable agreements (in contrast to the multiyear LOI agreements).  According to TSA, OTAs take many forms and are generally not required  to comply with federal laws and regulations that apply to contracts or  cooperative agreements, such as the Federal Acquisitions Regulations,  thus enabling the parties to negotiate provisions that are mutually  agreeable. According to TSA, the federal cost share applied to OTAs may  be negotiated, but since fiscal year 2008 TSA has generally followed the  federal cost share applicable to LOIs. As of the end of fiscal year 2011,  TSA had used at least 150 OTAs to support airport facility modifications  related to the installation of in-line systems. According to TSA, these  OTAs have reflected federal cost shares ranging from 50 to100 percent.

Additionally, TSA plans to deploy EDS machines in in-line configurations  at all category X and I airports and in-line or stand-alone configurations at  category II and III airports. At each of the 10 airports we visited, we  observed distinct checked baggage screening needs, based on an  airport\u2019s terminal configuration and the number of passenger boardings.  We discussed an airport\u2019s willingness and financial ability to pay for  facility modifications required to install in-line systems. For each of these  airports, officials and engineers provided documentation (for example,  drawings and blueprints) on distinct facility modification projects to  accommodate baggage screening system upgrades. According to airport  officials, TSA and airport officials work together to determine the most  appropriate baggage screening configuration based on an airport\u2019s  needs. Of the 337 airports where baggage screening systems are optimal  and no longer using temporary solutions, 55 airports use EDS in-line  systems exclusively for their primary checked baggage screening needs,  while 92 airports use EDS stand-alone machines only, and 167 use ETD  systems exclusively.

Moreover, TSA officials stated that the  in-line systems that best meet the screening needs of larger airports take  longer to plan and build because of the added complexity and scale of the  upgrades and the coordination required among multiple stakeholders.", "TSA anticipates that in the next 5 years about 60 percent (1,153 of 1,933)  of the EDS machines will reach the end of their useful life of about 10  years and will need to be replaced, as shown in figure 7. As a result, to  ensure that 100 percent of checked bags continue to be screened as  required by ATSA, TSA revised its focus from replacing stand-alone EDS  in airport lobbies with in-line systems to replacing its aging fleet of EDS  and ETD machines, a process it calls recapitalization. However, TSA  reported that it will continue to collaborate with airports or airlines to install  optimal in-line systems if it coincides with efforts to recapitalize aging  EDS machines or if the existing in-line systems do not meet current TSA  standards. In August 2011, TSA issued its EDS and ETD Recapitalization  and Optimization Plan, which establishes the method and criteria for  prioritizing when and how EBSP recapitalization and optimization will  occur. The plan notes that many in-line recapitalization projects will  include an optimization component. For example, a number of early in- line screening systems are likely to require optimization, among other  things, to improve performance, increase efficiency, and reduce operating  costs. At one airport we visited with an early in-line system, we observed  a baggage handling system that needed to be replaced because it had  sharp curves and steep grades that led to an excessive number of errors  and jams.

The working group, which  consisted of over 60 members representing, among others, TSA, FAA,  airports, airlines, designers of baggage handling systems, and financial  institutions, were unable to develop a consensus on an appropriate cost  share formula, in large part because of the difficulties of measuring  benefits, differing views on the federal responsibility for funding capital  investments related to baggage screening, and the competing demands  on the federal budget.

As a result, officials from 5 of the 10  airports we spoke with told us that after necessary, but nonallowable,  costs were included, the airports were already paying for more than  10 percent of the modification costs associated with in-line systems.", "Airports have a backlog of capital projects or would rather fund  projects that will produce additional revenue, such as parking garages  or larger areas for concessions, than projects that are related to TSA\u2019s  security responsibilities.", "TSA will be the primary beneficiary of in-line baggage screening  systems because the integration and consolidation of these systems  will enable TSA to reduce the number of baggage screeners and  provide TSA with other operational efficiencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA\u2019s Cost Estimation Processes Do Not Fully Comply with Best Practices, and TSA and DHS Are Working Together to Establish an Acquisition Program Baseline", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Estimates That the EBSP Will Cost Close to $50 Billion through 2030", "paragraphs": ["TSA\u2019s August 25, 2011, life cycle cost estimate identified a total program  cost for EBSP of $49.2 billion through fiscal year 2030. The $49.2 billion  includes $2.65 billion for EBSP program operation and management;  $11.03 billion for capital costs, including, among other things,  recapitalization and facility modifications for optimization; $14.89 billion  for operations and maintenance of equipment; $18.42 billion for screener  salaries; and $2.22 billion for research and development and other  miscellaneous related costs. Additionally, TSA officials reported that the  program is expected to provide life cycle cost savings of $537 million.  However, we found that the cost estimates are of questionable reliability  for a precise estimate. TSA continues to revise its life cycle cost  estimates. For example, its August 2011 EBSP life cycle cost estimate  report stated that new requirements, including recapitalization and  upgrading the efficiency of early in-line systems, will likely lead to a gap  between anticipated program needs and anticipated funding during fiscal  years 2012 to 2017, totaling up to $436 million. However, in December  2011 TSA officials told us the DHS Acquisition Review Board had  requested that TSA revise the EBSP funding plans and projections to  more accurately reflect current budget constraints and reduced funding  available for the program. According to TSA officials, they plan to  complete the revised EBSP planning estimates and funding projections to  help eliminate the potential funding gap before the next Acquisition  Review Board meeting in May 2012. EBSP senior program officials  explained that TSA will address the potential funding gap by   (1) controlling the costs associated with engineering initiatives and  improvements in technology performance, (2) delaying funding of some  new in-line systems and recapitalization projects, and (3) extending the  useful life of equipment beyond 10 years in cases where replacement  could be delayed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA\u2019s Life Cycle Cost Estimates Are Not Fully Consistent with Best Practices for Reliable and Credible Estimates", "paragraphs": ["Although TSA\u2019s methods for developing its LCCE reflect features of best  practices, its methods do not fully adhere to these practices. As  highlighted in our past work, a high-quality, reliable cost estimation  process provides a sound basis for making accurate and well-informed  decisions about resource investments, budgets, assessments of  progress, and accountability for results and thus is critical to the success  of a program. According to the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), federal agencies must maintain current and well-documented  estimates of program costs, and these estimates must encompass the  program\u2019s full life cycle.increased risk of making poorly informed investment decisions, securing   Without such an estimate, agencies are at  insufficient resources to effectively execute defined program plans and  schedules, and experiencing program cost and schedule overruns and  performance shortfalls. As highlighted in our Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide, a reliable cost estimate has four characteristics\u2014it is  comprehensive, well documented, accurate, and credible. We reviewed  TSA\u2019s cost estimation procedures for the EBSP and assessed the extent  to which the agency met the four characteristics, as shown in table 2.", "Our assessment showed that TSA\u2019s EBSP estimates partially met three  characteristics and minimally met one characteristic of a reliable cost  estimate. Specifically, TSA\u2019s cost estimate was as follows:", "Partially comprehensive because the estimate defines the program,  reflects the current schedule, is technically reasonable, includes  assumptions identified by a team of personnel and engineers, and  provides risks related to detection standards. However, the cost  estimate is not considered fully comprehensive because it does not  incorporate costs associated with all security threats, lacks a detailed  product-oriented work breakdown structure that covers the entire  scope of work, and lacks a single technical baseline. Without fully  accounting for life cycle costs, management may have difficulty  successfully planning program resource requirements and making  wise decisions. Further, the program lacks a defined end date. A  reasonable criterion is that the estimate capture at least 10 years of  costs beyond the planned full operational capability date\u2014the date at  which optimal systems are fully deployed and operating at all  locations. However, we cannot determine whether the time frame is  sufficient because we have not received documentation to support the  program\u2019s official, planned full operational capability date. According  to TSA, the EBSP does not have a defined end date for procurement  because maintaining compliance with the 100 percent screening  mandate established by ATSA requires TSA to continuously procure  and replace equipment as it reaches the end of its useful life. TSA  also believes that it is following DHS acquisition guidance outlined  under the acquisition decision memorandum dated January 13, 2005,  for estimating threshold dates. Nevertheless, the EBSP still lacks a  defined, official full operational capability date, without which we can  neither determine whether the time frame used in the LCCE is  sufficient nor verify that the life cycle cost estimate is fully  comprehensive.", "Partially documented because TSA used relevant data to help  develop the estimate. For example, TSA\u2019s estimated price for the  equipment is based on existing contracts for EBSP equipment  purchases, maintenance costs, LOI agreements, and OTAs. TSA also  provided narratives, briefings, and documents to describe the program  requirements, purpose, technical characteristics, and acquisition  strategy, and explained how calculations were performed. However,  TSA did not adequately document many assumptions or  methodologies underlying its cost model to the extent that would allow  someone unfamiliar with the cost estimate, using only the available  documentation, to easily re-create the estimate. For example,  equipment purchase and hardware upgrade costs were based in part  on estimates from engineers and contract specialists rather than  historical or analogous data. Unless ground rules and assumptions  are clearly documented, the cost estimate will not have a basis for  areas of potential risk to be resolved. In addition, TSA also provided  little or no evidence that the assumptions and methodologies  underlying the cost estimate were approved by management.officials agreed that additional documentation could improve the  outside reviewers\u2019 ability to evaluate the estimate. According to TSA,  the EBSP plans to follow DHS guidance to implement software  dedicated to the estimation, documentation, and reporting of costs  during all phases of the EBSP program life cycle to help address  documentation concerns.", "Partially accurate because while the estimate is properly adjusted for  inflation, differences between planned and actual costs are not fully  documented, explained, or reviewed. In addition, we cannot determine  whether the cost estimate is unbiased\u2014that is, neither overly  conservative nor overly optimistic\u2014because the program did not  perform an uncertainty analysis that meets best practices. While TSA  agreed that costs should be documented, it could not explain why the  differences between planned and actual costs were not being fully  documented, explained, or reviewed.", "Minimally credible because while TSA identified changes in cost for  each scenario against the baseline and developed a limited risk  analysis, TSA did not complete other relevant activities to ensure that  the estimate accounts for bias and uncertainty. For example, the  agency did not (1) document in detail the assumptions and  parameters associated with its sensitivity analysis, such as detailed  calculations on how each parameter was varied between its minimum  and maximum values; (2) conduct a fully objective uncertainty  analysis that derives the point estimate percentile rather than  assumes it; (3) cross-check major cost elements to see whether  results are similar; and (4) use an independent cost estimate to  validate the cost estimate. Given the important role that an  independent cost estimate provides in developing an objective and  unbiased assessment of whether the program estimate can be  achieved, developing and using an independent cost estimate would  provide decision makers with insight into a program\u2019s potential costs  and reduce the risk of underfunding a program. TSA officials told us  they did not perform a complete uncertainty analysis because it was  too costly and time consuming. TSA officials concurred that an  independent cost estimate was not done for the EBSP and agreed  that completing an independent estimate would be helpful.", "Regarding the credibility of TSA\u2019s estimates, our past work has shown  that program cost estimates that are independently validated help  improve the confidence that the estimate is credible, are needed for  making timely and informed budget decisions, and help reduce the  likelihood of unanticipated program cost growth. Our prior reviews of  several DHS programs, including the EBSP, have also shown that if cost  estimates are not validated in accordance with DHS acquisition  management directive requirements at the start of an acquisition  program, it is difficult to assess whether a program is being deployed  within planned budgets. Further, DHS\u2019s Acquisition Management  Directive requires major program cost estimates to be validated early in  the decision-making process, before programs can receive authorization  for acquisition contracts at the DHS Acquisition Review Board meeting.  However, we found that since 2008 the DHS Acquisition Review Board  allowed the EBSP to proceed with acquisition contracts before the LCCE  was independently validated by DHS, which is inconsistent with DHS  policy.", "In May 2010, the DHS Cost Analysis Division reviewed the EBSP life  cycle cost estimate and found that it needed more comprehensive data  and that its accuracy could not be determined. As of December 2011, the  estimate had not been independently validated by DHS. According to  TSA, DHS guidance that required validation of cost estimates was not in  place until November 2008. The interim DHS directive for LCCEs and  validation was established in November 2008, and the Cost Analysis  Division was designated the authority responsible for independent cost  estimates on January 24, 2010. However, the DHS Acquisition Review  Board did not request a validated LCCE until February 25, 2011. TSA  officials also stated that since the program\u2019s budget circumstances  changed over time, the cost estimate needed to be revised to reflect a  constrained budget for fiscal year 2013 and other program changes. For  example, TSA officials stated that new requirements for the EBSP,  particularly the shift in focus to recapitalization of the aging EDS and ETD  fleet and upgrades to in-line baggage screening systems and threat  detection levels, contributed to continued program cost growth and  delayed efforts to validate the latest LCCEs. As a result, the federal  government\u2019s portion of the cost estimates for the EBSP has increased  from approximately $20.5 billion in fiscal year 2010 to $25.4 billion in  fiscal year 2011\u2014a 24 percent increase.DHS on the validation of the cost estimate for the next Acquisition Review  Board meeting scheduled for May 2012.", "TSA is currently working with  According to our 2009 Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, endorsed  by the OMB and DHS, cost estimates are integral to determining and  communicating a realistic view of likely cost outcomes that can be used to  plan the work necessary to develop, produce, and support a program.

Establishing such a  baseline at program start is important for defining the program\u2019s scope,  assessing whether all life cycle costs are properly calculated, and  measuring how well the program is meeting its goals. As we have  previously reported, establishing realistic original baseline estimates is  important for minimizing the risks of poorly defined requirements and  achieving better program outcomes. By tracking and measuring actual  program performance against this formal baseline, management can be  alerted to potential problems, such as cost growth or changing  requirements, and has the ability to take early corrective action.", "However, since the inception of the program more than eight years ago,  the EBSP has not had a DHS approved acquisition program baseline and  DHS did not require TSA to complete an acquisition program baseline  until November 2008. An approved baseline will provide DHS with  additional assurances that TSA\u2019s approach is appropriate and that the  capabilities being pursued are worth the expected costs. DHS officials  told us that several reorganizations of DHS offices responsible for  approving the baseline and a lack of functional expertise within the  agency contributed to further delays in approving the EBSP acquisition  program baseline. According to TSA officials, they have twice submitted  an acquisition program baseline to DHS for approval. In November 2009  and February 2011, TSA requested approval of a program baseline, but  according to DHS officials TSA did not have a fully developed life cycle  cost estimate. In November 2011, DHS told TSA that it needed to revise  the life cycle cost estimates as well as its procurement and deployment  schedules to reflect budget constraints. DHS officials told us that they  could not approve the acquisition program baseline as written because  TSA\u2019s estimates were significantly over budget. TSA officials stated that  TSA is currently working with DHS to amend the draft program baseline  for approval. TSA officials stated that they plan to resubmit the revised  acquisition program baseline before the next Acquisition Review Board  meeting in May 2012.

These  projections represent TSA\u2019s best estimate for how much it will spend on  airport modifications for in-line systems each year from fiscal years 2012  through 2030. We also reviewed the reliability of the cost estimate by  evaluating how well TSA followed best practices detailed in the GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide (see below). While TSA\u2019s process for  estimating costs only partially meets the characteristics of a reliable cost  estimate, the data can serve to provide a rough indication of how much  could be saved by reducing the federal cost share for optimization. To  assess how the installation of in-line baggage handling systems may  benefit the airports that receive them, we visited a nonrandom sample of  10 airports. We chose these airports based on the size of airport, type of  checked baggage screening systems installed, and status of airport  facility modification completion. We discussed cost share with officials at  each airport representing the airport authority, tenant airlines, and TSA\u2019s  Federal Security Director.
