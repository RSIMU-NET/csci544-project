While weaknesses remain, SBA has taken some steps to enhance program processes to varying extents. For example,", "Certification process. In 2008, GAO found that SBA performed limited verification of the information firms reported on applications. In response to GAO's recommendation to develop and implement guidance for the certification process, SBA has taken steps to improve its processes to verify the eligibility of firms applying to the program. Since fiscal year 2009, SBA has required firms to provide supporting documentation for applications that the agency then reviews.", "Susceptibility to fraud and abuse. In 2008 and 2009, GAO's investigations found 29 HUBZone firms in five metropolitan areas made fraudulent or inaccurate representations, which allowed them to get into or remain in the program. In response to GAO's recommendations to address potential fraud, SBA increased its documentation requirements. But in 2010, GAO still was able to obtain HUBZone certification using bogus addresses. Subsequently, according to SBA officials, in fiscal year 2010 SBA began conducting site visits to 10 percent of certified firms.", "Recertification process. Firms wishing to remain in the program must recertify their continued eligibility to SBA every 3 years. However, in 2015, GAO found that SBA had not required firms seeking recertification to submit any information to verify continued eligibility and instead simply relied on their attestations of continued eligibility. GAO recommended that SBA reassess its recertification process and add additional controls. As of February 2017, SBA had not yet implemented this recommendation.", "Communications with firms about designations. GAO found in 2015 that SBA's communications to firms about programmatic changes (including redesignation) generally were not specific to affected firms and thus some firms might not have been informed they would lose eligibility. GAO recommended that SBA establish a better notification mechanism. In response, SBA revised its letters to newly certified firms to inform them of the consequences of redesignation, and as of February 2017, SBA was implementing additional steps to ensure that all currently certified firms would be notified of changes that could affect their program eligibility."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our work on the Small Business  Administration\u2019s (SBA) Historically Underutilized Business Zone  (HUBZone) program.

The program  provides federal contracting preferences to small businesses located in  HUBZone-designated areas that also employ residents of the areas. The  contracting preferences that a certified HUBZone firm (one that meets  program eligibility requirements) can receive include limited-competition  contracting awards such as sole-source and set-aside contracts. In some  cases, a HUBZone-certified firm can receive an award through full and  open competition. Federal agencies are responsible for trying to meet an  annual statutory goal for awarding contracts to HUBZone firms (3 percent  of the total dollar amount of all prime contracts and subcontracts subject  to such goals). During fiscal year 2015, federal agencies collectively  awarded 1.8 percent of eligible contracts to HUBZone-certified firms.", "In this statement, I will discuss the evolution of the HUBZone program  over the past decade, based on prior GAO performance audits and fraud  investigations. Specifically, this testimony (1) discusses areas of  weaknesses we have identified in prior reports, including fraud  investigations, and SBA\u2019s actions to address them; and (2) examines  2012 and 2015 data on the economic characteristics of HUBZones.  Generally, our prior work addressed SBA\u2019s efforts to better ensure that  only eligible small businesses participate in the HUBZone program,  including efforts to address fraud; how SBA communicates about  HUBZone area designations to HUBZone firms; and the economic  characteristics of HUBZones, including those slated to lose their  designations. In preparing this statement, we relied on our body of work  issued between June 2008 and September 2016. In addition, in  February 2017 we met with SBA officials to discuss the status of open  recommendations. As part of our fraud investigations, we created bogus  firms with fictitious owners and employees and submitted applications for  HUBZone certification to SBA. In addition, we selected HUBZone firms  based on certain criteria, such as receipt of HUBZone contracts, and  investigated them to determine whether they met key program eligibility  requirements.", "The work on which this statement is based was performed in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards or quality  standards for investigations as set forth by the President\u2019s Council on  Integrity and Efficiency, as appropriate. Those standards require that we  plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to  provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.

Congress  subsequently expanded the criteria for HUBZones to add former military  bases and counties in difficult development areas outside the continental  United States. The number of HUBZones increased from about 8,000 in  2000 to more than 14,000 in 2006.", "SBA generally updates HUBZone designations at least twice a year  based on whether they meet statutory criteria (such as having certain  income levels or poverty or unemployment rates). SBA generally uses  data from other federal agencies to determine if areas still qualify for the  HUBZone program. As a result of the updates, additional areas are  designated for inclusion while other areas lose their designation. Census  tracts and nonmetropolitan counties that lose their designation begin a 3- year \u201credesignation\u201d period during which firms in those areas can  continue to apply to and participate in the program and receive  contracting preferences. For instance, about 3,400 HUBZones  redesignated in 2012 lost their designations in 2015. Another  approximately 2,500 census tracts and nonmetropolitan counties are  scheduled to lose their designation by January 2020.

SBA officials did not believe they needed to  request supporting documentation from recertifying firms because all  firms in the program had undergone a full document review, either at  initial application or during SBA\u2019s review of its legacy portfolio in fiscal  years 2010\u20132012. However, as we found, the characteristics of firms  and the status of HUBZone areas\u2014the bases for program eligibility\u2014 often can change and need to be monitored.

The  officials also cited resource limitations. Based on data that SBA  provided, the agency visited about 10 percent of certified firms each year  during fiscal years 2013\u20132015. SBA\u2019s reliance on site visits alone would  not mitigate the recertification weaknesses that were the basis for our  recommendation.

Also, while the  poverty and unemployment rates for qualified and non-HUBZone  nonmetropolitan counties remained relatively unchanged between 2012  and 2015, the unemployment rate decreased in redesignated counties.", "We also updated our analysis that included indicators for household  income and housing value for qualified, redesignated, and non-HUBZone  areas (by census tract). As shown in table 1, in both 2012 and 2015  qualified areas on average, had higher poverty and unemployment rates  and lower median household income and housing values then either  redesignated or non-HUBZone areas. On average, redesignated areas  had economic indicators between those of qualified and nonqualified  areas.

In contrast, the average median household income  increased for both redesignated and non-HUBZone areas during that  period.", "As we have stated since our June 2008 report, while allowing continued  eligibility for firms located in redesignated areas can benefit firms and  communities in such areas, allowing continued eligibility could also result  in diffusion\u2014decreased targeting of areas with greatest economic  distress\u2014by lessening the competitive advantage on which small  businesses may rely to thrive in economically distressed communities.  Therefore, while allowing redesignated areas to remain eligible can  generate economic benefits for such areas, the inclusion of such areas in  the HUBZone program could limit the benefits that qualified areas with  more depressed economic conditions might realize.
