To address these challenges, section 911 of the NDAA for FY 2017 directed the Secretary of Defense to issue an organizational strategy that identifies critical objectives that span multiple functional boundaries; establish cross-functional teams to support this strategy and provide related guidance and training; and take actions to streamline the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Further, section 921 of the NDAA for FY 2019 calls for the Secretary of Defense to reform the department's enterprise business operations.", "The NDAAs for FY 2017 and 2019 also included provisions for GAO to assess DOD's actions in response to sections 911 and 921, respectively. This report assesses the extent to which DOD has made progress in (1) addressing the requirements of section 911, and (2) reforming the department's enterprise business operations under section 921. GAO reviewed documentation on DOD's implementation of sections 911 and 921; interviewed cross-functional team leaders, members, and other DOD officials; and compared DOD's implementation of its cross-functional teams to GAO's key practices."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has implemented four statutory requirements in section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2017, but has not addressed five requirements intended to support cross-functional teams and promote department-wide collaboration (see table).", "For two of these requirements, DOD has missed the statutory deadline by more than a year. GAO previously recommended that DOD take actions to improve its implementation of section 911, and DOD reported it is doing so, such as revising its draft cross-functional team guidance to address statutory requirements. Fully implementing GAO's prior recommendations and the remaining statutory requirements would better position DOD to effectively implement its cross-functional teams and advance a collaborative culture, as required by the NDAA.", "Nine cross-functional teams are driving DOD's enterprise business reform efforts under section 921 of the FY 2019 NDAA, but the teams' progress has been uneven. As of September 2018, DOD reported that these nine teams were pursuing a total of 135 business reform initiatives. However, 104 of these initiatives have not reached the implementation phase. A key challenge facing the teams is that some lack resources to fully implement their approved initiatives. For example, DOD officials stated that the department did not fulfill four of nine funding requests from the teams in fiscal year 2018 to implement their initiatives. As of September 2018, DOD officials estimated that the teams need about $6.7 billion to implement their initiatives from FYs 2018 through 2024, but DOD has not identified sources for this funding. GAO's prior work on efficiency initiatives found that up-front investments may be required to realize long-term savings. In addition, GAO's prior work on leading practices for implementing effective cross-functional teams highlights the importance of providing teams with access to resources and having well-defined team operations with established rules and procedures. However, DOD has not established a process for identifying and prioritizing available funding for implementing the teams' initiatives. Without such a process, DOD and the teams may not be able to adequately plan for and execute their reform initiatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD establish a process to identify and prioritize funding for implementing its cross-functional teams' business reform initiatives.

For example, our prior work found that DOD\u2019s efforts to  implement a hierarchical, portfolio-based approach to strategically acquire  contracted services had not been successful. In part, we found that the  cultural barriers and military commanders\u2019 reluctance to give up certain  responsibilities for determining how and which services were needed to  meet their missions hindered DOD\u2019s efforts. We have highlighted these  challenges in additional reports, including our High-Risk report, which  calls attention to agencies and program areas that are high risk because  of their vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement, or are  most in need of transformation. Further, the National Defense Business  Operations Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022 highlights that collaboration  and communication among the Office of the Secretary of Defense,  military services, and combatant commands are essential to ensuring the  success of the readiness program across the department.", "Section 911 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal  Year 2017 contained multiple requirements to help advance a more  collaborative culture within DOD.

This report is to set forth a comprehensive assessment of  the actions that DOD has taken pursuant to section 911 during each 6- month period and cumulatively since the NDAA\u2019s enactment. We have  issued three reports to date. In our first report, issued in June 2017, we  found that DOD had taken steps in several areas to begin implementing  the requirements of section 911. In our second report, issued in February  2018, we found that DOD had implemented some of the statutory  requirements outlined in section 911, but could do more to promote  department-wide collaboration, as required under the statute. We  recommended, and DOD concurred, that the CMO take four actions to  improve the department\u2019s implementation of section 911. In our third  report, issued in June 2018, we found that DOD had taken additional  steps in response to section 911, but still had not implemented several  requirements intended to support cross-functional teams and promote  department-wide collaboration.

Section 921 requires the Secretary of Defense, acting  through the CMO, to reform the enterprise business operations of the  department through reductions, eliminations, or improvements across all  organizations and elements of DOD with respect to any activity related to  civilian resources management, logistics management, services  contracting, or real estate management to increase effectiveness and  efficiency of mission execution. We are required to submit a report by  May 2019, setting forth an assessment of DOD\u2019s actions pursuant to the  provision. Because we determined that DOD\u2019s efforts to establish cross- functional teams dedicated to improving the department\u2019s business  operations are closely linked to the section 921 requirements, we are  combining our assessment of DOD\u2019s actions related to both sections 911  and 921 in this report.", "In this report, we assess the extent to which DOD has made progress in  implementing (1) the section 911 requirements related to DOD\u2019s  organizational strategy and cross-functional teams and (2) the section  921 requirements to reform the enterprise business operations of the  department.", "For the first objective, we reviewed documentation and interviewed  OCMO and other DOD officials on the department\u2019s efforts to finalize its  draft organizational strategy; establish cross-functional teams; provide  guidance on cross-functional teams; provide training to cross-functional  team members, their supervisors, and presidential appointees; report on  the establishment of cross-functional teams; and take actions to  streamline the organizational structure and processes of the Office of the  Secretary of Defense.

In addition, we conducted interviews with the leaders and  members from the nine cross-functional teams dedicated to improving the  department\u2019s business operations and analyzed the information from  these meetings. We interviewed team members separately from team  leaders to encourage candid discussion about the operations of the  teams. Two GAO analysts independently reviewed interviewees\u2019  responses to our questions to code them in terms of leading practices for  implementing effective cross-functional teams that we have identified in  our prior work. The analysts then compared how they coded the  statements. Where there was disagreement in the coding, the analysts  discussed their analyses and tried to reach a consensus. In cases where  they could not reach a consensus, a third analyst decided how the  information should be coded. In addition, we reviewed OCMO\u2019s efforts to  oversee the teams\u2019 progress, including observing a demonstration of the  dashboard used to monitor the teams\u2019 metrics.

We found that implementation of the business reform teams has  demonstrated some key characteristics of leading practices for  implementing effective cross-functional teams that we have identified in  our prior work. For example, across all the teams we spoke with,  members were responsible for leading the development of their team\u2019s  initiatives and communicating with their home organizations to obtain  input, demonstrating a well-defined team structure. In addition, the  business reform teams are structured to facilitate open and regular  communication, another leading practice. For example, the teams are  generally co-located with each other, which enables direct communication  among team members and between teams, members stated. Further,  members from most of the teams we spoke with were supportive of their  team leaders and viewed them as effective in their roles, demonstrating  an inclusive team environment. Team leaders across all teams also  stated that they regularly interact with senior management, such as  through weekly one-on-one meetings with the CMO or Deputy CMO. This  engagement reflects a key characteristic that states team leaders should  regularly interact with senior management.", "However, we found that the business reform teams\u2019 efforts have not  proceeded according to early plans outlined by the department. DOD\u2019s  August 2017 report to Congress on restructuring the CMO organization  stated that the teams were intended to help modify processes to move  toward enterprise service delivery. According to the report, the  department would transition to DOD enterprise services by the end of  fiscal year 2018. In July 2018, OCMO officials acknowledged that they  were behind schedule, but told us they expected to catch up to this  deadline by the end of fiscal year 2018, as originally planned. That  deadline was not realized. According to OCMO officials, the teams are  identifying new milestones for implementing initiatives, some of which will  contribute to a move toward enterprise services.", "In addition, the business reform teams vary in the number of initiatives  they are pursuing. As of September 2018, OCMO reported that the teams  were pursuing a total of 135 initiatives and that the number of initiatives  per team ranged from 2 to 38. For example, the community services  management team was developing 2 initiatives\u20141 to examine the  feasibility of merging DOD\u2019s three military exchange services and the  Defense Commissary Agency into a single resale enterprise, and the  other to streamline the inventory of DOD lodging. In contrast, the supply  chain and logistics team was developing 21 short- and long-term  initiatives, such as reducing the footprint of underutilized warehouses and  developing better data interoperability throughout the supply chain and  logistics enterprise.", "Further, the teams\u2019 progress in advancing their initiatives to the  implementation and monitoring phase has varied. The Reform  Management Group oversees the business reform teams. The Deputy  Secretary of Defense chairs the Reform Management Group, and the  CMO facilitates regular meetings of the group. The Reform  Management Group authorizes the business reform teams to proceed  with their initiatives through five gates\u20140 through 4. These gates trace  initiatives from conception to implementation and monitoring. Before  proceeding from one gate to the next, the teams must submit certain  deliverables to the Reform Management Group for review and approval.  For example, before an initiative can proceed to gate 1, OCMO requires  the teams to submit a charter for the initiative, which can identify, among  other things, the problem or opportunity statement, the project scope,  expected outcomes and risk analysis, and preliminary performance  measures. Figure 1 provides an overview of the five gates and the  status of initiatives by gate, as of September 2018.", "As shown in figure 1, while some teams have successfully advanced  several initiatives to gate 4, others have not yet progressed initiatives past  gate 2. Specifically, as of September 2018, DOD reported that 104 of the  teams\u2019 135 initiatives had not yet reached gate 3, the implementation  phase. According to the teams we interviewed, several factors may affect  the progress of an initiative, such as its complexity or a team\u2019s approach  to developing initiatives. For example, the community services  management team leader stated that the team is primarily focused on the  consolidation of the defense commissaries and exchanges, an initiative  that is relatively large in scope and complexity. According to the team  leader, this initiative involves a number of internal stakeholders, including  all of the military services, as well as outreach to external stakeholders,  such as veterans\u2019 organizations. In addition, the leader stated that the  team would need legislative changes to fully implement the initiative. As a  result of the large scope and complexity, the leader expects the initiative  to take longer to implement than others. Some teams have pursued a  proof-of-concept approach to developing their initiatives, which involves  pilots to test initiatives to prove their value prior to department-wide  implementation. For example, the health care management team is  conducting a regional pilot to test the feasibility of consolidating the  purchasing of services across the military health system.", "DOD has asserted that some of its initiatives have produced benefits  through savings or efficiencies. For example, according to a September  2018 DOD report on the department\u2019s investments in support of the  National Defense Strategy, the department achieved $1.61 billion in  benefits by implementing private-sector best practices in purchasing  goods and service contracts in the Air Force and defense agencies. In  addition, DOD reported that the department saved $297 million through  commercial information technology solutions, department-wide network  management, and optimized data centers. Further, according to the  report, consolidating four health care enterprises improved patient care  and medical readiness, with an estimated savings of more than $2.5  billion annually by 2023. OCMO officials stated that they are still in the  process of working with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Comptroller to document savings generated from the business reform  teams\u2019 initiatives. Given that OCMO officials stated they are taking steps  to document savings generated from the teams\u2019 initiatives, we are not  making a recommendation at this time, but will continue to monitor their  efforts as part of our ongoing work on the high-risk nature of DOD\u2019s  business transformation efforts.", "One senior DOD official involved in the reform effort acknowledged that  the teams\u2019 progress has been uneven. He cited a number of factors that  can affect teams\u2019 implementation, including the degree to which the  teams have support from the highest levels of department leadership to  operate independently and advance changes that may be unpopular with  internal or external stakeholders, and the ability of teams to tackle  longstanding systemic challenges, such as inaccurate cost data  throughout the department. This official and several teams we met with  cited the importance of the team leader\u2019s commitment to driving team  success.", "We found that uncertainty with funding for initiatives may be an additional  factor inhibiting some teams\u2019 progress. In some cases, the business  reform teams need funding to further develop and implement their  initiatives, such as the supply chain and logistics team\u2019s requirement for  $2.4 million to conduct a pilot project that included conducting three site  visits for warehouse and labor assessments in support of one of its  initiatives. According to OCMO officials, the business reform teams can  request funding from OCMO to further develop their initiatives, or if  funding is not available from OCMO, the teams can seek funding from  functional organizations. However, even in the early stages of their  implementation, some teams told us that they did not have access to  sufficient funding to fully develop and implement some of their approved  initiatives or that the process for obtaining the funding was uncertain.  For example, in June 2018, one team leader told us that the team did not  have sufficient funding to implement four initiatives. The leader also  stated that the team was not alerted to the lack of funding until  immediately prior to its planned implementation of these initiatives.  Members from another team stated that the Reform Management Group  wanted the team to implement its initiatives more quickly, which increased  the amount of funding the team needed for implementation. When the  team requested additional funding, however, OCMO did not have it  available. Further, OCMO officials told us that the teams submitted nine  requests for funding in fiscal year 2018, but OCMO did not have funding  to support four of these requests as of the end of fiscal year 2018.", "As the teams continue to develop and implement their initiatives, the  number of requests for funding may increase in the future. Our prior work  on efficiency initiatives has found that up-front investments may often be  required to realize long-term efficiencies and savings. In this regard,  OCMO officials told us that, as of September 2018, the nine teams had  planned investments of about $6.7 billion to implement their initiatives  from fiscal years 2018 through 2024. OCMO officials stated that this  amount is a projection from the teams, and DOD has not yet identified  sources for this funding. In addition, officials stated that more investment  could be needed as the teams continue to develop initiatives and more  enter the implementation phase. However, according to DOD\u2019s budget  materials for fiscal year 2019, requested funding for OCMO\u2014a source  used to fund the development of some of the teams\u2019 initiatives\u2014will  decrease from about $48 million in fiscal year 2018, to about $36 million  in fiscal year 2019.", "Leading practices for implementing effective cross-functional teams  highlight the importance of senior management providing teams with  access to resources. These leading practices also state that teams  should have well-defined team operations with established rules and  procedures. Further, the findings from a study contracted by DOD in  August 2017 to determine how best to implement effective cross- functional teams identified actions for DOD to consider for supporting the  implementation of its cross-functional teams, including identifying funding  mechanisms to fully support cross-functional teams. The study  suggested that language outlining the preferred mechanisms and  authorities for this purpose can be included in cross-functional team  guidance.", "OCMO officials told us that the office maintains a list of funding requests  from the teams and prioritizes which initiatives to fund based on several  factors including estimated yield, feasibility, and available resources for  implementation. However, OCMO did not have a process for identifying  and prioritizing available funding for implementing the initiatives planned  by the business reform teams for fiscal year 2018, and has not  established one for fiscal year 2019. According to OCMO officials, the  department initially planned to use available funding from OCMO or the  savings generated by the initiatives to fund the development and  implementation of other initiatives. However, OCMO officials have since  recognized that funding is needed and they are in the early stages of  developing an approach to do so. Specifically, OCMO officials said they  are working with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Comptroller to identify funding for initiatives in fiscal year 2020. While  there will likely be initiatives that cannot be funded given limited  resources, OCMO and the reform teams could benefit from a clear  process for identifying and prioritizing available funding. Without such a  process, OCMO and the reform teams may not be able to adequately  plan for and execute their initiatives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 called for organizational  and management reforms to assist DOD in addressing challenges that  have hindered collaboration and integration across the department.

DOD has highlighted its nine cross- functional teams dedicated to improving the department\u2019s business  operations as key to achieving enterprise business reform. However, this  effort has been marked by a slow start and uneven progress, and teams  face a number of challenges. One key challenge is the teams\u2019 lack of  resources to drive their initiatives forward.
