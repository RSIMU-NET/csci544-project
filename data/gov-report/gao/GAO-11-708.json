FDIC has implemented controls to detect and change default user accounts and passwords in vendor-supplied software, restricted access to network management servers, developed and tested contingency plans for major systems, and improved mainframe logging controls. However, the corporation had not always (1) required strong passwords on financial systems and databases; (2) reviewed user access to financial information in its document sharing system in accordance with policy; (3) encrypted financial information transmitted over and stored on its network; and (4) protected powerful database accounts and privileges from unauthorized use. In addition, other weaknesses existed in FDIC's controls that were intended to appropriately segregate incompatible duties, manage system configurations, and implement patches. An underlying reason for the information security weaknesses is that FDIC had not always implemented key information security program activities. To its credit, FDIC had developed and documented a security program and had completed actions to correct or mitigate 26 of the 33 information security weaknesses that were previously identified by GAO. However, the corporation had not assessed risks, documented security controls, or performed periodic testing on the programs and data used to support the estimates of losses and costs associated with the servicing and disposal of the assets of failed institutions. Additionally, FDIC had not always implemented its policies for restricting user access or for monitoring the progress of security patch installation. Because FDIC had made progress in correcting or mitigating previously reported weaknesses and had implemented compensating management and reconciliation controls during 2010, GAO concluded that FDIC had resolved the significant deficiency in internal control over financial reporting related to information security reported in GAO's 2009 audit, and that the remaining unresolved issues and the new issues identified did not individually or collectively constitute a material weakness or significant deficiency in 2010. However, if left unaddressed, these issues will continue to increase FDIC's risk that its sensitive and financial information will be subject to unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FDIC take two actions to enhance its comprehensive information security program.

Further, the interconnectivity among  information systems presents increasing opportunities for such attacks.  Indeed, reports of security incidents from federal agencies are on the rise,  increasing by more than 650 percent from fiscal year 2006 to fiscal year  2010.

Organizations accomplish this by designing and  implementing controls that are intended to prevent, limit, and detect  unauthorized access to computer resources (e.g., data, programs,  equipment, and facilities), thereby protecting them from unauthorized  disclosure, modification, and loss. Specific access controls include  system boundary protections, identification and authentication of users,  authorization restrictions, cryptography, protection of sensitive system  resources, and audit and monitoring procedures. Without adequate  access controls, unauthorized individuals, including intruders and former  employees, can surreptitiously read and copy sensitive data and make  undetected changes or deletions for malicious purposes or for personal  gain. In addition, authorized users could intentionally or unintentionally  modify or delete data or execute changes that are outside of their  authority.", "Boundary protection controls logical connectivity into and out of networks  and controls connectivity to and from network-connected devices. Any  connections to the Internet or to other external and internal networks or  information systems should occur through controlled interfaces (for  example, proxies, gateways, routers and switches, firewalls, and  concentrators). Many networked systems allow remote access to the  information systems from virtually any remote location; thus, it is  imperative that remote access paths be appropriately controlled and  protected using a method such as a virtual private network (VPN). In  addition, networks should also be appropriately configured to adequately  protect access paths between systems; this can be accomplished through  the use of access control lists and firewalls. National Institute of  Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance states that agencies should  establish trusted communication paths between users and the agency\u2019s  information systems, that firewalls should be configured to provide  adequate protection for the organization\u2019s networks, and that the  information transmitted between interconnected systems should be  controlled and regulated.", "FDIC had not always controlled the logical and physical boundaries  protecting its information and systems.

A key component of granting or denying  access rights is the concept of \u201cleast privilege,\u201d which refers to granting a  user only the access rights and permissions needed to perform official  duties. To restrict a legitimate user\u2019s access to only those programs and  files needed, organizations establish user access rights: allowable actions  that can be assigned to a user or to groups of users. File and directory  permissions are rules that are associated with a particular file or directory,  regulating which users can access it\u2014and the extent of their access  rights.

To  be effective, organizations should (1) configure the software to collect and  maintain a sufficient audit trail for security-relevant events; (2) generate  reports that selectively identify unauthorized, unusual, and sensitive  access activity; and (3) regularly monitor and take action on these  reports.

Often, segregation of incompatible duties is achieved by dividing  responsibilities among two or more organizational groups, which  diminishes the likelihood that errors and wrongful acts will go undetected  because the activities of one individual or group will serve as a check on  the activities of the other. Inadequate segregation of duties increases the  risk that erroneous or fraudulent transactions could be processed,  improper program changes implemented, and computer resources  damaged or destroyed.

NIST also recommends that agencies configure their systems to reflect  the most restrictive mode possible consistent with operational  requirements and employ malicious code protection mechanisms to  detect and eradicate malicious code transported by electronic mail,  electronic mail attachments, or other common means.", "FDIC had not applied appropriate configuration management controls to  many of the special purpose programs and data in the loss-share  estimating process. Although FDIC had documented activities for  development, testing, and production for three of the programs used to  calculate the estimates of losses due to loss-sharing agreements and had  assigned responsibility for the different activities, it had neither  documented approved changes to the programs prior to implementation  nor retained records of the changes made. While the corporation had  documented plans for tracking changes to these three programs, the  plans had not been implemented. Additionally, the corporation had not  documented plans for controlling changes to a program that generated a  key dataset or to two other programs used to validate the data contained  in a key database used in the loss-share loss estimation process.  Furthermore, FDIC had not applied version control or change control to  the database for the loss-share cost estimates. Moreover, a workstation  used to execute one of the key calculation programs had configuration  weaknesses that could allow it to be compromised.

Specifically:  \uf0b7  FDIC had developed and documented an IT security risk  management policy that required all sensitive applications to  periodically be assessed for the risk and magnitude of harm that could  result from vulnerabilities and potential threats.  \uf0b7  FDIC had not fully implemented its policies requiring that users be  provided with only the minimum level of access required to allow them  to perform their duties and that its computer security information  response team monitor the progress of security patching activities by  reviewing reports on the status of implementation. In addition, it had  not fully implemented its policies for frequency of password changes  and for storage of passwords.  \uf0b7  FDIC had developed and documented security plans for all of the  major systems we reviewed that addressed policies and procedures  for providing management, operational, and technical controls, and  had documented requirements for physically securing FDIC facilities.  \uf0b7  FDIC had conducted annual periodic testing and evaluation of the  effectiveness of the management, operational, and technical controls  for the major systems we reviewed.  \uf0b7  Although FDIC had established a process for planning, implementing,  evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to address information  security weaknesses, and had completed actions to remediate 26 of  the 33 control weaknesses we identified in our calendar year 2009  audit, the corporation had not yet completed actions to correct or  mitigate 7 of the previously reported weaknesses. For example, FDIC  had not separated or partitioned the data network from the voice  network, developed and documented policies and procedures for  assigning access to systems and databases where application  controls could be compromised, or fully implemented its monitoring  program.", "In addition, FDIC had not received an independent audit report from the  provider of its Web service in a timely manner. FISMA information  security requirements apply not only to an agency\u2019s own systems but also  to information systems used or operated on its behalf by a contractor or  other agency, such as an external service provider. According to OMB,  service providers are required to provide client organizations with an audit  report that describes whether internal controls were designed to achieve  specified objectives, have been placed into operation, and are operating  effectively. Previously known as Statement on Auditing Standards (SAS)  70 reports, since June 15, 2011, they have been known as Statement on  Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) 16 reports. OMB also  states that such reports should be provided within a reasonable time  frame so that auditors of client organizations may use them during their  financial statement audits. However, the provider of the Web service used  to exchange information with valuation contractors did not provide FDIC  with a SAS 70 report until March 2011, more than 8 weeks after the end  of the financial reporting period and more than 5 months after the end of  the period that the SAS 70 audit covered.", "Until all key elements of its information security program are fully  implemented, FDIC may not have assurance that controls over its  financial systems and information are appropriately designed and  operating effectively.", "FDIC had not applied key controls in its information security program to  the loss-share loss estimation process. OMB Circular A-130, Appendix  III, requires federal agencies to implement and maintain an automated  information security program, including planning for adequate security of  each system, assessing risks, and reviewing security controls. OMB  Circular A-127 requires that federal financial management systems,  which include core financial systems as well as any automated and  manual processes, procedures, data, hardware, and software that  support financial management, be subject to the requirements of Circular  A-130. However, FDIC had not applied key controls in its information  security program to the automated and semiautomated processes used to  support the preparation of the estimates of losses and costs due to loss- sharing agreements. Specifically, FDIC had not  \uf0b7  assessed the risks associated with the information and programs  involved to identify potential threats and vulnerabilities as well as  possible countermeasures and mitigating controls, and had not  included the programs in the risk assessment of any of its general  support systems;  \uf0b7  documented the management, technical, or operational security  controls intended to protect the programs in system security plans,  and had not included the programs in the system security plans of any  general support system; or  tested any security controls for the programs, and had not included  the programs when testing the security controls of other general  support systems.", "FDIC had not applied these controls because the Division of Resolutions  and Receiverships developed the process independently, in order to be  able to manage the large increase in bank failures and the extensive use  of loss-sharing agreements resulting from the current financial crisis. In  doing so, the Division of Resolutions and Receiverships had not used  FDIC\u2019s existing IT management framework\u2014which requires these  controls to be put into place\u2014to develop and manage the process.", "During 2010, FDIC had mitigated the effect of these weaknesses on  financial reporting by implementing compensating management and  reconciliation controls in this process. However, because of ongoing  financial institution failures and the lack of information security  management controls around the process, the financial information  processed by the programs involved\u2014representing a nearly $39 billion  impact on the corporation\u2019s financial statements\u2014continues to be at risk  of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or destruction."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["FDIC has made significant progress in correcting or mitigating previously  reported information security weaknesses, but other control weaknesses  continue to unnecessarily put FDIC\u2019s systems at an increased risk from  internal and external threats. A key reason for these weaknesses is that  the corporation had not fully implemented key elements of its information  security program, such as effectively implementing security policies,  conducting risk assessments, documenting security management plans,  documenting contingency plans, testing security controls, or implementing  an effective continuous monitoring program. FDIC had made  improvements in its information security controls and had mitigated the  potential effect of its remaining weaknesses on financial reporting by  implementing compensating management and reconciliation controls  during 2010, enabling us to conclude that FDIC had resolved the  significant deficiency over information systems that we had reported in  our 2009 audit. However, the weaknesses\u2014both old and new\u2014continue  to challenge the corporation in its efforts to ensure the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of financial and sensitive information.", "Until FDIC further mitigates known information security weaknesses in  access controls and other information system controls and fully  implements its information security program, the corporation will continue  to face an increased risk that sensitive financial information and  resources will not be sufficiently protected from inadvertent or deliberate  misuse, improper disclosure, or destruction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Acting Chairman take the following two actions  to enhance FDIC\u2019s information security program:  \uf0b7  Direct the Director of the Division of Resolutions and Receiverships  and the Chief Information Officer to develop, document, and  implement appropriate information security activities in the loss-share  loss estimation process, such as assessing and mitigating risks,  managing and controlling the configurations of programs and  databases, evaluating the effectiveness of security controls, and  ensuring that data and programs can be recovered after a disruption.  \uf0b7  Direct the Chief Information Officer to work with the external Web  service provider to obtain a more timely delivery of the provider\u2019s  SSAE 16 report (previously known as a SAS 70 report), or to obtain  other means of assurance of internal controls.", "We are also making 38 new recommendations to address 37 new  findings in a separate report with limited distribution.
