Collectively, these programs are expected to cost about $400 billion--with about three-fourths still to be invested. The JSF program, which is expected to make up the largest percentage of the new fleet, has more than 90 percent of its investments still in the future. Increased costs and extended development times have reduced DOD's buying power, and DOD now expects to replace legacy aircraft with about one-third fewer new aircraft compared to original plans at each program's inception. The outcomes of these acquisition programs directly impact existing tactical aircraft systems. Until new systems are acquired in sufficient quantities to replace legacy fleets, legacy systems must be sustained and kept operationally relevant. Continual schedule slips and reduced buys of new aircraft--particularly in the F-22A and JSF programs--make it difficult for program managers to allocate funds for modifying legacy aircraft to meet new requirements or to set retirement dates for legacy aircraft. Lengthening the life of legacy systems also impacts DOD's new tactical aircraft acquisition programs. DOD has become increasingly concerned that the high cost of keeping aging weapon systems relevant and able to meet required readiness levels is a growing challenge in the face of forecast threats and reduces the department's flexibility to invest in new weapons. DOD's tactical aircraft investments are driven by the services' separate acquisition planning. Moving forward, these plans are likely unexecutable given competing demands from future defense and non defense budgets. The EA-6B--providing tactical radar jamming capabilities for all services and one of the few examples of a joint asset--is also expected to be replaced by separate and unique aircraft for each of the services. Without a joint, DOD-wide strategy for tactical aircraft investments, it is difficult to identify potential areas where efficiencies might be achieved or where capability gaps might occur in DOD's tactical aircraft acquisitions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the past three decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has spent  Over the past three decades, the Department of Defense (DOD) has spent  $534 billion to develop, procure, and modify its tactical air forces.

This  includes establishing a solid business case that accurately and realistically  matches available resources (technologies, money, expertise, and time) to  warfighter needs. The Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment  report in January 2006 also found that a disciplined business approach was  needed to improve DOD\u2019s weapon system acquisition process.

We have  usually found poorer outcomes\u2014significant cost increases, reduced  procurement quantities, and schedule delays\u2014in programs not following  these practices. For example, immature technologies, design problems,  and changes in threats and requirements underpinning the original  business case, contributed to major cost increases for the F-22A program,  a doubling of its years spent in development, and a sharp reduction in  quantities deemed affordable. We are concerned that the JSF is on a  similar risky path with highly concurrent plans to begin production while  still early in development and with little testing completed. On the other  hand, the F/A-18E/F program is employing a more evolutionary approach  and is experiencing better cost and schedule outcomes.

There is a 198 aircraft difference between the Air Force\u2019s  stated need for 381 aircraft and the 183 aircraft the Office of Secretary  of Defense (OSD) says is affordable.

With unpredictable quantities and delivery  schedules of the new systems, program managers for legacy aircraft are  challenged to balance reduced funds for modifications with requirements  to keep legacy systems operational and relevant longer than they had  planned. Stable retirement plans are critical to effective management and  efficient resource use, but in this environment retirement plans keep  changing. Program managers are hard-pressed to allocate funds or set  sunset schedules for legacy fleets until the outcomes of new acquisitions  are known. Furthermore, the longer the services retain legacy systems in  their inventories, the more money they will need for operation and  maintenance costs in order to keep legacy aircraft operational and  relevant. DOD has become increasingly concerned that the high cost of  keeping aging weapon systems relevant and able to meet required  readiness levels is a growing challenge in the face of forecast threat  capabilities and is depleting modernization accounts, reducing the  department\u2019s flexibility to invest in new weapons.", "Operating costs per flying hour for Air Force legacy systems are shown in  figure 3. It illustrates that operation and maintenance costs typically  increase as weapons systems age. It also shows the relatively high  operating costs for the F-117A, a factor in the decision to retire that fleet  early.

Historically, however, costs increase;  quantities are reduced; and delivery schedules are delayed. The JSF  program represents 90 percent of the investments to go for new tactical  aircraft and projected plans are likely unaffordable given projected future  budget constraints and competing demands.", "First, plans for new systems are based on conservative estimates of future  cost growth to complete the programs but optimistic estimates on the  availability of future funding, production rates, and quantities of new  aircraft delivered to the warfighter on time. While it is understandable to  project that programs will execute to cost and quantity targets as planned,  the prevailing and historical evidence suggests otherwise. In 1997 we  reported that the historical average cost growth of major acquisition  systems was at least 20 percent. Our annual assessment of weapon  systems continue to show today that many programs cost more, take  longer to develop, and deliver fewer assets than planned. While the   F/A-18E/F program has generally executed to schedule, the F-22A did   not, and we believe the recent cost escalation and potential delays in  production indicate that the JSF is on a similar path. Air Force and Marine  Corps officials told us that the planned maximum procurement rates for  the JSF will be very difficult to sustain and there are already pressures to  reduce or delay procurement before it even begins. The fiscal year 2008  budget has reduced near-term quantities and current planning projections  suggest that the Air Force will significantly reduce annual procurement  quantities midterm in the program and defer these aircraft to later years,  extending the procurement period by 7 years.", "Second, the tactical aircraft plans do not consider billions in potential  added costs for legacy systems. As discussed earlier in this report,  substantial service life extension programs and additional modernization  enhancements are under serious consideration for many of the legacy  fleets. Some of these costs are not reflected in current programmed  budgets or have yet to be estimated. For example, the Navy is considering  options to extend the life of its F/A-18 fleets, but has not yet developed  comprehensive cost estimates. An initial estimate is for $2 billion, but an  official told us the cost will likely be much larger. The Air Force is now  planning to keep the A-10 in inventory for a longer period of time, but the  full costs to extend the life are not known, and some other potential costs,  including $2.1 billion to improve the engines, are not funded. One estimate  for extending the A-10\u2019s life in total was $4.4 billion. We also learned that  $283 million to retire the F-117A during fiscal years 2007 and 2008 has not  yet been funded, and given officials\u2019 comments about unstable divestiture  schedules and changing retirement dates, it may be the case that other  programs have also not factored in retirement costs to close contractor  facilities and government programs. Furthermore, as legacies remain in  the operational force longer, substantial funding for additional  sustainment costs and annual operating and maintenance costs will be  necessary, particularly if plans to defer JSF procurements are  implemented.", "Third, tactical aircraft plans will face increasing competition for the  defense dollar from other new procurements and from continuing costs  for the Global War on Terror. DOD is planning the start-up of several   big-ticket items including a new strategic tanker aircraft, a next generation  strike aircraft, unmanned aircraft, and other more transformational  programs. Projected costs for ongoing military operations in the Global  War on Terror will continue to put pressure on defense investment  accounts and are also expected to increase the share of the total budget  going to ground forces which could decrease the share for aviation  programs. Flat or lower funding levels and future systems that can  perform the same or similar tactical air missions may substantially alter  the ultimate mix, timing, and rate at which combat aircraft are acquired.", "Fourth, any questions on affordability must be viewed in a larger context  relative to federal spending, demographic trends, and impacts on  discretionary funding. The Comptroller General testified last year on the  nation\u2019s unsustainable fiscal path and its large and growing structural  deficit due primarily to known demographic trends, rising health care  costs, and lower federal revenues as a percentage of the economy. Federal  discretionary programs, including defense spending, will face serious  budget pressures. Even so, defense programs are commanding larger  budgets. Over the past 5 years, the department has doubled its planned  investments in new weapon systems from about $700 billion in 2001 to  nearly $1.4 trillion in 2006.", "The Congressional Budget Office evaluated the long-term implications of  defense plans and determined that current investment plans would require  sustained funding levels at higher real (inflation-adjusted) amounts than  since mid-1980s, due to sustained purchase of new equipment, increased  costs for new capabilities, increased operations and maintenance costs for  aging legacy systems, and costlier new systems. At the same time, the  Congressional Budget Office notes that increased medical and operating  support costs competing for the defense dollar and national demographic  trends will continue to put pressure on federal discretionary spending.", "Figure 6 illustrates the affordability challenge. It contrasts DOD\u2019s  optimistic future-funding plans with a more conservative estimate. DOD\u2019s  plan (top-line in figure 6) assumes funding levels well above historical  amounts. The spike in funding required starting in 2008, clearly shows the  typical bow wave effect in which weapon system budget requirements  tend to move to the right (delayed to future years) as programs fail to  receive full funding or do not execute as planned. DOD\u2019s projections show  an optimistic bent that tactical aircraft procurement will be able to  significantly increase its share of defense funding, exceeding historical  levels when many project flat or falling funding levels. The lower line  (shaded portion of fig. 6) assumes funding at the same level as fiscal year  2006 carried forward with annual inflationary increases. This more  conservative projection is in line with historical experience. Our analysis  of future-year defense plans indicates that the military services in total and  the tactical aircraft procurement in particular have received similar shares  of the defense dollar over time, a finding that argues against a strategy that  requires a substantial increase in order to succeed.

The intent is to manage groups of like capabilities across the  enterprise to improve interoperability, minimize capability redundancies  and gaps, and maximize capability effectiveness. This would help build  budgets around a set of capabilities instead of traditional military  accounts. The idea is to take a more joint look at what capabilities  combatant commanders and warfighters need, as opposed to the current  more service-centric way in which the services independently buy and  field capabilities they deem important. By shifting the focus from service- specific programs to joint capabilities, DOD should be better positioned to  understand the implications of investment and resource trade-offs among  competing priorities. In September 2006, DOD management selected four  test cases for experimentation with the joint capability portfolio  management concept. Depending on this outcome, tactical aviation would  appear to be an excellent candidate for portfolio management by cross- decking similar capabilities in each service.

Because funding needs and plans for new and legacy aircraft programs are  interdependent, cost, schedule, or performance problems experienced in  acquiring new systems cause perturbations in modernization costs and  retirement schedules throughout the operational fleets. Dependent largely  on the future course of the Joint Strike Fighter, legacy programs are  placed in reactive modes with uncertain and changeable future  requirements, unstable retirement plans, and potential unfunded  requirements in the billions of dollars. While the services strive to reduce  war-fighting risks by fielding new systems and limiting investment in  legacy systems, they are faced with increased prices and schedule risks for  new aircraft while maintaining aging, capability-limited legacy aircraft.
