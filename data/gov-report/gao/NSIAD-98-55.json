Therefore, you have expressed an interest in reducing operating costs.", "We have been assessing various Air Force activities to determine the feasibility of reducing operating costs. A few years ago, we evaluated whether the Air Force could operate its fighter forces more cost-effectively. In May 1996, we reported that the Air Force\u2019s fighter force was not organized economically and recommended that the Air Force develop an implementation plan for operating its fighter force in larger, more cost-effective squadrons. DOD concurred with that recommendation.", "For this follow-on effort, we assessed the cost-effectiveness of organizing the Air Force\u2019s airlift and refueling force into fewer, larger-sized squadrons and wings. In making this assessment, we (1) evaluated the effect that reorganization may have on mission accomplishment, (2) determined whether costs could be reduced through redistributing aircraft among fewer wings, and (3) developed five possible options for redistributing C-130 and KC-135 aircraft among fewer wings at lower operating costs.

The C-130\u2019s primary role is to provide airlift for theater cargo and personnel. The KC-135 aircraft is the Air Force\u2019s core refueler. The majority of these aircraft are in the reserve component, as shown in  table 1.", "Reserve component C-130 flying squadrons generally have 8 aircraft, and KC-135 squadrons generally have 10. Active force C-130 squadrons typically have 14 aircraft, while active KC-135 squadrons have 12. A reserve component wing comprises flying squadrons and other nonflying squadrons. Generally, reserve component wings have one flying squadron, unlike active wings, which generally have two to three flying squadrons. Some of the nonflying squadrons, such as maintenance, military police, and logistics squadrons, are directly related to the flying squadron, while others, such as medical, civil engineering, and communications squadrons, are not directly related.", "Reserve component C-130 and KC-135 aircraft are dispersed throughout the continental United States and Hawaii and Alaska. There are 22 states whose National Guard wings have C-130 aircraft, and 19 states whose National Guard wings have KC-135 aircraft. Seven states have both. There are nine states that have Air Force Reserve wings with C-130 aircraft and five states that have Air Force Reserve wings with KC-135 aircraft. Seven of the Guard wings with KC-135 aircraft are located on military bases and 12 are located with civilian airports. All six Reserve wings with KC-135 aircraft are located on military bases. Most Guard wings with C-130 aircraft, 20 of 23, are located with civilian airports. Half of the 10 Reserve wings with C-130 aircraft are located on military bases, and the other half are with civilian airports. Several locations maintain both Guard and Reserve wings.", "Though reserve component members are sometimes thought of as weekend warriors, about one quarter to one third of wing personnel are full-time military or civilian employees. These personnel are concentrated in areas such as maintenance, logistics, and security squadrons and the wing staff. The balance of wing personnel are part-time military personnel and are likely to have full-time employment in addition to their military responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Missions Can Be Fulfilled With Larger-Sized Reserve Component Units", "paragraphs": ["Larger-sized reserve component units would still be able to perform peacetime missions. When reserve component C-130 and KC-135 units have participated in peacetime deployments in Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, and Panama they have done so on a rotational basis. However, unlike the active Air Force, Reserve and Guard rotations are not assigned completely to a single flying squadron or wing, which makes the squadron size less important. In a typical reserve component rotation, while one wing is designated to lead the mission, it depends on many other wings to provide aircraft and personnel. For example, the reserve component was assigned to support operations in Saudi Arabia for a 3-month period. Personnel and aircraft from 19 Guard wings were typically rotated for 15 to 30 days to staff a flying squadron of 8 aircraft. A similar practice was used in Bosnia and Panama. Rotations are done in this manner because participation by reserve component members without a presidential call-up is voluntary. To obtain the complement of personnel needed, individual volunteers from many units are necessary. Thus, the number or size of units is not as important as the number of people that volunteer. Unit officials from several wings cited advantages in increasing the number of aircraft in a flying squadron. These included increased training opportunities and improved scheduling flexibility.", "Creating fewer larger-sized flying squadrons should have little impact on wartime missions as well. Wartime requirements for C-130 and KC-135 aircraft are not typically defined by the number of squadrons or wings but by the number of aircraft. For example, the July 1996 Joint Chief of Staff\u2019s Intratheater Lift Analysis expresses C-130 requirements in terms of aircraft, not wings or squadrons. The recent C-130 Airlift Master Stationing Plan also expresses requirements in terms of the number of C-130 aircraft. Moreover, the study also states that the current C-130 inventory exceeds requirements, which we believe further lessens the impact of eliminating squadrons.", "The manner in which the Air Force plans to use reserve component units in wartime also minimizes the impact of reducing the number of flying squadrons. According to planning officials from the Air Combat Command and the Air Mobility Command, because active Air Force units are available immediately, they are typically tasked as lead units to provide the command and control in theater for wartime deployments. Reserve component flying squadrons generally follow active Air Force units and are placed under their command structure. These officials stated that planners partly assign existing reserve component flying squadrons in war plans by matching the capacity at likely deployment locations with the squadrons available in the reserve component inventory. They said that as long as the total number of aircraft available to perform missions remained the same, they could change assignments based on larger-sized squadrons. Further, an Air Force official stated that while the Air Force prefers to assign aircraft by squadrons for planning purposes, flying squadrons\u2019 aircraft can be split, provided a command structure is in place. Unit officials stated that during Operation Desert Shield, reserve component aircraft and personnel were used in this manner. Moreover, in current deployment plans we viewed, one KC-135 flying squadron was split between two locations.", "Although squadrons are assigned to wings in peacetime, war plans described to us did not call for these wings to deploy or operate together. For example, civil engineer, medical, and security police squadrons may operate separately from the flying squadron. Wing officials stated that the Air Force has moved away from activating entire reserve component units; instead, war-fighting commanders choose packages of equipment and personnel that will meet their requirements for the mission at hand. At several wings we visited, officials stated that they had not deployed as a wing and were unaware of any plan to deploy as a wing. Further, many wing staff, including the wing commander, are not tasked in war plans and do not have a specific supporting mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reorganizing C-130 and KC-135 Squadrons at Fewer Locations Could Reduce Costs", "paragraphs": ["Redistributing the reserve\u2019s component C-130 and KC-135 existing aircraft into fewer, larger squadrons and wings would reduce operating costs. For example, redistributing 16 C-130 aircraft from two 8-aircraft wings to one 16-aircraft wing would save about $11 million dollars annually, primarily from personnel savings. This reorganization could eliminate about  155 full-time positions and 245 part-time positions. The decrease in full-time positions is especially significant, since the savings associated with these positions represents about $8 million, or 75 percent, of the total savings. Fewer people would be needed in areas such as wing headquarters, logistics, operations, and support group staffs as well as maintenance, support, and military police squadrons. Appendix II describes the organization of a typical wing and how redistributing aircraft would affect the wing.", "In many cases eliminating the aircraft from a wing could also generate savings additional to operating savings. For example, civil engineering and medical squadrons, which help to support the wing and base in peacetime, are not directly related to the aircraft. If the wing is inactivated, these units\u2019 worldwide requirements would have to be reexamined to determine whether they were still needed in the force structure. When the Reserve inactivated a C-130 wing in 1997, all eight of the nonflying squadrons not directly related to the aircraft were eliminated from the force structure, which involved about 140 full-time and about 625 part-time drill positions. Using average Air Force Reserve full- and part-time pay rates, these eliminations represent about $12 million in annual salaries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options for Reorganizing Aircraft and Achieving Savings", "paragraphs": ["We developed five options for redistributing the existing reserve component C-130 and KC-135 aircraft into larger-sized squadrons that show a gradual increase in savings in operating costs\u2014from $51 million to $209 million annually.

The options base like model aircraft together and involve the same number of aircraft as are now planned for the reserve component. In developing our options, we considered the two factors that reserve component officials cited as most important to successful reorganization: adequate recruiting potential and facility capacity.", "We also evaluated how three other issues could affect our options: one-time costs of redistributing the aircraft, the significance of the geographical location of the aircraft, and the effect that eliminating squadrons would have on states\u2019 abilities to respond to domestic crises."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Options Redistributed Aircraft From Existing Squadrons to Create Larger Squadrons", "paragraphs": ["We developed five options that redistributed aircraft from existing C-130 and KC-135 flying squadrons to other squadrons.

This reorganization would be achieved by redistributing aircraft from three C-130 squadrons and one KC-135 squadron to other squadrons. Our fifth option increased the squadron size to 16 aircraft for the C-130 and 12 for the KC-135 by redistributing aircraft from 13 C-130 squadrons and 5 KC-135 squadrons to other squadrons.

Air Reserve headquarters recruiters estimated that they could recruit enough personnel to support 16 C-130 aircraft at 8 of their current 10 locations. Guard headquarters recruiters estimated it could recruit an adequate number of personnel to support 16 aircraft at 9 of 23 C-130 locations. For KC-135 aircraft locations, Air Reserve officials estimated it could recruit enough personnel to support a 12-aircraft squadron at five of its six locations, with two locations capable of adding an entire 10-aircraft squadron. Guard recruiting estimates for the KC-135 indicate that 12-aircraft squadrons could be supported at 15 of 19 locations. Headquarters officials stated that for some options that double the sizes of existing flying squadrons, additional recruiters would be required for at least 6 years at affected locations.", "Reserve component officials at units we visited were more optimistic about their ability to recruit additional personnel than were headquarters officials. The four C-130 wings we visited estimated that they could add four additional aircraft with little or no problem. While headquarters recruiters estimated adding four C-130 aircraft at some locations could take several years to fully staff, unit officials estimated that recruiting additional personnel for the same number of aircraft would usually take no longer than 18 to 24 months. Recruiters also indicated that recruiting additional personnel for more than four aircraft at a given location would be more challenging but possible, if additional experienced recruiters were added to the wing receiving the aircraft and if spaces were available at schools to train new recruits.", "According to reserve component recruiters, the outlook for recruiting could improve if full- and part-time personnel moved with the aircraft. In the recent move of four C-130 aircraft from Chicago, Illinois, to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, about 200 part-time personnel relocated to Milwaukee. Reserve component officials believe it is probable that many personnel from wings clustered closely would move with the aircraft if the aircraft were moved to a nearby location.", "The outlook for recruiting could improve further if personnel from the C-141 fleet, which is being phased out of the inventory, could be used to support C-130 and KC-135 aircraft. The reserve component provides personnel to support most of the C-141 fleet of about 160 aircraft. Only about three-quarters of the C-141 aircraft will be replaced with C-17 aircraft. Some current Reserve units are not scheduled to become C-17 or any other Reserve units. Thus, this trained pool of personnel could be available for C-130 or KC-135 aircraft.

According to these officials, 38 locations could increase the number of assigned aircraft with no military construction costs. In other cases, ramp and hangar space would need to be increased slightly. Also, some locations may require increased administrative and supply space. Only in very few instances would locations require completely new facilities, such as additional hangars. All of the National Guard KC-135 wings could expand to at least 12 aircraft (3 already have more than 12 aircraft) with one-time construction costs of no more than $6 million. For most Guard C-130 wings, the military construction costs would be no more than a $1 million for increasing from 8 to 12 aircraft. Also, 17 of 23 locations could accommodate 16 aircraft at a cost ranging from $1 million to about $10 million.", "Expansion is possible at only three of six Air Force Reserve wings where KC-135 aircraft are located. The Reserve estimates it could add up to 10 additional aircraft at two of the three locations at a one-time cost of $1 million per squadron. The Reserve has two locations with 16 C-130 aircraft.

For instance, tankers meet their customers off the east and west coasts in a high concentration of areas to facilitate the movement of aircraft over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Thus, some refueling aircraft should be located in proximity to these areas. These officials also believe that it is important to maintain reserve component KC-135 aircraft in the northeast because active duty KC-135 aircraft are no longer based in this region. Some officials told us that KC-135 and C-130 aircraft should be based close to the units they train with, whether with other aircraft units\u2014as in the case of KC-135 aircraft\u2014or Army units for the C-130 aircraft."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-Term Savings Would Exceed One-Time Costs of Consolidations", "paragraphs": ["Although we could not determine one-time costs of consolidating C-130 and KC-135 aircraft in larger squadrons, we do not believe these costs to be significant relative to expected savings.

In some cases, personnel could be eligible for severance pay if their position was eliminated. Reserve component officials could not provide estimates of these costs, which would vary depending on how many trained personnel might relocate with the aircraft and how much of the relocation expenses the Air Force would pay. Because we did not identify specific bases in our options, it is difficult to determine these costs. However, during the 1995 base realignment and closure process, initial implementation costs to move C-130 aircraft from three locations were estimated to be offset in 1 year for two of the three locations and 3 years for the third. According to reserve component officials, these implementation costs could be minimized in several ways, for example, by moving aircraft to nearby bases and allowing recruiters sufficient time to phase in additional personnel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eliminating Wings in Some States Should Not Prevent Emergency Assistance", "paragraphs": ["National Guard units are unique in that they are under state control when not federalized. These assets are available to governors during emergencies and disasters. For this reason, inactivating Guard units has historically caused concern. However, not all states have C-130 or KC-135 aircraft in their Guard units. In 16 states, no Guard units are equipped with C-130 or KC-135 aircraft. We recognize that some of our options would likely eliminate National Guard wings in some states, but these states could still receive assistance during disasters and emergencies. States can receive assistance from other states\u2019 National Guard units in several ways, for example, through state compacts, federal laws, DOD regulations, and informal agreements.", "Compacts, which are agreements between states to support one another in times of need, are one way that assistance can be provided. One of the most inclusive compacts is the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, which was originally sponsored and established by the Southern Governors\u2019 Association in 1992. Under this compact, member states agree to provide for mutual assistance in managing any declared emergency or disaster as well as mutual cooperation in exercises and training. Through this compact, members agree on issues such as terms of liability, compensation, and reimbursement when emergency assistance is provided to member states. The compact was endorsed by the National Governors\u2019 Association and other regional and national organizations, and any state can now become a member. Currently, 20 states have joined the compact. While a National Guard official stated that no C-130 or KC-135 aircraft have yet been used under this compact, other assets such as helicopters have been shared. For example, Virginia, Florida, and Kentucky have provided helicopters to other states.", "States can also receive assistance during a natural disaster or emergency through the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, which authorizes the Federal Emergency Management Agency to assign missions to any federal agency if the President declares a federal emergency or disaster. Under the act, the agency can provide federal assets, including National Guard and active duty personnel and equipment, to states that are experiencing the emergency or disaster. For example, C-130 aircraft from a National Guard unit in Maryland assisted Florida, which has no C-130 aircraft in its National Guard, in its efforts to reduce the effects of Hurricane Andrew.", "Another way states can receive assistance is under a recently implemented Defense Department directive referred to as \u201cinnovative readiness training.\u201d Under this directive, Defense assets can be used to assist states and communities if the assistance provides a training opportunity related to units\u2019 wartime missions. In this case, the Guard can authorize units to participate even if a federal disaster is not declared. For example, we were told by Guard officials that Guard units from outside Iowa received training in water purification during floods in Iowa.", "Beyond these provisions, National Guard officials stated that assistance can be coordinated through the National Guard Bureau, even without an agreement among the states. To reduce response time, Guard officials sometimes develop preliminary plans for providing assistance when a major disaster is pending. For example, before Hurricane Iniki struck Hawaii, California National Guard, National Guard Bureau, and Hawaii National Guard officials coordinated relief efforts to allow California Guard units\u2019 C-130 aircraft to be prepared to provide assistance there, even though no formal agreement existed between the two states."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["The reserve components\u2019 C-130 and KC-135 aircraft can be redistributed into larger-sized squadrons and still accomplish their peacetime and wartime missions.
