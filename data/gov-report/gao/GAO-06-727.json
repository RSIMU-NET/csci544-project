Most of the activities that the grant recipients put in place were community development projects, such as projects supporting education and housing. Other activities included economic opportunity initiatives such as job training and loan programs. Although all EZs and ECs also reported using the program grants to leverage funds from other sources, reliable data on the extent of leveraging were not available. According to federal standards, agencies should oversee the use of public resources and ensure that ongoing monitoring occurs. However, none of the federal agencies that were responsible for program oversight--including HHS and the departments of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Agriculture (USDA)--collected data on the amount of program grant funds used to implement specific program activities. This lack of data limited both federal oversight and GAO's ability to assess the effect of the program. Moreover, because HHS did not provide the states and designated communities with clear guidance on how to monitor the program grant funds, the extent of monitoring varied across the sites. In addition, detailed Internal Revenue Service (IRS) data on the use of EZ/EC program tax benefits were not available. Previously, GAO cited similar challenges in assessing the use of tax benefits in other federal programs and stated that information on tax expenditures should be collected to ensure that these expenditures are achieving their intended purpose. Although GAO recommended in 2004 that HUD, USDA, and IRS work together to identify the data needed to assess the EZ/EC tax benefits and the cost effectiveness of collecting the information, the three agencies did not reach agreement on an approach. Without adequate data on the use of program grant funds or tax benefits, neither the responsible federal agencies nor GAO could determine whether the EZ/EC funds had been spent effectively or that the tax benefits had in fact been used as intended. Using the data that were available, GAO attempted to analyze changes in several indicators--poverty and unemployment rates and two measures of economic growth. Although improvements in poverty, unemployment, and economic growth had occurred in the EZs and ECs, our econometric analysis of the eight urban EZs could not tie these changes definitively to the EZ designation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community (EZ/EC) program is  one of the most recent in a series of large-scale federal efforts intended to  address one of the nation\u2019s most persistent challenges\u2014the revitalization  of impoverished urban and rural communities. When it was enacted in  1993, the EZ/EC program provided grants to public and private entities for  social services and community redevelopment and tax benefits to local  businesses to attract or retain jobs and businesses in distressed  communities. The program differs from earlier initiatives with similar goals  in that it emphasizes the role of local communities in identifying solutions  and the use of public-private partnerships to attract the investment  necessary for sustainable economic and community development. To date,  Congress has authorized three rounds of EZs and two rounds of ECs.  Communities designated under Round I of the program shared a total of $1  billion in federal grant funding and also received tax and other benefits.  The EZs received the bulk of this funding\u2014$720 million in total\u2014as well as  more extensive tax benefits than the ECs. Communities designated in the  two subsequent rounds of the program received a smaller amount of  federal funding and more tax benefits.

This report, the second of the  mandated series, focuses on the first round of communities designated as  EZs and ECs in 1994. It (1) describes how the designated communities  implemented Round I of the EZ/EC program; (2) evaluates the extent of  federal, state, and local oversight of the program; (3) examines the extent  to which data are available to assess the use of program tax benefits; and  (4) analyzes the effects that the Round I EZs and ECs had on poverty,  unemployment, and economic growth in their communities.", "To address our first three objectives, we made site visits to all 11 Round I  EZs and 2 of the 95 ECs\u20141 urban and 1 rural\u2014to interview stakeholders  and review documentation. To gather information from the ECs, we  administered an e-mail survey to officials from the 60 Round I ECs that  were still in operation as of June 2005 and did not receive a subsequent  designation. We chose to exclude the 34 ECs that received subsequent  designations, because we did not want their responses to be influenced by  those programs. Because the states distributed the federal funding to the  communities, we conducted telephone interviews with state officials in the  13 states containing the EZs and ECs that we visited. In addition, we  interviewed officials from the federal agencies with primary responsibility  for the program\u2014the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS),  the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). We  also analyzed fiscal and program data from the agencies and assessed the  reliability of these data. To address our fourth objective, that is, the effect  of the program on poverty, unemployment, and economic growth, we used  several methods. First, we calculated the changes in the poverty and  unemployment rates from 1990 to 2000 and measures of economic growth  from 1995 to 2004 in the designated EZs and ECs and in comparison areas selected for their similarities to the designated communities.

The main objective of  the Enterprise Zone program was to foster an attractive business  environment in specific areas where economic growth was lacking. In the  United States, some states began to administer similar state Enterprise  Zones in the 1980s. In 1993, the federal government established the federal  EZ/EC program to help reduce unemployment and revitalize economically  distressed areas. The authorizing legislation established the eligibility  requirements and the package of grants and tax benefits for the EZ/EC  program (table 1). Multiagency teams from HHS, HUD, USDA, and other  federal agencies reviewed the applications in Round I, and HUD and USDA  issued designations based on the effectiveness of communities\u2019 strategic  plans, assurances that the plans would be implemented, and geographic  diversity. In Round I, HUD designated a total of 8 urban EZs and 65 urban  ECs, and USDA designated 3 rural EZs and 30 rural ECs.", "HHS provided Round I EZs and ECs with a total of $1 billion in EZ/EC grant  funds. EZs and ECs were allowed to use the EZ/EC grants for a broader  range of activities than was generally allowed with those types of HHS  funds. For instance, EZs and ECs could use funding for \u201ctraditional\u201d  activities, such as skills training programs for disadvantaged youth or drug  and alcohol treatment programs, as well as for additional activities, such as  the purchase of land or facilities related to an eligible program or the  capitalization of a revolving loan fund. EZs and ECs were also permitted to  use grant funds to cover some administrative costs and to change their  goals and activities over time, with approval from HUD or USDA. In  addition, HUD and USDA expected EZs and ECs to use the EZ/EC grant to  leverage additional investment.", "Businesses operating in EZs and ECs were eligible for a substantial amount  of program tax benefits. In 1993, the Joint Committee on Taxation  estimated that the tax benefits available to businesses in Round I  communities would result in a $2.5 billion reduction in tax revenues  between 1994 and 1998. In 2000, the committee estimated that the  combination of EZ/EC program tax benefits and the Renewal Community  tax benefits would reduce tax revenues by a total of $10.9 billion between  2001 and 2010. The tax benefits for ECs expired in 2004, and the tax  benefits for all EZs and Renewal Communities are currently set to expire at  the end of 2009.", "Four federal agencies are responsible for administering the program in  Round I. Oversight responsibilities for Round I were divided among three  agencies, with HHS providing fiscal oversight and HUD and USDA  providing program oversight (fig. 1). HHS issued grants to the states, which  served as pass-through entities\u2014that is, they distributed funds to  individual EZs and ECs. According to their regulations, HUD and USDA are  required to evaluate the progress each EZ and EC made on its strategic plan  based on information gathered on site visits and on information reported to  them by the designated communities. In addition, IRS is responsible for  administering the program tax benefits.", "In assessing the extent of EZ/EC program improvements, it is useful to  understand the overall national trends in poverty, unemployment, and  economic growth.

The city of Atlanta elected to administer its  remaining EZ grants in conjunction with its Renewal Community initiative,  and prepared a strategic plan to address administration of both the  remaining HHS funds and the HUD-designated Renewal Community. The  Atlanta Renewal Community officials told us that they did not use the EZ  funds for about 4 years after receiving the designation because of the time  required for start-up but added that they planned to begin utilizing the  funds soon. The New York EZ received matching funds from both the state  and city governments, for a total of $300 million.

Overall,  both EZs and ECs used the program grants to implement a larger number of  community development activities\u2014such as education, health care, and  infrastructure\u2014than economic opportunity activities\u2014such as workforce  development and providing assistance to businesses (fig. 3).", "The activities most often implemented by urban EZs and ECs were  workforce development, human services, education, and assistance to  businesses, which accounted for more than 50 percent of the activities in  urban EZs and 60 percent of the activities in urban ECs (fig. 4). For  example, the Baltimore EZ implemented a customized training program  that provided EZ residents with individualized training and a stipend during  the training period. In the Bronx portion of the New York EZ, stakeholders  explained that they had funded an organization that trained women to  become child care providers, a program that not only provided job skills  and employment opportunities but also improved the availability of child  care in the area.

In the beginning, the  agencies made some efforts to share information, but these efforts were  not maintained. For example, HUD officials said that they had received  fiscal data from HHS and reconciled that information with their program  data on the activities implemented in the early years of the program.  According to HUD, the agency made additional attempts to obtain data  from HHS but only recently received a report. An HHS official said the  agency no longer regularly shared detailed data with HUD and USDA,  which the official said was likely due to a lack of program staff.", "These limitations do not necessarily apply to Rounds II and III of the EZ/EC  program. For example, both fiscal and program oversight of the urban and  rural EZs and ECs were provided directly through HUD and USDA in  Round II because the program funding came directly through HUD and  USDA appropriations. Officials from both agencies explained that  information on the activity for which funds were used was linked to each  drawdown of program funds. In addition, a HUD official said they had  issued improved monitoring guidance in Round II, since designees receive  funds directly from HUD. However, a USDA official said that they provided  similar monitoring guidance to designees in Rounds I, II, and III. Because  this report focuses on Round I of the program, we did not determine the  effectiveness of the oversight of future rounds of the program."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Lack of Detailed Tax Data Made It Difficult to Assess the Use of Program Tax Benefits", "paragraphs": ["A lack of detailed tax data limited our ability to assess the extent to which  businesses in the EZs and ECs used program tax benefits.

For example, the IRS collects some information on EZ businesses\u2019  use of tax credits for employing EZ residents. However, the data cannot be  separated to show how much was claimed in individual EZs. In addition,  IRS does not have data on the use of the increased expensing deduction for  depreciable property, because taxpayers do not report this benefit as a  separate line item on their returns. The lack of data on the use of program  tax benefits is consistent with findings of other reports we prepared citing  data challenges in other similar community and economic development  programs, such as the Liberty Zone program.", "Our 2004 report recommended that HUD, IRS, and USDA collaborate to  identify a cost-effective means of collecting the data needed to assess the  use of the tax benefits. In response, HUD, IRS, and USDA identified two  methods for collecting the information\u2014through a national survey or by  modifying the tax forms. However, the three agencies did not reach  agreement on a cost-effective method for collecting additional data. Given  the lack of information at the federal level, we, some EZs, and other  researchers have tried to assess the use of EZ/EC tax benefits by surveying  businesses. However, these surveys have had low response rates and a  high number of undeliverable surveys, suggesting that the results might not  be representative. Reasons associated with the low response rates were  cited in previous reports, including the difficulty of locating someone at the  businesses who knew whether the tax benefit had been claimed and issues  associated with multiple business locations. In addition, some EZ officials  said that businesses were not willing to share their tax information.  Further, a high rate of small business closures was determined to be a  contributing factor to the high number of undeliverable surveys. We  initiated a survey of businesses as a part of the audit work for this  engagement, but discontinued the survey due to a low response rate.", "In the absence of other data, we relied on testimonial information to assess  how often the EZ tax benefits were used and who used them. Although  stakeholders from all EZs told us that they did not have any data on the  extent to which EZ businesses had used program tax benefits, they  provided us with some information that was consistent with the findings of  past studies. For example, during our site visits, EZ stakeholders told us  that they believed large businesses, which tend to use tax professionals  who know and understand the benefits, were more likely to use the tax  benefits than small businesses. They also noted that small businesses were  less likely to make enough in profits to take advantage of the tax benefits.  The stakeholders stated further that the credit for employing EZ residents  was the most frequently used of the three original tax benefits. A few EZ  officials commented that retail businesses were more likely to use the  employment credit and manufacturing businesses were more likely to use  the increased expensing deduction.", "Stakeholders from only 4 of the 11 EZs and 2 of the 58 ECs that responded  to our EC survey told us that the tax-exempt bond benefit had been used in  their communities. EZ stakeholders and EC survey respondents cited a  variety of reasons that the tax-exempt bond financing had not been more  widely used. For instance, some said that the bonds were not used because  of the availability of the Industrial Development Revenue Bond, which EZ  stakeholders explained had fewer restrictions and could be issued for  larger amounts. In addition, some EZ stakeholders and one EC survey  respondent said that it was difficult to find a large pool of qualified EZ  residents to satisfy the employment requirement for the bond, which  required that at least 35 percent of the workforce be EZ residents. Some EZ  stakeholders also told us that the legal fees for an EZ bond were higher  than for other types of bonds because the restrictions made the EZ bond  more complex. For this reason, stakeholders explained, the cost of issuing  the EZ bond was high relative to the bond cap, particularly early in the program.

Conversely, if officials tended to choose  census tracts that were experiencing economic declines prior to 1994,  such as areas affected by the loss of major employers, we may be  understating the program\u2019s impact.", "Several program-specific factors also limited our ability to assess the  effects of the program. First, the program was designed to be tailored to the  local sites, and each community was given broad latitude to determine its  own needs and the program activities it thought would address those  needs. Thus, each designee may or may not have selected program  activities that directly related to the three factors\u2014poverty,  unemployment, and economic growth\u2014mandated for our evaluation.  Second, the time frame of actual program implementation may have varied  among the designees. For instance, some EZ stakeholders mentioned that  their programs took 2 or 3 years to get started, while others were able to  begin drawing down funds in the first year. Third, the nature of the EZ/EC  program, which focuses on changes in geographic areas rather than on  individuals, makes it difficult to determine how the program affected  residents who lived in an EZ/EC in 1994 but later moved. Stakeholders from  most of the EZs and ECs we visited said that residents were moving out of  the designated areas, often after finding a job.

If Congress  authorizes similar programs that rely heavily on tax benefits in the future, it  would be prudent for federal agencies responsible for administering the  program to collect information necessary for determining whether the tax  benefits are effective in achieving program goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to HHS, HUD,  IRS, and USDA. We received comments from HHS, HUD, and USDA. In  general, the agencies provided comments related to the oversight of the  program, the availability of data, and the methodology used to carry out the  work. Their written comments appear in appendixes V through VII,  respectively, and our responses to HUD\u2019s more detailed comments also  appear in appendix VI. HHS, HUD, and USDA also provided technical  comments, which we have incorporated into the report where appropriate.", "HHS commented that a statement made in our report\u2014that the agency did  not provide guidance detailing the steps state and local authorities should  take to monitor the program\u2014unfairly represented the relationship  between HHS and the other federal agencies that administered the EZ/EC  program. Specifically, HHS emphasized its responsibility for fiscal as  opposed to programmatic oversight of the program. We note in our report  that program design may have led to a lack of clarity in oversight, as no  single federal agency had sole oversight responsibility. While this lack of  clarity in oversight may be related in part to the design of the program,  which offered increased flexibility in the use of funds and relied on  multiple agencies for oversight, limited data and variation in monitoring  hindered federal oversight efforts. Moreover, we believe that, in  accordance with federal standards, each of the federal agencies that  administered the program bore at least some responsibility for ensuring  that public resources were being used effectively and that program goals  were being met.", "HUD disagreed with GAO\u2019s observation that there was a lack of data on the  use of program grant funds, the amount of funds leveraged, and the use of  the tax benefits. HUD indicated that we could obtain data on the use of  program funds and the amount of funds leveraged from its performance  reporting system. As we discussed in our report, we used information from  HUD\u2019s reporting system to report on the types of activities that designated  communities implemented. We also noted that HUD maintained some  information on the amount of EZ/EC grants budgeted for specific activities.  Although we found evidence that activities were carried out with program  funds, information contained in the performance reporting system on the  amounts of funds used and the amount leveraged was not reliable. For  example, we found evidence that communities had undertaken certain  activities with program funding, but we were often unable to find  documentation of the actual amounts allocated or expended. HUD also  indicated that it did not agree that data on the use of the tax benefits were  lacking. However, HUD indicated that the agency itself had attempted to  gather such data by collaborating with IRS in identifying ways to collect  data on tax benefits, by developing a methodology to administer a survey to  businesses, and by compiling anecdotal evidence of the use of program tax  benefits. We continue to believe that the lack of data on program tax  benefits limits the ability of the agencies to administer and evaluate the  EZ/EC program. Further, the lack of such data is likely to become  increasingly problematic in light of the fact that future rounds of the EZ/EC  program and the Renewal Community program rely heavily on tax benefits  to achieve revitalization goals.", "HUD concurred that limitations in the oversight of the EZ/EC program may  have resulted from the design of the program as no single federal agency  had sole responsibility for oversight. HUD also recommended that we  make clear that more oversight was not allowed in Round I and we include  a statement that it met agency requirements to undertake periodic  performance reviews and described some of its efforts to monitor the  program according to applicable regulations. We do not believe that more  oversight was not allowed. For example, early in the program HUD and  HHS made some efforts to share information. Specifically, HUD officials  said that they had received fiscal data from HHS and reconciled that  information with their program data on the activities implemented, but  these efforts to share information were not maintained. Further, as we  previously stated, while we recognize that program design may have led to  a lack of clarity in oversight, we believe that in accordance with federal  standards, each of the federal agencies that administered the program bore  at least some responsibility for ensuring that public resources were being  used effectively and that program goals were being met. HUD also  described changes it had made to ensure better oversight of program funds  for Round II. We acknowledge HUD\u2019s efforts to improve oversight of the  program and, as discussed in our report, the oversight limitations that we  identified in Round I of the program may not apply to later rounds.", "HUD provided several comments related to the methodology we used to  carry out our work. For example, HUD suggested that we measure the  successes of the Round I program in meeting the four key principles of the  program, which the designated communities were required to include in  their strategic plans. Additionally, HUD commented that the indices we  used to assess the effects of the EZ/EC program\u2014poverty, unemployment  and economic growth\u2014were used in the application process for the  program but were not intended to be used as performance measures. While  we appreciate HUD\u2019s suggestions on our methodology, our congressional  mandate was to determine the effect of the EZ/EC program on poverty,  unemployment and economic growth. In designing our methodology, we  conducted extensive research on evaluations that had been conducted on  the EZ/EC program, including HUD\u2019s 2001 Interim Assessment, and spoke  with several experts in the urban studies field.", "USDA stated that data and analyses on the effectiveness of programs such  as EZ/EC were useful and offered areas to consider for future evaluations  of economic development programs involving rural areas. For example,  USDA mentioned issues involved in collecting data on rural areas, such as  the limited availability of economic and demographic data for small rural  populations, and discussed USDA\u2019s efforts for developing a methodology  that focuses on economic impacts using county-level economic data. USDA  also said it is especially important in rural areas to have a clear and  adequately funded data collection process for program evaluations. In  addition, USDA noted that evaluations of the EZ/EC program could go  beyond the indicators of poverty, unemployment and economic growth to  include measures on economic development capacity and collaboration.  We agree that collecting data for rural areas is a challenge and appreciate  USDA\u2019s effort to develop a methodology that focuses on economic impacts  using county-level economic data and captures the short-term Gross  Domestic Product changes in the impacted rural counties. Further, we  appreciate USDA\u2019s suggestion that additional measures be considered in  future evaluations of economic development programs and that a broader  perspective on program results might be useful.", "USDA also commented that its performance reporting system was intended  to be used as a management tool for both USDA and the individual EZs and  ECs. According to USDA, the system was not designed to be an accounting  tool but has been useful for providing a picture of each designated  community\u2019s achievements. As we discussed in our report, we used  information from USDA\u2019s reporting system to report on the types of  activities that designated communities implemented and also noted that  USDA maintained some information on the amounts of EZ/EC grants  budgeted for specific activities. Moreover, while we recognize the system  was not intended to be used as an accounting tool, we found that the data  on the amounts of the EZ/EC grant funding were not reliable. For example,  in our assessment of the reliability of data contained in USDA\u2019s  performance reporting system, we were often unable to find  documentation of the actual amounts allocated or expended for specific  activities.", "USDA further commented that it had encouraged designated communities  to report all investment that contributed to the EZ or EC in accomplishing  its strategic plan as leveraged funds. We recognize USDA\u2019s efforts to  encourage leveraging in the designated communities and to report such  information in its performance reporting system. Our report notes that  stakeholders from all EZs and ECs we visited and EC survey respondents  reported having used their EZ/EC grants to leverage other resources.  However, we were unable to evaluate the amounts of funds leveraged  because the data contained in USDA\u2019s performance reporting system were  not reliable. For example, USDA\u2019s performance reporting system included  information on the amounts of funds leveraged for each activity, but for the  sample of activities we reviewed, either supporting documentation showed  an amount conflicting with the reported amount or documentation could  not be found. Moreover, as we discuss in our report, the definition of  leveraging used among the designated communities was inconsistent.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested Members of Congress,  the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and  Urban Development, the Secretary of Treasury, the Commissioner of the  Internal Revenue Service, and the Secretary of Agriculture.

To address  each of our objectives, we completed site visits to all Round I EZs and two  Round I ECs and administered a survey to all ECs that did not receive  subsequent designations, such as a Round II EZ designation. At each site,  we asked uniform questions on implementation, oversight, tax benefits,  and changes observed in the EZ and ECs. We also surveyed 60 ECs that  were in operation as of June 2005 and did not receive later designations and  asked about similar topics. We performed a qualitative analysis to identify  common themes from our interview data and open-ended survey  responses. To address our second objective, we also interviewed federal  and state program participants, reviewed oversight guidance and  documentation, and verified a sample of reported performance data by  tracing it to EZ and EC records. To address our third objective, we  attempted to administer a survey of EZ businesses, but discontinued it due  to a low response rate. To address our fourth objective, we obtained  demographic and socioeconomic data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial  censuses and business data for 1995, 1999, and 2004 from a private data  vendor, Claritas. We used 1990 Census data to select areas similar to the EZ  and EC areas for purposes of comparison. We then calculated the percent  changes in poverty, unemployment, and economic growth observed in the  EZs and ECs and their comparison areas. In addition, for the eight urban  EZs, we used an econometric model to estimate the effect of the program,  by controlling for certain factors, such as average household income, in the  EZs and their comparison areas.

To identify survey participants, we obtained contact  information for the Round I ECs that did not receive a subsequent  designation from HUD and USDA in April 2005. We then sent a notification  e-mail to inform the ECs of the survey, to identify the correct point of  contact, and to ensure the e-mail account was active. Those who did not  respond to the first e-mail received follow up e-mails and telephone calls.  The questionnaire was e-mailed on August 25, 2005 to 27 rural ECs and 33  urban ECs, and participants were given the option to respond via e-mail,  fax, or post mail.

We did not attempt to verify the respondents\u2019 answers  against an independent source of information. However, we used two  techniques to verify the reliability of questionnaire items. First, we used in- depth interviewing techniques to evaluate the answers of pretest  participants, and interviewers judged that all the respondents\u2019 answers to  the questions were based on reliable information. Second, for the items  that asked about changes to poverty, unemployment, and economic growth  in the EC, we asked respondents to provide a source of data for their  response.

For example,  differences in how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of  information available to respondents, or the types of people who do not  respond can introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We  sought to minimize these errors by taking the following steps: conducting  pretests, making follow-up contacts with participants to increase response  rates, performing statistical analyses to identify logical inconsistencies, and  having a second independent analyst review the statistical analyses.

In anticipation of these issues, we attempted to administer a  concise, high-level survey via mail to a stratified random sample (n=517) of  EZ businesses.

The survey  was targeted to private businesses rather than public and nonprofit  businesses, since these for-profit businesses were the ones eligible for the  tax benefits. Public and nonprofit businesses were excluded from the  sample by the primary industry code identifier included in the Claritas data.

We also  explored a variety of other data options to enhance our analysis, but were  ultimately not able to use them. For example, we tried to acquire data  throughout the period of the program, such as state unemployment data,  local building permit and crime data, and data on students receiving free or  reduced lunches. However, we were not able to use these data because  they were not captured consistently across sites, not available at the  census tract level, or not sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "The decennial census data used are from the census long form that is  administered to a sample of respondents.

This is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95  percent of the samples that could have been drawn. As a result, we are 95  percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will  include the true values in the study population.

To select comparison areas for our analysis, we used a statistical  matching method called the propensity score. The propensity score  predicts the probability that a tract could have been designated based on  having characteristics similar to those found in the tracts selected for the  program. We used five factors to calculate the propensity scores, as shown  in table 7.", "To ensure that our comparison areas were similar to the designated areas  in terms of geography, we explored two selection methods, one that  included tracts in the same county as the EZ/EC and in adjacent counties,  and another that selected tracts within a 5-mile radius of the EZ/EC. We  excluded tracts that received a subsequent designation in the EZ/EC or  Renewal Community programs in 1998 and 2002 in order to remove the  possibility of tracts that may have received similar benefits affecting our  analysis. After mapping the resulting comparison tracts using these two  methods, we decided to use tracts selected within a 5-mile radius of the  EZs and ECs because this method provided more contiguous areas, while  the results of the county and the adjacent counties method yielded  comparison tracts in other states where political structures and types of  funds could differ.", "Using the computed propensity scores, we selected comparison tracts  whose scores were greater than 0.1. This threshold was chosen because  most EZ tracts had propensity scores of 0.1 or higher; therefore,  comparison tracts with propensity scores of at least 0.1 were the most  similar to the EZ tracts. This threshold also yielded approximately the same  number of comparison tracts as EZ tracts in most of the eight urban EZs. In  addition, we tested this threshold by running our models with comparison  tracts whose propensity scores were greater than 0.05 or 0.15 and found  that the results did not change significantly.

In  our analysis of percent changes, we found that poverty and unemployment  had decreased and that some economic growth had occurred. However,  when we used the econometric models to control for other area  characteristics, our results did not definitively suggest that the observed  changes in poverty and unemployment were associated with the EZ  program in urban areas. In addition, our models did not adequately explain  the observed changes in the proxy measures we used for economic growth;  thus, the results did not allow us to conclude whether there is an  association between the EZ program and economic growth.", "As mentioned in the report, there were several challenges that limited our  ability to determine the effect of the program. First, data at the census  tract-level for the program years were limited. We used data from the 1990  and 2000 decennial censuses to show the changes in poverty and  unemployment. In addition, we primarily used two measures for economic  growth\u2014the number of businesses and the number of jobs from Claritas  Business-Facts dataset for years 1995, 1999, and 2004\u2014in our models of  economic growth. Second, we were not able to account for the spillover  effects of EZ designation into their neighboring areas. For example, if the  EZ/EC program affected comparison tracts as well as the designated  communities, our analyses would not find any significant differences  between the designated and comparison tracts. The result may be an  obscuring of the extent of the statistical association between the urban EZ  program and the study variables. Third, the analyses did not account for the  confounding effects of other public or private programs, such as those  intended to reduce poverty or unemployment or increase the number of  area jobs. As a result, estimates for the EZ program in our analyses may  under or overstate the extent of EZ program\u2019s correlation with poverty,  unemployment, and economic growth. Fourth, our estimations did not fully  account for the economic trends that were affecting the choice of areas  selected for the program. For example, if program officials tended to pick  census tracts that were already experiencing gentrification prior to 1994,  our estimations could overstate the effect of the EZ designation.  Conversely, if officials tended to choose census tracts that were  experiencing economic declines prior to 1994, such as those in which  major employers had closed, we might understate the program\u2019s impact.  We did include a variable from Census data\u2014new housing construction  between 1990 and 1994\u2014that measured one dimension of economic trends  prior to EZ designation, but we did not include other dimensions, such as  employment trends at the tract level, in the models."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Description of Our Models", "paragraphs": ["We used a weighted least square regression for our analyses. Our  dependent variables were (1) the difference in the poverty rate between  1990 and 2000, (2) the difference in the unemployment rate between 1990  and 2000 (3) the difference in the number of businesses between 1995 and  1999, and (4) the number of jobs between 1995 and 1999. For the basic  model, we measured the difference in each dependent variable against the  1990 value of some explanatory variables. The benefit of this approach is  that 1990 values of the explanatory variables would not have been affected  by the program, which was implemented in 1994. We also ran an expanded  version of the model that included variables for each of the EZs to  determine whether there were differences among the EZs, and we included  variables for the EZs and their surrounding areas to account for economic  trends at the metropolitan level, such as the growing or declining output of  local industries.", "Some of the explanatory variables for which we controlled included  socioeconomic factors, such as percent of population with a high school  diploma. In addition to these socioeconomic factors, we also considered  the five factors we used to select the comparison tracts:  percent of minority population in 1990,  average household income in 1990,  population density in 1990,  poverty rate in 1990, and  unemployment rate in 1990.", "We included these variables because the comparison tracts may not be  perfectly matched to the EZ tracts; including these factors allowed us to  further account for differences between EZ and comparison tracts.  Moreover, we weighted the estimations by the geometric mean of 1990 and  2000 household counts of each tract to account for differences in the  number of households in each tract. The purpose of this decision was to  put more weight on the tracts with large numbers of households, because  these tracts would tend to have smaller sampling errors.", "The coefficients for the EZ program variables represent the EZs with  respect to the comparison areas, and the positive or negative values  suggest whether the EZs fared better or worse than the comparison areas.  For instance, a positive coefficient in the models for poverty and  unemployment would mean that the EZs did not fare as well as the  comparison areas\u2014that is, they had either a greater increase or a smaller  decrease in poverty or unemployment. See our discussion of the results of  each model for more information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of Our Models for Poverty", "paragraphs": ["Although our comparison of the percentage change between 1990 and 2000  showed that poverty decreased in most urban EZs, the results of our  models did not conclusively suggest that the change in poverty was  associated with the EZ program. Our analysis of the percentage changes  showed that the poverty rate fell more in the EZs than in the comparison  areas. But, when we controlled for other factors in our models, we found in  the basic model that poverty decreased less in the EZs than in the  comparison areas, although the difference was very small (table 8). In  addition, many of the variables used in selection of comparison tracts were  significant, suggesting that the choice of areas selected for the program  might have affected the differences between the urban EZs and the  comparison areas in the change in poverty. When accounting for the  different urban EZs and their comparison tracts, the poverty rate decreased  more in some urban EZs but less in others with respect to the comparison  tracts, although the only significant result was in the Los Angeles EZ, which  experienced a greater increase in poverty than the comparison areas. The  differences among EZs may be a result of the local factors. In addition, one  researcher found that there was a nationwide decrease in the number of  people living in high poverty neighborhoods, defined as census tracts with  poverty rates of 40 percent or higher, between 1990 and 2000\u2014a trend that  might be a factor affecting our results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of Our Models for Unemployment", "paragraphs": ["Like our models for poverty, our models for the unemployment did not  conclusively suggest that the changes in unemployment were associated  with the EZ program. The results of our basic model suggested that  unemployment decreased more in the EZs than in the comparison areas,  but the difference was very small and was not statistically significant (table  9). All five of the variables we used to select comparison tracts were  statistically significant, suggesting that the choice of areas selected for the  program might have affected the difference in the change in unemployment  rate between EZ and comparison tracts. Like the model for poverty, our  model showed that the unemployment rate decreased more in some urban  EZs but less in others, although the only EZ that experienced a significant  change was the Cleveland EZ, which showed a significantly greater  decrease in unemployment than the comparison areas.

In order to be consistent with our analyses of  poverty rate and unemployment, which covered the time period between  1990 and 2000, we used 1995 and 1999 data for our models of economic  growth. We also tested the model using Home Mortgage Disclosure Act  data on the number of loan originations for new home purchases and the  mean loan amount for new home purchases as other possible measures of  economic growth, but found consistent results, which are not presented  here.", "On the basis of the results of our models, we were not able to determine  whether there is a statistical association between the EZ program and  economic growth because the explanatory variables we used explained  little of the variation in the changes in the number of businesses or jobs  between 1995 and 1999 (tables 10 and 11). Not surprisingly, most  explanatory variables were also not significant. The low explanatory power  of our models could be the result of not having considered the right  variables; however, we explored many combinations of variables, all of  which yielded consistent results. This lack of explanatory power might also  be the result of the fact that our proxy measures\u2014the number of  businesses and jobs\u2014were not strongly representative of economic  growth.

HUD commented that GAO should include details on the amount of  funding and tax incentives provided for Rounds II and III of the EZ/EC  program. We noted in our report that communities designated in  Rounds II and III received a smaller amount of funding and more tax  benefits than those designated in Round I. Our statement does not  provide further details on Rounds II and III because the focus of the  report is Round I. 2. We recognize that Round I designees were required to address four key  principles as part of their strategic plans. However, our mandate was to  assess the effectiveness of the EZ/EC program on poverty,  unemployment, and economic growth. Assessing the extent to which  communities addressed the key principles would not have been useful  in meeting our mandate because, among other things, there is not a  clear relationship between the key principles and poverty,  unemployment, and economic growth. Further, while the report did not  evaluate the extent to which communities met the key principles, it  included many examples of activities carried out under them. The  report also indicated that communities had implemented a larger  percentage of community development activities than economic  opportunity activities but did not comment on the appropriateness of  the distribution of activities.  3. Our mandate was to assess the effects of the EZ/EC program on  poverty, unemployment, and economic growth. Our report stated that  communities were required to submit strategic plans that addressed the  four key principles.  However, because communities were able to  modify their strategic plans over time, it would have been difficult to  establish set criteria for assessing performance. Nonetheless, our  report does contain numerous examples of activities undertaken by the  communities, including examples mentioned in a separate appendix  focusing on the 13 designated communities we visited.   4. HUD commented that because GAO found that a lack of data on how  program funds were used was a limiting factor in determining the  effectiveness of the EZ/EC program, we should make use of  information in the agency\u2019s performance reporting system and in  communities\u2019 strategic plans. However, we reported that our file review  to determine the accuracy of data in HUD\u2019s performance reporting  system found that the data were not sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.  For example, we found evidence that communities had  undertaken certain activities with program funding, but we were often  unable to find documentation of the actual amounts allocated or  expended. As a result, we were unable to rely on information contained  in the agency\u2019s performance reporting system on the amounts of  program funds allocated or expended on specific activities. 5. We found that data in HUD\u2019s performance reporting system on the  amounts of funds used and the amounts leveraged were not reliable.  For example, we found that HUD\u2019s system included information on the  amount of funds leveraged. But for the sample of activities we  reviewed, the supporting documentation either showed an amount  conflicting with the reported amount or was not available. Moreover,  we found that the definition of \u201cleveraging\u201d varied across EZ and EC  sites. HUD further commented that Table 5 in the report showed that  the agency\u2019s performance reporting system received a code of 2.0,  showing that leveraging data had strong documentation. However,  HUD appears to have misinterpreted the information we presented on  this matter. We found that HUD\u2019s data on leveraging received an  average code of 1.0, indicating that such information had weak  documentation. Lastly, HUD recommended that it be allowed to  alleviate GAO\u2019s concerns about the reliability of its leveraging data by  demonstrating how the data were tracked and recorded in its  performance reporting system. However, the data reliability problems  we found during the course of this work were due not to concerns  about the system used to track and record the data, but rather to the  frequent lack of supporting documentation for the data entered into the  system.  6. HUD commented that our report did not adequately address HUD\u2019s  performance reporting system and its role in HUD\u2019s oversight of the  urban Round I EZ and ECs. We acknowledge that HUD established the  system in response to an earlier GAO recommendation and has since  used it to oversee Round I EZs and ECs. Moreover, we agree that the  system contains a variety of information and data elements, including  activities implemented and program outputs. We also acknowledge that  the performance reporting system is not intended to be a financial  system for Round I. However, as discussed in our report, we found that  because the system did not always contain information on what was  spent on activities and did not always contain reliable information,  HUD and the other federal agencies were limited in their ability to  oversee the program.  7. HUD commented that the program\u2019s design was significant because it  provided insight about the nature and extent of the federal, state, and  local attitudes that existed at the time of the first Round of EZs/ECs.  HUD also stated that it did not conduct monitoring of the SSBG funds  because monitoring those funds was the responsibility of HHS. HUD\u2019s  statement further supports our discussion on the limitation in the  oversight of the EZ/EC program that may have resulted from the  program\u2019s design. Although we found program oversight was hindered,  we also reported that no single federal agency had sole responsibility  for oversight. We do not agree with HUD\u2019s recommendation that we  make clear that more oversight was not allowed in Round I. For  example, early in the program HUD and HHS made some efforts to  share information. Specifically, HUD officials said that they had  received fiscal data from HHS and reconciled that information with  their program data on the activities implemented, but these efforts to  share information were not maintained. Regarding the second  recommendation, although HUD described some of its efforts to  monitor the program according to applicable regulations, the oversight  concerns we identified in the report remain.   8. We reported that limitations in the oversight of the EZ/EC program may  have resulted from the design of the program.  9. We stated in the report that the concerns raised about program  oversight for the Round I EZ/EC program may not apply to future  rounds of the EZ/EC program. We also acknowledge that HUD may  have made changes in its oversight of later rounds of the program.  However, an evaluation of later rounds of the EZ/EC and Renewal  Community programs is beyond the scope of this report. 10. In our report, we acknowledged HUD\u2019s as well as the other agencies\u2019  response to the recommendation in our 2004 report to identify a cost- effective means of collecting the data needed to assess the use of the  tax benefits.  11. Our report acknowledged the collaboration among HUD, IRS, and  USDA in addressing our previous recommendation and summarizes the  outcome of their discussions, including the identification of two data  collection methods\u2014through a national survey or by modifying the tax  forms. In addition, our report also acknowledged that IRS did not have  any data for some program tax benefits. The lack of data on the use of  tax benefits continues to be a source of concern that limits an  assessment of the effect of the EZ/EC program.  12. We agree that HUD\u2019s efforts to develop a methodology to administer a  survey to businesses to assess the use of the program tax benefits is a  useful step in gathering such information.  13. We recognize the efforts between HUD and Treasury on sharing  national-level data on EZ businesses\u2019 use of tax credits for employing  EZ residents. However, as we mention in our report, data on the EZ  employment tax benefit were limited because they could not be linked  to the specific EZ claiming the benefit.  14. In the absence of other data, we acknowledge HUD\u2019s efforts to capture  anecdotal information on the use of program tax benefits by EZ  businesses. 15. We recognize HUD\u2019s efforts to market the EZ/EC program tax benefits.  16. We appreciate HUD\u2019s suggestion on how to approach evaluations of  later rounds of the EZ/EC and Renewal Community programs and  welcome the opportunity to discuss these ideas.  17. We appreciate HUD\u2019s comments on the descriptive information on EZs  and ECs we visited that are discussed in appendix IV. 18. HUD commented that the measures used in our report---poverty,  unemployment and economic growth\u2014were used in the application  process and were not intended to be used as performance measures.  However, as mentioned earlier our mandate was to assess the effects of  the EZ/EC program on poverty, unemployment, and economic growth.  19. HUD suggested that we consider additional methodologies for  measuring the effects of the EZ/EC program, such as trend analysis  using data from 1990 through 1995 and 1995 through 2000. To conduct  our work, we used 1990 and 2000 data to measure changes in poverty  and unemployment and 1995, 1999, and 2004 data to measure changes  in economic growth. We chose these dates because data were available  at the census tract level for these years. Moreover, in designing our  methodology for our econometric analysis, we conducted a literature  review and discussed our methodology with several experts in the  urban studies field and determined that the approach presented in this  report was effective in answering the objectives of our mandate. As  mentioned in Appendix II, we also conducted different tests to ensure  the robustness of our models, which all yielded results consistent with  our models. The approach that HUD suggested controlled for trends  that began before the EZs were designated in 1994. Because we did not  have data on poverty or unemployment for 1995 we were unable to use  this approach. However, our use of housing trends between 1990 and  1994 in our econometric model controlled for some trends that were in  place prior to EZ designation.", "HUD also suggested a longitudinal case study approach might be the  best way to assess the effectiveness of this type of program. Although a  longitudinal case study approach would be informative, it is unlikely  that a successful retrospective longitudinal study could be designed at  the end of the program. As HUD noted, this intervention was intended  to be implemented over a ten-year period. However, a longitudinal case  study approach would necessitate data collection beginning at the  inception of the program and continuing for the duration of the  program as well as some period of time after it ends."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Charles Wilson, Jr., Assistant  Director, Carl Barden, Mark Braza, Marta Chaffee, Emily Chalmers, Nadine  Garrick, Kenrick Isaac, DuEwa Kamara, Austin Kelly, Terence Lam, John  Larsen, Alison Martin, Denise McCabe, John McGrail, John Mingus, Jr.,  Marc Molino, Gretchen Maier Pattison, James Vitarello, and Daniel Zeno  made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
