Of the six studies GAO identified that assessed the effect of safety incentive programs, two analyzed the potential effect on workers\u0092 reporting of injuries or illnesses, but they concluded that there was no relationship between the programs and injury and illness reporting. Experts and industry officials, however, suggest that rate-based programs may discourage reporting of injuries and illnesses. Experts and industry officials also reported that certain workplace polices, such as post-incident drug and alcohol testing, may discourage workers from reporting injuries and illnesses. Researchers and workplace safety experts also noted that how safety is managed in the workplace, including employer practices such as fostering open communication about safety issues, may encourage reporting of injuries and illnesses.", "In 2010, from its survey, GAO estimated that 25 percent of U.S. manufacturers had safety incentive programs, and most had other workplace safety policies that, according to experts and industry officials, may affect injury and illness reporting. GAO estimated that 22 percent of manufacturers had rate-based safety incentive programs, and 14 percent had behavior-based programs. Almost 70 percent of manufacturers also had demerit systems, which discipline workers for unsafe behaviors, and 56 percent had post-incident drug and alcohol testing policies according to GAO\u0092s estimates. Most manufacturers had more than one safety incentive program or other workplace safety policy and more than 20 percent had several. Such programs and policies were more common among larger manufacturers.", "Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is not required to regulate safety incentive programs, it has taken limited action to address the potential effect of such programs and other workplace safety policies on injury and illness reporting. These programs and policies, however, are not addressed in key guidance such as OSHA's field operations manual for inspectors. OSHA has cooperative programs that exempt employers with exemplary safety and health management systems from routine inspections. One such program prohibits participants from having rate-based safety incentive programs, but guidance on OSHA\u0092s other cooperative programs does not address safety incentive programs. Similarly, OSHA inspectors and outreach specialists provide information to employers about the potential benefits and risks of safety incentive programs, but the guidance provided to inspectors in its field operations manual does not address these programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that OSHA provide guidance about safety incentive programs and other workplace safety policies consistently across the agency's cooperative programs, and add language about safety incentive programs and other workplace safety policies to the guidance provided to inspectors in its field operations manual.

In addition, OSHA targets  industries and employers with a high number of workplace injuries and  illnesses for inspection. When inspecting worksites, OSHA inspectors  identify hazards that could lead to workers\u2019 injuries or illnesses, review  worksites\u2019 injury and illness records, evaluate employers\u2019 safety and  health management systems, and meet with employers and worker  representatives to discuss their findings and possible courses of action to  correct hazards and improve their systems.

Employees should be involved in safety-  and health-related activities such as accident investigations.

Accurate injury and illness records  can be used to identify and prevent work-related injuries and illnesses.  (3) Hazard prevention and control  Employers should have clear procedures for preventing and controlling  hazards identified through worksite analysis, such as a hazard tracking  system and a written system for monitoring and maintaining workplace  equipment.  (4) Safety and health training  Training is necessary to reinforce and complement management\u2019s  commitment to safety and health and to ensure that all employees  understand how to avoid exposure to hazards.", "As part of their safety and health management systems, many employers  use safety incentive programs to encourage safety in the workplace.  These programs provide workers with rewards for achieving certain safety  goals. Examples of these rewards include cash, meals, tangible goods,  and public recognition. Employers can provide such rewards on the basis  of individual or group performance depending on the program\u2019s design.", "There are two types of safety incentive programs: rate-based programs,  which reward workers for achieving low rates of reported injuries or  illnesses, and behavior-based programs, which reward workers for certain  behaviors such as recommending safety improvements (see fig. 1). Rate- based programs provide workers or groups of workers with rewards such  as bonuses and prizes for having no or a low number of work-related  injuries and illnesses during a specified period. For example, an employer\u2019s  rate-based program may reward workers with $100 bonuses for having no  reported work-related injuries or illnesses in a given year. Behavior-based  programs provide workers or groups of workers with rewards for  demonstrating safe behaviors but are not tied to low injury and illness rates.  For example, an employer\u2019s behavior-based program may reward workers  with gift cards for identifying hazardous conditions and suggesting safety  improvements. Some experts we interviewed used the term behavior- based safety programs to describe an approach to workplace safety that  focuses on worker behavior as the cause of work-related injuries and  illnesses. However, in this report, we use the term behavior-based program  to define a type of safety incentive program that is a component of an  employer's safety and health management system. These systems may  include other workplace safety policies such as demerit systems that  discipline workers for failing to follow safety procedures.", "Employers\u2019 safety and health management systems often include other  workplace safety policies. For example, some employers require the  participation of frontline workers and management in safety committees to  help foster communication and address safety-related issues and  encourage workers to promptly report injuries or illnesses and address  safety hazards. Other workplace safety policies are designed to prevent  injuries and illnesses by holding workers accountable for using safe work  practices. Demerit systems discipline workers for unsafe work practices  such as failing to follow safety procedures. For example, some employers  have policies that discipline workers for not wearing protective gear or for  other unsafe practices linked to reported injuries. In addition, some  employers have drug and alcohol testing policies, which provide for the  testing of workers (1) prior to employment, (2) at random intervals for  some or all workers, (3) at scheduled times for all workers, (4) when there  is evidence that suggests a worker may have used drugs or alcohol, or  (5) after a workplace incident, such as an injury, occurs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Safety Incentive Programs and Policies May Affect Injury and Illness Reporting", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Research on the Effect of Safety Incentive Programs Is Inconclusive, but Several Experts Agree Certain Programs and Policies May Discourage Reporting", "paragraphs": ["Little conclusive academic research exists on whether safety incentive  programs and other workplace safety policies affect workers\u2019 injury and  illness reporting, but several experts stated that rate-based programs may  discourage injury and illness reporting.

Several of  them told us that an unintended consequence of rate-based programs  may be discouraging workers from reporting injuries and illnesses. For  example, when workers\u2019 injuries are relatively minor or easy to hide, and  if the rewards provided under the program are relatively large, workers  may not report their injuries to preserve their rewards. Potential  underreporting of injuries and illnesses is even greater when an incentive  creates peer pressure on workers to not report injuries. For example,  when all workers on a team get a reward only if no one on the team has  an injury, there may be pressure on all members of the team to not report  injuries. According to some experts we interviewed, it is difficult to  quantify the effect safety incentive programs may have on injury and  illness reporting partly because researchers do not have access to  workers\u2019 medical records. Without such access, workers who do not  report their injuries cannot be identified and this information cannot be  used to explore whether workers\u2019 decisions to not report their injuries  were linked to their employers\u2019 safety incentive programs.", "Several experts and industry officials we interviewed also mentioned that,  along with safety incentive programs, some workplace safety policies may  discourage workers from reporting injuries and illnesses.

Such policies include demerit systems that have  consequences for workers who report injuries or illnesses, such as giving  workers warnings, demotions, or terminating them for recurrences.  However, some employers use demerit systems to discipline workers who  engage in unsafe practices such as not wearing protective gear, and such  demerit systems may have no effect on workers\u2019 reporting of injuries and  illnesses. According to officials from a union, workplace safety policies  that single out workers who report injuries or illnesses by, for example,  requiring them to wear identifying clothes such as an orange vest, may  also discourage them from reporting. In addition, according to several  experts, policies that require drug and alcohol testing after an injury is  reported\u2014compared to those that are applied on a routine basis to all  workers\u2014may deter workers from reporting injuries. We found only one  study that evaluated the effect of these other workplace safety policies  mentioned by experts and industry officials as having a potentially  adverse effect on injury and illness reporting.

Some types of programs, particularly those that are tied to low  injury and illness rates, may discourage injury or illness reporting.  However, the same programs in workplaces with positive safety cultures  may have no effect with regard to reporting. Similarly, some workplace  safety policies, such as those that punish workers in some way for  reporting injuries or illnesses, may discourage workers from reporting  injuries and illnesses, especially when implemented in a workplace with a  negative safety culture.", "Because OSHA relies heavily on accurate injury and illness reporting in  tailoring its programs and allocating its finite enforcement resources, it is  important for the agency to assess the impact of safety incentive  programs and certain workplace safety policies on injury and illness  reporting, particularly given their prevalence. Without accurate data,  employers engaged in hazardous activities can avoid inspections and  may be allowed to participate in voluntary programs that reward  employers with exemplary safety and health management systems by  exempting them from routine inspections.", "OSHA can encourage employers to create positive safety cultures and  avoid safety incentive programs and workplace safety policies that may  have a negative effect on injury and illness reporting. However, because  safety incentive programs and certain workplace safety policies are not  addressed in OSHA guidance, including its field operations manual,  OSHA inspectors may not consider these programs and policies during  worksite inspections, even as they observe key aspects of the  workplace\u2019s safety culture. As a result, inspectors may miss opportunities  to educate employers about the benefits of promoting a positive safety  culture and avoiding prevalent programs and policies that can discourage  accurate reporting of injuries and illnesses. In addition, in the absence of  consistent guidance on the potential benefits and risks of some safety  incentive programs and workplace safety policies, OSHA may recognize  some employers as having exemplary safety and health management  systems without considering the potentially negative effects of some of  their programs and policies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To increase consistency across OSHA\u2019s cooperative programs, the  Secretary of Labor should direct the Assistant Secretary of OSHA to  implement criteria on safety incentive programs and other workplace  safety policies across all of its cooperative programs such as VPP and  SHARP.

We  sought studies that analyzed the effect of workplace safety incentive  programs; other workplace safety policies, such as post-incident drug  testing; or safety culture on workers\u2019 use of safe practices; injury and  illness rates; or reporting of injuries and illnesses. To identify the studies,  we searched bibliographic databases covering scientific, safety, medical,  and economic literature, including ArticleFirst, CINAHL, EconLit,  Electronic Collections Online, EMBASE, MEDLINE, ProQuest, PsycINFO,  SciSearch, and Social SciSearch for relevant search terms and citations  of studies. We limited the searches to materials published in 2001 or  after. We performed these searches from August 2011 to October 2011,  and identified over 600 abstracts of studies. Among these studies, we  excluded those that did not satisfy our criteria that each study (1) be  published in a peer-reviewed journal and (2) contain relevant, primary  research conducted in the United States. We also excluded studies that  seemed duplicative or did not meet GAO\u2019s methodological standards. To  assess the methodological quality of the studies, two GAO research  methodologists independently reviewed each study that satisfied our  criteria and excluded those that did not contain original research or lacked  rigor. Using this approach, we identified 26 methodologically sound  studies (see app. II for a list of the 26 studies).", "To supplement our understanding of what is known about the effect of  safety incentive programs and other workplace safety policies on injury  and illness reporting, we interviewed experts and industry officials from  academia, employer associations, a law firm, a consulting firm, unions,  and state and federal occupational safety and health agencies.

To  identify these experts and industry officials, we reviewed relevant trade  press and congressional transcripts and sought referrals from  interviewees. To ensure balance, we spoke with an array of experts and  industry officials with varying backgrounds and perspectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Survey of Manufacturing Worksites", "paragraphs": ["To study the prevalence of workplace safety incentive programs as well  as other workplace safety policies that may affect injury and illness  reporting, we surveyed a nationally representative sample of  manufacturing worksites. We selected a systematic random sample of  1,000 manufacturers from a total of 26,552 included in our sample frame  of data. Our sample frame consisted of the set of manufacturers with 11  or more employees contained in a nationally representative BLS  establishment survey fielded in 2010. This list was a relatively complete,  current source of business names and addresses that had undergone a  strict refinement process to remove establishments that were out of  business, duplicates, or miscoded. We sorted the manufacturers by the  sample weight for the BLS survey prior to the systematic random  selection in order to ensure that a range of manufacturers was obtained.", "We designed and implemented a dual mode survey (mail and web-based)  to obtain information from manufacturers on the types and characteristics  of safety incentive programs and policies used at their workplaces, and  the extent to which they performed contractual work for other companies.  To develop our survey questions, we drew on information we gathered  from interviews with occupational safety and health stakeholders and  from scholarly studies on occupational safety and health. We pretested  the survey with nine manufacturers that represented the three size  populations of manufacturers studied (small, medium, and large) and  submitted the questionnaire for an additional independent review by two  survey specialists within GAO and experts in OSHA and BLS. We then  made revisions based on their feedback prior to finalizing the survey. We  conducted the survey using a self-administered questionnaire, and  offered prospective respondents the option of completing and mailing a  hard copy questionnaire or completing the questionnaire online (see app.  III for a copy of the survey). To encourage participation, we mailed a  reminder postcard, a second questionnaire, and made follow-up phone  calls to all those who had not yet responded in regular intervals prior to  closing the survey. A total of 663 manufacturers responded, resulting in a  final weighted response rate of 62.4 percent.", "Because we surveyed a sample of manufacturers, the survey results are  weighted estimates for a population of manufacturers and thus are  subject to sampling errors associated with samples of this size and type.  Our sample is only one of a large number of samples we might have  drawn. As each sample could have provided different estimates, we  expressed our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s  results as a 95 percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 10  percentage points). We excluded 29 of the sampled manufacturers  because we were able to determine that they were out of business at the  time of our survey or they indicated that they did not engage in  manufacturing. Therefore, all 29 of the manufacturers we excluded were  considered out of scope. All estimates produced from the sample and  presented in this report are representative of the in-scope population.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors  resulting from the data collection procedures, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors, which can introduce unwanted variability into the  survey results. There are four primary sources of nonsampling error:  1.  Measurement\u2014error in responses recorded on the survey  instruments resulting from poorly worded, biased, or sensitive  questions; ambiguous instructions; or lack of information available to  respondents.  2.   Nonresponse\u2014bias from failing to get responses from  establishments whose answers would have differed significantly from  those that did participate.  3.  Coverage\u2014bias from failing to include all eligible establishments or  from including ineligible establishments in the list from which we  sampled.  4.  Data processing\u2014error arising from faulty handling or processing of  the data.", "We took extensive steps in developing the questionnaire, collecting the  data and analyzing the results to address the potential sources of  nonsampling error. To minimize measurement error, GAO staff with  subject-matter expertise collaborated with a survey design specialist to  develop the questionnaire. We pretested the instrument using cognitive  interviewing techniques and interviewed the pretest respondents to  ensure that (1) the questions and instructions were clear, unambiguous,  and in the correct order; (2) the terms we used were precise; (3) the  survey did not place an undue burden on the respondents completing it;  and (4) the survey was unbiased. To assess the risk of nonresponse bias,  we obtained answers over the phone to three survey questions from 19  nonrespondents. We statistically compared the answers from the  nonrespondents with those of our respondents on these three questions  and found no statistically significant differences. Our sample frame  minimized the risk of coverage error by drawing on a nationally  representative list of manufacturers that was thoroughly reviewed and  cleaned to remove ineligible establishments. Finally, we took several  steps to reduce processing errors: (1) Quality control measures were  implemented during preparation and mailout of survey packages to  ensure that the respondents would receive the package with the proper  login identification number and that the packages contained the correct  contents. (2) We contracted with an outside company to enter the data  from the paper questionnaires into a database, and we checked a 10  percent sample of the database as a quality control measure. (3)  Respondents who completed questionnaires online entered their answers  directly which eliminated the errors associated with a manual data entry  process.
