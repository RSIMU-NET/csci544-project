The act established TVA to improve the quality of life in the Tennessee  River Valley by improving navigation, promoting regional agricultural and  economic development, and controlling the floodwaters of the Tennessee  River. To those ends, TVA built dams and hydropower facilities on the  Tennessee River and its tributaries. From its inception in 1933 through  fiscal year 1959, TVA received annual appropriations to finance its cash  and capital requirements. In 1959, however, Congress amended the TVA  Act and provided TVA with the authority to finance its power program  through revenue from electricity sales and borrowing and required it to  repay a substantial portion of the annual appropriations it had received to  pay for its power facilities. Under the TVA Act, TVA must design its rates  to cover all costs but also keep rates as low as feasible.

To forecast the demand for electricity  in its service area for the next 20 or more years, TVA employs a set of  models but forecasting beyond a few years into the future involves great  uncertainty. Utilities deal with uncertainty partly by producing a range of  forecasts based on demographic and economic factors, and by  maintaining excess generating capacity, known as reserves. Models help  utilities choose the least-cost combination of generating resources to  meet demand. If demand forecasts are unreasonably high or low, a utility  could end up with more or less generating capacity than it needs to serve  its customers reliably, or it could end up with a mix of generating capacity  that is not cost effective.

Although TVA  established a goal to reduce its debt, it has not documented in its annual  performance plan or report strategies for how it will meet its goal, as  required by GPRAMA, thereby reducing transparency and raising  questions about how the agency will meet its goal.", "For TVA\u2019s unfunded pension liabilities, TVA officials have stated a goal to  eliminate the pension funding shortfall (about $6 billion at the end of fiscal  year 2016) by 2036, but TVA has not identified such a goal or milestones  in its performance plan or report. As of September 30, 2016, TVA\u2019s  pension plan was about 54 percent funded with a funding shortfall of  about $6 billion (plan assets totaled $7.1 billion and liabilities $13.1  billion). While TVA\u2019s debt has remained relatively flat, its unfunded  pension liabilities have steadily increased over the past 10 years (see fig.  5).", "Unfunded pension liabilities are similar to other kinds of debt because  they constitute a promise to make a future payment or provide a benefit.  According to a joint American Academy of Actuaries and Society of  Actuaries task force, a pension plan needs to be evaluated as part of a  plan sponsor\u2019s overall enterprise; an analysis that looks at the pension  plan as a self-standing entity is incomplete and too narrow. However, TVA officials told us that because TVA uses revenue from the rates it  charges customers to fund the pension, and not debt in the form of  bonds, unfunded pension liabilities would not affect TVA\u2019s debt reduction  plan. In addition, TVA defers pension costs as \u201cregulatory assets\u201d\u2014 incurred costs deferred for recovery through rates in the future\u2014in  accordance with accounting standards and with TVA board approval.  However, because TVA will need to recover these costs through rates in  the future, this affects its financial health and operations. If TVA uses  revenue from rate increases to close the pension shortfall, this could  decrease its ability to fund other activities such as capital projects with  revenue from rates. This could, in turn, require TVA to rely on debt to fund  certain capital projects and interfere with efforts to meet overall debt  reduction goals. Alternatively, further rate increases could interfere with  TVA\u2019s objective of keeping rates as low as feasible. Without the Board of  Directors ensuring that TVA better document and communicate  information about its goals to reduce debt and unfunded pension liabilities  in its performance plan and report, including strategies for achieving its  goals, congressional and other stakeholders will not have a complete  picture of TVA\u2019s progress toward managing its debt or its overall financial  health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Factors Could Affect TVA\u2019s Ability to Meet Its Debt Reduction Goal, and No Mechanism Is in Place to Ensure TVA Addresses Unfunded Pension Liabilities", "paragraphs": ["Several factors could affect TVA\u2019s ability to meet its debt reduction goal,  including regulatory pressures, changes in demand for electricity,  technological innovations, or unforeseen events.

For example, TVA estimates it will spend  about $2 billion on environmental expenditures and compliance with  regulations from 2017 through 2023 but, according to a TVA document,  this estimate could change as additional information becomes available  and regulations change. TVA spent about $977 million to eliminate the  wet storage of coal combustion residual, commonly called coal ash, to  assist in meeting EPA and Tennessee Department of Environment and  Conservation environmental requirements. As part of these efforts, TVA  prepared a June 2016 environmental impact statement on the approach it  planned to take for closing coal ash impoundments at its coal plants,  which involved converting all its wet storage to dry storage. According to  a TVA document, the agency anticipates spending about an additional  $1.2 billion in related coal ash costs through 2022.", "While the status of the Clean Power Plan that EPA issued in 2015 is  unclear, TVA continues to assess the plan and its status. According to  TVA documentation, TVA is well positioned to meet carbon emission  guidelines for existing fossil fuel plants under the plan. Specifically, in  April 2011, TVA agreed to retire 18 of its 59 fossil fuel units by the end of  2017 for several reasons, including the cost of adding emission control  equipment and other environmental improvements to the units. As of  September 2016, TVA had retired 14 of the 18 units and reported that it  would continue to evaluate the appropriate asset mix, given the costs of  continuing to operate its coal plants, including adhering to environmental  regulations.", "With regard to TVA\u2019s nuclear power plants, TVA also faces potential costs  related to proposed regulations. For example, in May 2014, NRC notified  certain nuclear power plant licensees of the results of seismic hazard  screening evaluations performed following the Fukushima nuclear  accident. Based on the screening results, TVA must conduct additional  seismic risk evaluations of all three of its nuclear plants\u2014Browns Ferry,  Sequoyah, and Watts Bar\u2014by 2019. According to TVA, NRC is  developing a rule anticipated in mid-2017 for nuclear plants to mitigate  the effects of events, such as seismic events, that exceed plant design  standards that could require TVA to modify one or more of its nuclear  plants. According to TVA documents, plant modification costs will be  unknown until the rule is finalized, but they could be substantial."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes in Electricity Demand, Technological Innovation, or Unforeseen Events Could Affect Revenues or Require Additional Investments", "paragraphs": ["Reductions in demand for electricity could affect TVA\u2019s revenues;  alternatively, increases in demand could generate additional revenue but  require investment in additional capacity or purchased power. The  expanded use of distributed generation and increased energy efficiency  and conservation could reduce demand for electricity in TVA\u2019s service  area and affect its revenues. As the amount of distributed generation  grows and renewable generation and energy efficiency technologies  improve and become more cost-effective, TVA projects sales of electricity  will see little, if any, growth in upcoming years. According to several  representatives from industry and stakeholder groups, distributed  generation could increase competition from end-use customers\u2014 consumers who typically buy power from the local power companies that  obtain power from TVA\u2014if they adopt on-site power generation.  According to EIA\u2019s Annual Energy Outlook 2016, annual electricity  demand for the average household will decline by 11 percent from 2015  to 2040. EIA reported that factors contributing to a decline in household  demand include efficient lighting technologies and increased distributed  generation, particularly rooftop solar. According to TVA documents, the  agency cannot predict the financial impact from future growth of  distributed generation but TVA has taken steps to anticipate the changes  in the electricity market that distributed generation could bring. For  example, in 2016, TVA announced a new business unit focused on  distributed energy resources and the energy delivery marketplace, and  according to a TVA official, it also formed information exchanges to  provide forums to discuss implementation issues related to distributed  generation and energy efficiency.", "Other technological developments in the electric utility industry could  change TVA\u2019s operating costs or requirements. For example, several  representatives we interviewed from industry and stakeholder groups said  that energy storage technology could become more cost-effective and  change the way utilities operate. While the added capacity provided by  energy storage could delay or alleviate the need for TVA to build  additional power plants, TVA officials said that there are still several  unknowns about the technology though they do not believe integration of  battery storage into the system would be problematic. Finally, unforeseen  events could also affect TVA\u2019s ability to meet debt reduction goals.

According to TVA\u2019s analysis, there is a 50 percent chance that annual  contributions of $300 million could eliminate the $6 billion funding shortfall  at the end of 20 years and a 50 percent chance that a funding shortfall  would remain. TVA\u2019s analysis assumes an annual return of 7 percent on  pension plan assets, but depending on market conditions, assets could  yield higher or lower than expected returns. According to TVA officials,  the pension plan asset performance is critical to TVA\u2019s ability to close the  pension funding shortfall. TVA officials have stated a goal to fully fund the  pension plan within 20 years. However, if market conditions over the next  20 years are not favorable enough to fully fund the pension liabilities,  which TVA\u2019s analysis assigns a 50 percent chance, TVA would need to  contribute more than $300 million per year to make up the difference if it  aims to eliminate the funding shortfall. Other factors that could affect  TVA\u2019s pension liabilities include greater than expected increases in retiree  lifespans and declining bond yields.", "In a 2010 report, the TVA OIG found that a combination of factors\u2014 including market conditions and TVA actions\u2014resulted in a significant  shortfall between pension plan assets and projected liabilities. These  factors included: (1) TVA not making contributions to TVARS for 6 years,  (2) the addition of significant retirement benefits to the plan when the  funded status was better, (3) the establishment of TVARS Rules that had  the effect of enticing employees to retire, and (4) the economic downturn  in 2008 and 2009. The TVARS pension plan\u2019s funded status decreased  from about 92 percent in 2007 to about 55 percent in 2016 (see fig. 6).", "In December 2015, TVA proposed changes to the TVARS Rules to  reduce the obligations of the pension plan and commit to making  consistent contributions. The TVARS board approved amendments that  reduced TVA\u2019s pension liabilities by about $960 million, reduced future  benefit accruals, and added a minimum contribution requirement of $300  million to the existing requirement for a period of 20 years. However, the  amended TVARS Rules do not adjust TVA\u2019s annual contribution  requirement to ensure TVA will fully fund its pension liabilities. The  TVARS Rules require that for a period of 20 years, or until the plan is  deemed fully funded, TVA\u2019s annual contribution equal the greater of (1) a  formula-based contribution or (2) $300 million. To the extent that a $300  million contribution proves inadequate because of plan experience, the  formula-based contribution would determine the amount TVA must  contribute each year. The formula uses a 30-year \u201copen amortization  method,\u201d meaning that the amortization period is reset to 30 years each  fiscal year, so the end of the amortization period (i.e., paying off the  unfunded liability) may never be achieved. A Blue Ribbon Panel  commissioned by the Society of Actuaries believes that plans\u2019 risk  management practices and their ability to respond to changing economic  and market conditions would be enhanced through the use of  amortization periods shorter than the 30-year period commonly used  today. The panel recommended amortization periods of no more than  15 to 20 years for gains and losses. According to the panel\u2019s 2014 report,  the panel believes that fully funding pension benefits of public employees  over their average future service reasonably aligns the cost of today\u2019s  public services with the taxpayers who benefit from those services. In  addition, according to the American Academy of Actuaries, funding rules  should include targets based on accumulating the present value of  benefits for employees by the time they retire, and a plan to make up for  any variations in actual assets from the funding target within a defined  and reasonable time period. In the private sector, ERISA generally  requires a 7-year amortization of shortfalls for private sector single- employer pension plans.", "Unlike an open amortization period, a closed, or fixed, amortization period  is generally maintained until the original unfunded liability amount is fully  repaid. Thus, a closed amortization period would be a better practice if  the goal is to fully fund pension liabilities. Table 2 compares the  amortization of $6 billion in unfunded liabilities using open and closed  amortization methods, assuming assets return 7 percent, as TVA  expects. The closed amortization method would extinguish the unfunded  liability in 30 years, whereas more than $4 billion in unfunded liability  would remain under the open amortization method (see table 2).", "As we mentioned earlier, TVA assumes an annual return of 7 percent on  pension plan assets, but depending on market conditions, assets could  yield higher or lower than expected returns. If the return on investment  was lower than expected, the unfunded liabilities would be greater, and  TVA would need to contribute more than $300 million per year to make up  the difference. The open amortization period utilized by the TVARS  formula-based contribution requirement does not ensure TVA\u2019s  contributions will adequately adjust for plan experience and does not  ensure full funding of the pension liabilities. Without a mechanism that  ensures TVA\u2019s contributions will adequately adjust for actual plan  experience, unfunded liabilities could remain, and future ratepayers may  have to fund the pension plan even further to pay for services provided to  prior generations of ratepayers.", "TVA officials told us that the agency does not plan to contribute more  than the TVARS Rules require and that it plans to continue to treat its  unfunded pension liabilities as regulatory assets, deferring pension costs  for recovery through rates in the future. However, the TVARS Rules do  not provide for fully funding pension benefits over the service of TVA  employees covered by the plan, which would align the cost of services  provided by covered employees with the rates paid by customers who  benefit from the services of covered employees. The deferral of  contributions necessary to close the funding shortfall reduces future  financial flexibility and may result in the need for rate increases during a  period of declining demand for electricity. If TVA needs to use revenue  originally targeted for debt reduction to pay for greater than estimated  pension expenses, this could interfere with TVA\u2019s debt reduction goal and  additional rate increases may be required which could interfere with  TVA\u2019s ability to keep rates low.

TVA generally aims to reduce its debt to increase its  financial flexibility over the long term to ensure sufficient room under its  debt ceiling so it can access capital for future investments to meet its  mission.
