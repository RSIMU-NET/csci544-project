For the 2000 Census, the Bureau removed the subgroup examples as part of a broader effort to simplify the questionnaire and help improve response rates. The Bureau removed unnecessary words and added blank space to shorten the questionnaire and make it more readable. Although the Bureau conducted a number of tests on the sequencing and wording of the race and ethnicity questions, and sought input from several expert panels, no Bureau tests were designed specifically to measure the impact of the questionnaire changes on the quality of Hispanic subgroup data. According to Bureau officials, because federal laws and guidelines require data on Hispanics but not Hispanic subgroups, the Bureau targeted its resources on research aimed at improving the overall count of Hispanics. Bureau evaluations conducted after the census indicated that deleting the subgroup examples might have confused some respondents and produced less-than-accurate subgroup data. A key factor behind the Bureau's release of the questionable subgroup data was its lack of adequate guidelines governing the quality needed before making data publicly available. As part of its planning for the 2010 Census, the Bureau intends to conduct further research on the Hispanic origin question, including a field test in parts of New York City. However, until research on a new version of the question is finalized, Bureau officials said that other census surveys will continue to use the 2000 Census format of the Hispanic origin question."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Collecting data on race and ethnicity is among the federal government\u2019s  most complex and controversial data collection efforts.

Over time,  in response to changing federal mandates, demographics, and its own  operational requirements, the U.S. Census Bureau (Bureau) has changed  the format and sequence of the race and ethnicity questions.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), through its Federal  Statistical Policy Directive No. 15, sets the standards governing federal  agencies\u2019 collection and reporting of race and ethnicity data.", "At least seven cabinet-level government departments, the Federal Reserve,  every state government, and a number of public and private organizations  use Hispanic data.  Although not required by federal legislation or OMB  standards, Hispanic subgroup data are also used for many of these same  purposes.  In addition, subgroup data are especially important to  communities with rapidly growing and diverse Hispanic populations.", "Collecting data on race and ethnicity has been a persistent challenge for the  Bureau.  Race and ethnicity are subjective characteristics, which makes  measurement difficult.  Moreover, the Bureau has found that some  Hispanics equate their ethnicity\u2014Hispanic\u2014with race, and thus find it  difficult to classify themselves by the standard race categories that include,  for example, white, black, and Asian.", "The Bureau\u2019s preparations for the 2000 Census included an extensive  research and testing program to improve the Hispanic count.  In 1990, the  Bureau estimated that it did not enumerate 5 percent of the Hispanic  population.  Further, the ethnicity question, which was posed to all  respondents, appeared to confuse both Hispanics and non-Hispanics.  For  example, many non-Hispanics, thinking the question only pertained to  Hispanics, did not answer the question.  Overall, 10 percent of respondents  failed to answer the 1990 Hispanic question\u2014the highest of any short form  item in 1990.

Since the 1970 Census, when the Bureau first included a question on  Hispanic origin, every census has had comparatively high Hispanic  undercounts that reduced the quality of the data.  As a result, the Bureau  has modified the Hispanic question on every census since then as part of a  continuing effort to improve the Hispanic count. (See fig. 1.)  In addition, a  Spanish language version of the census form has been available upon  request since 1980.", "For the 2000 Census, Hispanics could identify themselves as Mexican,  Puerto Rican, Cuban, or \u201cother Spanish/Hispanic/Latino.\u201d  Respondents  who checked off this last category could write in a specific subgroup such  as \u201cSalvadoran.\u201d  Although this approach was similar to that used for the  1990 Census, as shown in figure 1, the \u201cother\u201d category in the 1990 Census  included examples of other Hispanic subgroups.  The Bureau deleted these  examples as one of several changes to the Hispanic question for the 2000  Census.  Other changes included (1) adding the word \u201cLatino\u201d to the  designation Spanish/Hispanic, (2) dropping the word \u201corigin\u201d from the  question, and (3) moving the location of instructions on writing in an  unlisted subgroup.  According to Bureau officials, these latter three  changes were made to improve the Hispanic count.", "The Bureau removed the subgroup examples as part of a broader effort to  simplify the questionnaire and thus help reverse the downward trend in  mail response rates that had been occurring since 1970.  Indeed,  evaluations of the 1990 Census indicated that the overall design of the form  was confusing to many and contributed to lower response rates,  particularly among some hard-to-enumerate groups such as Hispanics.  In  redesigning the questionnaire, the Bureau added as much white space as  possible, and removed unnecessary words to make the questionnaire  shorter and more readable.  As shown in figure 2, the 2000 questionnaire  appears more \u201crespondent-friendly\u201d compared to the 1990 questionnaire.", "The Bureau initially proposed removing the example write-in subgroups  during 1990 through 1992.  A first version of the questionnaire without the  example subgroups was used in the 1992 National Census Test.  However,  as discussed in the next section, testing continued from 1992 to 1996 to  ensure that removing the write-in example groups did not harm the overall  count of Hispanics.  From 1995 to 1997, after testing showed that removal  of the write-in example groups would not harm the overall Hispanic count,  the Bureau finalized its decision to remove the example subgroups.", "Although federal law and OMB standards only require information on  whether an individual is Hispanic, Bureau officials told us they collect  subgroup data to help improve the overall Hispanic count.  According to  the Bureau, many Hispanics do not view themselves as Hispanic, but  identify instead with their country of origin or with a particular Hispanic  subgroup.  State and local governments, academic institutions, community  organizations, and marketing firms, among other organizations, also use  Hispanic subgroup data for a variety of purposes.  For example, officials in  the New York City Department of Planning told us that they need accurate  information on the number and distribution of Hispanic subgroups in  planning the delivery of numerous city services.", "According to a Bureau official, no data are available on the precise impact  the questionnaire redesign had on overall response rates in part because it  was made in conjunction with other efforts to improve the response rate,  such as a more aggressive outreach and promotion campaign.

Additionally, the census questionnaire is to be reviewed by  a variety of census advisory groups, OMB, and Congress before it is  finalized.", "Nevertheless, while the Bureau conducted a number of tests of the  sequencing and wording of the race and ethnicity questions, according to  Bureau officials, it did not specifically design any tests to determine the  impact of the changes on the quality of Hispanic subgroup data.  Because  OMB standards do not require data on Hispanic subgroups, Bureau officials  said that the Bureau targeted its resources on testing and research aimed at  improving the overall count of Hispanics.", "Throughout the 1990s, in revising the race and ethnicity questions, the  Bureau sought input from several expert panels, including the Interagency  Committee formed by OMB and the Census Advisory Committee on Racial  and Ethnic Populations, one of several panels with which the Bureau  consulted to help it plan the 2000 Census.  In addition, the Bureau  conducted several tests of the questionnaire to assess respondents\u2019  understanding of the questions and their ability to complete them properly.  They included the  1992 National Census Test, which field tested potential questions for the   1996 National Content Survey, which examined a number of issues to  improve race and ethnic reporting; and   1996 Race and Ethnic Targeted Test, which tested alternative formats  for asking race and ethnic questions.", "In addition, the Bureau analyzed the results of Hispanic data from the 1990  Census (which led to its conclusions about the undercount), but did not  conduct any specific evaluations of the quality of the 1990 Hispanic  subgroup data. The consultation, research, and testing played a key role in  the Bureau\u2019s decisions to place the ethnicity question before the race  question and make several other changes discussed earlier in this report.", "The test results also indicated that the example subgroups could produce  conflicting results.  On the one hand, the Bureau found that providing the  example subgroups could help prevent respondents\u2019 confusion over how to  describe their ethnicity.  On the other hand, the Bureau found that  removing the example subgroups could help reduce the bias caused by the  example effect, which occurs when a respondent erroneously selects a  response because it is provided in the questionnaire.", "Although the Bureau conducted a dress rehearsal for the 2000 Census in  1998 in order to test its overall design, the dress rehearsal did not identify  any problems with the Hispanic subgroup question.  According to Bureau  officials, this could have been because none of the three test sites\u2014the city  of Sacramento, California; Menominee County, Wisconsin, including the  Menominee American Indian Reservation; and the city of Columbia, South  Carolina, and its 11 surrounding counties\u2014had a large and diverse enough  Hispanic population for the problems to become evident."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Questions Raised about the Quality of Reported Hispanic Subgroup Data", "paragraphs": ["In May 2001, the Bureau released data on Hispanics and Hispanic  subgroups as part of its first release summarizing the results of the 2000  Census, called the SF-1 file.

The 2000 Census showed lower counts of several  Hispanic subgroups than analysts had expected based on their own  estimates using a variety of information sources such as vital statistics,  immigration statistics, population surveys, and other data.   In New York  City, local government officials and representatives of Hispanic subgroups  who partnered with the Bureau to improve the enumeration of Hispanics  told us that they were particularly concerned about low subgroup counts in  their communities in part because they needed accurate numbers to plan  and deliver specialized services to particular subgroups.

One key evaluation was the Alternative Questionnaire  Experiment, in which the Bureau sent out 1990-style census forms to a  sample of individuals as part of the 2000 Census.  As shown in figure 3, the  Bureau\u2019s research indicates that the 1990-style form elicited more reports  of specific Hispanic subgroups than the 2000-style questionnaire.  Indeed,  93 percent of Hispanics given the 1990-style form reported a specific  subgroup, compared to 81 percent of Hispanics given the 2000-style form.   Moreover, virtually every subgroup reported in the 2000-style form  composed a smaller percentage of the overall Hispanic count than the 1990- style form.  Thus, while the Bureau reported what respondents checked off  on their questionnaires, because of respondents\u2019 confusion over the  wording of the question, the 2000 subgroup data could be misleading.", "Figure 3 also suggests that one possible reason for this might be that many  respondents did not understand what they were supposed to write in, as  many more people on the 2000-style form wrote in \u201cHispanic,\u201d \u201cSpanish,\u201d or  \u201cLatino\u201d (as opposed to a specific subgroup) compared to the 1990-style  questionnaire.

As we noted in our companion  report on the Bureau\u2019s methods for collecting and reporting data on the  homeless and others without conventional housing, one cause of the  Bureau\u2019s shifting position on reporting those data and the resulting public  confusion appears to be its lack of documented, clear, transparent, and  consistently applied guidelines on the level of quality needed to release  data to the public.  With the Hispanic subgroup data, the Bureau released  the information as planned before it could properly assess its quality,  identify problems, and report its limitations.

However, the counts of Hispanic subgroups do not  appear to have been improved and, in fact, there is concern that some of  these subgroup counts may be less accurate than the 1990 counts.   Moreover, the Bureau\u2019s experience in simplifying the questionnaire in part  by removing the examples of the Hispanic subgroups shows the challenge  the Bureau faces in trying to improve one component of the census count  without adversely and unintentionally affecting other aspects of the census  count.
