To assess information systems controls, we identified  and reviewed SEC information systems control policies and procedures,  conducted tests of controls, and held interviews with key security  representatives and management officials concerning whether  information security controls were in place, adequately designed, and  operating effectively. This work was performed to support our opinion on  SEC\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015.", "We evaluated controls based on our Federal Information System Controls  Audit Manual (FISCAM), which contains guidance for reviewing  information system controls that affect the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of computerized information; National Institute of Standards  and Technology standards and special publications; and SEC\u2019s plans,  policies, and standards. We assessed the effectiveness of both general  and application controls by performing information system controls walkthroughs surrounding the  initiation, authorization, processing, recording, and reporting of  financial data (via interviews, inquiries, observations, and  inspections);  reviewing systems security risk assessment and authorization  documents;  reviewing SEC policies and procedures; observing technical controls implemented on selected systems;  testing specific controls; and  scanning and manually assessing SEC systems and applications,  including financial systems and related general support system  network devices (firewalls, switches, and routers) servers and  systems.", "We also evaluated the Statement on Standards for Attestation  Engagements report and performed testing on key information  technology controls on the following applications and systems: Delphi- Prism, FedInvest, EDGAR/Fee Momentum, and Federal Personnel and  Payroll System/Quicktime.

We  reviewed prior GAO reports to identify previously reported weaknesses  and examined the commission\u2019s corrective action plans to determine  which weaknesses it had reported were corrected. For those instances  where SEC reported that it had completed corrective actions, we  assessed the effectiveness of those actions by reviewing appropriate  documents, including SEC-documented corrective actions, and  interviewing the appropriate staffs.", "To assess the reliability of the data we analyzed, such as information  system control settings, security assessment and authorization  documents, and security policies and procedures, we corroborated them  by interviewing SEC officials and programmatic personnel to determine  whether the data obtained were consistent with system configurations in  place at the time of our review. In addition, we observed configuration of  these settings in the network. Based on this assessment, we determined  the data were reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We performed our work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.
