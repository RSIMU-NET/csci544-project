Savings in these IRAs are intended to be preserved by the conservative investments allowed under Department of Labor (DOL) regulations. However, GAO found that because fees outpaced returns in most of the IRAs analyzed, these account balances tended to decrease over time. Without alternatives to forced-transfer IRAs, current law permits billions in participant savings to be poorly invested for the long-term. GAO also found that a provision in law allows a plan to disregard previous rollovers when determining if a balance is small enough to force out. For example, a plan can force out a participant with a balance of $20,000 if less than $5,000 is attributable to contributions other than rollover contributions.", "Some 401(k) plan participants find it difficult to keep track of their savings, particularly when they change jobs, because of challenges with consolidation, communication, and information. First, individuals who accrue multiple accounts over the course of a career may be unable to consolidate their accounts by rolling over savings from one employer's plan to the next. Second, maintaining communication with a former employer's plan can be challenging if companies are restructured and plans are terminated or merged and renamed. Third, key information on lost accounts may be held by different plans, service providers, or government agencies, and participants may not know where to turn for assistance. Although the Social Security Administration provides individuals with information on benefits they may have from former employers' plans, the information is not provided in a consolidated or timely manner that would be useful to recipients.", "The six countries GAO reviewed address challenges of inactive accounts by using forced transfers that help preserve account value and providing a variety of tracking tools referred to as pension registries. For example, officials in two countries told GAO that inactive accounts are consolidated there by law, without participant consent, in money-making investment vehicles. Officials in the United Kingdom said that it consolidates savings in a participant's new plan and in Switzerland such savings are invested together in a single fund. In Australia, small, inactive accounts are held by a federal agency that preserves their real value by regulation until they are claimed. In addition, GAO found that Australia, the Netherlands and Denmark have pension registries, not always established by law or regulation, which provide participants a single source of online information on their new and old retirement accounts. Participants in the United States, in contrast, often lack the information needed to keep track of their accounts. No single agency has responsibility for consolidating retirement account information for participants, and so far, the pension industry has not taken on the task. Without a pension registry for individuals to access current, consolidated retirement account information, the challenges participants face in tracking accounts over time can be expected to continue."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Congress consider (1) amending current law to permit alternative default destinations for plans to use when transferring participant accounts out of plans, and (2) repealing a provision that allows plans to disregard rollovers when identifying balances eligible for transfer to an IRA.

Specifically, the Internal  Revenue Code allows former employers to force participants with vested  balances of $5,000 or less out of their 401(k) plans and, absent  participant instruction, transfer their savings into an individual retirement  account (IRA) referred to as a forced-transfer IRA in this report.

Because we found no comprehensive data on the  number of IRA accounts opened as a result of forced transfers or other  data relevant to their use and management, we collected data from a  non-generalizeable group of 10 providers of forced-transfer IRAs about  their practices and outcomes, including 3 of the largest IRA providers.  There is no comprehensive list of all forced-transfer IRA providers. For  this reason, we built a list of them through interviews with industry  professionals, a review of IRA market data, and online searches. Our  objective was to create a group that would cover a large share of assets  in the forced-transfer IRA market and represent both small and large IRA  providers in terms of company size. We reached out to the largest IRA  providers by assets under management, as well as all small forced- transfer IRA providers on our list and obtained forced-transfer IRA  account data from 10 providers that represent this mix of characteristics.  We also interviewed plan sponsor groups, 401(k) plan industry groups,  research entities, consumer groups, and six federal agencies (Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau, Department of Labor, Department of the  Treasury, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Securities and  Exchange Commission, and Social Security Administration) about plans\u2019  use of forced transfers and what challenges individuals and plans face  related to inactive accounts and multiple 401(k) plan accounts in the  United States.

EGTRRA sought to protect forced- out participants\u2019 retirement savings by requiring that, in the absence of  participant instructions, active plans transfer balances of $1,000 or more  to forced-transfer IRAs, thus permitting the plan to distribute them while  preserving their tax-preferred status. Expanding upon the statute,  regulations later provided that in the absence of participant instructions,  plans could opt to also transfer balances of $1,000 or less into forced- transfer IRAs.

To achieve this, DOL narrowly wrote the investment  guidance portion of the forced-transfer IRA safe harbor regulations to  effectively limit providers to holding the funds in money market funds,  certificates of deposit, or assets with similarly low investment risk typically  deemed appropriate for holding money for a short term. While such  conservative investments generally ensure that the money is liquid (that  is, available to the owner upon demand for cash-out, transfers to another  account, or reinvestment elsewhere), they can result in a low return and  potentially minimal growth over time.", "Most forced-transfer IRA balances in accounts we analyzed will decrease  if not transferred out of forced-transfer IRAs and reinvested, because the  fees charged to the forced-transfer IRAs often outpace the low returns  earned by the conservative investments prescribed by DOL\u2019s safe harbor  regulations. In recent years, the typical forced-transfer IRA investment,  such as a money market account, has earned almost no return. For  example, taxable money market funds averaged 1.45 percent for the 10  years ending July 31, 2014. We collected forced-transfer IRA account  information from 10 forced-transfer IRA providers, including information  about the fees they charged, the default investments used, and the  returns obtained (prior to these fees). Among those 10, there were 19  different combinations of fees and returns, as some providers offered  more than one combination for their forced-transfer IRA contracts. The  typical investment return for the 19 different forced-transfer IRA  combinations ranged from 0.01 percent to 2.05 percent. A low return  coupled with administrative fees, ranging from $0 to $100 or more to  open the account and $0 to $115 annually, can steadily decrease a  comparatively small stagnant balance. Using the forced-transfer IRA fee  and investment return combinations, we projected the effects on a $1,000  balance over time. While projections for different fees and returns show  balances decreasing at different rates, generally the dynamic was the  same: small accounts with low returns and annual fees decline in value,  often rapidly.

Among the 19 combinations  we analyzed, our analysis showed an average decrease in a $1,000  account balance of about 25 percent over just 5 years. The rate of  investment return needed to ensure a forced-transfer IRA balance does  not lose real value varies depending on the rate of inflation and the fees  charged.

We also projected the remaining  balance assuming a 15-year average return for money market funds,  which is 1.89 percent, and found no material difference in the result.  Using that return the balance significantly decreased over time, leaving a  $67 balance after 30 years.", "According to DOL officials, the agency has the flexibility under current law  to expand the safe harbor investment options for forced-transfer IRAs, but  currently its regulations do not permit those accounts to be invested in the  same funds allowed for participants automatically enrolled in 401(k)  plans.

For instance, DOL officials told us that many  small plans fail to file an updated or final Form 5500, which would include  a valuable piece of information, an employer identification number, which  can be used to track a new plan resulting from a merger. In the event of  a plan termination, the plan administrator may file Form 5310, a request  for a determination letter on a plan\u2019s qualified status, with the IRS, but  must provide participants an \u201cNotice to Interested Parties\u201d notifying them  of their right to comment on the plan termination. In certain instances of a  company spinoff, only the plan that was in existence before the spinoff is  required to file a Form 5310-A, making it difficult to trace the new plan  back to the original plan. We recently reported that this notice confuses  participants and it is difficult for the average pension plan participant to  exercise their right to comment.

Even with the information  participants received while still active in plans or at separation, they then  have to figure out which agencies and private sector entities to contact to  find their accounts. Former employers and record keepers have  information participants may need, but participants will need to have  stayed in contact with their former employers to get that information.  Federal agencies may also have some of the information that participants  may need. However, the information that agencies provide is not  designed to help participants keep track of multiple accounts or to find  lost accounts. Consequently, participants searching for their accounts  from former employers may have incomplete information. Moreover, if  participants kept the notices and statements sent to them, the information  they need may be out of date and located in multiple documents.

Although the  same information is reported on each form and SSA houses the data for  years, the data are not compiled for ease of use by the recipient or for  efficiency and cost-savings by the agency. Agency officials explained that  in the past people worked for one company for most of their lives and  were more likely to have had a traditional defined benefit pension plan,  and consequently the format of the Notice only allows for data from one  employer. Because the Notice is not currently formatted to display  consolidated data on potential benefits from multiple employers,  information on benefits from each employer must be sent separately to  the participant. Given that many individuals will change jobs often  throughout their working life, they can therefore expect to receive several  different Notices, adding to the number of disclosures, communications,  and notices they are expected to review, understand, and consider in  managing their retirement savings. Combining multiple Notices could  simplify the process of managing multiple forms for people with more than  one account and reduce the costs to SSA.", "More widely known, SSA also sends individuals a Social Security  Statement (Statement) that estimates Social Security retirement  benefits\u2014at different claiming ages, and displays a worker\u2019s earnings  history.

This information is also available online to  anyone who establishes an account. Similar to the Notice, the Statement  contains important information about an individual\u2019s potential retirement  income. Together these documents give individuals a more complete  understanding of their income in retirement. SSA also has earnings  recorded by employer, which is available upon request, but it is not  mailed to individuals or available online. The earnings record for each  year could provide clues as to when certain periods of employment  occurred, which is key information that industry professionals suggest  individuals looking for their lost 401(k) plan accounts should have when  conducting a search.", "Given the multiple Notices individuals can receive from SSA, in addition  to the Statement, finding a way to reduce duplication can help individuals  keep track of their accounts and locate missing accounts. SSA has a  process in place to review and revise the Statement and the agency  already stores all of the data published in the Notice.

If participants are reminded of their inactive 401(k)  plan accounts via the Notice and prompted to inform plans of updated  address information, the accounts may be less likely to become lost.  Making the information available online or mailing it every 5 years can  remind participants of the multiple accounts they have. Providing the  combined information on inactive accounts from multiple employers can  also give individuals needed information to keep track of their multiple  accounts and provide the opportunity to correct inaccurate account  information.

The current state of financial literacy in the  United States and the field of behavioral economics suggest that this kind  of participant engagement should not be expected.

Changing  the law so that active plans can no longer force-transfer accounts with  balances over $5,000 by disregarding rollovers can extend current  protections to all accounts of that size, while at the same time continuing  to provide plans relief from maintaining small, inactive accounts.  Regardless of the size of the balance that is transferred into a forced- transfer IRA, one way to partially mitigate the problems with these  accounts is to broaden the investment options for these accounts from  the limited conservative menu currently available. DOL can take steps to  expand the menu of investment options available under its safe harbor  regulations, to include alternatives similar to those available to  automatically enrolled 401(k) plan participants.

Our projection in figure 2, p.13, showing the effect of returns from  a money market investment versus a target date fund investment on a  small balance over 30 years used 10-year mean returns for these  investments. Given that the safe harbor for these accounts was issued 10  years ago in 2004, we feel a 10-year average is more appropriate and  accurately reflects the returns earned. However, using a longer time  period does not materially change our conclusions.

SSA noted that the agency has no firsthand legal or operational  knowledge of pension plans or the private pension system and should not  be in a position of responding to questions of that nature or about ERISA,  which it considered to be outside the scope of SSA\u2019s mission. We agree  with SSA\u2019s view about providing information or advice about private  pension plans generally. However, as SSA noted, the Notice of Potential  Private Retirement Benefit Information (referred to as the \u201cERISA notice\u201d  in SSA\u2019s letter) already directs recipients to contact DOL with any  questions.

SSA also  stated that there is no interface between potential private retirement  information and Social Security benefits. However, as noted in our report  on page 31, SSA already stores the potential vested benefits data and  provides the information in the Statement. Consolidating the two types of  information and making it available every 5 years can provide participants  with timely and adequate information to keep track of all of their work  place retirement accounts and could possibly lead to administrative  efficiencies. Therefore, it may be appropriate for SSA to explore its  concern about its legal authority to expend appropriated funds to disclose  information that it already provides to the relevant beneficiary, on a more  frequent basis and in a more consolidated manner. We continue to  believe that this recommendation could enhance the retirement security  of millions of Americans, who would benefit from the assistance in  keeping track of their multiple accounts from multiple employers and  becoming more knowledgeable about funds they may be due in  retirement.

Because we found no comprehensive data on the  number of IRA accounts opened as a result of forced transfers or other  data relevant to their use and management, we collected data from a  non-generalizeable group of 10 providers of forced-transfer IRAs about  their practices and outcomes, including three of the largest IRA providers.  There is no comprehensive list of all forced-transfer IRA providers. For  this reason, we built a list of forced-transfer IRA providers through  interviews with industry professionals, a review of IRA market data, and  online searches. Our objective was to create a group that would cover a  large share of assets in the forced-transfer IRA market and represent  both small and large forced-transfer IRA providers in terms of company  size. We reached out to the largest IRA providers by assets under  management, as well as all small forced-transfer IRA providers on our list.  We obtained forced-transfer IRA account data from 10 forced-transfer  IRA providers that represent this mix of characteristics. We also  interviewed plan sponsor groups, 401(k) plan industry groups, research  entities, consumer groups, and six federal agencies (Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau, Department of Labor, Department of the Treasury,  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, Securities and Exchange  Commission, and Social Security Administration) about plans\u2019 use of  forced-transfer IRAs and what challenges individuals and plans face  related to inactive accounts and multiple accounts in the United States.  We also reviewed research and industry literature, relevant laws and  regulations, 2013 ERISA Advisory Council testimony on missing  participants, industry whitepapers on a proposed default roll-in system,  and submissions to the 2013 Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation  request for information related to a tracking system for distributions from  terminating plans.", "To understand what happens to forced-transfer IRA accounts over time,  we constructed projections of what would happen to an account balance  year to year, given certain assumptions. We drew those assumptions  from the actual forced-transfer IRA account terms provided by providers  we interviewed and on which we collected data. We used the account  opening fee, annual fee, search fees, and rate of investment return to  project how long it would take for a $1,000 balance to decrease to zero.  While the range of average balances transferred into forced-transfer IRAs  reported by providers we interviewed was $1,850 to $3,900, we used a  $1,000 balance for our projection to make it easier to observe the  difference in values over time shown in the projection. Appendix III  shows the projected outcome for a $1,000 balance given the fee and  return information reported by the forced-transfer IRA providers we  contacted.", "To determine how forced-transfer IRAs are used, as described in  appendix II, we projected the balance of a typical low-wage worker at the  end of a typical tenure given certain assumptions about savings,  investment returns, and employer matching and vesting policies.  Specifically, we wanted to see if the projected balance would fall below  the $5,000 cap used to determine eligibility for forced transfers. The  projections assume the annual mean wage in 2013 for the service sector  occupation with the most workers, specifically \u201cfood preparation and  serving related occupations,\u201d including an annual raise equal to the  average annual increase in wage over 15 years (1999-2013). For these  assumptions, we referred to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 (BLS)  Occupational Employment Statistics, National Employment and Wage  Estimates. The Occupational Employment Statistics survey covers all full- time and part-time wage and salary workers in nonfarm industries. The  survey does not cover the self-employed, owners and partners in  unincorporated firms, household workers, or unpaid family workers. We  assumed the 2014 median tenure for employed workers in the food  preparation- and serving-related occupations, according to BLS data. We  also assumed that employer contributions, when there were any, were  made concurrently with employer contributions, rather than on a separate  periodic or annual basis. These projected savings also reflect a 6.3  percent investment return, which is the geometric mean of 10-year  returns for all target date funds according to our analysis of data from  Morningstar.com. Target date funds are the most common default  investment for individuals automatically enrolled into 401(k) plans,  according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America\u2019s (55th) Annual Survey  of Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plans, which reflects the 2011 plan  experience. We used optimistic, moderate, and pessimistic assumptions  to project vested balances (see appendix IV for additional details on our  assumptions). To estimate the number and the value of accounts that  could potentially be\u2014but were not already\u2014transferred to forced-transfer  IRAs, we collected Social Security Administration (SSA) data from the  form 8955-SSA. Data on the form 8955-SSA include deferred vested  benefits in all defined contribution plans, including 401(k) plans, as well  as in defined benefit plans, which are not subject to forced transfers. We  assessed the reliability of the data and found that it met our standards,  given our use of the data. We previously reported that data from the form  8955-SSA on potential private sector pension benefits retirees may be  owed by former employers are not always updated or verified over time  and may not reflect later distributions from plans, such as rollovers to a  new plan or cash-outs. We also asked PLANSPONSOR.com to include  questions about plan sponsors\u2019 use of forced transfers in its newsletter,  which is distributed to online subscribers. Respondents to the query  included 14 plan sponsors and 4 third-party administrators/record  keepers. To assess the reliability of the data we analyzed, we reviewed  IRA market data and interviewed IRA providers familiar with forced- transfer IRAs. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report.", "To better understand forced-transfer IRAs, as well as the challenges  people face in keeping track of multiple 401(k) plan accounts, we also  interviewed plan sponsor groups, 401(k) plan industry groups, research  entities, consumer groups, and six federal agencies (Department of  Labor, Department of the Treasury, Social Security Administration,  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), Securities and Exchange  Commission, and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau) about plans\u2019  use of forced-transfer IRAs and what challenges individuals and plans  face related to multiple accounts and inactive accounts in the United  States.

However, workers not actively  choosing a plan may accumulate  accounts in multiple plans selected  by their employers. According to  Australian Treasury officials, many  Australians lose track of their  accounts, especially when they  change jobs, names, and  addresses.

However, The SuperSeeker does not perform  analytical tasks, such as showing retirement outcomes under various  scenarios, according to government officials we interviewed. Participants  who find lost accounts upon searching for them are able to consolidate  them online in a plan of their choice generally within 3 working days.  The  SuperSeeker now allows paperless \u201cpoint and click\u201d consolidation.  According to ATO, nearly 155,000 accounts were consolidated in 2013-14  with a total value of about AUD 765 million.

Before  the legislation, plans had ultimate  discretion over whether or not to  accept a transfer, according to a  U.K. government report, and the  onus for pursuing a transfer rested  on individuals. Regulations will now  be made to automatically transfer  workplace retirement benefits,  according to a U.K. official,  preventing a plan from declining to  accept such transfers.
