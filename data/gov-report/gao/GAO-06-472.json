Because the proposals involved joint construction and service sharing on a scale beyond anything VA had experienced with its medical affiliates in the past, VA did not have criteria at the departmental level to evaluate the proposals on a consistent basis in both locations. In both locations, negotiations between VA and its medical affiliates stretched over a number of years, in part because they were hampered by limited collaboration and communication, among other things. While VA decided against a joint venture in Denver, it has made no decision on Charleston. A VA-MUSC steering group, formed last summer to study the joint venture proposal in Charleston, issued a report in December 2005 that outlined the advantages and disadvantages of different options. The joint ventures proposed in Denver and Charleston present a number of challenges to VA, including addressing institutional differences between VA and its medical affiliates, identifying legal issues and seeking legislative remedies, and balancing funding priorities. For example, capital expenditures for a joint venture would have to be considered in the context of other VA capital priorities. Although addressing these issues will be difficult, the VA-MUSC steering group's efforts could provide insight into how to tackle them. VA's experiences with joint venture proposals in Denver and Charleston offer several lessons for VA as it considers similar opportunities in the future. One of the most important lessons is that having criteria at the departmental level to evaluate joint venture proposals helps to improve the transparency of decisions concerning joint ventures and VA's ability to ensure that the decisions are made in a consistent manner across the country. Another key lesson is that having a strategy for communicating with stakeholders, such as employees and veterans, helps VA build understanding and trust among stakeholders. The following table identifies these and other lessons from VA's experiences in Denver and Charleston."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has maintained  partnerships, or affiliations, with university medical schools to obtain  medical services for veterans and provide training and education to  medical residents. These affiliations help VA fulfill its mission of providing  health care to the nation\u2019s veterans. Today, VA has affiliations with 107  medical schools, including the Medical University of South Carolina  (MUSC) in Charleston, South Carolina, and the University of Colorado\u2019s  School of Medicine\u2014through the University of Colorado at Denver and  Health Sciences Center and the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH)\u2014in  the Denver, Colorado, area. For example, many MUSC physicians serve as  residents at VA\u2019s medical facility in Charleston, the Ralph H. Johnson VA  Medical Center, and UCH physicians do the same at VA\u2019s Eastern Colorado  Health System in Denver. As part of their plans for new medical campuses,  UCH and MUSC proposed jointly constructing and operating new medical  facilities with VA in Denver and Charleston, respectively. Although VA has a  long history of partnering with its medical affiliates for training and  education as well as purchasing medical services from its medical  affiliates, this type of joint venture would represent a departure from VA\u2019s  typical relationship with its medical affiliates.", "In addition to partnering with university medical schools, VA manages a  diverse inventory of real property to provide health care to veterans.  However, many of VA\u2019s facilities were built more than 50 years ago and are  no longer well suited to providing accessible, high-quality, cost-effective  health care in the 21st century. To address its aging infrastructure, VA  initiated the Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES)  process\u2014the most comprehensive, long-range assessment of its health  care system\u2019s capital asset requirements ever undertaken by VA. In  February 2004, the CARES Commission\u2014an independent body charged  with assessing VA\u2019s capital assets\u2014issued  its recommendations regarding  the realignment and modernization of VA\u2019s capital assets necessary to meet  the demand for veterans\u2019 health care services through 2022.  In Denver, the  commission recommended VA build a replacement medical center with the  Department of Defense (DOD) on the former Fitzsimons Army Base in  Aurora, Colorado, which is just outside of Denver. The commission also  noted widespread agreement among stakeholders that the new VA facility  should be located near a new UCH facility, which was being constructed at  the Fitzsimons site. In Charleston, the commission did not recommend  replacing the current medical facility. However, the commission  recommended that, among other things, VA promptly evaluate MUSC\u2019s  proposal to jointly construct and operate a new medical center with VA in  Charleston, noting that such a joint venture arrangement could serve as a  possible framework for partnerships in the future.  In responding to the  commission\u2019s recommendations in May 2004, the Secretary stated that VA  would build a replacement VA medical center on the Fitzsimons site with  \u201csome shared facilities with the UCH\u201d and continue to \u201cconsider options for  sharing opportunities with MUSC.\u201d", "This report discusses (1) how VA evaluated the joint venture proposals  involving its facilities in Charleston and Denver and the status of these  proposals; (2) the challenges that VA faces in sharing facilities and services  with its medical university affiliates in Charleston and Denver; and (3) the  lessons VA can learn, if any, from its experiences in Charleston and Denver  if it moves forward with other partnerships. To address these objectives,  we analyzed agency documents and interviewed officials at VA, MUSC,  UCH, and the University of Colorado at Denver and Health Sciences Center.  We also met with local stakeholders, such as officials from the Fitzsimons  Redevelopment Authority (FRA) in Aurora, the mayors of Charleston and  Aurora, and representatives from the VA employee union in each location  to obtain their perspectives on the joint venture proposals and to obtain  information on local capital asset planning and its impact. We also  discussed the CARES review process and CARES Commission  recommendations with VA officials. We assessed the reliability of the  information obtained from VA, MUSC, and UCH. We concluded that the  information was sufficiently reliable for our purposes.  We also reviewed  GAO\u2019s body of work on VA\u2019s management of its capital assets and on  leading practices for realigning federal agency infrastructure, collaboration  among organizations, and organizational transformations. In September  2005, we also testified before the Subcommittee on Health, Committee on  Veterans\u2019 Affairs, House of Representatives, on the joint venture proposal  involving VA\u2019s facility in Charleston and MUSC. Although we examined the  joint venture proposals for VA\u2019s Denver and Charleston facilities and the  associated studies and planning documents, we did not evaluate the merits  of the proposals.

VA health care facilities provide  a broad spectrum of medical, surgical, and rehabilitative care. The  management of VA\u2019s facilities is decentralized to 21 regional networks  referred to as Veterans Integrated Service Networks (networks). The  Charleston facility is part of Network 7, or the Southeast Network, and the  Denver facility is located in Network 19, or the Rocky Mountain Network.", "To meet its mission of serving the needs of the nation\u2019s veterans, VA  partners with medical universities and DOD. In 1946, VA established a  program to enter into partnerships with medical universities, now referred  to as academic affiliations, to provide high quality health care to America\u2019s  veterans and to train new health professionals. Today, VA maintains  affiliations with 107 of the nation\u2019s 126 medical schools. In addition to  academic affiliation agreements, VA purchases clinical services from  medical schools for the treatment of veterans. Similarly, in 1982, the VA  and DOD Health Resources Sharing and Emergency Operations Act  (Sharing Act) was enacted to provide for more efficient use of medical  resources through greater interagency sharing and coordination. For  example, the VA Medical Center in Louisville and the Ireland Army  Community Hospital in Fort Knox, Kentucky, have engaged in sharing  activities to provide services to beneficiaries that include primary care,  acute care pharmacy, ambulatory, blood bank, intensive care, pathology  and laboratory, audiology, podiatry, urology, internal medicine, and  ophthalmology. Given the importance of these partnerships to VA\u2019s ability  to meet its mission, VA\u2019s 2003-2008 strategic plan includes goals for  sustaining partnerships with medical universities and sharing resources  with DOD.", "VA\u2019s Denver and Charleston medical facilities have long-standing  affiliations with local medical universities.

These  affiliations provide both VA facilities with the majority of VA\u2019s medical  residents who rotate through all VA clinical service areas.  Both VA  facilities also purchase a significant amount of medical services from their  affiliates. Specifically, the Denver facility annually obtains $9 million worth  of services from UCH, and the Charleston VA facility buys $13 million in  services annually from MUSC. The medical services purchased are in such  areas as gastroenterology, infectious disease, internal medicine,  neurosurgery, anesthesia, pulmonary, and cardiovascular perfusion. In  addition to these services, VA also has a medical research partnership with  MUSC for a mutually supported biomedical research facility, the Thurmond  Biomedical Research Center.

In both locations, multiple iterations of the joint venture  proposals have been considered, and negotiations between VA and its  medical affiliates have stretched over a number of years.

In particular, in  correspondence between VA and UCH in 2002, and again in 2004, the  Secretary of VA identified four major considerations\u2014(1) maintaining VA\u2019s  identity; (2) maintaining VA\u2019s governance; (3) balancing and evaluating  priorities within VA\u2019s capital asset program, including the CARES process;  and (4) securing funding. In 2002, a VA taskforce composed of  headquarters, network, and facility officials examined the potential for a  VA-UCH joint facility and identified additional factors critical to the  decision-making process. These factors included maintaining VA\u2019s  commitment to providing health care to meet veterans\u2019 unique needs and  research programs, VA\u2019s aging infrastructure, and the gap between health  care demand and capacity and funding. Another consideration that arose  through the course of negotiations was VA\u2019s space requirements for a new  facility and the associated acreage of land needed and available on the  Fitzsimons campus.

Figure 1 provides a time line of key events in the  negotiations between VA and UCH.", "In 1995, the University of Colorado decided to relocate its Health Sciences  Center campus, including its affiliated UCH, from downtown Denver to the  former Fitzsimons Army Medical Base located in nearby Aurora, Colorado,  which was closed as part of DOD\u2019s base realignment and closure process.  UCH determined that its facility in downtown Denver lacked the space to  accommodate its patient population and that there was little room for  expansion.  The availability of land at the Fitzsimons site offered an  opportunity for UCH to move and expand the size of its campus. When  Fitzsimons closed, DOD turned a portion of the 577 acres the base  occupied over to the U.S. Department of Education so that it could convey  land to public educational institutions. The University of Colorado applied  for and received 227 acres from the U.S. Department of Education, and the  University leased about 55 acres to UCH for its new inpatient and  outpatient pavilions. The majority of the land at Fitzsimons\u2014about 332  acres\u2014was purchased by FRA for $1.85 million. FRA plans to develop a  biomedical research park on this land. The remaining land at Fitzsimons is  owned by the City of Aurora, a private entity, and a nonprofit organization.", "In late 1999, VA officials at the facility and network level and UCH officials  began to informally discuss the possibility of relocating VA\u2019s Denver  medical center to the Fitzsimons campus. UCH and VA officials were  concerned that UCH\u2019s move to Fitzsimons, about 6 miles from its  downtown Denver location, would strain their affiliation because of the  amount of time it would take doctors to travel between the facilities. The  UCH president also suggested that colocating the UCH and VA medical  center at Fitzsimons could achieve cost efficiencies through integrating  inpatient activities, such as medical and surgical specialty labs, and sharing  some patient treatment. In considering a possible joint venture, facility and  network VA officials worked with UCH officials to examine options for  moving VA\u2019s medical center to the Fitzsimons campus as well as sharing  services and facilities with UCH. In particular, these officials jointly funded  a study to determine the feasibility and cost of different options, including  constructing free-standing facilities with limited sharing to jointly  constructing and operating a new fully-integrated facility at Fitzsimons.  The study, completed in 2001, concluded that a fully integrated, or joint,  facility was the most cost-effective option. A second study commissioned  by VA\u2019s Network 19 in 2002 also analyzed a range of options, including a  joint VA-UCH facility; but this study did not recommend which option to  pursue. These studies were shared with VA\u2019s central office, veteran service  organizations, and the Congress, and became the basis of the joint venture  proposal and negotiations.", "The Secretary of VA established a task force to examine the joint venture  proposal to integrate the Denver medical center and UCH on the  Fitzsimons campus in July 2002. The task force was composed of VA  officials at the departmental, network, and facility levels. In September  2002, the task force issued a draft report, which examined seven  alternatives\u2014ranging from maintaining the status quo to constructing a  fully integrated facility with UCH. The task force\u2019s report presented  advantages and disadvantages of each alternative. It did not recommend  which alternative to pursue.", "In September 2002, the president of UCH sent a letter to the Secretary of VA  asking that VA make a decision within 1 year regarding moving the VA  facility to the Fitzsimons campus. In October 2002, the Secretary  responded that VA could not commit to a joint UCH-VA hospital within that  time frame. The Secretary indicated that a number of important questions  remained unanswered, including how the joint hospital would be governed.  Furthermore, he noted that the proposal to relocate the Denver medical  center to Fitzsimons had to be evaluated in the context of the CARES  Commission report, which was not scheduled to be completed until the  following year.  The Secretary\u2019s response effectively ended discussions  about constructing and operating a fully-integrated facility with UCH.", "In January 2003, VA began developing a proposal for a joint VA-DOD facility  on the Fitzsimons campus. Specifically, the proposed joint federal facility  would house VA and DOD, and the two entities would share some medical  services and equipment. The joint VA-DOD facility, which was referred to  as the federal tower, would be built on UCH-leased land at Fitzsimons and  would be connected to UCH\u2019s inpatient pavilion by a 2-story clinical facility.  (See fig. 2.)  The clinical facility would house operating rooms, imaging,  and pathology laboratories, among other things, that would be shared by  VA, UCH, and DOD. With this concept in hand, VA, UCH, and DOD began  discussions about the availability of land adjacent to the UCH inpatient  pavilion for the federal tower. In August 2004, the UCH president estimated  that 18 acres of land was available adjacent to the UCH facility for the  federal tower. However, soon thereafter, a survey of the land indicated that  approximately 12 acres were available for the federal tower once  easements and setbacks were taken into account.", "In December 2004, in a letter to UCH, the Secretary stated that the  approximate 12 acres would be insufficient to meet VA\u2019s space  requirements for a new medical center. Specifically, the Secretary stated  that predesign planning for the new facility revealed that VA needed  approximately 1.46 million square feet to meet the specialized needs of  veterans and DOD patients. To accommodate these space requirements,  VA\u2019s architectural firm outlined three design options\u2014ranging from a 6- story VA hospital on 38 acres to a 8- to 10-story VA hospital on 20 acres.  Based on this analysis and other considerations, the Secretary concluded  that VA needed about 38 acres on the Fitzsimons campus for the joint VA- DOD facility. This decision ended negotiations over building the federal  tower on UCH-leased land and connecting it to UCH\u2019s inpatient pavilion  with a clinical facility. UCH subsequently decided to use the land adjacent  to the inpatient pavilion for other purposes.", "After land negotiations with UCH ended, VA officials began looking for a  new location on the Fitzsimons site for a stand-alone VA medical center.  The conference report accompanying VA\u2019s appropriation act for fiscal year  2004 directed VA to continue efforts to \u201cco-locate the Denver VA medical  center with \u2026  at the Fitzsimons campus.\u201dWhile there is no  statutory requirement to locate the VA medical center at Fitzsimons, VA  considers this language in the conference report to express the will of  Congress and, as a result, has gone forward with efforts to purchase  property from FRA for such a purpose.  In July 2005, VA signed a  memorandum of understanding with FRA to set forth the conditions under  which VA and FRA will proceed with discussions that may lead to the  purchase and conveyance of about 40 acres located on the southeast  corner of the Fitzsimons campus.  (See fig. 3.)  According to FRA officials,  this piece of land is currently owned by FRA and three other entities.  According to a VA official, in February 2006, VA offered FRA $16.50 per  square foot for the FRA-owned portion of the land. (VA is in the process of  surveying the land to determine the total square footage.)   The VA official  responsible for the land negotiations at Fitzsimons told us that VA\u2019s offer is  valid for 6 months, and that VA expects to finalize the purchase of the FRA- owned portion of the land by the end of this fiscal year. VA is currently  negotiating with the other three land-holding entities about the purchase of  their land. According to the VA official, he does not foresee any \u201cshow  stoppers\u201d in the negotiations with these three entities, and therefore VA  expects to reach agreement with these entities in the coming months.", "Negotiations between VA and UCH on the different joint venture proposals  were hampered by a lack of VA leadership buy-in and miscommunication.  For instance, although VA officials at the facility and network levels  worked with UCH officials in developing the joint facility proposal, the  current network director told us that the Secretary was never fully  supportive of this concept. Rather, according to the network director, the  Secretary envisioned a stand-alone facility adjacent to the UCH complex.  When VA decided to pursue a stand-alone facility, UCH officials said they  felt as though they had been misled by VA officials, including the Secretary,  about VA\u2019s interest in a joint facility. Further, in a correspondence from the  UCH president to VA in 2004, the UCH president noted that a freestanding  VA medical center on the Fitzsimons campus was never discussed. UCH  officials also told us that at no time did UCH ever consider a freestanding  facility for VA on its new campus because there would be limited  opportunities for sharing capital and operating costs. In addition, there was  miscommunication about the amount of land available for a federal tower  and VA\u2019s space requirements. Specifically, UCH officials told VA officials  that there were about 18 acres available for the federal tower; however, the  survey revealed that only a little more than 12 acres were available. In  addition, in December 2004, the Secretary of VA informed UCH that VA  needed 1.46 million square feet for its new facility. According to UCH  officials, these space requirements ran counter to estimates that were  discussed with VA facility and network level officials and, according to the  UCH president in 2004, would result in a facility that was about 50 percent  larger than the existing VA medical center in Denver.

Under  MUSC\u2019s proposal, VA would vacate its current facility and move to a new  facility located on MUSC property. MUSC also indicated that sharing  medical services would be a component of the joint venture. Although VA  and MUSC currently share some services, the joint venture proposal,  according to MUSC officials, would have increased the level of sharing of  medical services and equipment, thereby creating cost savings for both VA  and MUSC.", "To meet the needs of a growing and aging patient population, MUSC has  undertaken a multiphase construction project to replace its aging medical  campus. Construction on the first phase began in October 2004. Phase I  includes the development of a 4-story diagnostic and treatment building  and a 7-story patient hospitality tower, providing an additional 641,000  square feet in clinical and support space.  Phase I also includes the  construction of an atrium connecting the two buildings, a parking  structure, and a central energy plant. Initial plans for phases II through V  include diagnostic and treatment space and patient bed towers. According  to MUSC officials, as of September 2005, there are approximately 24  months remaining for the planning of phase II. As shown in figure 5, phases  IV and V would be built on VA property. In particular, phase V would be  built on the site of VA\u2019s existing medical center.", "In response to MUSC\u2019s proposal, VA formed an internal workgroup  composed of officials primarily from VA\u2019s Network 7 to evaluate MUSC\u2019s  proposal. The workgroup analyzed the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of  the proposal and issued a report in March 2003, which outlined three other  options available to VA: replacing the Charleston facility at its present  location, replacing the Charleston facility on land presently occupied by  the Naval Hospital in Charleston, or renovating the Charleston facility. The  workgroup concluded that it would be more cost-effective to renovate the  current Charleston facility than to replace it with a new facility. This  conclusion was based, in part, on the cost estimates for constructing a new  medical center. In April 2003, the Secretary of VA sent a response to the  president of MUSC, which stated that if VA agreed to the joint venture, it  would prefer to place the new facility in phase III\u2014which is north of phase  I\u2014to provide better street access for veterans. (See fig. 6 for MUSC\u2019s  proposal and VA\u2019s counterproposal.) In addition, the Secretary indicated  that MUSC would need to provide a financial incentive for VA to participate  in the joint venture. Specifically, MUSC would need to make up the  difference between the estimated life-cycle costs of renovating the  Charleston facility and building a new medical center\u2014which VA estimated  to be about $85 million\u2014through negotiations or other means. The  Secretary stated that if these conditions could not be met, VA would prefer  to remain in its current facility.", "The MUSC president responded to VA\u2019s counterproposal in an April 2003  letter to the Secretary of VA. In the letter, the MUSC president stated that  MUSC was proceeding with phase I of the project and that the joint venture  concept could be pursued during later phases of construction. The letter  did not specifically address VA\u2019s proposal to locate the new facility in phase  III, or the suggestion that MUSC would need to provide some type of  financial incentive for VA to participate in the joint venture. To move  forward with phase I, the MUSC president stated that MUSC would like to  focus on executing an enhanced-use lease (EUL) for Doughty Street.", "Although MUSC owns most of the property that will be used for phases I  through III, Doughty Street is owned by VA and serves as an access road to  the Charleston facility and parking lots. The planned facility for phase I  would encompass Doughty Street. (See fig. 7.) Therefore, MUSC could not  proceed with phase I\u2014as originally planned\u2014until MUSC secured the  rights to Doughty Street. To help its medical affiliate move forward with  construction, VA executed an EUL agreement with MUSC in May 2004 for  use of the street. According to the terms of the EUL, MUSC will pay VA  $342,000 for initial use of the street and $171,000 for each of the following 8  years.", "To facilitate negotiations on the joint venture proposal, a congressional  delegation visited Charleston to meet with VA and MUSC officials to  discuss the joint venture proposal on August 1, 2005. After this visit, VA and  MUSC agreed to jointly examine key issues associated with the joint  venture proposal. Specifically, VA and MUSC established the Collaborative  Opportunities Steering Group (steering group). The steering group is  composed of five members from VA, five members from MUSC, and a  representative from DOD, which is also a stakeholder in the facility health  care market. The steering group chartered four workgroups:  The governance workgroup examined ways of establishing  organizational authority within a joint venture between VA and MUSC,  including shared medical services.", "The clinical service integration workgroup identified medical services  provided by VA and MUSC and opportunities to integrate or share these  services.", "The legal workgroup reviewed federal and state authorities (or  identified the lack thereof) and legal issues relating to a joint venture  with shared medical services.", "The finance workgroup provided cost estimates and analyses relating to  a joint venture with shared medical services.", "The steering group and workgroups were intended to help VA and MUSC  determine if the joint venture proposal would be mutually beneficial. On  December 7, 2005, the steering group issued its final report to the Under  Secretary for Health and to the president of MUSC. According to the report,  the steering group concluded that the most advantageous options were  those that provide a revenue stream for VA and provide MUSC access to  new space without capital financing. Therefore, the group explored  construction models that incorporated benefits to both organizations that  included taking advantage of VA\u2019s access to capital financing and access to  MUSC revenue streams. As shown in table 3, the report identifies six  planning models, ranging from constructing a new medical facility with  space for VA and MUSC, to sharing that could occur with VA maintaining its  existing facility. Four of the models\u2014A, A-1, A-2, and B\u2014include varying  levels of shared space between VA and MUSC. These four models also call  for VA to overbuild the facility\u2014that is, build it bigger than VA needs\u2014and  lease the excess space to MUSC, thus providing VA with a revenue stream  to offset some of the cost of construction. The amount of excess space  built and leased by VA varies among the four models. Any option pursued  that involves VA building a new medical facility over-capacity for the  purpose of leasing the underutilized space requires close scrutiny, since  real estate leasing agreements are currently not part of its mission. In  addition, such options would also require specific congressional  authorization and appropriation since the costs of any of the planning  models identified would exceed $7 million, the threshold for such action.", "The steering group\u2019s December 2005 report does not recommend an option  that VA should pursue. Rather, the report outlines the perceived advantages  and disadvantages, as well as the costs, of each option.  (See app. I for the  advantages, disadvantages, and costs of the different models.)  However,  the report does note that two options were rejected by steering group  members. In particular, the finance workgroup rejected Model A-2\u2014which  included an oversized new VA medical center and separate buildings for  administrative and clinical services\u2014because, among other things, the  construction of a separate building to house administrative services was  not cost-effective.  Additionally, MUSC deemed Model B\u2014which included a  replacement VA medical center with moderate excess space to lease to  MUSC\u2014not to be a viable option because it did not meet its total bed  replacement needs.  Although the report identifies options that provide a  revenue stream for VA, the report notes that there is not sufficient revenue  or cost avoidance in any of the models for VA to achieve a 30-year payback  on the construction investment. According to VA officials, the next step is  for the Capital Asset Board of the Veterans Health Administration to make  a recommendation regarding the options contained in the report.

In particular, before August 2005, VA and MUSC had  not exchanged critical information that would help facilitate negotiations.  For instance, MUSC did not clearly articulate to VA how replacing the  Charleston facility, rather than renovating it, would improve the quality of  health care services for veterans or benefit VA. MUSC officials had  generally stated that sharing services and equipment would create  efficiencies and avoid duplication, which would lead to cost savings.  However, MUSC had not provided any analyses to support such claims.  Similarly, as required by law, VA studied the feasibility of coordinating its  health care services with MUSC, pending construction of MUSC\u2019s new  medical center. This study was completed in June 2004. However, VA  officials did not include MUSC officials in the development of the study,  nor did they share a copy of the completed study with MUSC. VA also  updated its cost analysis of the potential joint venture in the spring of 2005,  but again, VA did not share the results with MUSC. Because MUSC was not  included in the development of these analyses, there was no agreement  between VA and MUSC on key input for the analyses, such as the specific  price MUSC would charge VA for, or the nature of, the medical services that  would be provided.

These challenges\u2014which were identified by VA, MUSC,  or UCH officials as well as previous studies prepared for or by VA, MUSC,  or UCH\u2014include addressing institutional changes for VA and institutional  differences between VA and its medical affiliates, identifying legal issues  and seeking legislative remedies, and balancing funding priorities.  Although addressing these issues will be difficult, it is not insurmountable,  as evidenced by the VA-MUSC steering group\u2019s efforts to address some of  these challenges, as well as by VA\u2019s past partnerships with some medical  affiliates and DOD.", "Addressing institutional changes and differences:  The joint ventures  proposed in Charleston and Denver pose a series of institutional  changes for VA and reveal a number of institutional differences between  VA and its medical affiliate that would need to be reconciled.  Specifically, as an in-house health care service provider with other  departmental priorities, by jointly constructing and operating a hospital  with a nonfederal health system, VA would deviate from its current  health care model. Although VA purchases significant amounts of  medical services from its medical affiliates, the relationship between VA  and its affiliates has centered on providing enhanced care for veterans  as well as training medical school residents and conducting medical  research. According to VA, altering this historical relationship to include  jointly constructing and operating facilities would introduce legal,  administrative, and management complexities that might require  additional authorities. In addition, according to VA and some  stakeholders, a joint facility could diminish VA\u2019s identity by deviating  from a VA medical facility that treats only veterans to one with a mixed- patient population served by providers from different health systems.   Hence, if maintaining VA\u2019s identity is important to VA leadership, steps  would need to be taken to protect VA\u2019s identity in a joint facility.", "Adding to the challenge of expanding affiliation relationships to include  joint ventures involving major capital are inherent differences between VA  and its medical affiliates\u2014from their missions to their funding processes.  For example, in addition to its mission of providing care for our nation\u2019s  veterans, VA is also responsible for supporting national, state, and local  emergency management and serving as backup to DOD during war and  other national emergencies. In addition, funding decisions for both VA and  MUSC must go through several layers of review. VA\u2019s major capital  investments (over $7 million) must be evaluated at multiple levels within  VA and approved by the Office of Management and Budget and by  Congress, while such investments by MUSC must be approved by its  board, and if requiring state funds, by the state legislature. These  differences would need to be considered in any joint venture between VA  and a medical affiliate.", "Identifying legal issues and seeking legislative remedies:  Joint  venture proposals raise many complex legal issues. The specific legal  issues raised depend on the type of joint venture proposed, but many  involve real estate, construction, contracting, and employment. In  Charleston, the legal workgroup identified VA\u2019s and MUSC\u2019s legal  authorities, or lack thereof, on numerous issues relating to each option  considered. The legal workgroup concluded that VA has the legal  authority to pursue any of the six planning models identified but that  specific considerations would arise for each model. For example,  legislative authorization and appropriation are required for any major  VA construction project over $7 million. In addition, while VA is  authorized, under its EUL authority, to lease underutilized real property  for up to 75 years, the authorization does not provide for building a new  medical facility over-capacity for the purpose of leasing the  underutilized space.", "Developing appropriate governance plans:  A venture involving a  jointly operated facility would require the parties to agree to a plan for  governing it. Any governance plan would have to maintain VA\u2019s direct  authority over and accountability for the care of VA patients. In addition,  if shared medical services were a component of a joint venture between  the VA and an affiliate, the entities would need a mechanism to ensure  that the interests of the patients served by both are protected today and  in the future. For instance, VA might decide to purchase operating room  services from its affiliate. If the sharing agreement were dissolved  afterwards, it would be difficult for VA to resume the independent  provision of these services. Therefore, a clear plan for governance  would ensure that VA and its affiliate could continue to serve their  patients\u2019 health care needs as well as or better than before. To address  possible governance issues in Charleston, the steering group  recommended instituting a joint governance council that would include  a nonaffiliated third party to oversee the sharing relationship in areas  other than research and educational activities. The joint governance  council\u2019s decisions would be advisory in nature\u2014and not legally  binding\u2014in order not to undermine the current authority of VA or  MUSC.", "Balancing funding priorities:  VA leadership must weigh joint venture  opportunities against VA\u2019s capital assets and health care service needs  throughout the nation when making funding decisions and  recommendations. VA operates a nationwide health care system for  veterans, including 157 medical centers and over 800 clinics. According  to VA, its capital requirements are significant given the amount of real  property it owns and uses and the age and condition of most of its  facilities. Further, in 2004, the Secretary of VA estimated that  implementing CARES will require additional investments of  approximately $1 billion per year for at least the next 5 years, with  substantial infrastructure investments then continuing indefinitely.  Balancing these competing capital requirements is made more difficult  by the fiscal challenges facing the federal government. Given the size of  the government\u2019s projected deficit, VA, like other federal agencies, could  face constrained budgets in the future, making funding of even high  priority capital requirements challenging.", "Additional challenges are likely to be identified as VA continues to explore  the proposed joint venture with MUSC or other possible joint ventures in  the future. In particular, should VA decide to pursue a joint venture with  MUSC or other medical affiliates in the future, it would likely face  additional challenges during the implementation phase. For example, due  to the inherent differences in the purposes for which VA\u2019s and MUSC\u2019s  information management systems were designed, the systems would not be  compatible. According to MUSC officials, VA\u2019s and MUSC\u2019s computerized  patient record systems are different, and their billing systems are  incompatible. Therefore, at least initially, the systems would not be  integrated, and parallel systems would need to be implemented\u2014which  could result in added costs in terms of staff time and raise the potential for  errors."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA\u2019s Current Sharing Arrangements with Medical Affiliates and DOD Could Be Instructive As VA Considers Current and Future Joint Ventures", "paragraphs": ["Partnerships with other health providers are not new to VA. For instance,  the Mike O\u2019Callaghan Federal Hospital, an integrated federal hospital  jointly constructed by the VA and Air Force in Las Vegas, Nevada, currently  serves as a model of joint operation and shared medical services.   However, joint ventures of this magnitude with DOD are limited. Further,  VA has not entered into a joint venture with a medical affiliate of the  magnitude proposed in Charleston or Denver. However, there are instances  of significant capital ventures between VA and its affiliates involving high- priced medical equipment. For example, VA\u2019s Western New York Healthcare  System in Buffalo, New York, houses a Positron Emission Tomography  (PET) scanner that was purchased by its affiliate. In exchange, VA  purchases scans from its affiliate for veterans and provides operational and  administrative staff to support the equipment.", "These past capital ventures are on a smaller scale than the joint ventures  proposed in Charleston and Denver, but they could be somewhat  instructive as VA considers current and future joint venture proposals and  attempts to address the associated challenges.  For example, in these past  capital ventures, VA had to ensure that veterans received the appropriate  access to equipment and services, and VA accomplished this through the  terms and conditions outlined in the contract. In addition, VA had to  address governance, legal, and information management challenges in  establishing these capital-sharing arrangements.

It is possible  that more opportunities for similar joint ventures or sharing arrangements  will present themselves in the coming years. In particular, our analysis of  VA data on its major medical facilities indicates that 43 percent of these  facilities, like the medical center in Denver, consist of buildings with an  average age of over 50 years, although some have undergone extensive  renovations over the years. Given the age of these facilities, many of them  may need to be replaced or extensively renovated in the future.  Additionally, disasters, such as Hurricane Katrina, could force unplanned  renovations or replacements. As VA moves forward in making necessary  renovations or replacements throughout the country, there could be  opportunities for joint ventures with its medical affiliates.

VA did not have criteria at the  departmental level for evaluating and negotiating joint venture proposals,  which led to inconsistent evaluations of the Denver and Charleston  proposals. For instance, in Denver, VA facility and network officials  worked collaboratively with UCH officials on the joint venture proposals,  including jointly funding a study to assess the feasibility and cost of various  options.

Although we recognize  that every joint venture is likely to be different, criteria would establish a  framework for evaluating future joint venture proposals. In addition to  identifying the factors VA would consider in evaluating proposals and  indicating how these factors would be measured, the criteria would help  ensure that proposals are evaluated consistently\u2014regardless of location or  officials involved. The criteria would also serve to communicate VA\u2019s  expectations for joint ventures. That is, they would identify what VA is  looking for in potential joint ventures, such as improved medical care for  veterans and reduced operating costs. By documenting and sharing these  criteria with potential partners, VA would help ensure that its positions are  understood from the outset and thus eliminate possible misunderstandings.

The strategy should also encourage communication by  facilitating a two-way honest exchange with, and allow for feedback from,  stakeholders.  A communications strategy can also help ensure that these  groups receive a message that is consistent in tone and content. Sharing a  consistent message with stakeholders helps reduce the perception that  others are getting the \u201creal\u201d story when, in fact, all are receiving the same  information.
