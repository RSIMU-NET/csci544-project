A combination of enforcement and taxpayer service promotes compliance with the tax laws. GAO was asked to (1) compare IRS's proposed FY 2008 budget to prior years' and assess how the new spending initiatives are justified, and (2) describe IRS's enforcement, filing season, and BSM performance. GAO analyses are based on IRS's 2008 budget submission, supplementary IRS data, interviews with IRS officials, and prior GAO reports. Some of GAO's analyses have been reported earlier this year and updated here."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS's budget proposes to increase spending by almost 5 percent to $11.6 billion. The budget proposes shifting a greater proportion of spending to enforcement, continuing a trend since 2004. IRS projects that revenue from the new initiatives will have a relatively small impact on the tax gap--less than one percent of the gap last estimated at $290 billion in 2001. The tax gap is the difference between what taxpayers owe and voluntarily pay. Justifications for the new initiatives varied with some lacking descriptive, cost, and expected performance information. For example, an initiative for improving compliance estimates provided no information on how the budget and staff needed or work to be done were determined. Without such information, decision makers do not have an informed basis for approving and funding the new initiatives. IRS has made noticeable progress in its enforcement efforts including increasing the amount of enforcement revenue collected and enforcement staffing. For example, between FY 2004 and 2006 enforcement revenue increased 13 percent to $48.7 billion. Nevertheless, enforcement remains on GAO's high-risk list. The tax gap has been a persistent problem in spite of efforts to reduce it, as the rate of taxpayers' voluntarily compliance with the tax laws has changed little over the past three decades. To better target enforcement resources, IRS has requested funding to do additional compliance research which GAO has long supported. Finally, GAO has reported on IRS's lack of a data-based plan to improve compliance. Filing season performance in 2007 improved in some areas compared to prior years', but there have been challenges. As of April 20, IRS processed about 104.6 million individual income tax returns and issued 88.2 million refunds. Electronic filing grew, telephone access is somewhat better, and Web site use continues to grow. However, fewer than 4 percent of eligible taxpayers used the Free File program. The latest release of Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), the new tax processing system, was delayed. As a result, millions of taxpayers did not benefit from CADE's faster processing of refunds. IRS recently issued its plan, the Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint, to improve taxpayer service. Despite progress in implementing BSM projects including for CADE and improving management controls and capabilities, significant challenges and serious risks remain. Delays in the latest release of CADE resulted in continued contention for key resources and will likely impact future releases. IRS has more to do to address GAO's prior recommendations such as developing a long-term strategy that would include time frames for retiring legacy computer systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We appreciate this opportunity to comment on the Internal Revenue  Service\u2019s (IRS) budget request as well as its performance in enforcing tax  laws, providing services this tax filing season, and modernizing its  information systems.", "Effective tax administration requires a balance of taxpayer service and tax  law enforcement. To provide enforcement and taxpayer service in fiscal  year (FY) 2008, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has requested an $11.6  billion operating-level budget with about 63 percent going for enforcement  activities and 31 percent for taxpayer service (including operational  support). The remainder includes funding to develop and implement IRS\u2019s  Business Systems Modernization (BSM) program, a multibillion-dollar,  high-risk, complex effort intended to help improve both enforcement and  taxpayer service.", "Although IRS has increased direct revenue collected through its  enforcement programs in recent years, enforcement continues to be  included on our list of high-risk federal programs. This is due, in part, to  the persistence of a large tax gap. IRS estimated the gross tax gap to be  $345 billion for tax year 2001. After late payments by taxpayers and  revenue brought in by IRS\u2019s enforcement efforts, IRS estimates the  resulting net tax gap to be $290 billion.", "The annual tax return filing season is when IRS provides much of its  service to taxpayers. From January through April, IRS processed over 100  million individual tax returns and issued refunds, handled tens of millions  of phone queries from taxpayers, and provided forms and answers to  questions for tens of millions of taxpayers on its Web site. Smaller  numbers of taxpayers were assisted at IRS\u2019s walk-in sites or at sites  operated by other organizations and staffed by volunteers. While it is  always a massive undertaking, the IRS Commissioner stated that this  year\u2019s filing season was high risk for several reasons, including challenges  in implementing the new telephone excise tax refund (TETR), split refund  option (refunds can now be directly deposited to up to three separate  accounts), and several tax law extensions that were enacted in December  of 2006.", "As requested, our objectives in this statement are to compare IRS\u2019s  proposed FY 2008 budget submission with prior years\u2019 spending and  staffing and assess how new spending initiatives are justified, and whether  there are opportunities to reduce or reallocate resources. In addition, our  statement will describe IRS\u2019s performance in three areas: enforcement,  service to taxpayers so far this filing season (including the impact of this  year\u2019s tax system changes), and systems modernization.", "Our analyses are primarily based on the information in IRS\u2019s FY 2008  budget request, supplementary data from IRS, interviews with IRS officials  and other tax experts, IRS\u2019s filing season performance measures and our  past reports on IRS\u2019s enforcement, filing season, and systems  modernization programs. Some of our analyses have been reported earlier  this year, but are updated here. Since sources and procedures for  producing this year\u2019s data have not changed significantly changed from  prior years, we determined that the data we used were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this statement. Data limitations are discussed where  appropriate. Our review of justifications for selected new spending  initiatives used criteria based on our previous work on results-oriented  government and performance budgeting. We selected 6 of the total 14 non- legislative new spending initiatives for review based on certain  characteristics that we believed might affect how they were justified. We  reviewed the justifications to determine whether they included basic  information such as the problem or performance shortfall to be addressed,  work to be done, explanations of estimated costs, and measures and  goals. We reviewed IRS\u2019s efforts to address our prior year  recommendations related to our annual filing season and BSM work. We  performed our work from December 2006 through April 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, we make the following major points:  IRS\u2019s 2008 budget request proposes to increase spending, particularly for  enforcement. The $11.6 billion requested total operating budget is an  increase of $608.8 million (4.9 percent) over the FY 2007 level. IRS  proposes spending a total of $7.2 billion for enforcement, including  operational support. This continues a trend since 2004 of shifting a greater  proportion of spending to enforcement and away from taxpayer service.  The budget submission includes IRS initiatives and legislative proposals to  address the tax gap. However, the expected direct enforcement revenue  (i.e., the amount collected from taxpayers targeted by IRS\u2019s enforcement  efforts) to be gained is small compared to the size of the tax gap. For  example, in FY 2010, after the initiatives are phased-in, IRS expects to  collect an additional $699 million in direct enforcement revenue\u2014or about  one-fourth of 1 percent of the tax year 2001 net tax gap\u2014from added  enforcement staff. Furthermore, the justifications for initiatives varied in  the information they provided, with some lacking basic descriptive, cost,  and expected performance information suitable for assessing them. For  example, an initiative to determine the impact of taxpayer service on  compliance lacked information such as a problem statement and an  explanation of estimated costs. IRS identified savings in the 2008 budget  request, and we identified additional savings opportunities in our past  work including mandating electronic filing for certain tax preparers and  consolidating and retiring legacy information systems.", "Despite progress, enforcement of the tax laws remains on our high risk  list because of the tax gap. The tax gap has been a persistent problem in  spite of a myriad of efforts to reduce it. The rate at which taxpayers pay  their taxes voluntarily and on time has tended to range from around 81  percent to around 84 percent over the past three decades. To be in a  position to more effectively address the tax gap, IRS needs more  compliance research, which we have long supported. IRS has requested  funding to do a rolling sample of audits of individual taxpayer accounts  (small annual samples that would replace larger but intermittent efforts).  While we have concerns about the amount of information provided to  justify the specific request, we have been generally supportive of such an  approach. Finally, we have reported on the need for a data-based plan to  improve compliance. In a recent hearing, the Chairman of the Senate  Finance Committee asked the Secretary of the Treasury for a more  detailed plan by July 2007.", "IRS\u2019s filing season performance improved in some areas, although there  have been challenges. As of April 20, IRS processed approximately   104.6 million individual income tax returns, and issued 88.2 million  refunds. Electronic filing continued to grow, almost 8.5 percent greater  than last year. Challenges include the taxpayers\u2019 use of the Free File  program which was slightly less than last year and a 2 month delay in IRS\u2019s  latest release of the Customer Account Data Engine (CADE), a modern tax  return processing system that issues faster refunds. As of April 20, IRS had  posted 9.1 million returns by CADE, far fewer than the 33 million IRS  originally planned. As a result, millions of taxpayers did not receive the  benefits of CADE\u2019s faster posting and subsequent refund issuance.  Regarding taxpayer service, telephone access is somewhat better and the  accuracy of IRS\u2019s answers to taxpayer questions is comparable to last  year. Use of IRS\u2019s Web site continues to increase, which is important  because it is available around the clock and is lower cost than most other  types of assistance. Despite the filing season being characterized as high- risk, in large part because of TETR, the impact of TETR on taxpayer  services has been much less than IRS anticipated. Longer term, through its  Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint (TAB), IRS plans to improve taxpayer  services by assessing taxpayers\u2019 needs and preferences. TAB provides  information on the cost per service contact. Having such information  could assist IRS in determining whether it can provide taxpayers services  through lower cost options.", "IRS continues to make progress in implementing BSM projects and  meeting cost and schedule commitments, but two key projects\u2014CADE  and Modernized e-File (a new electronic filing system)\u2014experienced  significant cost overruns during 2006. Future BSM project releases face  serious risks, which IRS is working to mitigate. For example, delays in  deploying the latest release of CADE have resulted in contention for key  resources and will likely impact the design and development of the next  two important releases, which are scheduled to be deployed later this  year. IRS has made significant progress in implementing our prior  recommendations and improving its modernization management controls  and capabilities. However, critical controls and capabilities related to  requirements development and management and post-implementation  reviews of deployed BSM projects have not yet been fully implemented. In  addition, more work remains to be done by the agency to fully develop a  long-term vision and strategy for completing the BSM program, including  establishing time frames for consolidating and retiring legacy systems.", "As we will discuss in more detail later in this statement, we recommend  that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue    have available basic descriptive, cost, and expected performance  information on the spending initiatives proposed in the 2008 budget  submission to the extent that such information has not been provided, and include in future budget submissions, basic descriptive, cost, and  expected performance information on new spending initiatives, with  supplementary documentation available if needed.", "In email comments on a draft of this statement, IRS\u2019s Chief Financial  Officer agreed with the second recommendation, but not the first. She  stated that the FY 2008 budget and justification did provide basic  descriptive, cost, and expected performance information for each  initiative. While we agree that for every initiative IRS provided the total  proposed spending, some initiatives lacked basic information such as on  how the amount to be spent was determined and work to be done. For  example, the initiative for improving compliance estimates provided no  explanation of how the 258 FTEs were determined or basic information on  the work such as the number of examinations to be conducted. Without  such information, at the end of the fiscal year, Congress would be unable  to tell whether IRS spent the money as intended."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS\u2019s Request Increases Enforcement Spending and Identifies Savings, but Provides Limited Justification for Some New Spending, and Other Savings Opportunities Exist", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019s 2008 budget request proposes to increase spending.

Based on the allocation  reported in the budget request, IRS plans to spend a total of $7.2 billion for  enforcement and $3.6 billion for taxpayer service. Including operational  support, IRS is requesting almost 56,600 FTEs for enforcement and about  35,200 FTEs for taxpayer service (an increase of 0.7 percent and a  decrease of 3.7 percent, respectively, compared to FY 2007 levels).", "Figure 1 shows that this continues a trend since 2004 of shifting a greater  portion of spending toward enforcement as compared to service. In years  following passage of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, IRS  made significant progress in taxpayer service, although there were  declines in many aspects of enforcement activities, such as for  enforcement staff and revenue collected as shown in figures 2 and 3,  respectively, later in this statement. However, at FY 2008 requested  levels, total spending for enforcement will increase by over 19 percent  while spending for taxpayer service will decrease by almost 4 percent  since 2004.", "In the 2008 budget submission, IRS proposes a number of new initiatives,  all of which are intended to improve taxpayer compliance\u2014some by  increasing staffing for enforcement or making legislative changes, and  some by improving taxpayer service or infrastructure. The request  includes estimates of the annual costs of the initiatives plus, for some  initiatives, dollar estimates of the increased revenue expected to be  realized, as summarized in table 2.", "IRS recognizes that there are likely revenue effects beyond those shown in  table 2. Table 2 shows, for example, the direct revenue from new  enforcement initiatives. Direct revenue is the amount collected from  taxpayers targeted by IRS enforcement actions, such as audits. However,  the budget submission states that enforcement actions have indirect  revenue effects as well by increasing voluntary compliance by all  taxpayers.", "The magnitude of the indirect effects of enforcement is not known with a  high level of confidence because of challenges in measuring compliance;  developing reasonable assumptions about taxpayer behavior; and  accounting for factors outside of IRS\u2019s actions that can affect taxpayer  compliance, such as changes in tax law. However, several research studies  have offered insights to help better understand the indirect effects of IRS  enforcement on voluntary tax compliance and show that they could  exceed the direct effect of revenue obtained. Given the uncertainty of  estimates of indirect revenue, in its budget request, IRS says that it cannot  measure the impact of deterrence of enforcement or service on  compliance, but only that their effects are positive. Finally, the budget  request also recognizes that the initiatives intended to improve taxpayer  service or modernize information systems are also expected to ultimately  improve taxpayer compliance. Again, however, reliable information about  the magnitude of the improvement is not available.", "Over the 3 years shown in table 2, IRS expects the estimated cost for the  initiatives will decrease while the resulting direct revenue increases. IRS is  requesting about $410 million for FY 2008 to fund all the initiatives, with  the estimated costs declining in FYs 2009 and 2010 because of start-up  costs in FY 2008.", "IRS is projecting that direct revenues will increase by about $2.6 billion in  FY 2010, as more staff are hired, trained, and become more productive,  and all aspects of the legislative initiatives are phased-in, particularly for  the information reporting requirements. However, the direct revenues  expected are small compared to the estimated $290 billion net tax gap for  tax year 2001. For instance, the revenue-producing initiatives are  expected to yield about $699 million in FY 2010, or about one-fourth of       1 percent of the tax year 2001 net tax gap. In 2010, the total estimated  increased revenue from both the revenue-producing and legislative  initiatives, about $2.6 billion, is about 0.9 percent of the 2001 net tax gap.", "No single approach, such as IRS enforcement, is likely to fully and  effectively address noncompliance. Multiple approaches are needed  because noncompliance has multiple causes and spans different types of  taxes and taxpayers. Approaches include devoting additional resources to  enforcement, providing more enforcement tools like information  reporting, improving taxpayer service, periodically measuring compliance,  setting tax gap reduction goals, leveraging technology to enhance IRS\u2019s  efficiency, and simplifying or reforming the tax code. For example,  regarding information reporting, we recently recommended to IRS, that to  assist taxpayers in accurately reporting their capital gains and losses from  securities, in the instructions to Schedule D clarify the appropriate use of  capital losses to offset capital gains or other income and provide guidance  on resources available to taxpayers to determine their basis."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Justifications for Some New Initiatives Lacked Basic Descriptive, Cost, and Expected Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["Justifications for the new spending initiatives varied in the basic  information they provided.

IRS uses its enforcement authority to ensure  that taxpayers are reporting and paying the proper amounts of taxes  through efforts such as examining tax returns and document matching.  IRS seeks to improve voluntary compliance through efforts such as  education and outreach programs and tax form simplification.", "IRS needs better, more continuous compliance research and better  measurements of compliance. We have long been a supporter of such  research, because it can give IRS and Congress an important measure of  taxpayer compliance and it allows IRS to better target enforcement  resources towards noncompliant taxpayers. Taxpayers benefit as well,  because properly targeted audits mean fewer audits of compliant  taxpayers and more confidence by all taxpayers that others are paying  their fair share. IRS\u2019s budget request includes $41 million for improving  tax gap estimates and detecting noncompliance including for a rolling NRP  sample of individual taxpayers and a dedicated cadre of examiners to  conduct audits. Using a rolling sample, IRS plans to replicate the 2001 NRP  study by conducting audits of a smaller sample size instead of larger  intermittent efforts.
