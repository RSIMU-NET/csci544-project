Nearly all of the systems in development have experienced cost growth or schedule delays. These problems have delayed the fielding of a warfighting capability and have resulted in program restructuring, cancellation, or unplanned investments in older legacy ISR systems. For example, problems in developing the Aerial Common Sensor affected three legacy programs, increasing their collective budgets by 185 percent, or nearly $900 million. In many cases, GAO found that the newer ISR programs lacked a solid business case or a knowledge-based acquisition strategy before entering the development process. A good business case requires the manager to match the system requirements with mature technologies and a system design that can be built. This requires sufficient knowledge about the system gained through basic system engineering concepts and practices. Although it fights jointly, DOD does not always procure new systems jointly. Instead, each service typically develops and procures systems independently. Opportunities exist for different services to collaborate on the development of similar weapon systems as a means for creating a more efficient and affordable way of providing new capabilities to the warfighter. GAO identified development programs where program managers and services are working together to gain these efficiencies and other programs that have less collaborative efforts and could lead to more costly stovepiped solutions. For example, the Navy and Army have collaborated successfully on the Fire Scout, but in contrast, the Air Force and Army have not been as collaborative on the Predator and Warrior systems, as they each currently plan unique solutions to their similar needs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the next 7 years, the Department of Defense (DOD) plans to invest  Over the next 7 years, the Department of Defense (DOD) plans to invest  over $28 billion to develop, procure, and modify 20 major airborne  over $28 billion to develop, procure, and modify 20 major airborne  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems and maintain  intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems and maintain  existing systems until the new ones are fielded.

We continue to believe that our  recommendation for an enterprise-level investment strategy with a single  point of accountability for resources decisions is necessary to maximize to  the full extent efficiency and effectiveness in acquiring major acquisition  systems. The Defense Science Board Summer Study on Transformation  reported in February 2006 came to similar conclusions: that the Secretary  of Defense should assemble a small direct-reporting cell to create and  maintain a metric-based, multiyear plan that specifies what is to be done,  when, with what resources, and with what capability output. It concluded  the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics  needs authority over architectures, resources, and personnel. Our other  review efforts of the acquisition and requirements processes continue to  show that DOD has not sufficiently improved the process to ensure cross- service redundancies are reduced or eliminated where possible.

However, as reported in our March 30,  2007 report, Best Practices: An Integrated Portfolio Management  Approach to Weapon System Investments Could Improve DOD\u2019s  Acquisition Outcomes, this system is still not working as planned. Despite  the provisions of JCIDS, needs continue to be based on investment  decision-making processes that do not function together to ensure DOD  pursues needs that are not redundant. The Warrior decision is an example  where the service chose to ignore the recommendations of the Joint  Requirements Oversight Council and proceeded with a unique program.", "DOD stated that its Portfolio Management Experiment supports this  enterprise-level strategy, but it is still a pilot program and actual changes  to the processes have not been identified to show how it will ensure more  responsible and joint decision making for major acquisition programs. As  pointed out in the report, while this seems like a good first step, portfolios  are largely advisory and managers have not been given direct authority to  manage fiscal resources and make investment decisions. Without this  authority, DOD continues to risk stovepiped solutions that may overlap  and not be affordable within available resources. Furthermore, it seems  within the last few years the real input from DOD leadership comes at the  end of the year, right before the budget is supposed to go to Congress. In  December each year a Program Budget document is issued by the Office of  the Secretary of Defense that has included radical changes to major  acquisition programs but without the transparency as to the detailed  analysis and integrated investment planning that should have taken place  to make these major investment decisions.", "In its response, DOD also states that a number of successes have occurred  within the Unmanned Aerial Systems portfolio managed by the Office of  Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics.  While there may be some successful UAS programs, there are also  examples of large, important programs that have significantly exceeded  cost estimates and delivery dates. We believe that having a UAS portfolio  is contrary to the direction of the Quadrennial Defense Review to get away  from \u201cplatform\u201d-based decisions and move toward \u201csensor\u201d-based  decisions. The Battlespace Awareness Functional Capabilities Board, as  part of the JCIDS process, seems to be a more representative grouping of  ISR programs than the UAS portfolio. We believe if properly organized  based more on \u201csensor\u201d requirements, then it would not be necessary to  have both for ISR investment decision making.", "DOD states that we did not consider the department\u2019s ongoing efforts to  develop UAS and ISR Roadmaps that represent, according to them,  enterprise-level strategies. While we did not review these as part of this  review, GAO has ongoing work under a different engagement that is  looking at the ISR Roadmap. The initial conclusions from that review were  presented to the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Air and Land  Forces in testimony on April 19, 2007. GAO testified that the ISR  Roadmap was a noteworthy step in examining ISR capabilities but it does  not represent a comprehensive vision for the ISR enterprise or define  strategy to guide future investments. Furthermore, the ISR Roadmap is  managed by the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence,  while the UAS Roadmap is managed by the Office of the Under Secretary  of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics. This difference  emphasizes the need for a single point for ISR investment decisions within  OSD.", "Finally, DOD states that the report does not recognize ground component  requirements and operating concepts for multiple joint missions and that it  did not recognize the benefits of acquisition programs with unique  requirements or the benefits of competition. We believe the report, as it  relates to the decision to buy a unique platform for the Warrior, did  recognize the difference in how the two services planned to operate the  platforms. However, we do not believe that it necessarily excuses DOD to  buy two different platforms to satisfy the warfighter\u2019s expressed ISR  requirement. Furthermore, we believe it has been the unique stovepiped  solutions of the military services that have over time created unnecessary  duplication and inefficient use of limited defense funding. As to  competition, GAO has consistently expressed its belief that with proper  controls and oversight competition is beneficial to price, reliability,  performance, and contractor responsiveness in buying major weapon  systems.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense and  interested congressional committees.
