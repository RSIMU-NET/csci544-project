The Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) provides funds to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS--the agency that administers Medicare--to safeguard over $300 billion in program payments made on behalf of its beneficiaries. CMS conducts five program integrity activities: audits; medical reviews of claims; determinations of whether Medicare or other insurance sources have primary responsibility for payment, called secondary payer; benefit integrity to address potential fraud cases; and provider education. In this report, GAO determined (1) the amount of MIP funds that CMS has allocated to the five program integrity activities over time, (2) the approach that CMS uses to allocate MIP funds, and (3) how major changes in the Medicare program may affect MIP funding allocations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal years 1997 through 2005, CMS's MIP expenditures generally increased for each of the five program integrity activities, but the amount of the increase differed by activity. Since fiscal year 1997, provider education has had the largest percentage increase in funding--about 590 percent, while audit and medical review had the largest amounts of funding allocated. In fiscal year 2006, funding for MIP will increase further to $832 million, which includes $112 million in funds that CMS plans to use, in part, to address potential fraud and abuse in the new Medicare prescription drug benefit. CMS officials told us that they have allocated MIP funds to the five program integrity activities based primarily on past allocation levels. Although CMS has quantitative measures of effectiveness for two of its activities--the savings that medical review and secondary payer generate compared to their costs--it does not have a means to determine the effectiveness of each of the five activities relative to the others to aid it in allocating funds. Further, CMS has generally not assessed whether MIP funds are distributed to the contractors conducting each program integrity activity to provide the greatest benefit to Medicare. Because of significant programmatic changes, such as the implementation of the Medicare prescription drug benefit and competitive selection of contractors responsible for claims administration and program integrity activities, the agency's current approach will not be adequate for making future allocation decisions. For example, CMS will need to allocate funds for program integrity activities to address emerging vulnerabilities that could affect the Medicare prescription drug benefit. Further, through contracting reform, CMS will task new contractors with performing a different mix of program integrity activities. However, the agency's funding approach is not geared to target MIP resources to the activities with the greatest impact on the program and to ensure that the contractors have funding commensurate with their relative workloads and risk of making improper payments."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1990, we designated the Medicare program as high risk for fraud, waste,  abuse, and mismanagement, in part because of its sheer size and  complexity. Medicare is a federal program that now pays over $300 billion  a year to over 1 million providers to help more than 42 million elderly and  certain disabled beneficiaries obtain a variety of health care services and  items. One measure of the program\u2019s vulnerability is the billions of dollars  in improper payments that Medicare makes each year to providers that  participate in the program. In November 2005, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that administers the Medicare  program\u2014reported that Medicare made an estimated $12.1 billion in  improper payments to providers. To address Medicare\u2019s vulnerability, the  Congress enacted a provision in the Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) that established the Medicare Integrity  Program (MIP). MIP provides CMS with dedicated funds to identify and  combat improper payments, including those caused by fraud and abuse.", "CMS pays MIP funds to its Medicare contractors to conduct five activities  to safeguard Medicare payments. These activities are (1) audits of cost  reports, which are financial documents that hospitals and other  institutions are required to submit annually to CMS; (2) medical reviews of  claims to determine whether services provided are medically reasonable  and necessary; (3) determinations of whether Medicare or other insurance  sources have primary responsibility for payment, which is called  secondary payer; (4) identification and investigation of potential fraud  cases, which is called benefit integrity; and (5) education to inform  providers about appropriate billing procedures.", "Recent events have raised questions about how MIP funding is being used.  In addition to establishing MIP, HIPAA established a fund to provide  resources for the Department of Justice\u2014including the Federal Bureau of  Investigation (FBI)\u2014and the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) to investigate and prosecute  health care fraud and abuse. In 2005, we reported that the FBI could not  adequately account for its share of these funds or demonstrate that its  funds were being used to investigate health care cases. This finding raises  concerns about how CMS is using its MIP funds to conduct its program  integrity efforts\u2014also called program safeguard activities. Further, the  Medicare program is undergoing significant changes that will alter the  nature and scope of CMS\u2019s program integrity efforts. For example, the new  Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit will increase Medicare\u2019s  vulnerability to improper payments.", "You expressed interest in CMS\u2019s efforts to safeguard Medicare payments  and ensure that MIP funds are used effectively. In this report, we   (1) provide information on CMS\u2019s allocation of MIP funds among its five  program integrity activities over time, (2) examine the approach that CMS  uses to allocate MIP funds among these activities, and (3) describe how  major changes in the Medicare program may affect MIP funding  allocations.", "In preparing this report, we interviewed CMS officials about their  allocation of MIP funds among the five activities for fiscal years 1997  through 2005 and reviewed allocations of MIP funds to the five activities.  We also reviewed related financial and other documentation, including  budget, expenditure, and savings data for fiscal years 1997 through 2005,  and budget proposals for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Because most MIP  expenditures are for activities related to Medicare Parts A and B, our  analysis focused on those expenditures; however, we also collected some  information about CMS\u2019s planned MIP expenditures for the new  prescription drug benefit (Part D). In addition, the Deficit Reduction Act of  2005 (DRA), which was enacted in February 2006, established an  additional activity under MIP and provided $12 million in funding for this  activity in fiscal year 2006.

We did not independently examine the internal and  automated data processing controls for CMS systems from which we  obtained data used in our analyses, but we reviewed selected data for  internal consistency and accuracy. CMS subjects its data to different levels  of review and conducts periodic examinations of selected systems and  controls over the data. The agency uses these data to support its  management and budgetary decisions and expend funds to contractors.  Therefore, we considered the data to be reliable for the purposes of our  review. In addition, we interviewed CMS officials regarding changes in  Medicare contracting that may affect MIP funding allocations,  performance measures, and contractors\u2019 evaluations, and reviewed related  agency documents.

The level of funding  available for program integrity activities was constrained, not only by the  need to fund ongoing Medicare program operations\u2014such as the costs for  processing medical claims, but also by budget procedures imposed under  the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990. In the early and mid-1990s, we  reported that such funding constraints had reduced Medicare contractors\u2019  ability to conduct audits and review medical claims. HHS advocated for a  dedicated and stable amount of program integrity funding outside of the  annual appropriations process, so that CMS and its contractors could plan  and manage the function on a multiyear basis.

CMS increased its allocation for provider  education by about 590 percent from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year  2005. This increase was due, in part, to CMS\u2019s decision in fiscal year 2002  to use MIP funds for outreach activities to groups of like providers, which  had not previously been funded through MIP. CMS will be able to further  increase expenditures for program integrity in fiscal year 2006. In addition  to the maximum of $720 million originally appropriated under HIPAA for  fiscal year 2006, DRA increased the maximum by an additional   $112 million, for a total of $832 million.

In 2001, we reported that as CMS increasingly focused on  ensuring program integrity, providers were concerned about what they  considered to be inappropriate targeting of their claims for review.  Further, providers asserted that they may have billed incorrectly because  of their confusion about Medicare\u2019s program rules. To address these  concerns, CMS developed a more data-driven approach for conducting  medical review and also increased its emphasis on provider education.", "CMS officials explained that medical review would help identify providers  that were billing inappropriately, and provider education would focus on  individuals\u2019 specific billing errors to eliminate or prevent recurrence of the  problems. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2002, spending for the  provider education activity increased significantly because CMS began to  use MIP funds for what the agency called provider outreach. Provider  outreach focuses on communicating with groups of providers about  Medicare policies, initiatives, and significant programmatic changes that  could affect their billing. This information is conveyed through seminars,  workshops, articles, and Web site publications. Previously, provider  outreach had been funded outside of MIP, as part of CMS\u2019s program  management budget.

For example, while CMS has noted that benefit integrity and  provider education activities have intangible value, the agency has not  routinely collected information to evaluate their comparative  effectiveness. Furthermore, CMS has not fully assessed whether MIP funds  are appropriately allocated within the audit, medical review, benefit  integrity, and provider education activities.

CMS officials told us that  they may also consider the agency\u2019s high-level priorities. For example, in  fiscal year 2004, CMS began to increase funds to expand the scope of its  annual study to estimate Medicare improper payment rates, and in fiscal  year 2002, it increased its MIP allocation for provider education.", "CMS does not have a means to compare quantitative data or qualitative  information on the relative effectiveness of MIP activities that it could use  in allocating funds. Instead, it calculates the quantitative benefits for two,  and assesses the qualitative benefits\u2014which are not objectively  measured\u2014for the other three. In fiscal year 2005, for its medical review  and secondary payer activities, CMS tracked dollars saved in relation to  dollars spent\u2014a quantitative measure that the agency calls a return on  investment (ROI).", "Having an ROI figure is useful because it measures the effectiveness of an  individual activity so that its value can be compared with that of another  activity. As of fiscal year 2005, secondary payer had an ROI of $37 for  every dollar spent on the activity, and medical review had an ROI of $21  for every dollar spent. CMS tracked the ROI for audit, but by fiscal year  2002, audit\u2019s reported contribution to ROI fell to almost zero. (See fig. 5  and app. II, table 5, for additional ROI details.)", "CMS officials told us that the decrease in the ROI for audit was due to the  implementation of prospective payment systems (PPS), under which  Medicare pays institutional providers fixed, predetermined amounts that  vary according to patients\u2019 need for care. Until fiscal year 2001, audits  had achieved an ROI that was generally $9 or more for every dollar spent  conducting them, by disallowing payment for individual costs that should  not have been paid by Medicare under the previous payment method.  Under PPS, CMS\u2019s methods for paying providers changed. However, the  information system that had been used to track ROI began to incorrectly  calculate the savings from audit because it had not been adjusted for the  new payment method. According to agency officials, CMS is implementing  a different way to track audit savings, and an overall ROI. It will focus on  the savings from disallowing items that directly affect an individual  provider\u2019s payment under a PPS, such as bad debts and the number of low- income patients hospitals serve. It will track the amounts related to these  add-on payments actually paid by Medicare to, or recouped from, the  provider after an audit. The difference between the amount paid prior to  the audit and the amount paid after the audit (assuming there has been an  adjustment) would be the savings.", "However, all audit functions do not result in measurable savings. For  example, in its written comments on a draft of this report, CMS noted that  many audit functions funded by MIP do not have an ROI. CMS stated that  these include processing cost reports for data collection purposes,  correcting omissions on providers\u2019 cost reports, implementing court  decisions, and issuing notifications concerning Medicare payments. In  addition, CMS stated that some of these activities are mandated by law,  while others have significant value to the Medicare Payment Advisory  Commission (MedPAC), which is an independent federal commission;  providers; provider associations; and actuaries.", "From fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2005, CMS developed qualitative  assessments of the impact of benefit integrity and provider education.  According to CMS, the agency develops such assessments when the  savings generated by MIP activities are impossible or difficult to identify.  Nevertheless, CMS officials told us that these activities provide value to  the program in helping to ensure proper Medicare payments. For example,  CMS officials said that benefit integrity contributes to the work of federal  law enforcement agencies, which investigate and prosecute Medicare  fraud and abuse. CMS officials also noted that they consider benefit  integrity to have a sentinel effect in discouraging entities that may be  considering defrauding the Medicare program, but this effect is impossible  to measure.", "CMS indicated that trying to measure the results of the contractors\u2019 benefit  integrity activities could create incentives that undermine the value of  their work. For example, counting the number of cases referred to law  enforcement for further investigation could lead the contractors to refer  more cases that were less fully developed. However, other agencies that  investigate or prosecute fraud, such as HHS and the Department of  Justice, keep track of their successful cases, recoveries, and fines to  demonstrate their results. Similarly, CMS could assess the degree to which  each of its contractors had contributed to HHS and the Department of  Justice\u2019s successful investigations and prosecutions.", "In regard to educating providers on appropriate billing practices, CMS may  be missing opportunities to evaluate its contractors\u2019 performance.  Provider education can help reduce billing errors, according to CMS.  However, according to an OIG report, CMS has not evaluated the  strategies used to modify the behavior of providers through education to  determine if these strategies are achieving desired results.", "CMS has noted the intangible value inherent in benefit integrity and  provider education activities, but the agency has not routinely collected  information to evaluate their comparative effectiveness in ensuring  program integrity. Further, as discussed earlier, correct information on  audit\u2019s effectiveness, based on an ROI, has not been available for the last  several years. Consequently, CMS is not able to determine if some of the  funds spent for benefit integrity, provider education, and audit\u2014about  $396 million, or 56 percent of MIP funds in fiscal year 2005\u2014could be  better directed to secondary payer or medical review. Nevertheless, CMS  officials told us that they plan to decrease the allocation to medical review  and increase the allocation to provider education.", "CMS officials stated that they are developing two initiatives that will give  the agency objective measures of the results of the audit and provider  education activities. As discussed earlier, CMS is implementing a revised  methodology for calculating the ROI for audit. In addition, it is trying to  develop information on the effectiveness of provider education. A CMS  official explained that the agency is adding a provider education  component to its program integrity management reporting system.

For example, CMS estimated that the contractor that handled  claims for DME, orthotics, prosthetics, and supplies in a jurisdiction that  included Texas and Florida\u2014two states experiencing high levels of  fraudulent Medicare billing\u2014improperly paid 11.5 percent of its 2004  claims\u2014or $474.9 million\u2014which was a higher improper payment rate  than that of other contractors paying these types of claims. As we  previously reported, our analysis indicated this contractor received almost  a third less funds for medical review per $100 in submitted claims in fiscal  year 2003 than the amount given to contractors in other regions with less  risk of fraudulent billing. Our most recent analysis indicated that the  imbalance in fund allocation did not change in fiscal years 2004 and 2005.  We could not determine the rationale for this allocation beyond what was  historically budgeted for this contractor.", "The amount of medical review funds allocated to individual contractors is  not directly tied to the amount of benefits that they pay, which is a key  measure of potential risk. For example, in fiscal year 2004, one contractor  paid out $66 million in benefits and received about 28 cents in medical  review funds for each $100 in benefits paid. In contrast, another contractor  paid out considerably more in benefits\u2014about $5 billion in fiscal year  2004\u2014and received about 7 cents in medical review funds for each $100 in  benefits paid.", "Further, CMS has not adjusted the amount of funding for individual  contractors to educate providers based on their relative risks. A CMS  official told us that the amount of provider education funding is generally  aligned with the amount allocated for medical review, regardless of the  value of the benefits that the contractor pays.", "Similarly, the amount of MIP funds provided to PSCs is not directly tied to  the amount of benefits paid in jurisdictions for which they have  responsibility for benefit integrity. For example, CMS spent about   $75 million for work performed by PSCs under 13 benefit integrity task  orders. The PSCs averaged about 3 cents for each $100 in paid claims in  the jurisdictions for which they conducted benefit integrity tasks.  However, the amount of MIP funding paid to the PSCs to conduct benefit  integrity activities varied from about 1 cent to about 7 cents for each $100  in claims paid. Further, our analysis showed no clear relationship between  funds provided to PSCs and their responsibilities for conducting benefit  integrity activities in jurisdictions with high incidences of fraudulent  Medicare billing. For example, one PSC received about 4 cents for  conducting benefit integrity work for each $100 in paid claims for benefit  integrity work in a jurisdiction that included Florida, which is at high risk  for fraudulent billing. In contrast, PSCs received the same level of funding  to conduct benefit integrity work in states at lower risk for fraudulent  billing, including Iowa, Montana, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Audit\u2019s Role Has Changed, but Funding Allocations May Not Be Optimal", "paragraphs": ["During the last decade, Medicare has significantly changed how it pays  institutional providers\u2014such as hospitals and nursing homes\u2014that it  audits.

However, these audits can affect a much smaller proportion of  Medicare\u2019s payments under a PPS than audits of costs under the previous  payment method. Given the magnitude of the payment method change,  CMS has not evaluated whether funds within the audit activity should be  further reallocated to potentially generate greater savings to the Medicare  program by addressing the accuracy of reported costs that may be used to  determine payment increases.", "CMS distributes funds to its contractors to conduct certain tasks, such as  inputting data from; reviewing; and, if needed, auditing cost reports  submitted by its institutional providers in order to settle, or agree upon,  the reported costs. CMS\u2019s audit contractors are also required to conduct  wage index reviews and assist with intermediary hearings and appeals of  settled cost reports. For several years, CMS has had a backlog of cost  reports to settle, and the agency has made a priority of reducing the  backlog. Other priorities include more closely scrutinizing those providers  that are still paid based on their costs\u2014such as critical access hospitals\u2014 and conducting required audits.", "For providers paid under a PPS, CMS has shifted its audit focus to the few  items that could affect a provider\u2019s payments if disallowed. These include  bad debt, payments for graduate medical training, and the number of low- income patients that hospitals serve. CMS has also shifted more audit  resources to hospitals because more items on their cost reports can affect  calculations of a provider\u2019s add-on payments.", "CMS does not know the amount of MIP funds that are associated with  audits of different types of providers or specific issues, such as bad debt.  However, in fiscal year 2004, CMS began to separately track some audit  costs, such as those for desk reviews, audits, and wage index reviews.  This provided some information on how audit funds were being spent.  According to CMS officials, tracking the costs of individual audits at a  provider or issue level would be difficult and costly because multiple  issues are audited at the same time and the complexity of individual audits  varies for the same provider type. Nevertheless, more detailed information  on audit costs\u2014such as at the provider level\u2014than CMS currently tracks  could provide it with a better understanding of the value of its current mix  of tasks, particularly if it could associate the costs with the savings from  the audits. This could provide CMS with information on whether it needs  to change the balance of funding for those tasks\u2014for example, whether it  should focus more attention on bad debt or other areas of the cost report  for specific types of providers.", "Further, CMS\u2019s audit function continues to focus on verifying specific  aspects of the provider\u2019s cost report that affect its individual payment.  This type of audit generally addresses a small portion of providers\u2019  Medicare payments, while under a PPS, a much greater portion of the  payments are based on overall industry costs. Each year, MedPAC  advises the Congress on whether the Medicare PPS rates for institutional  providers should increase, decrease, or remain constant. However,  MedPAC generally does not have a set of audited cost reports that validate  the information it uses in its assessments of providers, such as hospitals\u2019  allocations of their costs. According to MedPAC, the current audit process  reveals little about the accuracy of the Medicare cost information. For  example, while CMS audits individual providers through full or partial  audits, it does not allocate funds to audit a panel of providers, such as  hospitals, which could provide a means to highlight areas where cost  reporting accuracy is problematic. Without accurate information, CMS  cannot ensure that payments to hospitals properly reflect their costs and  provide reliable information that can be a factor in determining whether  rates should change or remain constant.", "CMS might find it cost-effective to gather additional information because  audits have the potential to give the Congress better information on  hospitals\u2019 costs. For example, by law, CMS is required to periodically  conduct audits of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) facilities, which care for  patients who must rely on dialysis treatments to compensate for kidney  failure. CMS broadened its audit plan for these facilities to include a  review not only of bad debts, but also to validate the costs of a selected  number of items that are paid through PPS. CMS officials indicated that  their audits of these facilities generated only limited savings, usually  related to bad debts, so they did not consider these audits very valuable.  However, as a result of these audits, MedPAC officials stated in 2005 that  these facilities had a greater margin\u2014or ratio of Medicare payments to   costs\u2014than their cost reports suggested. This information was factored  into MedPAC\u2019s recommendation about the amount of payment increase  needed in calendar year 2007. Setting appropriate payment increases for  hospitals is potentially more important to Medicare than for ESRD  facilities because payments to participating inpatient hospitals  represented about $116 billion, or about 40 percent of Medicare\u2019s benefit  payments in fiscal year 2004. CMS officials agreed that gathering this  information might be valuable, but indicated that they did not currently  have sufficient funding to conduct this data validation in addition to their  current efforts funded as part of audit."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Used Savings Information to Optimize Allocation of Secondary Payer Funds", "paragraphs": ["In contrast to provider education and audit, CMS collects information on  the relative savings from specific secondary payer functions and has used  this information to decide on funding allocations within the secondary  payer activity. CMS allocates funds to, and calculates savings for, about 16  secondary payer functions. Among these functions are (1) a data match  that helps identify instances when a Medicare beneficiary was covered by  other insurance and (2) the initial enrollment questionnaire, which gathers  insurance information on beneficiaries before they become eligible for  Medicare. Within secondary payer, for fiscal year 2005, savings for the 16  functions ranged from less than 1 percent to 49 percent of savings of over  $5 billion for all of the functions.", "CMS officials told us that they have used relative savings information for  secondary payer functions as one factor in determining whether to  increase, decrease, or terminate funding for the functions within this  activity. For example, according to CMS officials, in fiscal year 2005,  savings for one secondary payer function\u2014voluntary reporting of primary  payer information to CMS by health insurance companies\u2014increased by  about 65 percent over fiscal year 2004. Further, savings from this effort  continue to increase. CMS is planning to maintain or expand funding to it.  However, CMS officials said that after confirming their relatively low  savings, they had terminated certain other efforts to identify secondary  payer claims. The terminated efforts included (1) a second questionnaire  sent as follow-up to determine whether a beneficiary who is claiming  Medicare benefits for the first time has other health insurance that would  be responsible for paying the claim and (2) an effort to determine whether  certain trauma codes contained in a claim could indicate that another  insurer, such as worker\u2019s compensation, could be the primary payer."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Future Programmatic Changes Will Affect MIP Funding Allocations", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare program is undergoing significant changes for which there is  little precedent.

CMS\u2019s current allocation  approach\u2014which agency officials characterized as primarily relying on  previous fiscal year funding allocations for each activity, and to each  contractor, to determine current allocations\u2014will not be adequate to  address emerging program integrity risks and ongoing programmatic  changes. In addition, as contracting reform proceeds, CMS intends to  increase its use of MIP funds to reward contractors to encourage superior  performance.

Over the next 10 years, total expenditures for the  prescription drug benefit, which was implemented in January 2006, are  projected to be about $978 billion, while total expenditures for the  Medicare program are projected to be about $6.1 trillion. CMS and others  have stated that the prescription drug benefit is at risk for significant fraud  and abuse. In December 2005, an assistant U.S. attorney noted that the  Medicare prescription drug benefit would be vulnerable to a host of fraud  and abuse schemes unless better detection systems are developed.  According to CMS, the prescription drug benefit may be vulnerable to  fraud and abuse in particular areas, including beneficiary eligibility, fraud  by pharmacies, and kickbacks designed to encourage certain drugs to be  included by the plans administering the benefit. To respond to these  challenges, CMS has selected eight private organizations, called Medicare  prescription drug integrity contractors (MEDIC), to support CMS\u2019s benefit  integrity and audit efforts.", "Because the Medicare prescription drug benefit is in the early stages of  implementation, CMS does not yet have data to estimate the level of  improper payments or information to determine the level of program  integrity funds needed to address emerging vulnerabilities. As a result, it is  not clear whether, in the future, CMS will need to shift funds from  program integrity activities for Parts A and B to protect the Part D drug  benefit from potential fraud and abuse. For fiscal year 2006, $112 million  beyond the HIPAA limit of $720 million has been appropriated for CMS to  support program integrity activities. The President\u2019s Budget for fiscal year  2007 has also proposed additional funds for fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year  2008. CMS plans to use some of the additional funding provided under  DRA for fiscal year 2006 to support Part D program integrity efforts. For  example, CMS plans to spend $14 million over the next fiscal year to fund  efforts by MEDICs to protect the prescription drug benefit by performing  selected tasks, such as analyzing data to identify instances of potential  fraud and abuse. In addition, CMS plans to spend about $33 million on   Part D information technology systems to track data related to beneficiary  eligibility and to collect, maintain, and process information on Medicare  covered and noncovered drugs for Medicare beneficiaries participating in  Part D. See appendix IV for more information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicare Contracting Changes Will Affect MIP Allocations", "paragraphs": ["Another significant programmatic change that will affect future MIP  funding allocations is Medicare contracting reform. MMA required CMS to  transfer all claims administration work, which includes selected program  integrity activities, to MACs by October 2011. CMS plans to transfer all  work to the MACs by July 2009\u2014about 2 years ahead of MMA\u2019s specified  time frame. Contracting reform will affect MIP funding allocations because  of (1) changes in contractors\u2019 responsibilities for program integrity  activities and their jurisdictions, (2) the potential for operational  efficiencies, and (3) increasing use of MIP funds for contractor award  payments.", "The transition to MACs will change some contractors\u2019 program integrity  responsibilities and require reallocation of MIP funds among them. The  new MACs will be responsible for paying claims that were previously  processed by intermediaries and carriers, but CMS has decided that MACs  will not be performing all of the MIP activities that they previously  conducted. For example, PSCs performed medical reviews of claims in  some contractors\u2019 jurisdictions, but this activity will be performed by  almost all of the MACs in the future. Further, contractors\u2019 jurisdictions  will change as 23 MACs assume the work previously performed by a total  of 51 Medicare intermediaries and carriers, within the confines of 15 newly  designated geographic jurisdictions. The PSCs conducting benefit  integrity work will be aligned with the MACs in the 15 jurisdictions. In  some cases, one PSC may be aligned with more than one MAC jurisdiction.", "According to CMS officials, Medicare contracting reform will lead to  operational efficiencies and savings that would mostly be due to more  effective medical review. For example, CMS anticipates that greater  incentives for MACs to operate efficiently and adopt industry innovations  in the automated medical review of claims will result in total estimated  trust fund savings of $650 million for Medicare from fiscal year 2006 to  fiscal year 2011. Having program integrity activities operate more  effectively could give CMS additional flexibility to reallocate some funding  while achieving reductions in improperly paid claims. However, we have  not validated CMS\u2019s estimate, and in our August 2005 report on CMS\u2019s plan  for implementing Medicare contracting reform, we raised concerns about  the uncertainty of savings estimates, which were based on future  developments that are difficult to predict.", "As part of contracting reform, CMS plans to increase its allocation of MIP  funds that are used as award payments to encourage superior performance  of program integrity activities by contractors. Award payments that are  tied to appropriate performance measures could encourage contractors to  conduct MIP activities effectively and introduce innovations, such as  developing new analytical approaches to enhance the medical review  process. Intermediaries and carriers, both of which conduct some program  integrity activities, are currently paid on the basis of their costs, generally  without financial incentives to encourage superior performance. In  contrast, CMS currently offers award payments to other types of  contractors that conduct program integrity activities, including four MACs  that were selected in January 2006, PSCs, the COB contractor, NSC, and  the DAC contractor. As early as 2009, or when all administrative work has  been transferred to MACs, CMS will be offering the opportunity to be  selected for award payments to all contractors that conduct program  integrity activities.", "The usefulness of using MIP funding for award payments to encourage  contractors to conduct program integrity tasks effectively depends on how  well CMS can develop, and consistently apply, performance measures to  gauge differences in the quality of performance. In 2004, CMS conducted a  study to evaluate whether the agency could reduce improper payments by  using award payments for contractors to lower their paid claims error  rates, which represent the amount of claims contractors paid in error  compared with their total fee-for-service payments. According to CMS, the  outcome of that pilot was positive, and CMS plans to use award payments  in the future as part of its strategy for reducing improper payments.  However, as we reported in March 2006, CMS will need to refine its  measure of contractor-specific improper payments, which would enhance  its ability to evaluate their performance of medical review and provider  education activities. Further, even when CMS has developed measures to  assess the performance of contractors that conduct MIP activities, it has  not always effectively or consistently applied them. For example, the OIG  recently reviewed the extent and type of information provided in  evaluation reports on PSCs\u2019 performance in detecting and deterring fraud  and abuse. The OIG found that although the evaluation reports were used  as a basis to assess contractors\u2019 overall performance, they did not  consistently include quantitative information on the activities contractors  performed or their effectiveness."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["We designated the Medicare program as high risk for fraud, waste, abuse,  and mismanagement in 1990, and the program remains so today. To  address this ongoing risk and reduce the program\u2019s billions of dollars in  improper payments, CMS must use Medicare\u2019s program integrity funding  as effectively as possible. Further, Medicare\u2019s susceptibility to fraud is  growing, as it addresses the challenges of adding a prescription drug  benefit to the program. Despite Medicare\u2019s increasing vulnerability, CMS  has generally not changed its allocation approach for MIP funding. In 2006,  a decade after MIP was established to support Medicare program integrity  activities, CMS officials state that the primary basis for their allocation of  funds is how they have been allocated in the past. However, programmatic  changes for Medicare\u2019s contractors and emerging risks for the Part D  prescription drug benefit suggest that CMS needs to modify its approach  for deciding on funding allocations for\u2014and within\u2014the five program  integrity activities. Also supporting the need for CMS to assess its current  allocation approach is that the agency\u2019s funding decisions do not routinely  take into account quantitative data or qualitative information on the  relative effectiveness of its five program integrity activities or contractors\u2019  vulnerabilities. Without considering information or data, CMS cannot  judge whether funds are being spent as effectively as possible or if they  should be reallocated.

CMS stated this quantitative  measure can be an indicator of effectiveness, but noted that such a  measure cannot serve as the sole basis for informing funding decisions.  The agency stated that some of its MIP activities had benefits that could  not be easily quantified. CMS agreed on the value of allocating funds based  on risk and provided information on programmatic changes that would  help it do so. The agency also noted the efforts it had recently made to  strengthen program integrity.", "CMS expressed concern about our discussion in the draft report  concerning the use of ROI as a way to quantitatively measure effectiveness  and to allocate MIP funds. CMS stated that the agency cannot provide  funding based exclusively on an ROI because some activities, including  benefit integrity, do not lend themselves to an ROI measurement and  others, such as audit, are governed by statutory requirements. CMS also  stated that in allocating MIP funds, it is critical that it consider factors  other than ROI, including historical funding, because MIP funding has not  increased since 2003.", "Our report indicates that an ROI is an important factor that should be  considered in allocating funds, but cannot be the sole consideration.
