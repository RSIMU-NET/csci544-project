As you are  aware, in April, May, and June 2002, before the current debt ceiling was  raised to $6.4 trillion, Treasury used its statutory authority to invoke two  debt issuance suspension periods.

Since then, the Congress has attempted to control the size of the debt  by imposing ceilings on the amount of Treasury securities that can be  outstanding.  In February 1941, an overall ceiling of $65 billion was set on  all types of Treasury securities that could be outstanding at any one time.", "The debt ceiling was raised several times between February 1941 and June  1946, when a ceiling of $275 billion was set that remained in effect until  August 1954.  At that time, the first temporary debt ceiling, which added $6  billion to the $275 billion permanent ceiling, was imposed.  Since then,  numerous temporary and permanent increases in the debt ceiling have  been enacted.  Total debt subject to the debt ceiling, as of June 30, 2002,  was about $6.1 trillion.  About 44 percent, or $2.7 trillion, was held by  federal trust funds, such as the Social Security trust funds and the Civil  Service Retirement and Disability Trust Fund (Civil Service fund), and by  the Government Securities Investment Fund of the Federal Employees\u2019  Retirement System (G-Fund), hereafter collectively referred to as Funds.", "The Secretary of the Treasury has several responsibilities related to the  federal government\u2019s financial management operations.  These include  paying the government\u2019s obligations and investing Funds\u2019 receipts not  needed for current benefits and expenses.  The Secretary has generally  been provided with the ability to issue the necessary securities to the  Funds for investment purposes and to borrow the necessary funds from the  public to pay government obligations.", "Under normal circumstances, the debt ceiling is not an impediment to  carrying out these responsibilities.  Treasury is notified by the appropriate  agency (such as the Office of Personnel Management for the Civil Service  fund) of the amount that should be invested (or reinvested), and Treasury  makes the investment.  In some cases, the agency may also specify the  security that Treasury should purchase.  These securities count against the  debt ceiling.  Consequently, if Funds\u2019 receipts are not invested, an increase  in the debt subject to the debt ceiling does not occur.", "When Treasury is unable to borrow because the debt ceiling has been  reached, the Secretary is unable to fully discharge his financial  management responsibilities using the normal methods.  In 1985, the  government experienced a debt ceiling crisis from September 3 through  December 11.  During that period, Treasury took several actions that were  similar to those discussed in this report.  For example, Treasury redeemed  Treasury securities held by the Civil Service fund earlier than normal in  order to borrow sufficient cash from the public to meet the fund\u2019s benefit  payments and did not invest some trust fund receipts.   In 1986 and 1987,  after Treasury\u2019s experiences during prior debt ceiling crises, the following  statutory authorities were provided to the Secretary of the Treasury to use  the Civil Service fund and the G-Fund to assist Treasury in managing its  financial operations during a debt ceiling crisis: 1. Redemption of securities held by the Civil Service fund.  Subsection  (k) of 5 U.S.C. 8348 provides authority to the Secretary of the Treasury  to redeem securities or other invested assets of the Civil Service fund  before maturity to prevent the amount of public debt from exceeding  the debt ceiling.", "Subsection (k) of 5 U.S.C. 8348 also provides that, before exercising the  authority to redeem securities of the Civil Service fund, the Secretary  must first determine that a \u201cdebt issuance suspension period\u201d exists.   Subsection (j) of 5 U.S.C. 8348 defines a debt issuance suspension  period as any period for which the Secretary has determined that  obligations of the United States may not be issued without exceeding  the debt ceiling.", "The statute authorizing the debt issuance suspension period and its  legislative history are silent as to how the Secretary should determine  the length of a debt issuance suspension period.

Suspension of Civil Service fund investments.  Subsection (j) of 5  U.S.C. 8348 provides authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to  suspend additional investment of amounts in the Civil Service fund if  the investment cannot be made without causing the amount of public  debt to exceed the debt ceiling. This subsection of the statute also  authorizes the Secretary to make the Civil Service fund whole after the  debt issuance suspension period has ended. 3. Suspension of G-Fund investments.  Subsection (g) of 5 U.S.C. 8438  provides authority to the Secretary of the Treasury to suspend the  issuance of additional amounts of obligations of the United States to  the G-Fund if issuance cannot occur without causing the amount of  public debt to exceed the debt ceiling.

Each day from April 4 to  April 16, 2002, and from May 16 to June 28, 2002, Treasury determined the  amount of funds that the G-Fund would be allowed to invest in Treasury  securities and, when necessary, suspended some investments and  reinvestments of the G-Fund receipts and maturing securities that would  have caused the debt ceiling to be exceeded.", "On April 4, 2002, when the Secretary determined that the first debt issuance  suspension period had begun, the G-Fund held about $41 billion of  Treasury securities that would mature that day.  To ensure that it did not  exceed the statutory debt limit, Treasury did not reinvest about $13.7  billion of these securities on this date.  On April 16, 2002, the debt issuance  suspension period ended, and Treasury fully invested the G-Fund and  compensated the G-Fund for its interest losses.  The G-Fund remained fully  invested until the start of the second debt issuance suspension period on  May 16, 2002.  On that date, the G-Fund held about $41 billion of maturing  Treasury securities.  To ensure that it did not exceed the statutory debt  limit, Treasury did not reinvest about $9.2 billion of these securities.", "During both debt issuance suspension periods, the amount of the G-Fund\u2019s  receipts that Treasury invested changed daily, depending on the amount of  the government\u2019s outstanding debt.  Although Treasury can accurately  predict the outcome of some events that affect the outstanding debt, it  cannot precisely determine the outcome of others until they occur.  For  example, the amount of securities that Treasury will issue to the public  from an auction can be determined some days in advance because Treasury  can control the amount that will be issued.  On the other hand, the amount  of savings bonds that will be issued and redeemed and of securities that  will be issued to, or redeemed by, various government Funds is difficult to  precisely predict.  Because of these difficulties, Treasury needed a way to  ensure that the government\u2019s Funds activities did not cause the debt ceiling  to be exceeded and also to maintain normal investment and redemption  policies for the majority of the government Funds.  To do this, each day  during a debt issuance suspension period, Treasury   calculated the amount of public debt subject to the debt ceiling,  excluding the receipts that the G-Fund would normally invest;  determined the amount of G-Fund receipts that could safely be invested  without exceeding the debt ceiling and invested this amount in Treasury  securities; and  suspended investment, when necessary, of the G-Fund\u2019s remaining  receipts.", "For example, on May 23, 2002, excluding G-Fund transactions, Treasury  issued about $32.2 billion and redeemed about $29.1 billion of other Funds\u2019  securities that counted against the debt ceiling.  Treasury also issued about  $66.4 billion and redeemed about $56.1 billion of other securities.  Since  Treasury had been at the debt ceiling the previous day, Treasury could not  invest the entire amount that the G-Fund had requested ($41 billion)  without exceeding the debt ceiling.  As a result, the $13.4 billion difference  between the $98.6 billion of securities issued and the $85.2 billion of  securities redeemed was added to the amount of uninvested G-Fund  receipts.  This raised the amount of uninvested funds for the G-Fund from  about $900 million to about $14 billion on that date.  Interest on the  uninvested funds was not paid until the debt issuance suspension period  ended.

The normal redemption policy, which  involves redeeming current-year securities first, was used during the  second 2002 debt issuance suspension period.  For example, when  Treasury redeemed about $4 billion earlier than normal on May 16, 2002,  the securities selected were those that matured on June 30, 2002.  During  the 1995/1996 debt issuance suspension period, the early redemptions were  made from long-term securities that matured about 14 years later.  The  impact between the two approaches on Treasury\u2019s ability to manage the  amount of outstanding debt during a debt issuance suspension period can  be significant when a debt issuance suspension period also includes the  date when securities mature.  This could have occurred during the second  2002 debt issuance suspension period as the Civil Service fund had more  than $45 billion of Treasury securities scheduled to mature on June 30,  2002.", "Should a debt issuance suspension period cover a June 30 rollover date, the  securities selected for early redemption can have a significant impact on  the amount of maturing securities, as shown in tables 2 and 3.", "The amount of maturing securities to be reinvested is important because,  as in the case of the G-Fund, Treasury does not have to reinvest the  maturing Civil Service fund securities during a debt issuance suspension  period.  This, in turn, allows Treasury to take other actions, such as  investing other Funds\u2019 receipts or issuing securities to the public to raise  cash.  As illustrated in tables 2 and 3, the amount of maturing securities to  be reinvested can have a significant impact on Treasury\u2019s debt management  options.  For example, (1) if the Civil Service fund had $48 billion of  maturing Treasury securities and (2) Treasury needed to invest $52 billion  of other Funds\u2019 receipts that could not remain legally uninvested on June  30, by not reinvesting the maturing Civil Service fund\u2019s current-year  securities Treasury could invest all but $4 billion of these receipts (see  table 2).  Treasury would then need to find some other method of  generating room under the debt ceiling in order to invest the remaining $4  billion.  On the other hand, if Treasury had redeemed long-term securities,  then the $52 billion of other Funds\u2019 receipts could have been invested by  simply not reinvesting any of the Civil Service fund\u2019s maturing securities  (see table 3).", "During the second 2002 debt issuance suspension period, Treasury  expected to make about $50 billion in interest payments to the Funds,  excluding the Civil Service fund and the G-Fund, on June 30, 2002.  Had  Treasury redeemed the long-term securities rather than the current-year  securities, the resulting $52 billion of maturing Civil Service fund securities  would have been adequate to fully invest the $50 billion of interest  payments.  This assumes that Treasury would have decided to suspend the  reinvestment of these maturing securities and use the resulting room under  the debt ceiling provided by this suspension to invest the interest payments  to the other Funds.  On the other hand, by redeeming short-term securities,  the $48 billion of maturing Civil Service fund securities available would not  have been adequate to fully invest the interest payments, and Treasury  would have had to obtain $2 billion of debt limit from other sources, such  as the G-Fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accrued Interest Used in Redemption Calculations during Second 2002 Debt Issuance Suspension Period", "paragraphs": ["Treasury\u2019s normal redemption policy is to include the accrued interest on  the security that is being redeemed when determining the amount of  principal that should be redeemed.

The interest payments associated with these  redemptions totaled about $84 million.  However, during the 1995/1996 debt  issuance suspension period, which had a 14-month debt issuance  suspension period, Treasury did not use the accrued interest in determining  the amount of securities that should be redeemed.

It subsequently  reversed this transaction and redeemed current-year securities.", "When Treasury decided to reinvest funds associated with some of the  early Civil Service fund redemptions, it did not include the accrued  interest associated with those funds when they were subsequently  redeemed to pay the June 3, 2002, Civil Service fund benefit payments.   This was inconsistent with a similar reinvestment made on May 17, 2002,  that was redeemed on May 20, 2002, in which Treasury included the  accrued interest in its calculations.", "When Treasury restored the losses incurred by the Civil Service fund, it  misclassified about $1.2 million of principal losses as interest losses.

However, as a result of the restoration policies and  procedures Treasury used during the 2002 debt issuance suspension  period, according to Treasury\u2019s new financial management system, the  amount of the Civil Service fund\u2019s security holdings was about $1.2  million less on June 28, 2002, than it would have been had the debt  issuance suspension period not occurred.  Nevertheless, as previously  noted, the restoration made on June 30, 2002, fully compensated the  Civil Service fund for all losses.", "Although these errors were not significant and were subsequently  corrected as necessary, we believe that had Treasury established  documented policies and procedures and effectively implemented them,  the likelihood of these errors would have been greatly reduced."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["During the 2002 debt issuance suspension periods, Treasury acted in  accordance with its statutory authorities when it (1) suspended some  investments of the Civil Service fund and G-Fund and (2) redeemed  securities earlier than normal from the Civil Service fund.  These and other  actions discussed in this report allowed the government to avoid default on  its obligations and to stay within the debt ceiling.", "Although some of the stated policies and procedures Treasury used to  implement the actions it took on the Civil Service fund during the second  2002 debt issuance suspension period differed from those used in the  1995/1996 debt issuance suspension period, they were adequate to ensure  that the Civil Service fund did not incur any losses after the debt issuance  suspension period had ended and Treasury was able to take the necessary  restoration actions.  However, Treasury\u2019s stated policies and procedures to  be used for the Civil Service fund and G-Fund during a debt issuance  suspension period have not been documented.  Properly documenting the  policies and procedures will (1) allow Treasury management to ascertain  the impacts of these policies and procedures on Treasury\u2019s ability to  manage the outstanding debt during a debt issuance suspension period and  (2) if effectively implemented, reduce the chance for confusion and risk of  errors should Treasury need to use the policies and procedures in the  future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Treasury direct the Under  Secretary for Domestic Finance to document the necessary policies and  procedures that should be used during any future debt issuance suspension  period.  Further, the document developed should clearly state which office  is responsible for approving any modifications to the documented policies  and procedures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, Treasury agreed that  accurate documentation of its policies and procedures is a valuable  objective and said that it believed it was desirable to maintain the  preexisting policies and procedures for the redemption of securities and  crediting of interest to the maximum extent possible.  Treasury said that  maintaining these standards makes the operations transparent and reduces  confusion to the stakeholders of the funds affected by early redemption  activities.  Because it was unclear whether Treasury\u2019s proposed  development and documentation of guidelines for debt issuance  suspension periods would address our recommendation to document the  necessary policies and procedures that should be used during any future  debt issuance suspension period, we held subsequent discussions with  Treasury officials to clarify the department\u2019s intentions.", "Treasury officials were concerned that developing detailed policies and  procedures would limit their flexibility to manage the debt during debt  issuance suspension periods because they believed such situations may  have unique characteristics with distinct circumstances that need to be  addressed.  We explained that our recommendation did not call for  documenting the circumstances under which the Secretary should invoke  specific actions.  For example, we did not call for stipulating (1) how to  determine the length of a debt issuance suspension period, (2) which funds  should be used by Treasury to help manage its operations, (3) when to  exchange securities held by the Federal Financing Bank for securities held  by the Civil Service fund, (4) when to recall compensating balances, or   (5) when to suspend fund investments. On the other hand, we did envision  that such policies and procedures would document how to implement the  actions directed by the Secretary, including (1) how to implement a given  course of action, such as redeeming Civil Service fund securities earlier  than normal, and (2) how to fully compensate a fund for its losses.", "Taken from this perspective, Treasury officials generally agreed with the  need to document the necessary policies and procedures relating to  implementing actions determined by the Secretary.  They did note,  however, that such procedures might need to contain options in order to  maintain the flexibility needed.  For example, the policies and procedures  might have two or more options on how to handle the redemption of Civil  Service fund securities earlier than normal.  Documenting policies and  procedures that contain options would meet the intent of our  recommendation.  As we noted in our report, properly documenting the  policies and procedures will (1) allow Treasury management to better  ascertain the impact of these policies and procedures on Treasury\u2019s ability  to manage the outstanding debt during a debt issuance suspension period  and (2) if effectively implemented, reduce the chance for confusion and  risk of errors should Treasury need to use the policies and procedures in  the future.", "Regarding three instances where the lack of documented policies and  procedures contributed to what we characterized as some confusion and  errors, Treasury did not agree that these instances were errors.  As  discussed below, we continue to believe that errors occurred.", "As a backdrop for this discussion, the recurring theme of our report is that  Treasury did not have documented policies and procedures that should be  used during a debt issuance suspension period.  Based on discussions with  cognizant Treasury officials, it was our understanding that Treasury  intended to apply what it referred to as its standard redemption policies  and procedures\u2014those used in normal daily operations.  In commenting on  this report, however, Treasury stated that it initially modeled its actions  during the 2002 debt issuance suspension period on actions it had taken  during the 1995/1996 debt issuance suspension period but that after further  analysis it decided to instead use its standard redemption policies and  procedures.   The 1995/1996 procedures for redeeming securities earlier  than normal used long-term securities and did not consider accrued  interest in determining the amount to be redeemed.  In contrast, Treasury\u2019s  standard redemption policies and procedures use current-year securities  and consider accrued interest.", "Regardless of which approach Treasury opted to follow for the debt  issuance suspension period transactions discussed in our report, Treasury  did not consistently adhere to either approach and consequently made the  following errors:   When Treasury first redeemed securities earlier than normal, it  redeemed long-term securities and included the accrued interest on the  securities when determining the amount of principal that should be  redeemed.  Although the choice of long-term securities for early  redemption was consistent with the practices used during the 1995/1996  debt issuance suspension period, including accrued interest in  calculating the amount of principal to be redeemed was a departure  from Treasury\u2019s 1995/1996 practices.", "For subsequent redemptions of securities reinvested, although Treasury  used current-year securities, it was inconsistent in considering accrued  interest in determining the amount of principal that should be  redeemed.  When Treasury redeemed the May 17, 2002, reinvestment on  May 20, 2002, it redeemed current-year securities and included accrued  interest in this calculation.  This was consistent with its standard  redemption policies and procedures.  However, on June 3, 2002, when  Treasury redeemed 10 reinvestments, it did not consider accrued  interest.  Instead, the June 3, 2002, redemption followed the practices  used in the 1995/1996 debt issuance suspension period.", "Regarding the third instance, the classification of $1.2 million of losses  incurred, Treasury did not agree that its classification of this amount as  interest losses was in error.  As discussed in our report, the dual set of  accounts maintained by Treasury\u2019s new financial management system\u2014 one that tracks actual debt issuance suspension period transactions and  one that tracks transactions that would have occurred had there not been a  debt issuance suspension period\u2014clearly showed that the principal  balances in the Civil Service fund differed by $1.2 million on June 28, 2002.   As such, we concluded that when Treasury restored the losses incurred by  the Civil Service fund, it misclassified about $1.2 million of principal losses  as interest losses.", "As stated in our report, these errors were not significant and were  subsequently corrected as necessary; however, we believe that had  Treasury established documented policies and procedures and effectively  implemented them, the likelihood of these errors would have been greatly  reduced.", "Specific technical comments provided orally by Treasury were  incorporated in this report as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the chairmen and ranking minority  members of the Senate Committee on Appropriations; the Senate  Committee on Governmental Affairs; the Senate Committee on the Budget;  the Subcommittee on Treasury and General Government, Senate  Committee on Appropriations; the Senate Committee on Finance; the  House Committee on Appropriations; the House Committee on  Government Reform; the House Committee on the Budget; the House  Committee on Ways and Means; and the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal  Service, and General Government, House Committee on Appropriations.
