We noted, however, that Congress has not  explicitly prohibited SSA from considering these factors and we  believe that conducting these studies would put SSA in a better  position to thoughtfully weigh various policy options before deciding  on a course of action.", "SSA has two initiatives to expedite cases for the most severely disabled individuals:  Quick Disability Determination and Compassionate Allowances. Using predictive modeling  and computer-based screening tools to screen initial applicants, the Quick Disability  Determination identifies cases where a favorable disability determination is highly likely  and medical evidence is readily available, such as with certain cancers and end-stage  renal disease. With Compassionate Allowances, SSA targets the most obviously disabled  applicants based on available medical information and generally awards benefits if there is  objective medical evidence to confirm the diagnosis and the applicant also meets SSA\u2019s  non-disability criteria. commissioners told us that simplifying disability policy, such as by  streamlining work incentive and work reporting rules, could also help staff  better manage disability workloads.", "SSA is processing more initial claims annually, but claims denied at the  initial level can be appealed and often result in a request for a hearing by  an administrative law judge. To reduce its hearings backlog, SSA has  used strategies such as hiring additional administrative law judges and  support staff, opening more hearings offices, and conducting more  hearings via video conference. Our preliminary results indicate that,  although SSA completed more hearing requests in fiscal year 2012 than  in previous years, the agency fell short of its hearings completion target  by more than 54,000 hearings, and at 321 days, the average wait time for  hearings exceeded the agency\u2019s target by 41 days.

Furthermore, SSA officials told us that they intend to revisit the IT  strategic plan annually and refresh it as appropriate. Our prior work  indicates that SSA has not always had an updated IT strategic plan to  guide its modernization efforts. In the absence of regular updates, SSA  based its IT modernization efforts on program activities that were tied to  short-term budget cycles and not developed in the context of a long-term  strategic plan.

Many of its programs are written in COBOL, which is one of the oldest  computer programming languages and is difficult to modify and update.  The OIG noted also that the agency risks losing key institutional  knowledge relating to COBOL programming and its increasingly complex  information systems. According to the OIG, SSA has indicated that  modernizing its legacy applications will ultimately reduce operating costs  and improve service delivery. However, agency officials told us they have  conducted analyses that show the costs of moving away from using  COBOL currently outweigh the benefits. Accordingly, the OIG found that  SSA has developed an approach to gradually reduce its reliance on  COBOL for core processing of program transactions but has not yet  articulated a formal strategy for converting its legacy programs to a more  modern programming language. SSA officials disagree that such a  strategy is needed because they consider this programming language to  be sufficient for their needs and point out that it is still used by other  businesses.", "Information security weaknesses. SSA uses and stores a great deal of  sensitive information, but has been challenged to effectively protect its  computer systems and networks in recent years. Our prior work states  that it is essential for agencies to have information security controls that  ensure sensitive information is adequately protected from inadvertent or  deliberate misuse, fraudulent use, and improper disclosure, modification,  or destruction.

SSA officials told us the agency is  engaged in ongoing efforts to reduce the footprint of its headquarters  facilities. According to an SSA official, vacant space in headquarters  facilities has increased during the past few years as a result of the  shrinking workforce. SSA officials told us that OFSM is analyzing the  space needs of all offices in the headquarters area and will reassign  space according to staffing levels and other criteria. According to an  official, SSA\u2019s efforts were motivated by several factors, including an  OMB directiveagency\u2019s ultimate goal of terminating all commercial leasing in the  headquarters area; and, to a lesser degree, reducing current vacancies in  headquarters.   to make more efficient use of federal office space; the  In addition to these headquarters-focused efforts, SSA is reducing office  space in the field as opportunities arise, but our preliminary work shows  that it lacks a proactive plan to assess field facilities for potential space  reductions.

However, OFSM\u2019s  standards do not call for wholesale reductions or reconfigurations of  existing space. SSA has established a workgroup that is developing  guidance to help identify opportunities to reduce space by co-locating  certain field-based facilities, such as field offices and video-based  disability hearing offices, but the workgroup\u2019s proposals need to be  reviewed and it is not yet clear if the agency will adopt them.", "Considerations for realigning the facilities structure. SSA has been  advised to consider aligning its facilities structure with its changing  methods of providing services. For example, the OIG reported in 2011  that SSA\u2019s long-term planning efforts should assess whether the agency\u2019s  existing office structure will align with future methods of providing  customer service. In 2011, the Social Security Advisory Board  suggested that as SSA continues to increase electronic service delivery, it  adapt its organizational structure to maximize the effectiveness of the  agency\u2019s transformation. In prior work, we have also reported that federal  agencies may be able to increase efficiency and effectiveness by  consolidating physical infrastructure or management functions.

SSA regional commissioners told us that  field offices have been consolidated in most of its of 10 regions and  several regions have co-located with the Office of Disability Adjudication  and Review to provide space to hold disability hearings within field  offices. These consolidations and co-locations can save money on rent and guard services. Regional commissioners told us that a single office  consolidation can save up to $3 million over a 10-year period.", "Despite these actions, our preliminary work indicates that SSA has not  engaged in a systematic analysis of potential approaches for  consolidating its facilities or realigning its facilities with the agency\u2019s  evolving service delivery model. The National Research Council  recommends that federal agencies use their organizational mission to  guide facilities investment decisions and then integrate these investments  into their strategic planning processes. We previously reported that  agencies should consider the potential costs and benefits of any  widespread efforts to consolidate physical infrastructure before embarking  on such an action. To support its rationale for consolidation and assess  the potential impact and challenges of consolidation, we suggested that  agencies consider issues such as how to fund up-front costs associated  with consolidation and the effect on various stakeholders."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "SSA\u2019s Planning Efforts Are Not Adequate to Address the Long- Term Nature of Its Management Challenges", "paragraphs": ["SSA has ongoing planning efforts, but we have identified two major areas  in which these efforts may fall short in addressing the long-term nature of  the agency\u2019s management challenges: (1) its planning efforts are short- term and do not adequately address emerging issues, and (2) it lacks  continuity in its strategic planning leadership.", "Need for longer-term efforts to address emerging issues.

While the draft service delivery plan acknowledges the need to  assess the agency\u2019s workforce structure, it stops short of providing a  vision for how the workforce structure should best make use of expanded  virtual and automated service delivery channels. The plan also states that  issues such as the need to strategically develop and place self-service  options and to determine whether the Internet should be the primary  service delivery mechanism for certain services, will need to be  considered over the next 6 to 10 years, but it does not provide a specific  strategy for how to resolve these issues. Further, the plan does not  articulate SSA\u2019s long-term costs and benefits for its investments, such as  the specific impact that moving to online services is expected to have on  backlogs and workforce needs.

One of the goals of the agency\u2019s strategic plan  is to increase the public\u2019s use of online services, but several SSA officials  and representatives of one SSA management group told us that this shift  will not be sufficient to address growing service demands. For example,  as discussed earlier, to meet service challenges, some officials said the  agency will also need to simplify its disability policy and develop a  strategy for meeting the needs of individuals who may not have access to  computers at home or who may not be computer literate.
