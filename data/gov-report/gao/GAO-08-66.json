The Medicare hospice benefit is specifically designed for end-of-life care but is an elected benefit for individuals who have a terminal diagnosis with a prognosis of 6 months or less if the disease runs its normal course. GAO was asked to identify examples of programs that provide key components of end-of-life care. Specifically, GAO (1) identified key components of end-of-life care, (2) identified and described how certain programs incorporate key components of end-of-life care, and (3) described the challenges program providers have identified to delivering the key components of end-of-life care. To identify the key components of end-of-life care, GAO relied on studies by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). To identify and describe programs that implement these key components and describe the challenges providers of these programs face, GAO conducted site visits to four states, Arizona, Florida, Oregon, and Wisconsin, that, in addition to other criteria, demonstrated a high use of end-of-life services. We interviewed officials of federal, state, and private programs in these four states that provide care to individuals nearing the end of life."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The IOM and AHRQ studies identified the following key components in providing care to individuals nearing the end of life: care management to coordinate and facilitate service delivery; supportive services, such as transportation, provided to individuals residing in noninstitutional settings; pain and symptom management; family and caregiver support such as respite care; communication among the individuals, families, and program staff; and assistance with advance care planning to aid individuals with making decisions about their future care. The programs GAO identified in the four states incorporate key components of end-of-life care when delivering services to individuals nearing the end of life. These programs use care management, either through a case manager or an interdisciplinary care team of health care professionals, to ensure continuity of care and the delivery of appropriate services. The programs also provide supportive services, such as personal care services or meal delivery, to assist individuals in their homes. Pain and symptom management is provided by these programs to treat pain and other symptoms of an individual who is seriously ill. These programs provide family and caregiver support through services that alleviate demands on the caregiver and by providing bereavement support for family members. The programs foster communication with individuals and family members to plan care that reflects each individual's choices. In addition, these programs use tools such as electronic medical records to facilitate communication among staff members. The programs GAO identified initiate and encourage advance care planning for the end of life and assist individuals with making decisions about future medical care, such as completing advance directives and identifying health care proxies, that is, those who can make health care decisions on behalf of the individual. Providers of the programs GAO identified described challenges they encounter to delivering some of the key components of end-of-life care. Providers described difficulties delivering supportive services and family and caregiver supports to rural residents because of travel distances, fewer community-based service options, and an inability to hire adequate numbers of staff in rural areas. Providers also stated that, in their experience, physician training and practices can inhibit the provision of pain and symptom management and advance care planning to individuals nearing the end of life. A recent article published in a medical journal GAO reviewed identified similar issues with physician training and practices. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid, commented that the report is a useful description of diverse provider types that deliver services to persons coming to the end of life. CMS noted that the report is especially helpful as a time approaches when more Americans will be living with serious and eventually fatal chronic conditions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1999, approximately 28 percent of all Medicare spending was used to  provide care for beneficiaries in the last year of their lives. A large  percentage of this spending was for institutional services such as hospital  inpatient or nursing home care; for example, slightly more than 58 percent  of this spending was for hospital inpatient services. In that same year,  approximately 1.5 million individuals over age 65 resided in nursing  homes. Sixty-two percent of these individuals had their nursing home care  paid for by Medicaid and about 16 percent had their care paid for by  Medicare. However, there are alternatives to institution-based end-of-life  care, such as home and community-based services. In 2005, the  Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the  federal agency that administers Medicare and Medicaid, testified that  providing home and community-based services, such as personal care  services, can be a cost-effective way to provide end-of-life care while  increasing personal autonomy and allowing individuals to live in their  homes, surrounded by friends and family.", "Advances in treating diseases have lengthened the life expectancy of  Americans, and chronic conditions such as heart failure, diabetes, or  kidney failure are no longer immediately fatal and can be treated or  managed with medication. As a result, more than 80 percent of Americans  lived past age 65 in 2000; however, many individuals live their last years of  life with chronic conditions. For example, according to the 2003 Medicare  Current Beneficiary Survey, 21 percent of beneficiaries have had a  diagnosis of diabetes, 5 percent have had a diagnosis of Alzheimer\u2019s  disease, and 15 percent have had a diagnosis of pulmonary disease, such  as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition, 73 percent  of beneficiaries reported that they had two or more chronic conditions.  Medicare beneficiaries with chronic health conditions use many health  care resources. Ninety percent of Medicare beneficiaries over age 65 live  with a chronic condition in the year before death.", "Medicare has a program that is specifically designed for end-of-life care,  the hospice benefit. The hospice benefit is designed to provide comfort  and pain relief and emotional and spiritual support to individuals with a  terminal illness, generally in a home setting. Medicare hospice services  include, for example, nursing care, counseling, and homemaker services,  as well as drugs and medical supplies. However, not all individuals nearing  the end of life may qualify for or elect to receive care under this benefit. To  be eligible for the benefit, a physician must certify an individual as having  a life expectancy of 6 months or less if his or her illness runs its normal  course. Physicians certifying patients for hospice are expected to use their  best clinical judgment regarding the normal course of the individual\u2019s  illness. However, the course of many conditions, such as COPD, is often  uncertain, making it difficult for physicians to predict accurately the life  expectancy of individuals with these conditions and, therefore, refer them  to hospice. In addition, a beneficiary who elects hospice must waive  Medicare coverage for curative care related to the terminal illness for the  period the election is in effect. Some individuals are reluctant to forgo  curative care for their terminal illness and, therefore, do not elect hospice.", "You are interested in health care services delivered to individuals who are  nearing the end of life and asked us to identify examples of programs,  other than hospice, that provide key components of end-of-life care. In this  report, we (1) identify key components of end-of-life care, (2) identify and  describe how certain programs incorporate key components of end-of-life  care, and (3) describe the challenges program providers have identified to  delivering the key components of end-of-life care.", "To identify key components of end-of-life care, we interviewed officials  from CMS and 10 national independent and academic researchers in end- of-life and long-term care. In addition, we interviewed officials from the  National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) and the  National Association for Home Care and Hospice (NAHC), industry  organizations that represent home care agencies, hospices, and palliative  care providers. Based on these interviews, we identified and relied  primarily on two extensive studies to identify the key components of end- of-life care: a 1997 Institute of Medicine (IOM) study and a 2004 study  published by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).  The IOM study identified factors that promote high-quality care for  individuals near the end of life. The report was prepared by an IOM- appointed committee that included health care professionals and  researchers with expertise in geriatrics, end-of-life care, chronic illness  and disability, pain management, and long-term care. The committee  prepared this report with the objective of stimulating discussion,  encouraging consensus on how care for those approaching death can be  improved, and encouraging action to implement that consensus. The  AHRQ report is a study on the state of the science regarding end-of-life  care. It includes a comprehensive review of the literature that addresses  the effectiveness of specific health care interventions for improving  outcomes in individuals at the end of life. In preparing its report, AHRQ  reviewed a total of 5,165 abstracts applicable to the report\u2019s key questions  that were published in the English language, appeared in journals from  1990 through 2004, involved human subjects, and did not include  individual case reports. The AHRQ report was peer reviewed by a  multidisciplinary technical expert panel that included leading scientists  and clinicians in nursing, gerontology, and palliative medicine and others  with a broad knowledge of relevant research and policy issues.", "To identify the programs that deliver key components of end-of-life care  and describe how they incorporate these key components, we first  interviewed the officials from CMS, NHPCO, and NAHC and the 10  national independent and academic researchers in end-of-life and long- term care. We also used 2001 data from the U.S. Census Bureau to identify  states that had a high percentage of population age 65 and over. We  reviewed 2003 data from the National Center for Health Care Statistics and  2000 through 2003 data from The Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care to  identify states that had low health care service utilization as a proxy for  higher-than-average use of care management. In addition, we examined  fiscal year 2004 Medicaid data on states\u2019 spending for certain home and  community-based services. We reviewed data on the utilization of  Medicare hospice services at the end of life from a study published in 2002  as a proxy for individuals who use noninstitutional services for end-of-life  care. Using information from our interviews and these data, we identified  14 states that meet at least one of the following criteria: a high proportion  of individuals over age 65, low health care service utilization, a high  proportion of Medicaid spending for home and community-based services  relative to spending for institutional services, or a high proportion of  individuals who use hospice services at the end of life. From the 14 states  we identified, we selected 4 states, Arizona, Florida, Oregon, and  Wisconsin, that are geographically diverse and have at least one state or  local program that provides care to individuals nearing the end of life. We  identified programs in these states that provide care to individuals nearing  the end of life and interviewed representatives of providers of these  programs: the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), the  Wisconsin Partnership Program (WPP), the Medicaid Arizona Long Term  Care System (ALTCS), and palliative care programs. To describe how  these programs incorporate key components of end-of-life care, we  conducted site visits to interview representatives of PACE providers in  Florida, Oregon, and Wisconsin; representatives of three providers of  WPP; state officials from the ALTCS program; and representatives of at  least 2 palliative care programs in each of the four states for a total of 12  palliative care programs.", "To describe the challenges these programs encounter in providing the key  components of end-of-life care, we conducted site visits to interview  representatives of PACE providers in Florida, Oregon, and Wisconsin;  representatives of three providers of WPP; state officials from the ALTCS  program; and representatives of at least 2 palliative care programs in each  of the four states for a total of 12 palliative care programs.

These programs  generally do not receive federal or state funding and may rely on private  grants or charitable support. Palliative care programs are designed to  improve the quality of a seriously ill individual\u2019s life and support the  individual and his or her family during and after treatment. Services  provided by palliative care programs vary and may include pain and  symptom management, assistance with planning for additional services,  and psychosocial and spiritual support and can be provided in conjunction  with curative care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Components of End-of-Life Care", "paragraphs": ["The IOM and AHRQ studies identified the following key components in  providing care to individuals nearing the end of life: care management;  supportive services for individuals; pain and symptom management; family  and caregiver support; communication among the individuals, families,  and program staff; and assistance with advance care planning. Care  management, also referred to as case management, interdisciplinary care,  or care coordination, is the coordination and facilitation of service  delivery and can be provided by a team or a single manager. Supportive  services include personal care services, home delivered meals,  transportation to medical appointments, and other services that assist  individuals who reside in noninstitutional settings. Pain and symptom  management is pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies, such  as massage therapy, to treat pain and other symptoms of an individual who  is seriously ill. Family and caregiver support are services that provide  assistance to those caring for an individual nearing the end of life in his or  her home and can include respite care and bereavement counseling.  Communication among individuals, families, and program staff includes  discussions regarding end-of-life issues with individuals and their family  members and the use of various tools to foster communication among  program staff. Advance care planning is the process by which individuals  make decisions about their future care and may include the completion of  written documents, such as advance directives.", "Specifically, IOM reported that for individuals nearing the end of life, care  systems should ensure that the following are provided: interdisciplinary  care management; home care or personal care services, which we refer to  as supportive services; pain and symptom management; supportive care  for caregivers and family through services such as respite care or  housekeeping services; and communication. The IOM report also  identified advance care planning as a key component of end-of-life care.  The IOM report recommended that people nearing the end of life should  receive supportive services managed by those involved in their care and  that health care organizations should facilitate advance care planning. In  addition, the IOM report recommended that health care professionals  improve care for individuals nearing the end of life by providing pain and  symptom management.", "The AHRQ report focused on identifying outcomes that can indicate the  quality of the end-of-life experience and identifying the patient, family, and  health care system factors that are associated with better or worse  outcomes at the end of life. The AHRQ report identified continuity of  health care, such as that provided through care management; supportive  services, such as home care services; pain and symptom management;  support for families and caregivers; and effective communication among  program staff, which could include improved medical record  documentation, as core components of end-of-life care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Programs Incorporate Key Components of End-of-Life Care", "paragraphs": ["The programs we identified in four states that incorporate key  components of end-of-life care described in the IOM and AHRQ reports are  PACE, WPP, ALTCS, and palliative care programs.

PACE  beneficiaries attend a PACE adult day center where they receive services  from the interdisciplinary care team. The WPP providers use an  interdisciplinary care team approach similar to PACE, although the teams  are generally smaller. Representatives of two WPP providers we  interviewed stated that care management reduces hospitalizations.  Representatives of one of these providers stated that care management  ensures that individuals admitted to a hospital are discharged to an  appropriate setting to avoid unnecessary readmission. Representatives of  the second WPP provider stated that care management improves the  medical care of individuals by providing physicians with an accurate  picture of individuals\u2019 health status and assisting individuals with  accessing physicians in a timely manner.

These programs\u2019 teams  include medical directors, social workers, chaplains, nurses,  psychologists, and case managers. Two of the hospice-based palliative  care programs developed partnerships with local hospitals and use  interdisciplinary care teams to assist individuals. Two other hospice-based  palliative care programs use interdisciplinary care teams of health care  professionals to coordinate medical, nursing, social work, and spiritual  services.

Representatives of providers also stated  that they believe physician training and practices can inhibit the provision  of pain and symptom management and advance care planning to  individuals nearing the end of life."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Providers Encounter Challenges Delivering Supportive Services and Family and Caregiver Support to Rural Residents", "paragraphs": ["Representatives of providers we interviewed described difficulties  delivering supportive services and family and caregiver support to rural  residents because of travel distances, lack of community-based services,  and insufficient numbers of nursing and personal care staff in rural areas.  Representatives of providers we interviewed stated that significant  distances between residents in rural areas make it difficult to provide  family and caregiver support, such as respite care, and supportive  services, such as personal care services. The length of time it takes for  personal care staff to travel between individuals in rural areas decreases  the number of services the providers can deliver in a day. In addition,  representatives of providers told us that increases in fuel costs have  affected how many services they can provide. Representatives of providers  we interviewed also described how unpaved roads and inclement weather  can increase travel time or prevent travel entirely when serving rural  residents. Representatives of one provider stated that the challenge of  providing transportation in rural areas is one of the barriers that has  prevented the provider\u2019s expansion into rural areas of the state.", "Representatives of providers we interviewed also cited the limited  availability of certain services in rural areas as a challenge to serving  individuals nearing the end of life who reside in those areas.  Representatives of providers described difficulties in delivering supplies  and medications to rural residents. For example, representatives of a  hospice-based palliative care provider noted that the pharmacy service it  contracts with to provide home delivery of medications cannot provide  daily delivery in very rural areas and inclement weather may further delay  deliveries. To address the problem, this provider has contracted with local  rural pharmacies to provide emergency medication; however, in a two- county area, only one pharmacy is open 24 hours a day, making it difficult  for individuals to access medications in an emergency. Representatives of  another hospice-based palliative care provider and a WPP provider stated  that they are sometimes unable to coordinate supportive services, such as  meal delivery and personal care services, for individuals in rural areas  because they are unable to locate providers of these services in these  regions. In addition, representatives of providers noted that a lack of  transit services makes it difficult to provide individuals living in rural areas  with transportation to medical appointments or day centers.", "Representatives of providers stated that an insufficient number of nursing  staff and personal care workers in rural areas makes it difficult to provide  end-of-life care to those residents. For example, representatives of a  provider of both PACE and WPP noted that it is often difficult to hire staff  to work in more remote geographic areas, and they cited this as a barrier  to expanding the provider\u2019s services into additional rural areas of the  state. In addition, representatives of one hospice-based palliative care  provider that serves a remote rural area stated that they have been unable  to maintain adequate numbers of health care workers to provide services  to its patients because such workers are increasingly choosing to relocate  to urban areas. Representatives of another hospice-based palliative care  provider in a rural region also stated that they have difficulty finding  qualified staff to fill these positions.", "State officials we interviewed said that PACE is not a feasible option in  rural areas because of the requirement that the providers operate an adult  day center. Representatives of a provider that was formerly a PACE  provider stated that it was difficult to remain financially solvent as a PACE  provider in a rural community because there were not enough eligible  individuals to support an adult day center model. This provider ended its  participation in PACE because the community it served did not have  enough eligible individuals to justify the expense of a day center. Also, in  rural areas, the distance to the PACE adult day center from the residences  of individuals enrolled in the program can be a challenge for the PACE  program\u2019s transportation services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Providers Encounter Physician Training and Practices as Challenges to Providing Pain and Symptom Management and Advance Care Planning", "paragraphs": ["Representatives of providers we interviewed described how they believe  physician training and practices may present challenges to providing pain  and symptom management and advance care planning to individuals  nearing the end of life. Representatives of providers stated that physicians  often do not receive adequate training in pain and symptom management.  A physician we interviewed who is the director of a hospital-based  palliative care program stated that he believes because physicians lack  training to recognize the need for pain and symptom management,  individuals nearing the end of life often have difficulty accessing such  services. Representatives of other palliative care providers we  interviewed agreed that lack of physician training in pain and symptom  management is a challenge to the provision of pain and symptom  management. Representatives of a hospital-based palliative care provider  believe that many medical schools do not provide sufficient training for  physicians in pain and symptom management. Representatives of a  palliative care provider operated by a health care system stated that they  believe most physicians are not trained to provide pain and symptom  management to individuals nearing the end of life. A recent article in the  New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) has also noted that physicians  receive little or no training in the use of medications for pain and symptom  management.", "Representatives of providers we interviewed also cited physician practices  as challenges to individuals receiving pain and symptom management  services as they near the end of life. A representative of a hospital-based  palliative care provider stated that some physicians are reluctant to refer  individuals to the program so that they can receive pain and symptom  management because these physicians do not understand or recognize the  need for such care. Representatives of providers we interviewed also  described how, in their experience, physicians may fail to address pain in  a timely manner. A representative of a hospital-based palliative care  provider stated that patients\u2019 severe pain may go untreated while  physicians, intent on finding the cause of the pain, order extensive  diagnostic testing. Representatives of a palliative care program operated  by a health care system stated that some physicians perform aggressive  medical procedures on individuals nearing the end of life. These  representatives stated that they believe some physicians view providing  pain and symptom management as \u201cgiving up\u201d on a patient.", "Representatives of providers we interviewed described how physicians  often do not engage in advance care planning with individuals nearing the  end of life. For example, representatives of a hospice-based palliative care  provider stated that they believe physicians do not spend enough time  talking with individuals about end-of-life care options such as hospice. As  was recently reported in NEJM, physicians receive little training in the  compassionate discussion of end-of-life issues. Furthermore, ALTCS  officials stated that, in their experience, physicians often do not inform  individuals about advance directives. Representatives of a hospice-based  palliative care provider stated that physicians sometimes provide  individuals with incorrect information about care options for the end of  life. Representatives of a PACE provider told us that some physicians  resist ending curative care to allow individuals nearing the end of life to  receive only supportive care services, and the article published in NEJM  reported that some physicians regard the death of patient as a professional  failure."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS stated that the report is a  useful description of a diverse set of provider types in very different  settings, each of which provides useful services to persons coming to the  end of life. CMS noted that the report is especially helpful as a time  approaches when more Americans will be living with serious and  eventually fatal chronic conditions. CMS also stated that it was useful that  our report included individuals living with serious chronic conditions who  might live for some years. However, CMS suggested that we avoid using  the term terminal illness when referring to such individuals. We note that,  in our draft report, we used this term only in the context of discussing the  Medicare hospice benefit, which is, by definition, a benefit for individuals  with terminal conditions. CMS also stated that we should mention other  important components of end-of-life care including, for example, having  the appropriate medical diagnosis and having all possible opportunities for  a meaningful life. However, these issues are beyond the scope of our  report. CMS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated  where appropriate.
