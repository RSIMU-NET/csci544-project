Within the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) Grant Programs Directorate administers the Port Security Grant Program (PSGP) to strengthen ports against risks from terrorist attacks. FEMA received and obligated $150 million in Recovery Act PSGP funds in 2009, and, as of September 2010, recipients have drawn down over $10 million. To facilitate recipient reporting, FEMA must consider the need both for transparency and for protection of Sensitive Security Information (SSI), which could be detrimental to transportation security if disclosed. As requested, GAO assessed FEMA's: (1) controls to ensure Recovery Act PSGP staff consistently follow SSI policies, and (2) steps to ensure PSGP recipients have not disclosed SSI on Recovery.gov. GAO reviewed relevant laws, regulations, guidance, and a random sample of PSGP Recovery Act recipient reports available as of February 2010, and interviewed agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FEMA has taken steps to ensure Recovery Act PSGP staff consistently follow the Department of Homeland Security's SSI policies and processes, but key actions have not been taken. For instance, FEMA has appointed an SSI Program Manager--responsible for FEMA-wide SSI oversight--and an SSI Coordinator to facilitate the Grant Programs Directorate's use of SSI. Also, the SSI Program Manager provided SSI training to FEMA's Grant Programs Directorate staff; however, the training did not include FEMA-specific examples to illustrate the application of SSI, which the staff requested. GAO has previously reported that, when assessing training, managers should consider whether the training includes both the theoretical basis of the material--such as context and principles--and the practical application of the issues. Including FEMA-specific examples could help FEMA ensure Recovery Act PSGP staff have the necessary knowledge to handle and safeguard SSI. In addition, the SSI Coordinator has not assessed whether SSI documents have been appropriately labeled, in accordance with SSI regulations. For example, FEMA has determined that certain materials grant recipients submit to FEMA during the application process to describe how their projects will address current gaps and deficiencies are SSI, but has not marked them as such. While these documents have not been posted to Recovery.gov, immediately reviewing and marking them as SSI could improve safeguards and help prevent the information contained therein from inadvertent disclosure. FEMA has taken steps to develop a quarterly review process for Recovery Act PSGP recipient reports--prior to their public release on Recovery.gov--but does not have key controls to help prevent public disclosure of SSI. For instance, FEMA staff drafted a procedure for reviewing recipient reports, but FEMA management has not approved it and the draft does not include a procedure to verify the reviews' accuracy. Further, while GAO found that SSI had not been disclosed in Recovery Act recipient reports posted on Recovery.gov for the single reporting period GAO reviewed--with data publicly available as of February 2010--FEMA lacks a process for comparing recipient reports to SSI criteria, and a protocol that informs recipients when FEMA determines that their reports contain SSI. Introducing these measures could help Grant Programs Directorate staff consistently review reports, identify when they contain SSI, reduce the risk of SSI disclosure on Recovery.gov, and reinforce recipients' obligations to safeguard SSI. In addition, GAO found wide variation in the level of detail about the awards' descriptions among the recipient reports sampled from Recovery.gov as of February 2010, although the majority provided minimal detail. According to FEMA, the sensitive nature of PSGP information affects the transparency of PSGP recipient reporting. By providing instruction to recipients on what should and should not be reported due to SSI requirements, FEMA could help recipients report project details in a transparent manner on the expenditure of Recovery Act funds while protecting information that could otherwise jeopardize transportation security if released."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that FEMA improve SSI training, ensure proper marking of SSI, enhance recipient report review controls, and instruct recipients on safeguarding SSI while reporting on funded activities and expected outcomes in a transparent manner.

To promote transparency and  accountability, the Recovery Act includes a requirement that recipients  report quarterly on a number of measures, such as a description of the  projects funded, and that these reports be made available to the public  through Recovery.gov, the government\u2019s Recovery Act Web site.", "The transparency that is envisioned for tracking Recovery Act spending  and results is an extensive undertaking for the federal government. Both  Congress and the President have emphasized the need for accountability,  efficiency, and transparency in the expenditure of Recovery Act funds and  have made it a central principle of the act. However, tracking billions of  dollars that are being disbursed to thousands of recipients is an enormous  effort. The administration expects that achieving this degree of visibility  will be iterative, whereby both the reporting process and the information  recipients provide improve over time and, if successful, could be a model  for transparency and oversight beyond the Recovery Act.", "To implement Recovery Act reporting requirements, the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) provides guidance to federal agencies for  overseeing recipients\u2019 Recovery Act quarterly reporting, which includes a  requirement that agencies review the overall data quality of recipient  reports before they are posted on Recovery.gov. While the Recovery Act  does not specifically define transparency, OMB\u2019s guidance states that  recipients\u2019 narrative information, such as their award descriptions, must  be sufficiently clear to facilitate understanding by the general public of  how Recovery Act funds are being used.", "In addition, OMB directs federal agencies to consider both transparency as  well as national security concerns, when applicable, when reviewing  recipients\u2019 quarterly reports in preparation for posting on Recovery.gov.  Among other agencies, this directive applies to DHS\u2019 Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA), which operates the Recovery Act PSGP. On  the one hand, FEMA must help ensure that award and project descriptions  publicly available on Recovery.gov explain how recipients are using PSGP  funds in order to promote transparency. On the other hand, FEMA is  responsible for helping to ensure that specific information about the ports\u2019  existing vulnerabilities, such as the absence of security systems, is  safeguarded and not publicly disclosed on Recovery.gov. This is  particularly important since the disclosure of such information\u2014some of  which stems from grant recipient documents that contain Sensitive  Security Information (SSI)\u2014could compromise national security.", "In response to your request regarding the federal role in reporting on the  use of Recovery Act funds and the extent to which recipients transparently  report on their activities, we issued a report in May 2010 on the extent to  which descriptions of awards found on Recovery.gov fostered a basic  understanding of award activities and expected outcomes. This report  provided information on the level of transparency in reporting on  Recovery.gov for federal agencies administering 11 Recovery Act  programs including broadband, energy, transportation, infrastructure, and  civil works. Our assessment of transparency on Recovery.gov included a  review of the transparency of award descriptions on Recovery.gov for  FEMA\u2019s Recovery Act PSGP. The Recovery Act PSGP recipient reports  varied widely in level of detail\u2014as we will discuss later in this report\u2014 because FEMA lacked a process for considering both the need to report  on funded activities and expected outcomes in a transparent manner and  the need to safeguard SSI in recipient reports. Therefore, as agreed with  your office, this report focuses on FEMA\u2019s efforts to safeguard sensitive  information associated with its Recovery Act port security awards.  Specifically, it addresses: (1) the extent to which FEMA has implemented  management controls to ensure that DHS\u2019 SSI policies and processes are  consistently followed when administering the Recovery Act PSGP, and (2)  the steps that FEMA has taken to ensure that sensitive information has not  been publicly disclosed by PSGP recipients on Recovery.gov.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and DHS  guidance on SSI to determine the extent to which FEMA has adopted DHS  management controls to apply applicable safeguards to SSI contained in  PSGP grant materials. We also attended a new SSI training course on July  12, 2010, that FEMA provided to its staff to observe the applicability of  course material to FEMA grant managers. In addition, we reviewed  FEMA\u2019s draft standard operating procedure for reviewing Recovery Act  recipient reports prior to their release on Recovery.gov and compared it  with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and DHS\u2019  guidance for safeguarding SSI to determine the steps FEMA has taken to  help prevent public disclosure of sensitive Recovery Act PSGP grantee  details. We complemented this review by interviewing FEMA and DHS  officials with responsibility for ensuring a reasonable degree of quality  across PSGP recipient reports, as laid out in OMB\u2019s Recovery Act  reporting guidance.", "In addition, we reviewed existing Recovery Act guidance from OMB to  determine the extent to which instructions are available to agencies on  handling sensitive information from grant recipients and reviewed  documentation of FEMA\u2019s contact with recipients after reviewing their  reports to assess the extent to which FEMA consistently attempted to  prevent disclosure of protected information. We also selected a  representative probability (random) sample of 61 out of the total 214 PSGP  recipient reports available on Recovery.gov as of February, 2010, and  reviewed the level of detail they provided. We also spoke with DHS  officials responsible for assessing whether or not documents contain SSI  to determine the extent to which recipient award descriptions available on  Recovery.gov could reveal vulnerabilities at the ports and potentially  jeopardize port security.", "Finally, we interviewed a nonprobability sample of 6 of the 61 randomly  sampled Recovery Act PSGP recipients to determine the extent to which  FEMA had provided recipients with information related to safeguarding  sensitive details when submitting Recovery Act reports. We selected the 6  recipients based on diversity in geographical location; PSGP award size;  level of detail included in quarterly report submission provided to FEMA;  and whether the recipient made changes to its entries following FEMA\u2019s  review. Our interviews provided us with an understanding of recipients\u2019  experience in balancing transparency and the safeguarding of SSI in  reporting information for ultimate posting on Recovery.gov. However,  because we used a nonprobability sample, the results cannot be  generalized to all Recovery Act PSGP recipients.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2010 through October  2010 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

For example, none of the FEMA  officials with whom we spoke reported that they\u2014or anyone else\u2014was  responsible for incorporating a sensitivity review into their quarterly data  quality assessment during which they could compare recipients\u2019  submissions to FederalReporting.gov against SSI standards to determine if  the information should be prevented from public disclosure on  Recovery.gov.", "A Recovery Act PSGP official with whom we spoke reported that it is  Recovery Act PSGP recipients\u2019 responsibility to ensure that they do not  report SSI in their quarterly reports because it is the recipients who  initially report the information, not FEMA. However, since FEMA treats  the investment justifications as SSI, and much of the information  requested in the reporting fields on FederalReporting.gov is similar in  nature, conducting such a review would help FEMA ensure that nothing  from the investment justifications was inadvertently copied into the  FederalReporting.gov reporting fields and ultimately published on  Recovery.gov. Further, pertinent SSI regulations require that a covered  person must take reasonable steps to safeguard SSI in that person\u2019s  possession or control from unauthorized disclosure, and state that  violations of the SSI regulations, such as unauthorized disclosure of SSI, is  grounds for, among other things, a civil penalty and other enforcement or  corrective action by DHS. While recipients initially report the  information, FEMA accesses this information during its data quality review  and, therefore, under SSI regulations, Recovery Act PSGP personnel are  considered to be covered persons and have the accompanying  responsibility to safeguard any SSI in the recipient reports.", "A TSA security official who reviewed our sample of 61 PSGP recipient  reports available on Recovery.gov for the reporting period with data  available as of February 2010, informed us that none contained SSI;  however, FEMA should consider a cautious approach when reviewing this  material in advance and inform recipients if their draft submissions  contain SSI. While our review showed that none of the Recovery Act  PSGP recipient reports for the single reporting period in our review  contained SSI, developing a management-approved policy for reviewing  Recovery Act PSGP recipient reports that includes steps to compare  submissions against SSI criteria and properly safeguard it could reduce the  risk that SSI is made publicly available on Recovery.gov in subsequent  reporting periods. Further, such a policy could help better position FEMA  to ensure that officials responsible for Recovery Act recipient reviews take  reasonable steps to safeguard SSI from unauthorized disclosure, as  required by SSI regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Lacks a Protocol for Informing Recipients When Their Draft Recovery Act Reports Contain SSI and Should Be Safeguarded", "paragraphs": ["According to the GPD official responsible for reviewing recipients\u2019  submissions and performing the data quality review on  FederalReporting.gov, when the Recovery Act quarterly reporting began,  the issue of data sensitivity was not discussed in any manner. However,  the official noted that the GPD Director to whom he reported at the time  told him to use his judgment and when he thought recipient submissions  included \u201ctoo much detail\u201d in the narrative-based fields, such as the one  for \u201caward description,\u201d he should notify recipients. Specifically, the  director instructed him to use boilerplate language when commenting  back to the recipients, with the following notification statement: \u201cDue to  the public nature of this report, please adjust the Award Description to:  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act Port Security Grant Program  (ARRA PSGP).\u201d This official stated that he did not develop standard  criteria to determine what \u201ctoo much detail\u201d meant, nor does he compare  the information contained in these quarterly reports against SSI criteria  while conducting his data quality review. Instead, he explained that he  used his best judgment and if the details in the narrative field appeared  similar to the information the recipient reported in its investment  justification, then he sent the recipient the standard notification statement.", "This notification statement did not communicate the rationale for  change\u2014that the specific information about their use of award funds or  expected outcomes could disclose SSI, which could document  vulnerabilities or jeopardize port security\u2014or a reason for recipients to  take action, even though SSI regulations require covered persons to take  reasonable steps to safeguard SSI from unauthorized disclosure.  Moreover, internal control standards call for managers to ensure that there  are adequate means of communicating with, and obtaining information  from, external stakeholders that may have a significant impact on the  agency achieving its goals. Most importantly, FEMA\u2019s notification  statement does not inform recipients of their responsibility as covered  persons to safeguard SSI. Including in its standard operating procedures a  process for notifying recipients when their reports include SSI and taking  steps to inform recipients about their responsibilities as covered persons  could better position FEMA to help prevent the inadvertent release into  the public domain of information that could potentially compromise  national security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Not Provided Instruction to Recipients on Safeguarding SSI While Reporting Project Details in a Transparent Manner for Posting on Recovery.gov", "paragraphs": ["During the Recovery Act quarterly reporting process, under federal SSI  regulations, both recipients\u2014who submit the initial information\u2014and  FEMA personnel\u2014who review the information\u2014are considered to be  covered persons with a duty to safeguard SSI. In addition, OMB\u2019s Recovery  Act reporting guidance states that recipients\u2019 narrative information must  be sufficiently clear to facilitate understanding by the general public of  how Recovery Act funds are being used.", "In reviewing the narrative descriptions provided on Recovery.gov for the  61 recipients in our sample, we found wide variation in the level of detail  provided regarding the awards\u2019 purposes, scope and nature of activities,  locations, costs, outcomes, and status of work. In a few instances, the  reports had clear and complete information across these areas. For  instance, the description of an award for a Missouri port stated that it will  be used for surveillance cameras that will allow the police department to  receive information about potential attacks using improvised explosive  devices and, as a result, increase the likelihood of preemptive action. In  the majority of cases, however, the reports provided little or none of the  information on what funds are being spent on and what outcomes are  expected. For instance, an award description for a port in Washington did  not provide the location where the award activities are being conducted,  what the award would fund, or the outcomes expected as a result of the  award.", "According to FEMA, the sensitive nature of port security information  affects the transparency of PSGP recipient reporting. However FEMA\u2019s  GPD has not provided technical assistance or program-specific guidance  to Recovery Act PSGP recipients on how to report on funded activities and  expected outcomes in a transparent manner while also safeguarding SSI.  For example, all of the PSGP recipients with whom we spoke reported  that FEMA had not instructed them on how to consider transparency  needs and safeguard SSI in Recovery Act reporting.", "According to a Coast Guard Recovery Act PSGP official, GPD\u2019s SSI  Coordinator, and three of the five Recovery Act PSGP recipients with  whom we spoke, Recovery Act PSGP recipients are not always clear  regarding what information they should report and what information they  should protect. For instance, GPD\u2019s SSI Coordinator told us that the  recipients may be confused about what they should report in their  quarterly Recovery Act reports because OMB guidance stresses  transparency even though SSI regulations stress safeguards. Therefore, the  SSI Coordinator stated that recipients may be unsure how to comply with  both because of their seemingly conflicting messages. Moreover, the Coast  Guard official and four of the five Recovery Act PSGP recipients with  whom we spoke told us that guidance from FEMA on what recipients  should and should not report for ultimate posting on Recovery.gov would  be helpful to recipients and assist them in better understanding how to  adhere to the requirements in both OMB\u2019s existing guidance on Recovery  Act recipient reporting and those found in the SSI-related regulations.", "Recovery Act PSGP officials with whom we spoke cited two reasons why  FEMA has not issued instructions to recipients on what information to  include in the narrative fields when completing their quarterly reports.  First, the officials reported to us that FEMA was concerned that issuing  instructions to recipients on what to report in the narrative fields may  conflict with OMB\u2019s emphasis on transparency in Recovery Act reporting.  When we raised this issue with OMB, staff there told us that OMB allows  agencies discretion with regard to balancing transparency with national  security concerns and it cannot provide guidance that addresses the  details of each Recovery Act program. OMB staff noted that agencies  should be aware of what program information may be sensitive and  address these concerns directly with recipients. Further, according to  OMB officials, agencies overseeing Recovery Act programs have discretion  to provide their recipients with technical assistance or supplemental  materials to aid recipients in reporting.", "In our May 2010 report, we reported that some agencies\u2014unlike FEMA\u2014 supplemented OMB\u2019s high-level guidance with program-specific technical  assistance on how to meet OMB\u2019s reporting requirements, including  specific instructions on what to write in the narrative fields. In addition,  OMB\u2019s March 2010 Memorandum 10-14 permits federal agencies  overseeing Recovery Act reporting to provide program-specific guidance  on Recovery Act recipient reporting to recipients as long as it does not  conflict with OMB guidance and the agency obtains OMB approval. Two  other agencies\u2014the departments of Transportation and Education\u2014have  obtained OMB approval to issue such program-specific guidance to assist  recipients with Recovery Act reporting. As we reported in May 2010, OMB  officials told us that OMB created generic reporting guidance because they  expected the guidance to be a baseline, with agencies providing  supplemental guidance that was more specific to unique program  characteristics and situations than OMB\u2019s one-size-fits-all guidance was  designed to address. We also reported that, according to OMB, the  agencies would be better sources of program specific individualized  guidance, tailored to the awards made under their programs.", "Second, FEMA officials said that even if they were to issue instructions to  recipients on what to report in the narrative fields that ultimately will be  posted on Recovery.gov, some recipients might not follow them and  FEMA cannot require them to do so. However, given that under federal SSI  regulations Recovery Act PSGP recipients are considered to be covered  persons, they have a duty under SSI regulations to safeguard SSI.", "Taking appropriate measures to provide instruction\u2014which could be in  the form of technical assistance, supplemental materials, or OMB- approved guidance\u2014to Recovery Act PSGP recipients has several  benefits. Namely, by describing the information to include in narrative  fields that ultimately will be posted on Recovery.gov and informing  recipients of their duty to protect SSI as covered persons, FEMA could  help ensure that recipients consider both the need to report on funded  activities and expected outcomes in a transparent manner while  safeguarding SSI when reporting information on issues that ultimately will  be posted on Recovery.gov.", "With regard to additional controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure of  Recovery Act PSGP SSI, FEMA officials reported that their ability to  implement such controls\u2014including their assessments of information  recipients submit quarterly to FederalReporting.gov\u2014is constrained due  to the small number of PSGP staff on board, as well as significant staff  turnover. According to FEMA data, as of July 2010, 10 FEMA employees  were administering both the Recovery Act PSGP and regular PSGP, and  GPD\u2019s staff turnover rates were 4 percent and 8 percent in the 2nd quarter  and 3rd quarter of 2010, respectively. Further, according to FEMA officials,  OMB is primarily concerned with data quality surrounding the numerical  reporting fields, such as the award amount, and is less concerned with the  content of the narrative reporting fields, such as the award description. In  addition, DHS officials charged with overall Recovery Act implementation  confirmed that their review of DHS-wide recipient information focuses on  the nonnarrative fields\u2014such as jobs created, recipient addresses, or  recipient Congressional district. As a result, the FEMA official charged  with conducting the data quality reviews told us his priorities have been  on numbers rather than narrative. OMB staff with whom we spoke told us  that agencies are better positioned to review narrative information  because they have knowledge of the programs and OMB staff explained  that agencies are expected to use their judgment to help ensure that  recipients do not disclose SSI in the information that ultimately will be  posted on Recovery.gov."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Reporting on the funded activities and expected outcomes of Recovery  Act funds in a transparent manner is vital to ensuring public trust.

Specifically,  determining whether Recovery Act PSGP documents, such as investment  justifications, that contain SSI are appropriately marked as such and  taking steps to ensure Recovery Act PSGP officials receive FEMA-specific  SSI training could help better position FEMA to ensure that its Recovery  Act PSGP staff protect SSI from unauthorized disclosure. Further, having  an approved policy for reviewing Recovery Act PSGP recipient reports  could help ensure that initial reviews by different FEMA GPD staff will be  conducted in a consistent manner to reduce the risk of error.
