These growing premiums result in higher costs to the federal government and plan enrollees. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) oversees FEHBP, negotiating benefits and premiums and administering reserve accounts that may be used to cover plans' unanticipated spending increases. GAO was asked to discuss its December 22, 2006 report, entitled Federal Employees Health Benefits Program: Premium Growth Has Recently Slowed, and Varies Among Participating Plans (GAO-07-141). In this report, GAO reviewed (1) FEHBP premium trends compared with those of other purchasers, (2) factors contributing to average premium growth across all FEHBP plans, and (3) factors contributing to differing trends among selected FEHBP plans. GAO reviewed data provided by OPM relating to FEHBP premiums and factors contributing to premium growth. For comparison purposes, GAO examined premium data from the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and surveys of other public and private employers. GAO also interviewed officials from OPM and eight FEHBP plans with premium growth that was higher than average and six FEHBP plans with premium growth that was lower than average."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Growth in FEHBP premiums recently slowed, from a peak of 12.9 percent for 2002 to 1.8 percent for 2007. Starting in 2003, FEHBP premium growth was generally slower than for other purchasers. Premium growth rates for the 10 largest FEHBP plans by enrollment--accounting for about three-quarters of total enrollment--ranged from 0 percent to 15.5 percent for 2007. Projected increases in the cost and utilization of health care services and in the cost of prescription drugs accounted for most of the average annual FEHBP premium growth for 2000 through 2007. Absent other factors, these increases would have raised 2007 average premiums by 9 percent. Other projected factors, including benefit changes resulting in less generous coverage and enrollee migration to lower-cost plans, slightly offset average premium growth. In 2006 and 2007, projected withdrawals from reserves helped offset average premium growth--by 2 percentage points for 2006 and 5 percentage points for 2007. To explain the factors associated with premium growth, officials GAO interviewed from most of the FEHBP plans with higher-than-average premium growth cited increases in the cost and utilization of services as well as a high share of elderly enrollees and early retirees. Officials GAO interviewed from most plans with lower-than-average premium growth cited adjustments made for previously overestimated projections of cost growth, and some officials cited benefit changes that resulted in less generous coverage for prescription drugs.

For this report, we were asked to examine the nature and extent of  premium increases in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  (FEHBP) and the potential effect on premium growth of the Medicare  retiree drug subsidy, had OPM applied for the subsidy and used it to offset  premium growth. Federal employees\u2019 health insurance premiums have  increased each year since the late 1990s, and these increases pose higher  costs for the federal government and plan enrollees. About 8 million  federal employees, retirees, and their dependents receive health coverage  through plans participating in the FEHBP, the largest employer-sponsored  health insurance program in the country. The Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) administers the program by contracting with multiple  health insurance carriers to offer health plans through the program and  negotiates benefits and premium rates with each carrier. OPM also  administers reserve accounts for each plan that may be used to cover  plans\u2019 unanticipated spending increases.", "My remarks today will focus on (1) recent FEHBP premium growth trends  compared to those of plans offered by other purchasers, (2) the factors  that contributed to average premium growth trends across all FEHBP  plans as well as the effect the Medicare retiree drug subsidy would have  had on premium growth, and (3) the factors that contributed to differing  premium growth among selected FEHBP plans. These remarks are based  on information contained in our December 2006 report.", "In conducting our work, we analyzed historic and recent premium trend  data from 1994 through 2007 from OPM for all FEHBP plans and compared  them with premium data from the California Public Employees\u2019  Retirement System (CalPERS)\u2014the second largest public purchaser of  employee health benefits\u2014and surveys of multiple employer-sponsored  health plans from Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and  Educational Trust (Kaiser/HRET). To identify factors contributing to  average FEHBP premium growth trends across all FEHBP plans, we  analyzed OPM summary reports assessing the effect of projected changes  in various factors, including the cost and utilization of services, enrollee  demographics, and use of reserves, on premium growth trends from 2000  through 2007. We also examined aggregate data on the actual growth in  per-enrollee expenditures from 2003 through 2005 for 5 large FEHBP  plans. We explored with officials from OPM and 14 selected FEHBP plans  the potential effect on premium growth of the retiree drug subsidy if OPM  had applied for the subsidy and used it to mitigate premium growth. The  14 plans were selected because of size (at least 5,000 enrollees) and length  of participation in the FEHBP (at least 3 years). To examine the reasons  for differing premium growth trends among FEHBP plans, we conducted  interviews with officials from these 14 plans. Eight of the plans had higher- than-average premium growth, and six of the plans had lower-than-average  premium growth for either (a) 2006 or (b) the 3-year period from 2004  through 2006. A detailed explanation of our scope and methodology is  contained in appendix I of the December 2006 report. We conducted our  work for that report from January 2006 through December 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "In summary, we found that growth in average FEHBP premiums recently  slowed from a peak of 12.9 percent for 2002 to 1.8 percent for 2007. This  was lower than growth for other purchasers from 2003 through 2007.  Premium growth rates for the 10 largest FEHBP plans by enrollment,  accounting for about three-quarters of total enrollment, ranged from 0 to  15.5 percent for 2007, but varied more widely across the smaller FEHBP  plans.", "Projected increases in the cost and utilization of health care services and  in the cost of prescription drugs accounted for most of the average annual  premium growth across all FEHBP plans for 2000 through 2007. Absent  projected decreases in the costs of other factors, these increases would  have raised 2007 average premiums by about 9 percent, rather than the   1.8 percent actual increase for that year. During this same period,  projected decreases in the costs associated with certain other factors,  including benefit changes that resulted in less generous coverage and  enrollee migration to lower-cost plans, generally helped offset premium  growth to a small extent. In 2006 and 2007, projected withdrawals from  reserves particularly helped offset average premium growth by about   2 percentage points for 2006 and about 5 percentage points for 2007.  Regarding the potential effect of the retiree drug subsidy, most plan  officials we interviewed stated that the subsidy would have had a small  effect on premium growth for 2006 had OPM applied for the subsidy and  used it to mitigate premium growth. Officials from two large plans with  higher-than-average shares of retirees, however, stated that the subsidy  would have lowered their plans\u2019 premium growth\u2014officials from one plan  said by at least 3.5 to 4 percentage points for their plan. We estimated that  the subsidy would have lowered premium growth across all FEHBP plans  for 2006 by more than 2 percentage points on average, from the 6.4 percent  average growth rate for 2006 to about 4 percent. OPM officials said that  OPM did not apply for the subsidy because the intent of the subsidy was to  encourage employers to continue offering prescription drug coverage to  Medicare-eligible enrollees, and FEHBP plans were already doing so.", "To explain the factors associated with premium growth, officials we  interviewed from most of the plans with higher-than-average premium  growth cited increases in the cost and utilization of services as well as a  high share of elderly enrollees and early retirees.

The  premiums are intended to cover enrollees\u2019 health care costs, plans\u2019  administrative expenses, reserve accounts specified by law, and OPM\u2019s  administrative costs.

The plans  include benefits for medical services and prescription drugs.", "By statute, OPM can negotiate contracts with health plans without regard  to competitive bidding requirements. Plans meeting the minimum  requirements specified in the statute and regulations may participate in the  program, and plan contracts may be renewed automatically each year.  OPM may terminate contracts if the minimum standards are not met.", "OPM administers a reserve account within the U.S. Treasury for each  FEHBP plan, pursuant to federal regulations. Reserves are funded by a  surcharge of up to 3 percent of a plan\u2019s premium. Funds in the reserves  above certain minimum balances may be used, under OPM\u2019s guidance, to  defray future premium increases, enhance plan benefits, reduce  government and enrollee premium contributions, or cover unexpected  shortfalls from higher-than-anticipated claims.", "On January 1, 2006, Medicare began offering prescription drug coverage  (also known as Part D) to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries. Employers  offering prescription drug coverage to Medicare-eligible retirees enrolled  in their plans could, among other options, offer their retirees drug  coverage that was actuarially equivalent to standard coverage under Part  D and receive a tax-exempt government subsidy to encourage them to  retain and enhance their prescription drug coverage. The subsidy  provides payments equal to 28 percent of each qualified beneficiary\u2019s  prescription drug costs that fall within a certain threshold and is estimated  to average about $670 per beneficiary per year.

First, drug costs for  Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in these plans accounted for a small  proportion of total expenses for all enrollees, and the subsidy would have  helped offset less than one-third of these expenses. Second, because the  same plans offered to currently employed enrollees were offered to  retirees, the effect of the subsidy would have been diluted when spread  across all enrollees.
