Located within the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), CCC was established in 1933 to stabilize, support, and protect farm incomes and prices and to assist in maintaining balanced and adequate supplies of agricultural commodities and in facilitating their orderly distribution. CCC carries out this mission by financing a variety of income and commodity support programs through direct payments and loans. These programs assist producers in the production and marketing of agricultural commodities such as feed grains, wheat, rice, and cotton. In addition, CCC\u2019s mission has been expanded in recent years to include the financing of a range of commodity export, resource conservation, and disaster assistance programs. Among other things, these programs are intended to enhance the price competitiveness of U.S. commodities in foreign markets, assist producers in implementing conservation practices on their farms, and indemnify producers for the extraordinary losses of crops or livestock resulting from weather-related disasters and pest infestations. CCC itself has no employees; its operations are carried out principally through the personnel and facilities of USDA\u2019s Farm Service Agency (FSA), Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS), and Natural Resources and Conservation Service (NRCS).", "CCC finances its operations through two basic mechanisms. First, most of its programs are financed through a borrowing authority of up to $30 billion; CCC borrows these funds from the Department of the Treasury. This borrowing authority is akin to an open line of credit\u2014CCC obtains funds by borrowing against this line of credit on an as-needed basis. CCC receives annual appropriations for its net losses (expenditures that the Corporation will never recover, such as payments to producers) from operations financed through its borrowing authority. These appropriations, along with receipts from some CCC programs (such as loan repayments from producers), enable CCC to repay its debt to the Treasury, thereby replenishing its borrowing authority. Second, CCC finances several of its commodity export programs through direct annual appropriations and other funding.", "Given the diversity of CCC\u2019s operations and the magnitude of its borrowing authority, you asked us to provide information on how CCC funds are spent and controlled.

CCC also funds commodity export, resource conservation, and disaster assistance programs.", "CCC\u2019s programs\u2014including its income and commodity support, resource conservation, and disaster assistance programs and most of its commodity export programs\u2014are classified as mandatory spending programs, and therefore CCC does not require annual appropriations in order to make outlays for them. Instead, CCC borrows funds from the Department of the Treasury to finance these programs. CCC may have outstanding borrowing of up to $30 billion at any one time. In contrast, several of CCC\u2019s commodity export programs\u2014the export credit guarantee programs and the Food for Peace Program\u2014are financed primarily through direct annual appropriations in addition to other funding.", "CCC\u2019s nonrecoverable losses are reimbursed through an annual appropriation.

In addition, CCC collects program receipts from its commodity programs\u2014mainly commodity loan repayments and the proceeds from the sale of commodities held in inventory by CCC.

The reviews of these offices, whose activities are integral to the implementation of CCC\u2019s income and commodity support, resource conservation, and disaster assistance programs, are conducted periodically by designated FSA state and county employees to identify systemic problems in office operations. According to the OIG, without reviewing compilations of these reports, the operations analysis staff would be unable to detect any nationwide problems that required corrective action and, if material, inclusion in FSA\u2019s report under the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act. In response, the operations analysis staff said that it was obtaining copies of the operations review reports from county offices, but that it lacked the staff resources and automated data processing capability to compile and analyze the reports. However, the staff agreed in principle with the need to do so.", "The OIG also found that FSA\u2019s financial systems and related accounting procedures are not designed to readily and efficiently compile the data needed to prepare CCC\u2019s Summary Expenditure Report in a timely manner. According to the OIG, these difficulties occur because CCC\u2019s financial systems, which function on an accrual basis of accounting, cannot provide automated information on cash expenditures. Furthermore, the OIG found that the systems are not designed to provide automated data in the level of detail and categories required for the report. As a result, FSA financial management staff must manually extract some data from CCC\u2019s financial systems and perform certain automated and manual referencing procedures to develop cash expenditures.", "In responding to the OIG\u2019s finding, FSA\u2019s Financial Management Division indicated that it was developing a new accounting system that it believes will significantly improve FSA\u2019s ability to compile expenditure information for the Summary Expenditure Report. However, according to FSA financial management officials, the implementation of this accounting system may not be completed until fiscal year 1999. In addition, these officials said that the limitations of other accounting systems, such as those used by FSA\u2019s disbursing offices, that will \u201cfeed\u201d into the new system will continue to cause problems in preparing this report, necessitating some manual preparation of expenditure data.", "According to the OIG, the material weaknesses it noted in FSA\u2019s internal control structure could adversely affect CCC\u2019s ability to be reasonably assured that its transactions are properly recorded and accounted for so that it can prepare reliable financial statements and maintain accountability over its assets. The OIG also noted that some of these weaknesses were identified in previous audits of CCC\u2019s financial statements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CCC\u2019s Administrative Expenditures Conformed With Statutory Funding Caps, and Its Programs Have Statutory Basis for Using CCC Funds", "paragraphs": ["We found no instances in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 in which CCC\u2019s funding for administrative uses exceeded the relevant statutory funding caps.
