Recent legislation and presidential directives have called for a robust and integrated biosurveillance capability; that is, the ability to provide early detection and situational awareness of potentially catastrophic biological events. The Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act directed GAO to report on the state of biosurveillance and resource use in federal, state, local, and tribal governments. This report is one in a series responding to that mandate. This report addresses (1) federal efforts that support a national biosurveillance capability and (2) the extent to which mechanisms are in place to guide the development of a national biosurveillance capability. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed federal biosurveillance programs, plans, and strategies and interviewed agency officials from components of 12 federal departments with biosurveillance responsibilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies with biosurveillance responsibilities--including the Departments of Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, and Agriculture--have taken or plan to take actions to develop the skilled personnel, training, equipment, and systems that could support a national biosurveillance capability. GAO previously reported that as the threats to national security have evolved over the past decades, so have the skills needed to prepare for and respond to those threats. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) officials stated that skilled personnel shortages threaten the capacity to detect potentially catastrophic biological events as they emerge in humans, animals, or plants. To address this issue, some federal agencies are planning or have taken actions to attract and maintain expertise using fellowships, incentives, and cooperative agreements. Moreover, CDC has called for the development of a national training and education framework to articulate professional roles and competencies necessary for biosurveillance. The Department of Agriculture has also developed training programs to help ensure that diseases and pests that could harm plants or animals can be identified. In addition, federal agencies have taken various actions designed to promote timely detection and situational awareness by developing (1) information sharing and analysis mechanisms, (2) laboratory networks to enhance diagnostic capacity, and (3) equipment and technologies to enhance early detection and situational awareness. While national biodefense strategies have been developed to address biological threats such as pandemic influenza, there is neither a comprehensive national strategy nor a focal point with the authority and resources to guide the effort to develop a national biosurveillance capability. For example, the National Security Council issued the National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats in November 2009. While this strategy calls for the development of a national strategy for situational awareness, it does not meet the need for a biosurveillance strategy. In addition, this strategy includes objectives that would be supported by a robust and integrated biosurveillance capability, such as obtaining timely and accurate insight on current and emerging risks, but it does not provide a framework to help identify and prioritize investments in a national biosurveillance capability. GAO previously reported that complex interagency efforts, such as developing a robust, integrated, national biosurveillance capability, could benefit from an effective national strategy and a focal point with sufficient time, responsibility, authority, and resources to lead the effort. Efforts to develop a national biosurveillance capability could benefit from a national biosurveillance strategy that guides federal agencies and other stakeholders to systematically identify risks, resources needed to address those risks, and investment priorities. Further, because the mission responsibilities and resources needed to develop a biosurveillance capability are dispersed across a number of federal agencies, efforts to develop a biosurveillance system could benefit from a focal point that provides leadership for the interagency community."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Homeland Security Council direct the National Security Staff to identify, in consultation with relevant federal agencies, a focal point to lead the development of a national biosurveillance strategy to guide the capability's development.

In January 2010,  the bipartisan Commission for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass  Destruction Proliferation and Terrorism, which was established by the  Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act to address  the threat that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction poses to  the United States, gave the nation a failing grade in its efforts to enhance  capabilities for rapid response to prevent biological attacks from inflicting  mass casualties. The commission reported that unless the world  community acts, it is more likely than not that a weapon of mass  destruction will be used in a terrorist attack somewhere in the world by  the end of 2013. Further, the report stated that such a weapon is more  likely to be biological than nuclear.", "The U.S. government has a long history of employing disease surveillance  activities to help limit malady, loss of life, and economic impact.  Traditional disease surveillance activities involve trained professionals  engaged in monitoring, investigation, confirmation, and reporting in an  effort to further various missions including, but not limited to, detecting  signs of pathogens in humans, animals, plants, food, and the environment.  However, in recent years experts and practitioners, reacting to an  increasing awareness of the speed and intensity with which a biological  weapon of mass destruction or highly pathogenic strain of emerging  infectious disease could affect the nation, have sought to augment the  traditional surveillance activities with biosurveillance programs and  systems. The dual purposes of biosurveillance are (1) to detect as early as  possible a potentially catastrophic biological event and (2) to enhance  situational awareness\u2014including awareness, comprehension of meaning,  and projection into the near future about events\u2014by improving the quality  of information available to support response and policy actions in the face  of such an event.", "Since at least the 1990s, there has been an ongoing and evolving effort by  the federal government in conjunction with its partners to address the  need for a strategic approach to improving disease surveillance and  response. Recognizing the potentially devastating consequences that could  flow from biological events\u2014both natural and intentional\u2014responsible  federal officials and other experts have, in various formats, called for  better integration of multiple disparate surveillance and related mission  activities to help support a strong national biosurveillance capability. For  example, among the federal government\u2019s initiatives to confront the threat  of biological events was a presidential directive that called for the  development of a national, robust, and integrated biosurveillance  capability that provides timely warning and ongoing characterization of  catastrophic biological events, drawing on the systems, resources, and  information from existing human, animal, plant, food, and environmental  surveillance activities. Ensuring the development of such a national  biosurveillance capability involves attention to the resources\u2014personnel,  training, equipment, and systems\u2014that underpin various surveillance  efforts across the federal government, as well as mechanisms to help  direct effective and efficient use of those resources to support the  capability.", "Many federal departments and agencies pursue missions and manage  programs that might contribute to a national biosurveillance capability.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the federal  agency with primary responsibility for disease surveillance\u2014including  food-borne illnesses\u2014in humans. The Department of Agriculture (USDA)  is the primary federal agency with responsibility for pest and disease  surveillance in animals and plants as well as food-borne illnesses within  the agricultural industries. As the agency with lead responsibility for  protecting against and responding to threats and hazards to the nation, the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is concerned with the prevention  of bioterrorist attacks as well as preparing the nation to respond to  biological events in order to minimize human and economic losses. In  addition, the Homeland Security Council was established by executive  order in 2001 to serve as a mechanism for ensuring coordination of  homeland security-related activities of executive departments and  agencies and effective development and implementation of homeland  security policies. The establishment of the Homeland Security Council  was subsequently codified in statute with the enactment of the Homeland  Security Act of 2002.", "Around the same time that the President issued a directive calling for a  national biosurveillance capability, Congress articulated a similar goal  with respect to a biosurveillance capability in the Implementing  Recommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 (9/11 Commission  Act)\u2014to enhance the capability of the federal government to rapidly  identify, characterize, localize, and track biological events of national  concern by integrating and analyzing data relating to human, animal, plant,  food, and environmental surveillance. The 9/11 Commission Act also  directed us to examine the state of federal, state, local, and tribal  government biosurveillance efforts and the federal government\u2019s use of  resources to implement and execute biosurveillance systems. This report  responds in part to that mandate by examining the extent to which a  national, robust, integrated biosurveillance capability has been  established. Specifically, the report examines the following: (1) federal  agency efforts to provide resources\u2014personnel, training, equipment, and  systems\u2014that support a national biosurveillance capability; and (2) the  extent to which mechanisms are in place to guide the development of a  national biosurveillance capability.", "In December 2009, in response to the same mandate, we issued work  addressing the efforts of DHS\u2019s National Biosurveillance Integration  Center (NBIC), which was established in the 9/11 Commission Act to  enhance federal biosurveillance capabilities. We also have ongoing work  on state, local, tribal, and territorial biosurveillance activities, from which  we expect to issue a report in winter 2011.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed key legislation and presidential  directives related to biosurveillance, including the Homeland Security Act  of 2002, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and  Response Act of 2002, the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act of  2006, and Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD) 9, 10, and  21. This report focuses on surveillance efforts for one or more of the  following biosurveillance domains: human health, animal health, plant  health, food, and the environment (specifically, air and water). It focuses  primarily on seven federal departments that have key roles and  responsibilities\u2014based on agency missions, statutory responsibilities,  presidential directives, or programmatic objectives\u2014for biosurveillance  and related mission activities, including protecting public health,  agriculture, and national security. These departments are the Departments  of Agriculture, Defense (DOD), Homeland Security, Health and Human  Services, Interior (DOI), as well as the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) and the United States Postal Service (USPS). To understand how  federal agencies have planned or coordinated their biosurveillance efforts,  we reviewed key agency and interagency documents, including concepts  of operation, surveillance and implementation plans, and biodefense  strategies. For example, we reviewed NBIC\u2019s Concept of Operations for  the National Biosurveillance Integration System, agency strategies and  plans for conducting surveillance, and the National Security Council\u2019s  National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats. We conducted  interviews with officials and observed operations at federal agencies\u2014 particularly DHS, HHS, and USDA, which have the larger and more direct  mission responsibilities for biosurveillance and related mission  activities\u2014to understand their roles and responsibilities and how their  activities support the national biosurveillance capability. We also collected  and analyzed information on the resources, systems, and equipment they  use; the other governmental and nongovernmental entities with whom  they partner; and the limitations they have encountered in conducting  their biosurveillance missions. We also reviewed reports published by  nongovernmental entities\u2014for example, the National Academy of  Sciences\u2019s Institute of Medicine and the Center for Biosecurity\u2014related to  public health, disease detection, bioterrorism, biodefense, and emergency  management. We also reviewed our prior work on federal surveillance  activities, food safety, intergovernmental and interagency collaboration,  and national security issues. We compared information we collected from  agency documents and officials to our previous work related to national  strategies and focal points for leadership to identify mechanisms that  could help support crosscutting efforts to build and sustain a national  biosurveillance capability. More detailed information about our scope  and methods appears in appendix I.", "We conducted this work from December 2008 through May 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As shown in figure 1, biosurveillance is a concept that emerged in  response to increased concern about biological threats from emerging  infectious diseases and bioterrorism. Biosurveillance is carried out by and  depends on a wide range of dispersed entities. Federal biosurveillance  responsibilities, likewise, are spread across an array of agencies and  provided for in multiple laws and presidential directives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Social and Economic Conditions Contribute to the Threat of a Catastrophic Biological Event", "paragraphs": ["In an era of rapid transit and global trade, the public health and  agricultural industries, as well as natural ecosystems including native  plants and wildlife, face increased threats of naturally occurring outbreaks  of infectious disease and accidental exposure to biological threats.  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), infectious diseases  are not only spreading faster, they appear to be emerging more quickly  than ever before. Since the 1970s, newly emerging diseases have been  identified at the unprecedented rate of one or more per year. There are  now nearly 40 diseases that were unknown a generation ago. In addition,  during the last 5 years, WHO has verified more than 1100 epidemic events  worldwide. Figure 2 shows select disease occurrences worldwide in  recent decades. Additional information about the occurrences is available  electronically in pop-up boxes on the map or in print in appendix II.  Examples of emerging infectious disease include Severe Acute  Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), H5N1 influenza (avian flu), and the H1N1  influenza that resulted in a global pandemic in 2009. The potential impact  of these events is not limited to public health. For example, the avian  influenza outbreaks in Asia and Eastern Europe were reminders that the  public health sector is intrinsically linked to the agriculture, trade,  tourism, economic, and political sectors.", "Due to the rapid and constant movement of people and commodities\u2014 such as animals, plants, and food\u2014biological agents can be carried by  passengers or containers on airplanes and boats and slip across national  borders unnoticed as infectious diseases are transferred from person to  person through close contact with one another. Ecological changes, such  as changes in land use, and the globalization of the food supply are also  associated with the emergence and spread of infectious disease. Animals  also face the threat of infectious disease, and in some cases diseases\u2014 known as zoonotic diseases\u2014can be transferred between animals and  people. Zoonotic diseases represent at least 65 percent of newly emerging  and reemerging infectious diseases in recent decades. Many important  factors contribute to the proliferation of zoonotic diseases, including the  growth of human and domestic animal populations and the increasingly  close physical proximity within which humans and their domestic animals  live with wild animals.", "Some disease agents can also be weaponized and used as weapons of mass  destruction to disrupt economies and endanger human, animal, and plant  health. Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, there has been concern  that another terrorist attack on U.S. soil could involve biological or other  weapons of mass destruction. Groups like the Center for  Counterproliferation Research at the National Defense University and the  Commission on the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction  Proliferation and Terrorism (established by the 9/11 Commission Act)  have warned that the biological weapons threat is real, with evidence that  terror groups like Al Qaeda have had active biological weapons programs  in the past and approximately 12 countries are suspected of seeking  biological weapons.", "Emerging disease and bioterrorism concerns also surround the nation\u2019s  agriculture and food supply, as well. Plant resources in the United States,  including crops, rangelands, and forests, are vulnerable to endemic,  introduced, and emerging pathogens. More than 50,000 plant diseases  occur in the United States, caused by a variety of pathogens. Increasing  globalization and international trade activities create a likelihood that  many other exotic plant pathogens will arrive in the United States in the  coming years.", "In addition, the United States faces growing food safety challenges from  fresh and processed foods that become contaminated well before they  reach the consumer, leading to outbreaks linked to foods that have not  previously been associated with foodborne illnesses. For example,  according to USDA, leafy greens are the category of produce most likely to  be associated with an outbreak. Recent outbreaks of foodborne illness  have also focused public attention on the increasing potential for  widespread dissemination of contaminated products. For example,  beginning in September 2006, the United States experienced an outbreak  of E. coli 0157:H7 associated with the consumption of tainted spinach  grown in California; this outbreak resulted in 205 victims in 26 states  suffering severe disease. Three people died. Widespread outbreaks of  other foodborne illnesses, such as Salmonella, have also occurred from  contaminated peanut butter and tomatoes.", "We reported in March 2005 that although the United States has never  experienced a terrorist attack against agriculture, it is vulnerable for a  variety of reasons, including the relative ease with which causative agents  of diseases that could affect livestock and crops could be obtained and  disseminated. Many of these diseases are endemic in other parts of the  world and can be extracted from common materials, such as soil. Farms in  general are easily accessible because they are located in rural areas and  have minimal security, especially crop farms. Moreover, the highly  concentrated breeding and rearing practices of our livestock industry may  make it a vulnerable target for terrorists because diseases could spread  rapidly and be difficult to contain. For example, between 80 and 90  percent of grain-fed beef cattle production is concentrated in less than 5  percent of the nation\u2019s feedlots. Therefore, the deliberate introduction of a  highly contagious animal disease in a single feedlot could have serious  economic consequences. In addition, a number of disease causing agents  can infect and be spread by wildlife. According to officials at DOI, it may  be difficult to control a novel pathogen if it is introduced into native  wildlife. These officials noted that the gregarious habits of many wildlife  species can enhance their susceptibility to catastrophic losses from select  diseases, and because of their mobility, there is potential for infectious  disease to spread quickly to new locations and populations.", "Finally, pathogens can be carried through or introduced into the  environment, causing damage to health and economies. Drinking water  utilities across the country have long been recognized as potentially  vulnerable to terrorist attacks of various types, including physical  disruption, bioterrorism, chemical contamination, and cyber attack.  Damage or destruction by terrorists could disrupt not only the availability  of safe drinking water, but also the delivery of vital services that depend  on these water supplies, such as fire suppression. People and animals also  face the threat of becoming ill from inhaling certain biological agents,  some of which occur naturally in our environment and some that can be  weaponized and intentionally released to cause catastrophic disruption.  Concerns about weaponized airborne pathogens were amplified by the  anthrax attacks conducted through the mail a month after the September  11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Laws and Presidential Directives Direct Agencies to Strengthen Biosurveillance and HSPD- 21 Calls for an Integrated National Biosurveillance Capability", "paragraphs": ["As figure 3 shows, federal laws and directives call for HHS, USDA, DHS,  and other federal agencies to take action to strengthen biosurveillance.  The most recent of these\u2014Homeland Security Presidential Directive-21\u2014 synthesizes and reiterates actions in other laws and directives, explicitly  calling for a national biosurveillance capability. In calling for this national  capability, HSPD-21 discusses certain aspects related to the personnel,  training, equipment, and systems needed. For example, among the  elements it describes as necessary for a robust and integrated national  capability are enhanced clinician awareness, stronger laboratory  diagnostic capabilities, integrated biosurveillance data, and an  epidemiologic surveillance system with sufficient flexibility to tailor  analyses to new syndromes and emerging diseases.", "In the case of biological threats, timely detection of biological agents is a  precursor to effective response; therefore, a national biosurveillance  capability like the one described in HSPD-21 is an essential tool in the  nation\u2019s preparedness to confront catastrophic threats. Capabilities to  carry out any broad emergency management mission\u2014like  biosurveillance\u2014are made up of (1) planning, (2) organization and  leadership, (3) personnel, (4) equipment and systems, (5) training, and (6)  measurement/monitoring.", "A national biosurveillance capability like the one described in HSPD-21  would largely rely on an interagency effort because the mission activities  and accompanying resources that support the capability\u2014personnel,  training, equipment, and systems\u2014are dispersed across a number of  federal agencies. For example, HHS\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) has primary responsibility for human health and USDA  for plant and animal health. Responsibility for various food sources is split  between USDA and HHS\u2019s Food and Drug Administration (FDA). DHS, as  the agency with primary responsibility for securing the homeland, is  responsible for coordinating efforts to prevent, protect against, respond  to, and recover from biological attacks. The resources\u2014personnel,  training, equipment, and systems\u2013that support a national biosurveillance  capability reside within the separate agencies that acquire and maintain  them in pursuit of their missions, which overlap with but are not wholly  focused on biosurveillance.", "A national biosurveillance capability also depends upon participation from  state, local, and tribal governments. Few of the resources required to  support the capability are wholly owned by the federal government. The  responsibility and capacity for collecting most information related to  plant, animal and human health, food, and environmental monitoring  resides within state, local, and tribal governments, or private sector  entities\u2014such as hospital and other private health care providers. In the  United States, state and local public health agencies have the authority  and responsibility for carrying out most public health actions, and the  federal government generally cannot compel state, local and tribal  governments, or private sector entities to provide information or  resources to support federal biosurveillance efforts. Instead, individual  federal agencies, in pursuit of their missions, attempt to build  relationships and offer incentives\u2014like grants\u2014to encourage voluntary  cooperation with specifi c federal efforts.", "In addition, although traditional disease surveillance systems designed to  collect information on the health of humans, animals, and plants are the  backbone of biosurveillance\u2014because they, among other things, provide  mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and specific information about  outbreaks to inform response\u2014they also rely on time-intensive testing and  confirmation practices. The inherent time lag, combined with limitations  arising from reliance on data not owned by the federal government,  presents challenges that limit the promise of traditional disease  surveillance alone to provide the timely detection and situational  awareness that is the goal of a national biosurveillance capability.

We reported in September 2009 that as the threats to national security\u2014 which include the threat of bioterrorism and pandemic outbreak\u2014have  evolved over the past decades, so have the skills needed to prepare for and  respond to those threats. We also found that like other federal efforts to  address modern national security challenges that require collaboration  among multiple agencies, an effective biosurveillance capability relies on  qualified, well-trained professionals with the right mix of skills and  experience. Figure 4 provides examples of the workforce involved with  detection and situational awareness activities that support biosurveillance.", "The public health and health care workforce is expected to continue to  confront shortfalls in the coming years, which could threaten the federal  government\u2019s ability to develop a national biosurveillance capability.  According to CDC officials, serious public health and health care  workforce shortages currently exist due to factors such as the exodus of  retiring workers, an insufficient supply of trained workers, inadequate  funding, and uncompetitive salaries and benefits. In discussing concerns  about looming workforce shortages, CDC officials pointed to a December  2008 Association of Schools of Public Health estimate that by 2020 the  nation will face a shortfall of over 250,000 public health workers. CDC  officials said that states and communities nationwide report needing more  public health nurses, informaticians, epidemiologists, laboratory workers,  statisticians, and environmental health experts. Moreover, the Institute of  Medicine stated in 2009 that the unevenness of organizational and  technical capacity at state and local levels across the public health system  weakens the nation\u2019s preparedness to detect and, especially, to respond to  and manage the consequences of a major health emergency.", "We also reported in February 2009 that the animal health field faces  workforce shortages that could affect the ability of professionals to be  prepared and enabled to detect and warn of biological events. For  example, USDA officials have expressed concern about the future size and  skills of the veterinarian workforce, particularly veterinary pathologists  who are integral to the work conducted in USDA\u2019s diagnostic laboratories,  including work on diseases that threaten animal and human health.  Further, USDA officials have also expressed concern about the availability  of taxonomists, whose expertise is critical to characterizing threats and  providing warning of a potentially catastrophic biological event involving  plants.", "Although the workforce shortages threaten to diminish capacity to detect  signals of potentially catastrophic biological events as they emerge, some  federal agencies are planning or have taken actions to help mitigate them.  In particular, in its National Biosurveillance Strategy for Human Health,  CDC named the biosurveillance workforce as one of its priority areas. To  enhance workforce capability, CDC\u2019s strategy calls for assessing the  current biosurveillance workforce capability, identifying and addressing  gaps, ensuring the workforce is competent, developing recruitment and  retention strategies for professionals across diverse fields, and  establishing a national-level governance body for the biosurveillance  workforce across agency boundaries and disciplines. CDC has also taken  actions to help increase the number of public health workers, including  extending service and learning fellowships in epidemiology, informatics,  laboratory, and management.", "Moreover, with respect to animal and plant workforce, the federal  government is implementing measures to help ensure an adequate  workforce. For example, we reported in February 2009 that USDA has set  a goal of recruiting at all veterinary colleges and universities. In addition,  USDA is using incentives, such as bonuses, to attract and maintain its  veterinarian workforce.  In addition, USDA has identified tactics to build  the capacity and retain the experience of taxonomists. USDA is also using  cooperative agreements and funding to enlist taxonomic services from  nonfederal institutions to identify and confirm identifications of exotic  plant pests. According to USDA officials, they have increased the number  and variety of these agreements in recent years, increased availability of  professionals who can help identify threats to plants by nearly 50 percent  in the past 20 years, and created a career ladder to retain experienced and  talented workers. Further, in response to recommendations we made in  February 2009 to address veterinarian shortages, in November 2009, the  Office of Personnel Management established the governmentwide  Veterinary Medical Officer Talent Management Advisory Council.  The  purpose of the council is to lead the design and implementation of a  governmentwide workforce strategy for federal veterinary medical  workers.

Training and accreditation programs are  essential to developing a knowledgeable workforce with the skills needed  to identify potential threats to human, animal, and plant health. An  effective medical response to a biological event would depend in part on  the ability of individual clinicians and other professionals to identify,  accurately diagnose, and effectively treat diseases, including many that  may be uncommon. The opportunity to evaluate signs and symptoms of  diseases of concern relies on trained professionals possessing the  knowledge needed to identify and order the right lab test to confirm a  diagnosis. In addition, detection and warning of a disease threat also relies  on these professionals knowing who to call to report the finding.", "One challenge federal officials relayed to us is that because the concept of  biosurveillance is relatively new and has been evolving over the last  decade, there are few if any specialties or concentrations in  biosurveillance within epidemiology or other programs. They further  noted that while some university programs are beginning to address the  issues in their curricula, the general lack of biosurveillance or cross- domain specialties, curricula, and classes in these programs limits the  feedback loop between academics and practitioners that helps support  innovative solutions.", "Another training challenge is keeping up with changes in issues,  technologies, and systems. CDC officials told us that public health workers  are always challenged with keeping abreast of developments. For  example, when a new laboratory tool or method is developed, public  health workers must be trained to use them. Epidemiologists also must be  trained and educated about new or emerging health issues, infections,  software, information technology systems, and tools. Clinicians require  continuing education to remain astute. These CDC officials noted that  maintaining expertise in a rapidly changing field is difficult, yet having  professionals with the right expertise is critical in protecting the public\u2019s  health, as well as for emergency preparedness and response. For USDA,  the increased risks to animal and public health from animal diseases have  presented challenges because the expertise needed to identify and  respond to the risks of zoonotic diseases has not been defined.", "Further, a DOI official expressed concern about maintaining skills and  expertise of wildlife health professionals. According to this official,  identifying, characterizing, and mitigating threats involving free ranging  fish and wildlife populations call for specific training and expertise in  wildlife epidemiology and wildlife disease ecology. These officials  expressed concern about whether federal inspectors receive sufficient  training or have sufficient resources to address disease in free-ranging  wildlife populations.", "Federal agencies have taken actions to help respond to the challenges  arising from evolving fields of study and increased risks of outbreaks  impacting more than one domain. For example, in the National  Biosurveillance Strategy for Human Health, CDC has called for the  development of a national training and education framework to articulate  professional roles and competencies necessary for biosurveillance. The  strategy also noted that in addition to the traditional public health  professions trained in surveillance, there is a need to recruit professionals  from other diverse fields including informatics and computational  sciences to enhance data sharing, as well as the plant and veterinary  sciences to help understand how diseases flow among humans, animals,  and plants. Along these lines, CDC has developed a public health  informatics fellowship program, which is designed to help address the  need for practitioners with a mastery of sophisticated electronic systems  to facilitate communication and data exchange among public health  personnel at the local, state, and federal levels. Officials at HHS also noted  that the National Institute of Health\u2019s National Library of Medicine has  funded 18 University-Based Biomedical Informatics Research Training  programs, of which 10 have special Public Health Informatics tracks.", "USDA has also developed training programs to ensure their first detectors  are knowledgeable on diseases and pests of significance. For example,  USDA has an accreditation program for veterinarians and views the cadre  of veterinarians it has accredited as the front line of surveillance for  diseases of significance that are not specifically monitored through a  program. These accredited state and federal veterinary officials\u2014as we  reported in 2005, approximately 80 percent of the veterinary workforce\u2014 are dispersed throughout the country and are trained to observe signs and  symptoms of diseases and unusual occurrences of illness or death in  animal populations. According to USDA, the United States depends  extensively on accredited veterinarians for official functions, such as  inspecting, testing, and certifying animal health. For plant surveillance,  USDA\u2019s National Plant Diagnostic Network began the National First  Detector Training Program in 2003. The program offers training to aid  USDA\u2019s surveillance of plants for pests and diseases. First detectors are  individuals who in the course of their activities are in a position to notice  an unusual plant pest outbreak, a pest of concern, or symptoms of a pest  of concern. The individuals may include growers, nursery producers, crop  consultants, pesticide applicators, and master gardeners, among others.

This may  be particularly important as many disease agents have the potential to be  weaponized and many of the recent emerging infectious diseases are  zoonotic.", "In reviewing the federal response, we reported that the analysis of the outbreak continued for weeks as  separate investigations of sick people and of dying birds.

NBIC supports the BCOP through a system\u2014the  Biosurveillance Common Operating Network (BCON)\u2014that monitors,  tracks, and disseminates available NBIS-partner information, but relies  largely on information from publicly available sources, such as news  articles. One of the primary data sources for BCON is an international  information gathering service called Global Argus, a federally funded  program in partnership with Georgetown University. The service searches  and filters over 13,000 overseas media sources, in more than 34 languages.", "A similar type of initiative underway at some federal agencies involves  developing and maintaining communication tools for information sharing  within specialized disciplines. These communication tools may include  functions that allow users to send and receive information or view the  status of ongoing events. One such tool is a Web-based forum that  provides a secure environment for the exchange of information on case  reports and allows users to request information or expertise from other  users. For example, one such communication tool developed by CDC,  known as Epi-X, provides a secure Web-based forum for public health  officials to post case reports of conditions and ask other health officials  whether they have also seen cases of the condition. The officials can also  discuss similarities in the cases that may indicate how the disease is  spreading and suggest mitigation measures\u2014for example, product  recalls\u2014that could be implemented. In this way, health officials can  leverage both information and analytical capacity across agencies, levels  of government, and different regions of the country to help support the  early detection and situational awareness goals of biosurveillance. For  example, the forum may help them to more quickly and comprehensively  determine whether diseases seem to be widespread and what caused them  and to discuss treatment options in a secure environment. For more  information on specific communication tools, see appendix IV.", "In addition, we reported in May 2003 that electronic reporting of data can  facilitate data exchange among different databases and allow more rapid  and accurate analysis of information from multiple sources. CDC officials  noted that laboratory reports could be received by CDC in 72 hours if  exchanged through an electronic system, as opposed to the up to 2 weeks  it can take for laboratory report hard copies to be sent through the mail.  Further, because it facilitates data exchange, standardization can help  support the vision of integrated surveillance systems articulated in HSPD-9  and 21. According to CDC officials, the potential benefits of electronic  reporting of data in a standardized format are striking and can eliminate  the need for analysts to dedicate valuable time to processing and  translating data provided in different formats expressed using various  terminologies. For example, during the 2001 anthrax event, the results of  laboratory tests for anthrax were reported in different formats (e.g.,  emailed text, mailed hard copy, as attachments in different software  programs), and using different terminology, such as \u201cBacillus anthracis,\u201d  \u201cB. anthracis,\u201d and \u201cAnthrax.\u201d These variations in report format and  language required analysts at CDC to spend time translating and compiling  the data into information that could inform decision making during the  event.", "To support effective and efficient information sharing, some agencies have  efforts underway to promote electronic reporting of information in a  standardized format. For example, CDC\u2019s Public Health Information  Network (PHIN) initiative aims to advance the development of  interoperable surveillance and other public health systems at federal,  state, and local levels. The initiative defines data and messaging standards  and provides guidance for public health entities to follow in building  systems that meet compatibility and interoperability standards for  enhanced electronic information sharing. Additionally, HHS, through  initiatives to support nationwide health information exchange, has defined  specific standards that promote the exchange of biosurveillance  information among health care providers and public health authorities.", "Within CDC, several surveillance systems have been developed and  implemented in accordance with PHIN standards to promote electronic  information sharing. One of these is the National Electronic Disease  Surveillance System (NEDSS). A primary goal of NEDSS is the ongoing,  automatic capture and analysis of data that are already available  electronically to minimize the problems of fragmented, disease-specific  surveillance systems. The initiative is intended to promote efficient and  effective data management and information sharing by eventually  consolidating the data collection of CDC\u2019s various programmatic disease  surveillance activities in one place. For more information on programs  that support standardization and electronic data exchange, see appendix  IV.", "To further enhance and support biosurveillance activities, CDC, DHS and  other federal agencies have developed or taken action to gather electronic  data from syndromic surveillance systems. Syndromic surveillance uses  health-related data collected before diagnosis to look for signals or  clusters of similar illnesses that might indicate an outbreak. Examples of  syndromic surveillance data are prediagnostic health-related information  like patients\u2019 chief complaints recorded by a health care worker at the  admissions desk of a hospital emergency room and information collected  on over-the-counter sales of antidiarrheal medicines that could indicate  gastrointestinal disease outbreaks. We reported in 2004 that because these  syndromic systems monitor symptoms and other signs of disease  outbreaks instead of waiting for clinically confirmed reports or diagnoses  of a disease, some experts believe they can increase the speed with which  outbreaks are identified. However, we also reported in September 2004  and November 2008 that the ability of syndromic surveillance to more  rapidly detect emerging diseases or bioterror events has not yet been  demonstrated, and questions about its cost-effectiveness arise. An  example of a syndromic surveillance system is CDC\u2019s BioSense\u2014another  CDC system that was developed and implemented in accordance with data  and message standards defined by the PHIN initiative. BioSense collects  electronic data that are voluntarily shared by participating state, local, and  other federal public health entities, including data related to infections,  injuries, and chronic diseases. Currently the system collects chief  complaint data from 570 hospitals and 1,100 federal clinics, and sales data  from over 10,000 pharmacies. Because the data and messages are sent and  received in standardized formats, the data are integrated into the BioSense  system, reducing the need for analysts to manually interpret or manipulate  data and are analyzed by the system to enhance the nationwide situational  awareness capabilities of public health analysts at CDC.", "Even as standardization and data and information-sharing tools improve,  other challenges will likely impede information sharing for biosurveillance  purposes across federal, state, and local levels of government. We and  others have noted that numerous challenges have impeded efforts to  coordinate and collaborate across organizational boundaries to integrate  biosurveillance and other national security activities. Some such  challenges are inherently intergovernmental issues and arise because most  of the information needed for biosurveillance is generated and owned  outside of the federal government. Therefore, there is limited assurance  that state and local governments can or will fully participate in federal  information sharing and standardization initiatives like PHIN. CDC  officials expressed concern about the differing levels of capacity and  willingness among states to participate in data standardization and  electronic information-sharing initiatives.", "Moreover, information-sharing challenges also occur among the federal  agencies. As we reported in December 2009, NBIC has faced collaboration  challenges and has been largely unsuccessful in obtaining from federal  partners key resources needed to support data integration and shared  analytical capacity. Federal officials from agencies participating in the  National Biosurveillance Integration System\u2014such as CDC, USDA, and  FDA\u2014described challenges to sharing such information, including  concerns about trust and control over sensitive information before it is  vetted and verified. In addition, NBIC officials told us and we previously  reported that much of the information available to help achieve  biosurveillance goals is unstructured and not readily processed by a  computer system; while, data that are more easily computer processed  often lack the context needed to make appropriate conclusions about  whether anomalies actually signal a potential problem."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Laboratory Networks to Enhance Laboratory Diagnostic Capacity", "paragraphs": ["Over the past decade, the federal government has leveraged and enhanced  its laboratory capabilities, capacity, resources, and expertise for detecting  and warning about biological threat agents by developing and  implementing laboratory networks at the federal, state, and local level. In  addition, the federal government led an effort to establish a consortium of  laboratory networks that further integrates a number of these networks. In  June 2005, 10 federal agencies signed a Memorandum of Agreement  establishing the Integrated Consortium of Laboratory Networks (ICLN).  The purpose of this consortium is to establish a coordinated and  operational system of laboratory networks that provide timely, high- quality, and interpretable results for early detection of acts of terrorism  and other events that require integrated laboratory response capabilities.  ICLN\u2019s individual laboratory networks focus on detecting biological threat  agents that affect humans, animals, or plants that contaminate the air,  water, or food supply. These laboratory networks which comprise the  ICLN are shown in table 1.", "The federal government is developing and implementing equipment and  technologies that can provide additional information to support early  detection and situational awareness. For example, the federal government  is applying diagnostic technologies to help detect and monitor biological  events. Studying disease agents at the molecular level can provide  information for situational awareness. Techniques to determine and  attribute the source of biological events can be important for both natural  and intentional events. In a natural event\u2014such as a foodborne illness\u2014it  can help speed detection, focus the investigation, and characterize the  extent and severity of disease. For intentional events, it can provide  critical information to help determine the scope of the attack and  contribute to law enforcement investigations. One example of such a  system is CDC\u2019s PulseNet, a national network of public health laboratories  that perform DNA \u201cfingerprinting\u201d as a means to help with early  identification of outbreaks of foodborne illness with a common source and  enhance situational awareness during an event. The PulseNet program  provides a tool for participating laboratories to upload and then compare  the genetic \u201cfingerprints\u201d of foodborne pathogens isolated from samples  taken from sick individuals. The network can identify and label each  fingerprint pattern to permit the rapid comparison of these patterns with  others in the PulseNet database. PulseNet officials told us that this process  can take roughly 2 weeks after receiving a sample. FDA, USDA, CDC, and  state public health officials have access to the PulseNet database. See  appendix IV for more information on foodborne disease monitoring  systems and diagnostic technologies.", "Federal agencies have also developed technologies to detect biological  agents in drinking water and air. Drinking water utilities across the  country have long been recognized as potentially vulnerable to terrorist  attacks of various types, including physical disruption, bioterrorism,  chemical contamination, and cyber attack. People also face the threat of  becoming ill from inhaling certain biological agents\u2014whether naturally  occurring or intentionally weaponized and released to cause disease and  disruption. EPA has developed a system to detect contamination of  drinking water and USPS, DOD, and DHS have developed sensor  technologies to detect aerosolized biological agents in the air. EPA\u2019s Water  Security Initiative program developed a contamination warning system to  allow local water utilities to monitor drinking water for contamination by  chemical, biological, and radiological agents. The contamination warning  system has been designed to provide timely detection and appropriate  response to biological events.", "The system, however, is not widely distributed. Currently, the Greater  Cincinnati Water Works in Cincinnati, Ohio is the only locality that has the  system fully operating. EPA is assisting local water districts in four other  locations\u2014New York City, San Francisco, Dallas, and Philadelphia\u2014with  implementation the contamination warning system as part of a five-city  pilot project each of which EPA officials stated is to last for four years and  be complete in 2012. Local water utilities are to implement this system on  a voluntary basis and operate it at their own expense. According to EPA  officials, no contamination warning systems has yet been proven to be  effective and sustainable for drinking water systems, but the Water  Security Initiative is attempting to design, deploy, and test an effective and  sustainable system. For more information on the Water Security Initiative,  see appendix IV.", "USPS, DOD, and DHS have developed and implemented technologies to  sample the air and test for specific biological agents. One of these, DHS\u2019s  Biowatch program, has been implemented in more than 30 metropolitan  areas and tests for the presence of multiple biological threat agents.  USPS has deployed an indoor monitoring system\u2014Biohazard Detection  System\u2014at mail distribution centers nationwide that automatically detects  and warns of the presence of the anthrax organism in the air surrounding  mail-sorting equipment. DOD has also developed indoor and outdoor  monitoring systems to detect airborne chemical, biological, radiological,  or nuclear agents in order to protect military interests.", "However, these sensor technologies are limited in their ability to provide  early detection because there are constraints on the speed with which the  diagnostic testing can be performed. For example, DHS\u2019 Biowatch sensor  technology depends on air filters which must be collected and transported  to a laboratory for diagnostic testing, which can take more than a day.  According to senior officials from the Office of Health Affairs and the  Science and Technology Directorate at DHS, research and development to  eliminate the need for manual collection of samples is underway, but the  science needed to do so may not yet be fully mature.

Various federal statutes and presidential directives call for biosurveillance  actions, culminating with HSPD-2\u2019s most recent call for a robust,  integrated national biosurveillance system that draws upon and  synthesizes the capabilities of multiple existing systems across a number  of federal departments and agencies. The challenges in achieving this  vision are many and difficult to successfully address, such as acquiring and  retaining staff with sophisticated skills and melding disparate information  and data systems.

Because a biological incident,  originating from nature or deliberate acts, could emerge through any  number of means\u2014plant, animal, air, and human transmission\u2014it is  essential that federal agencies collaborate to leverage their capabilities  and find effective and efficient solutions and strategies for detection and  analysis. Although efforts like the National Biosurveillance Strategy for  Human Health, USDA\u2019s Strategy for the National Animal Health  Surveillance System, and DHS\u2019s National Biosurveillance Integration  Center are potentially useful steps in developing a robust, national  biosurveillance capability, they do not provide a unifying framework and  structure for integrating dispersed capabilities and responsibilities.

These include the  Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, the Council of State  and Territorial Health Epidemiologists, and the National Association of  County and City Health Officials. These organizations represent state and  local epidemiologists, public health organizations, and officials involved in  public health at the state and local levels.

In addition, we met with experts  from research organizations that study biodefense issues, including the  University of Pittsburgh Center for Biosecurity, the Congressional  Research Service, and the National Academies\u2019s Institute of Medicine.  These organizations identified biosurveillance efforts at the federal level,  discussed the status of the federal government\u2019s efforts to build a national  biosurveillance capability, and described limitations on the federal  government\u2019s biosurveillance efforts and efforts to build a robust and  integrated national biosurveillance capability.", "During our review of documents and interviews with knowledgeable  officials, we compiled a list of more than 100 programs from across the  federal government which may be relevant to biosurveillance. We also  asked federal officials to explain how these programs may contribute to  detecting biological events or providing situation-specific information to  decision makers during an ongoing event, and to identify other programs  to consider for inclusion in our study. For each program identified, we  interviewed officials and requested descriptive information on their  program, such as the coverage and frequency of populations surveyed;  diseases on which data are collected by these biosurveillance efforts and  their characteristics; how data are used to conduct biosurveillance; how  information is reported to support early detection of a biological event or  improved information during an event; the status of these efforts; and  costs to operate these efforts. These programs were included in our  catalog because they may contribute to biosurveillance in one of the  following five ways:  1.  Provide information to establish disease baselines, such as infection  rates and geographical distribution of disease outbreaks.  2.  Provide opportunities for astute clinicians to detect outbreak signals,  such as collecting syndromic data that, when analyzed, may indicate  an emergent infectious disease.  3.  Provide disease-specific information to enhance response; for  instance, data which may be used to identify and trace sources of  detected outbreaks.  4.  Represent a surveillance effort designed to shorten the time to detect  disease outbreaks, such as environmental sensors designed to detect  specific biological agents.  5.  Provide tools to integrate data or coordinate information sharing; for  instance, communication platforms on which analysts can discuss  biosurveillance issues of concern.", "For each agency in our review, we compiled the information on each  program into a standard profile and validated this information with  program officials. We asked these program officials to verify the accuracy  of the information, to add missing information, or make technical  comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.

Detecting a  signal that warns of a potential or imminent biological threat of national  concern requires the ability to discern whether disease occurrence is  abnormal based on its general characteristics, as well as where, when, and  how severely the disease has historically occurred. This information is  also useful for projecting how an outbreak may progress during response  to a potentially catastrophic biological event.", "The U.S. government has a long history of monitoring human, animal, and  plant health\u2014in some cases for more than a century\u2014to help limit  malady, loss of life, and economic impact. Disease surveillance for human  health at the national level was established to assess the status of the  public\u2019s health, develop policy to define public health priorities, and  provide assurance of the prevention and control of disease. The federal  government uses a nationally notifiable disease List as the foundation of  its human health surveillance efforts.", "Fifty-seven jurisdictions, including state and local health departments,  voluntarily report cases of certain diseases named on the list of nationally  notifiable diseases to the CDC. CDC uses these reports from the states to  monitor national health trends, formulate and implement prevention  strategies, and evaluate state and federal disease prevention efforts. In  addition to the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, CDC  maintains programs aimed at detecting and preventing specific diseases,  such as influenza. (For more information on specific programs, see app.  IV.) In general, these programs rely on participating health providers to  send case reports to CDC on a periodic basis. According to CDC, the  timeliest of these disease-specific surveillance programs have participants  report the data weekly. Other programs may send information to the CDC  on a monthly or annual basis. CDC compiles the data, checks for accuracy,  clarifies inconsistencies, and reports national level data at regular  intervals. Information that is collected through the National Notifiable  Disease Surveillance System and other public health surveillance  programs can be applied to determine the scope and forecast the course of  an outbreak to enhance situational awareness to guide decision makers\u2019  response efforts.", "Similarly, to help protect the nation\u2019s agricultural sector, USDA has  routine reporting systems and disease-specific surveillance programs for  domesticated animals and some wildlife that can provide information to  support the early detection goal of biosurveillance. Information gathered  through these efforts can also help characterize and project the nature and  scope of an outbreak\u2014for example, by providing the number of infected  animals and where they are located\u2014to enhance situational awareness.  For instance, state animal health officials obtain information on the  presence of specific, confirmed clinical diseases in livestock, poultry, and  aquaculture in the United States from multiple sources\u2014including  veterinary laboratories, public health laboratories, and veterinarians\u2014and  report this information to the USDA\u2019s National Animal Health Reporting  System (for more information, see app. IV). USDA has also developed  control and eradication programs of specific diseases that threaten the  health of animals to reduce the incidence of disease and to provide timely  detection of some foreign animal diseases, resulting in smaller outbreaks.  These programs are carried out in targeted high-risk populations of  various animal and aquaculture species to identify cases of the disease,  stem the spread of disease, and take measures to ensure certain diseases  that are no longer common in the United States do not reemerge.", "In addition, USDA coordinates with state departments of agriculture, state  foresters, universities, and industry partners to conduct pest detection  surveys of agricultural plants and forests annually. By working with states  to identify and prioritize pest threats of national interest and coordinate  pest surveys, USDA\u2019s Pest Detection Program provides nationwide  information about the presence of select plant pests.", "According to officials at DOI, currently there is no national reporting  system for diseases of wildlife, making it difficult to track national trends  in wildlife disease.

It also maintains a database on  disease findings in wild animals and on wildlife mortality events.", "For foodborne illness, CDC, USDA, and FDA can partner to use their  traditional surveillance activities to enhance situational awareness during  outbreaks. First, CDC identifies an outbreak of foodborne illnesses based  on reports from state and local health care providers. Then, it works with  the other federal partners to characterize the extent of the illness and  identify its source, using a system called OutbreakNet (see app. IV for  more information). While CDC works with its external partners to collect  additional information about identified cases\u2014such as characteristics of  the people affected, the types of food consumed, and the possible location  of the consumption\u2014FDA and USDA work with state and local food safety  agencies to gather additional information about the source by conducting  inspections and testing food samples.", "Although information provided by traditional surveillance activities is  essential for biosurveillance purposes, the nature of those systems  presents inherent challenges that prevent them from being wholly  sufficient as tools for timely detection and enhanced situational  awareness. We and others have reported that traditional disease reporting  has generally been slow and incomplete, and, therefore, not well suited to  provide early detection and warning of a disease outbreak or pest  infestation. For example, federal agencies collecting data from state,  local, and private-sector entities generally rely on voluntary participation,  which limits the federal government\u2019s ability to institute controls at the  initial collection and data entry points to help ensure accuracy,  completeness, or timely reporting. As we reported in 2004, most states  maintain a modified version of the national notifiable disease list that  reflects the public health priorities of the particular state, but do not  consistently reflect CDC\u2019s list of notifiable diseases. Therefore, some local  health care providers are not obligated to report diseases on the national  notifiable disease list. For instance, five states, including Alabama,  Nevada, New Hampshire, Oregon, and Washington do not require local  health care providers to report cases of smallpox\u2014which could be used by  terrorists as a biological weapon\u2014even though CDC requests this  information.", "We also previously reported that state officials have experienced  significant underreporting by health care providers in their efforts to  collect disease data and underreporting can adversely affect public health  efforts by leading to erroneous conclusions about trends in incidence, risk  factors for contracting a disease, appropriate prevention and control  measures, and treatment effectiveness. According to the Institute of  Medicine, many health care providers do not fully understand their role in  infectious disease surveillance, including their role as a source of data.  Furthermore, despite the existence of state notifiable disease lists and  related laws, some providers may be unaware of basic reporting  requirements.", "Also posing a challenge to timely detection and situational awareness is  the need for laboratory confirmation. Although mechanisms exist for  reporting suspected cases of disease, traditional public health systems rely  on laboratory-confirmed cases. Laboratory confirmation, while important  to establishing accurate information, adds up to 2 weeks to the reporting  process, as results are analyzed and communicated at the state and local  levels before they are reported to federal health officials. Officials from  CDC and USDA attribute this delay to the inability of labs to communicate  test results electronically.", "Timely detection and situational awareness are also problems for livestock  biosurveillance. For example, we reported in 2005 that USDA does not  always use rapid diagnostic tools to test animals at the site of an outbreak.  Although, according to experts, on-site use of rapid diagnostic tools is  critical to speeding diagnosis, containing the disease, and minimizing the  number of animals that need to be slaughtered, USDA employd them only  within selected laboratories. DOD used rapid diagnostic tools to identify  disease agents on the battlefield, but USDA officials considered the  technology to be still under development. A 2002 USDA exercise  estimated that, under the current approach, a foreign animal disease such  as Foot and Mouth Disease would spread rapidly, necessitating the  slaughter of millions of animals and cause staggering financial losses\u2014 precisely the type of high-visibility destruction some experts told us  terrorists seek. In response to our recommendation, USDA is in the  process of evaluating the costs and benefits of using penside rapid  diagnostic tools.
