However, these losses were offset by insurance premiums paid to FHA by borrowers, not by the U.S. Treasury.", "As an alternative to allowing lenders to foreclose on FHA borrowers in default, HUD operates a mortgage assignment program. By taking assignment of mortgages (purchasing mortgages) rather than having lenders foreclose on them, HUD can at times avoid foreclosure losses for FHA, help borrowers retain their homes, and provide borrowers with an opportunity to avoid foreclosure. For borrowers accepted into the program, FHA pays the mortgage debt, takes assignment of the mortgage from the lender, and develops a new repayment plan for the borrower under which monthly mortgage payments can be reduced or suspended for up to 36 months. HUD, acting as mortgagee, collects mortgage payments from the borrowers while allowing them to live in their homes. The number of FHA borrowers participating in this program has tripled in the last 6 years, totaling about 71,500 at the end of fiscal year 1994; their unpaid principal balances total about $3.7 billion. About 1 in 4 defaulted single-family FHA loans are assigned rather than immediately foreclosed.", "Concerned about the rising number of loans assigned to HUD and their financial impact, you asked us to determine whether the mortgage assignment program (1) helps borrowers avoid foreclosure, (2) reduces FHA\u2019s foreclosure losses, and (3) can be improved to reduce such losses."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The mortgage assignment program was created in 1959 by section 230 of the National Housing Act. However, HUD only began operating the program in 1976 in settlement of a lawsuit. The program, intended to help mortgagors who have defaulted on HUD-insured loans to avoid foreclosure and retain their homes, provides mortgagors with financial relief by reducing or suspending their mortgage payments for up to 36 months until they can resume making regular payments. To enter the program, a mortgagor must apply and meet certain criteria, including that the default must have been caused by circumstances beyond the mortgagor\u2019s control, such as the loss of employment or serious illness. However, after the 36-month period, a mortgagor\u2019s delinquencies are not required to be eliminated or reduced by a specified time other than over the remaining term of the loan, which HUD can extend for up to 10 years.", "Most of the mortgages assigned under the program are insured by FHA under its Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (Fund). For these mortgages, the cost of the assignment program is financed by the Fund, which insures private lenders against losses on mortgages that finance purchases of one to four housing units. To cover losses, FHA deposits borrowers\u2019 insurance premiums in the Fund. Historically, the Fund has been financially self-sufficient. However, if it were to become exhausted, the U.S. Treasury would have to directly cover lenders\u2019 claims and administrative costs.", "We based our analysis of whether the assignment program helps borrowers avoid foreclosure and reduces FHA\u2019s foreclosure losses primarily on data from two of HUD\u2019s national information systems\u2014the Single-Family Mortgage Notes Servicing System and the Single Family Insurance System\u2014as of September 30, 1994. We used these data to analyze foreclosures and delinquencies and forecast the foreclosure rates of the 68,695 mortgages assigned since fiscal year 1989. We also built a cash flow model and prepared analysis to estimate the financial loss to FHA\u2019s Fund from these loans by estimating the revenue and expense flows for these loans over their life. Our data reflect nationwide mortgage assignment statistics on single-family loans that were entered in HUD\u2019s two national data systems as the Fund\u2019s mortgage defaults that were assigned to avoid foreclosure\u201471,500 mortgage loans as of September 30, 1994. Loans assigned to HUD for other reasons were not included in our analyses. To determine how to improve the program and reduce its losses, we obtained information from four other mortgage assistance institutions that provide foreclosure relief to borrowers in default on single-family housing loans\u2014the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Rural Housing and Community Development Service (RHCDS), Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). (See app. I for additional details on the scope and methodology of our work.)", "To improve the administration of the program, HUD recently has initiated changes to the program. These include selling its currently assigned loans; implementing Activity Tracking, an automated collection computer subsystem; studying the costs and benefits of alternatives to foreclosure; permitting lenders to provide relief to borrowers, such as suspending or reducing mortgage payments, without prior approval from HUD; implementing a \u201ccompromise offer\u201d program under which borrowers\u2019 loans are considered to be paid off for less than the amount owed; and implementing for a limited period of time a program for reducing interest rates on certain program loans. HUD has also proposed contracting for loan servicing.", "The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) considers FHA\u2019s mortgage assignment program to be a high-risk area because controls do not protect the financial interests and resources of the government. In the President\u2019s fiscal year 1996 budget, OMB stated that the servicing of assigned loans was expensive, inefficient, and labor-intensive. Also, OMB noted that there is little evidence that the program achieves its goal of giving homeowners a chance to keep their homes during a temporary interruption of income. According to OMB, legislative changes should be considered to reduce or eliminate the assignment of loans in the future by greater reliance on the private sector as well as legislation to reduce the program\u2019s forbearance period from 3 years to 1 year. To reduce the number of assigned loans and the required servicing of loans, OMB recommended that HUD continue to sell its assigned loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mixed Results in Avoiding Foreclosures Permanently", "paragraphs": ["We forecast, on the basis of historical data on the disposition of program loans, that about 35,400 (52 percent) of the 68,695 borrowers accepted into the program since fiscal year 1989 will eventually lose their homes through foreclosure. For the remaining loans (48 percent), we forecast that borrowers will pay off the loans and avoid foreclosure by either selling their homes or refinancing their mortgages, often after remaining in the program for a lengthy period of time. Some of these borrowers who eventually pay off their loans may have, under the compromise program, paid HUD an amount less than the total amount owed. (A detailed discussion of our methodology for forecasting the program\u2019s foreclosure rates appears in app. II.)", "Figure 1 shows our estimates of conditional foreclosure rates based on loans that remained active until a given year and were assigned during a 17-year period (fiscal years 1977 through 1994). We estimate that conditional foreclosure rates will increase sharply over the first 7 years after a loan is accepted into the program, peaking at about 13 percent. The program\u2019s conditional foreclosure rates substantially exceed those experienced on FHA\u2019s nonassigned single-family loans during the same 17-year period.", "HUD\u2019s records show that since fiscal year 1977, at least 96,500 borrowers have been accepted into the assignment program. About 71,500 of these borrowers were still assigned to HUD as of September 30, 1994. A large portion of them\u201439,603, or 55 percent\u2014have been in the program fewer than 3 years (see fig. 2).", "As shown in figure 3, of the approximately 71,500 borrowers in the program as of September 30, 1994, 59 percent were current with forbearance agreements or current with their original mortgage payments. The remaining 41 percent were delinquent or pending foreclosure. Only 5 percent of the program\u2019s borrowers were making full mortgage payments.", "When borrowers remained in the program beyond the 3-year relief period and therefore were required to make full mortgage payments, the proportion of borrowers current with repayment agreements dropped and the proportion of borrowers in foreclosure increased. Similarly, the average amount of delinquencies owed by borrowers increased. (See app. III for detailed information on borrowers\u2019 compliance with repayment agreements.)", "Most of the 25,041 borrowers who left the program for whom records are available did so following foreclosure, while other borrowers paid off their loans and at times eliminated delinquencies. Of the 25,041 borrowers, HUD foreclosed on 14,707 borrowers (59 percent), while 10,334 borrowers (41 percent) paid off their loans. An example of a borrower who left the program through foreclosure is a Chicago mortgagor who was accepted into the program in November 1990 and was $9,495 behind in payments at that time. The loan\u2019s outstanding principal balance at that time was $34,862. Although HUD determined that the mortgagor\u2019s income was sufficient for him to make more than full mortgage payments, the mortgagor made only five payments over the next 3-1/2 years. By September 1994, when HUD began foreclosure, the borrower was over $25,000 behind in payments.", "Borrowers who paid their loans generally did so following the sale of their homes at a price that, in most cases, allowed them to repay the outstanding mortgage and the delinquent amount. For example, a Seattle, Washington, mortgagor defaulted on an $89,890 loan 15 months after obtaining it. The mortgagor found a new job after experiencing a salary cut on his previous job. When the mortgage was assigned in November 1990, the mortgagor was already $6,333 behind in payments. Initially, the mortgagor was allowed to make reduced payments of $400 per month, about half the full payment. After 2 years, the mortgagor was unable to pay off the delinquent amount, which had grown to $19,229 when he sold the house in April 1993. However, the sale proceeds enabled the mortgagor to fully satisfy his obligation to HUD. (See app. IV for cases in which some borrowers paid off mortgages and others did not.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Program\u2019s Operating Procedures Contribute to High Foreclosure Rates", "paragraphs": ["Given the lower income of FHA borrowers, which can make them financially vulnerable, the assignment program\u2019s operating procedures do not provide assurance that delinquent amounts will be repaid and that borrowers will succeed in avoiding foreclosure. These procedures include (1) accepting borrowers into the program after they have accumulated substantial loan delinquencies and therefore have an uncertain repayment ability and (2) a 36-month relief period when payments can be reduced or suspended, which permits outstanding delinquencies to grow even if borrowers are current with repayment agreements. Most FHA home loans are for moderate-income individuals. These individuals are likely to be more financially vulnerable than other mortgagors who are able to obtain home loans without FHA\u2019s assistance.", "Under the assignment program, a borrower must miss at least three mortgage payments before submitting an application to enter the program. During the acceptance process, additional payments may be missed, and substantial delinquencies may accumulate over a period of 6 months or more. We randomly selected, as case studies, 136 loans from four loan categories\u2014paid-off, current with payments, foreclosed on, and delinquent\u2014from files at four HUD field offices\u2014Boston, Chicago, Ft. Worth, and Spokane\u2014to illustrate, among other things, the amount of delinquencies that borrowers had accumulated when they entered the program. Our review of these loans showed that borrowers were, on average, 8 months behind in mortgage payments of $4,014 on their loans at the time they were accepted into the program. These loans had an average outstanding principal balance of $39,886 at that time. These figures, and others reported later that are based on these case studies, are not projectable to the universe of assigned loans.", "The program also allows 3 years of reduced or suspended mortgage payments. For borrowers who qualify for this program feature, delinquencies for unpaid interest and other expenses continue to grow. As shown in figure 4, as of the end of fiscal year 1994, all borrowers in the program for more than 1 year but fewer than 3 years experienced, on average, an increase in delinquent amounts from about $7,000 to $15,000. On average, after 9 years in the program, delinquencies for all borrowers continued to grow, peaking at about $22,000. Similarly, delinquencies for borrowers current with forbearance agreements also grew at about the same rate as those of all borrowers during the first 3 years but began to decline after the borrowers had been in the program for 3 years.", "Once the 36-month relief period is completed, borrowers are expected to resume full mortgage payments and, if possible, increase payments to reduce accumulated delinquent amounts. If borrowers cannot make full payments, HUD may initiate foreclosure action. There is no requirement, however, that borrowers pay off their delinquent amounts or leave the program in a specified time period, other than over the remaining term of the loan, which HUD can extend for up to 10 years. About 31,900 (45 percent) of the borrowers in the program as of September 30, 1994, had been in the program for more than 3 years. About 1,000 borrowers had been in the program for over 15 years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Assignment Program Increases FHA\u2019s Losses", "paragraphs": ["In assessing the cost to FHA of operating the program, we (1) forecasted the foreclosure and payoff rates for loans assigned since fiscal year 1989 and (2) estimated the expenditure and revenue flows for these loans over their expected life. Using historical data on the performance of individual loans in the assignment program, we developed estimates of loan-servicing costs, acquisition costs, and other costs for all surviving loans over their anticipated life. In addition, we estimated revenues received from loan payoffs, mortgage payments, and the sale of properties after foreclosure. In order to estimate the program\u2019s net loss to FHA, we compared the resulting cost per assigned loan to the average loss that FHA would have experienced on these loans had they gone directly to foreclosure rather than to the assignment program.", "Our analysis showed that losses on the 68,695 loans assigned to HUD since fiscal year 1989 will be an estimated average of about $49,000 each. We subtracted from the estimated average loss of $49,000 the estimated $27,000 loss that FHA would have experienced had the loans not entered the assignment program, leaving an estimated net loss to FHA of about $22,000 per assigned loan.", "On the basis of this analysis, we estimate that FHA\u2019s Fund will experience additional losses of about $1.5 billion over what it would have incurred if the loans entering the assignment program since fiscal year 1989 had immediately gone to foreclosure instead. Table 1 summarizes our estimates of the expenses and income associated with the program\u2019s 68,695 loans over their life. The additional costs incurred by FHA are primarily attributable to the partial payments it received on mortgage loans; delays in receiving funds from the sale of the assignment program\u2019s properties that are eventually foreclosed; administrative costs; and advances made by HUD for taxes, insurance, and other expenses.", "FHA borrowers\u2019 premiums pay for these losses, not the U.S. Treasury. To cover losses, FHA deposits borrowers\u2019 insurance premiums in the Fund. According to 12 U.S.C. 1711, the Fund must meet or endeavor to meet statutory capital ratio requirements designed to achieve actuarial soundness; that is, it must contain sufficient reserves and funding to cover estimated future losses resulting from the payment of claims on defaulted mortgages and administrative costs.", "To offset substantial losses to the Fund that were incurred in the 1980s, FHA borrowers were required to pay higher insurance premiums beginning in July 1991. In our recent report and testimony on the actuarial soundness of the Fund, we reported that the economic value of FHA\u2019s Fund clearly has improved significantly in recent years but that the Fund as of the end of fiscal year 1993 had not yet accumulated sufficient capital reserves to cover losses during periods of adverse economic conditions as defined by the law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Options Available to Reduce the Program\u2019s Losses", "paragraphs": ["Options are available to the Congress to change the assignment program that would reduce the losses incurred by the program. These options include directing HUD to shorten the 36-month relief period, set a time limit on eliminating delinquencies, and accept into the program only those borrowers who can afford half or more of their mortgage payments.", "Information provided by officials from four mortgage lending or purchasing institutions indicates that these institutions provide borowers in default a shorter time period to begin full mortgage payments under the original loan or a modified loan and to repay delinquent amounts. They also use techniques different from HUD\u2019s that could improve the effectiveness and reduce the cost of the program.", "VA usually capitalizes the delinquency and reamortizes the new loan balance (i.e. extends the time period for payment of the loan principal) as soon as it acquires the loan. In addition, VA will reduce the interest rate on the reamortized loan to as low as 3 percent below the current market rate if a reduction is necessary to bring the veteran\u2019s payments to an affordable level. VA may also acquire loans for borrowers who are not able to resume payments immediately if they show the ability to be able to do so in a reasonable period of time. VA field stations have significant discretion in deciding what constitutes a reasonable period; however, it is usually not extended beyond the point at which the loans reach a full year\u2019s delinquency. During this period, VA may provide relief by agreeing to accept payments of less than a full installment or by extending complete forbearance. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provide relief for up to 18 months. They may extend this period longer under certain circumstances, but during the relief period, the borrower must eliminate the delinquency. Although RHCDS does not have a specified relief period, an RHCDS official told us that its county supervisors provide short-term relief on a case-by-case basis.", "Another option for reducing the program\u2019s losses would require borrowers to pay half or more in monthly mortgage payments. We estimate that if all 68,695 borrowers who have entered the program since fiscal year 1989 had paid and continue to pay 50 percent of their original mortgage payments, the program would lose about $433 million more than what would have occurred if the loans had gone immediately to foreclosure, or substantially less than our estimated loss of $1.5 billion. The mortgage payments being made by borrowers as of September 30, 1994, averaged about a third of the original mortgage payments. These borrowers would have to pay 67 percent of their original mortgage payments for the program to break even.", "In addition to a shorter period of relief, other mortgage assistance institutions stress resolving the delinquency by the end of the relief period. In contrast, the mortgage assignment program gives borrowers many years beyond the relief period to repay a delinquency, as evidenced by some borrowers who have been in the program for 15 years. If the borrower is unable to pay the delinquency within the 3-year relief period, HUD\u2019s regulations require that the borrower must repay the delinquency on or before the mortgage maturity date, but the borrower may be given up to 10 years beyond the maturity date.", "Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and VA also work closely with borrowers to provide long-term solutions, such as modifying the structure of a loan to resolve delinquencies. Officials from these organizations told us that they believe techniques such as refinancing and reducing interest rates to reduce monthly mortgage payments are successful alternatives to costly foreclosure. However, HUD seldom uses its authority to modify borrowers\u2019 mortgage loans. Rather, HUD uses repayment agreements both before and after the 36-month relief period to secure repayment of outstanding delinquencies. These are generally 1-year term agreements based on the borrowers\u2019 estimated income and expenses to repay a debt. HUD field office officials told us that the preparation and monitoring of these agreements requires extensive staff resources.", "According to HUD\u2019s Director, Single-Family Servicing Division, the primary strategy HUD plans to follow to reduce the program\u2019s losses is to sell its assigned loans and thereby reduce the number of loans it holds and services. In June 1994, HUD sold at auction about 15,000 performing and nonperforming (loans in compliance with repayment agreements and those not in compliance) single-family loans that were not in default when assigned, including 357 loans that were facing foreclosure. FHA received about $12.6 million from the sale of the 357 loans, which represents about 70 percent of the unpaid principal balance on these loans. FHA officials consider these results encouraging and believe that future sales will provide significant relief to field offices that have a large number of assigned loans. FHA plans to sell an additional 15,000 loans in calendar year 1995 and most of the remaining assigned loans over the next 2 years. By fiscal year 1997, HUD expects its inventory to consist only of newly accepted assigned loans that would be held by HUD for a short time before being sold. The purchasers of these loans would be required to comply with HUD\u2019s assignment program\u2019s servicing standards, including permitting 3 years of reduced or suspended mortgage payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The assignment program operates at a high cost to FHA\u2019s Fund and has not been very successful helping borrowers avoid foreclosure in the long run. The program helps about half of the financially troubled homeowners to avoid foreclosure permanently. However, the costs incurred by HUD to achieve this result exceed the costs that would have been incurred if all assigned loans had gone immediately to foreclosure without assignment. While FHA borrowers\u2019 premiums pay these costs, not the U.S. Treasury, the program\u2019s costs lessen the Fund\u2019s ability to build reserves.", "Options are available to the Congress to make changes to the program to reduce its losses. The options, such as requiring borrowers to pay more in monthly mortgage payments, would reduce but not eliminate the program\u2019s additional losses. The assignment program would have to require borrowers to begin full mortgage payments within a few months after entering the program in order to nearly eliminate the additional losses incurred by the program.", "All of these options pose the trade-off of preventing some individuals and families from entering the program who would eventually bring their loans current and/or avoid foreclosure. However, unless changes are made to the present assignment program, its costs will continue to make it more difficult for the Fund to maintain financial self-sufficiency."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["If the Congress believes that the additional losses incurred by the assignment program are excessive in relation to the number of borrowers that avoid foreclosure, it could consider eliminating the program. However, since some borrowers who default on their FHA mortgages can avoid foreclosure with some assistance, the Congress could consider establishing a short-term, temporary relief program of a few months for such borrowers to replace the mortgage assignment program.", "If, however, the Congress believes that the borrowers served by FHA\u2019s single-family program are at high risk and therefore in need of additional assistance in the form of forbearance, changes to the program should be considered that would reduce but not eliminate additional future losses. The following are options that the Congress could consider:", "Require borrowers to (1) resume full mortgage payments within a shorter time period than the 36 months currently allowed and/or (2) eliminate outstanding delinquency amounts within a specified period. For example, the Congress may wish to require that borrowers resume full mortgage payments within 1 year of entering the program and eliminate outstanding delinquencies within 2 years.

The comments focused on (1) the effects of past litigation efforts on HUD\u2019s management of its mortgage assignment program and (2) alternatives available to prevent foreclosure other than the options we suggest for changing forbearance relief (reducing or suspending monthly mortgage payments for a certain period of time) provided through the assignment program.", "Specifically, HUD commented that litigation has affected the evolution and operation of the assignment program. According to HUD officials, a consent decree, which the Department entered into in 1979, and litigation preceding and subsequent to entering the consent decree known collectively as the Ferrell v. Pierce litigation have limited HUD\u2019s options to modify the assignment program. The Department believes the Congress needs to understand these limitations when it considers changing the program. Under the consent decree, HUD agreed to, among other things, (1) operate the assignment program for 5 years in compliance with its January 1979 handbook without any modification that would curtail the rights of the mortgagors under the program and (2) after the 5-year period, operate either the present assignment program or an equivalent substitute to help mortgagors avoid foreclosure during periods of temporary financial distress. A series of lawsuits concerning HUD\u2019s implementation of the consent decree followed.", "We agree that the consent decree and the Ferrell v. Pierce litigation have limited HUD\u2019s options to change the program. It is because of this limitation that the forbearance relief options we present were addressed to the Congress and not to the Secretary of HUD. So that the Congress has a full understanding of the litigation\u2019s effects when considering options to forbearance relief provided through the mortgage assignment program, HUD\u2019s description of the current operation of the assignment program and the effect of past litigation on that program is provided in appendix V.", "HUD also commented that if the Congress were to consider alternative relief measures for borrowers, there are methods widely used to prevent foreclosure by the private sector that are not discussed in our report. The alternatives to forbearance relief cited by HUD included (1) \u201cmodifying defaulted borrowers\u2019 mortgage loans by reducing interest rates, (2) extending the remaining period of the loans, and/or (3) paying partial claims to remedy default with a new obligation from the borrower to repay FHA the amount of the claim.\u201d HUD noted that while our report discusses some relief options used with other federally related mortgages, the options we present to the Congress for change do not include such options. HUD also commented that pursuant to section 918 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, it is studying the adequacy of existing programs authorized to help FHA borrowers avoid foreclosure and alternatives to foreclosure being used with other federally related mortgages. HUD expects to issue this study shortly.", "We agree that there are alternatives to foreclosure other than the forbearance relief measure provided through HUD\u2019s assignment program. In fact, our report points out that Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and VA provide borrowers long-term solutions, such as modifying the structure of their loans to resolve delinquencies. Officials from these organizations told us that they believe techniques such as refinancing and reducing interest rates to reduce monthly mortgage payments are successful alternatives to costly foreclosure.", "However, this report did not seek to analyze all possible alternatives to the mortgage assignment program because of the focus of our work and our desire not to duplicate HUD\u2019s efforts in studying such alternatives. However, it should be noted that HUD has seldom made use of modified mortgage loans. Consequently, assessing the merits of modifying financially troubled FHA loans to single-family borrowers in lieu of the forbearance that HUD currently provides is difficult. In addition, no matter how successful other alternatives are in avoiding foreclosure, not all borrowers will be able to resume mortgage payments immediately, which is required under such options as refinancing, reducing interest rates, and extending the period of the loan.", "We recognize, however, that to the extent that such alternatives are effective in helping borrowers retain their homes without entering HUD\u2019s assignment program, they could be a more effective way to avoid costly foreclosure than the current assignment program. HUD\u2019s study on alternatives to foreclosure should be helpful to the Congress in assessing these alternatives. Our report should be helpful to the Congress in assessing changes needed to HUD\u2019s mortgage assignment program to reduce losses on those mortgages that enter the program, regardless of other alternatives that may be used to prevent assignment.", "While HUD officials agreed that the program\u2019s losses have exceeded those that would have been incurred if loans had gone immediately to foreclosure without assignment, they did not agree with the magnitude of our estimate of the additional cost that FHA incurs. We received no official estimate from HUD of the additional cost, although one HUD analyst said that he believes the additional cost is about one-third of our estimate.

We also assessed revenues received from early loan payoffs, mortgage payments, and sales of properties following foreclosure.

From these databases, we obtained information on the initial characteristics of each loan, such as the year the loan was assigned, the initial unpaid principal and delinquency amount, and the loan interest rate and term.

Other factors that affected costs included the percentages of unpaid principal to original loan amount, receivables due FHA to original loan amount, advances to original loan amount, and the policy year of the loans. In addition, we assumed that FHA would continue to receive partial and delayed payments for some mortgages assigned and that both foreclosure and prepayment behavior will remain the same in future years as it has been in the past. This is a critical assumption because of data limitations. As a result, our analysis does not take into account that the loans assigned from fiscal years 1989 through 1994 may differ from earlier loans in ways that affect their prepayment and foreclosure probabilities beyond 6 years from the date of assignment.", "Given these assumptions, we projected future loan activity for foreclosures, prepayments, and surviving loans.
