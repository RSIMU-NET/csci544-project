The bonus amounts vary, mainly on the basis of the services\u2019 needs in certain critical specialties and the length of reenlistment. Fifty percent of the bonuses are paid in initial bonus payments and the remaining 50 percent in equal anniversary payments for each year of reenlistment.

Before 1974, the military had provided a $2,000 reenlistment bonus for all servicemembers willing to reenlist. During that year, DOD raised concerns that the bonus program was not focused enough to meet the services\u2019 needs. In 1974, Congress authorized the use of selective bonuses, which gave the services flexibility to adjust the bonuses paid to reenlistees to aid in staffing the most hard-to-fill critical specialties. Overall, the Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program is intended to increase reenlistments in specialties deemed critical by the Secretary of Defense.", "To implement the Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program, DOD issued a directive in 1985, updated in 1996, which assigns specific responsibilities for administering the program to the Office of the Secretary of Defense and to the services\u2019 Secretaries. Under this directive, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy, under the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, is responsible for establishing procedures for administering the selective reenlistment bonus program. Specifically, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy is responsible for establishing (1) criteria for designating military specialties that qualify for bonuses, (2) criteria for individual members\u2019 eligibility for bonuses, and (3) reporting and data requirements for the annual review and evaluation of programs as well as individual services\u2019 requests for military skill designations. In addition, according to the DOD directive, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management Policy is responsible for annually reviewing and evaluating the services\u2019 enlisted personnel bonus programs in conjunction with the annual budget cycle. These reviews are to include an assessment of the criteria used for designating critical military specialties. As a result of these reviews, the Office of the Secretary of Defense is to make the revisions needed to attain specific policy objectives.", "At the same time that DOD issued its 1985 directive, it issued an instruction providing the services with guidance for managing their programs. However, this instruction was canceled in 1995, and replacement guidance has not been issued, although the updated overarching directive remains in effect. DOD did not issue replacement guidance because of administrative and legal questions that have only recently been resolved, thus clearing the way for reissuance of the guidance. The canceled instruction was to require the services to provide a balanced evaluation of five factors in identifying critical specialties: a consideration of (1) serious understaffing in adjacent years, (2) persistent shortages in total career staffing, (3) high replacement costs, (4) the arduousness or unattractiveness of the work, and (5) whether the specialty is essential to the accomplishment of defense missions. In addition, the instruction was to require that a reasonable prospect must exist for enough improvement in the occupation to justify the cost of providing the bonus. The instruction was also to require the services to provide DOD with reports on the status of their programs and on the status of the specialties included in their programs.", "The Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program has experienced substantial cost growth, as shown in figure 1.

The service secretaries designate which specialties are eligible to receive bonuses. (See app. II for more discussion of bonus determinations.) Total bonus amounts are determined by multiplying (1) the service member\u2019s current monthly basic pay by (2) the number of additional years of obligated service and by (3) a bonus multiple that can range from 0.5 to 15. The bonus multiples are determined by each service for all specialties they deem critical. For example, an enlistee who earns $24,000 per year and reenlists for 4 years in an occupation with a multiple of 4 would receive a reenlistment bonus of $32,000. This amount is calculated by multiplying the monthly basic pay of $2,000 by the number of reenlistment years (4) and by the multiple (4). The bonus multiples are determined by each service for all eligible specialties, and the occupations that they deem most critical or hardest to fill would generally receive higher multiples. Navy officials told us that they also consider alternative wages that certain specialties can obtain outside of the military when determining the size of the bonus multiplier for a critical specialty.", "Each of the services has established its own guidance for implementing its selective reenlistment bonus program. This guidance varies by service. Generally, the services\u2019 guidance establishes eligibility criteria for servicemembers and in some cases also defines criteria for selecting specialties for inclusion in the program. The Navy and Marine Corps have adopted all the original criteria that were established by DOD\u2019s 1985 program instruction. The Air Force updated its program guidance in 1998, which only partially reflected DOD\u2019s original program instruction. This instruction includes the criteria for individual servicemembers\u2019 eligibility as well as guidance for the selection of specialties. The Army has established guidance for individual servicemembers\u2019 participation in the program but not specific guidance for determining which specialties should be included in the program.", "In addition to establishing their own guidance for selecting individuals and occupations to include in the program, the services have also defined some other program characteristics, which also differ between the services as shown in table 1 for fiscal year 2001. While congressional authorization allows the maximum amount of a bonus to be $60,000 and the maximum multiple to be 15, the services determine their own limit. In fiscal year 2001, the maximum bonus ranged from $35,000 to $60,000, and the services\u2019 maximum bonus multiple ranged from 5.0 to 8.0. The table also displays the minimum and maximum reenlistment periods.", "The Army, Navy, and Air Force pay bonuses to reenlistees with an initial payment and equal annual installments over the reenlistment period. The initial payment is made at the time of the reenlistment or when the reenlistment period begins and is equal to 50 percent of the total bonus. The remaining 50 percent is paid in equal annual payments over the term of the reenlistment, and the payments are called \u201canniversary payments.\u201d In the example above, the initial 50-percent payment would be $16,000, and the anniversary payments would be $4,000 for 4 years. Starting in fiscal year 2001, the Marine Corps began paying the entire bonus in one lump-sum payment at the beginning of the reenlistment period.

Marine Corps officials told us that they utilize all of these criteria in selecting specialties eligible for a bonus. However, the Navy uses only the following four criteria when identifying specialties for inclusion in the program: (1) severe undermanning, (2) severe career undermanning, (3) high training and replacement costs, and (4) skills essential to accomplishing the defense mission. According to Navy officials, any one of these criteria qualifies a specialty for inclusion in the program.

As a result, the bonuses paid may not reflect the importance of the specialty. The Air Force has adopted most of the original DOD criteria; however, it does not require a balanced application of those criteria. The Air Force\u2019s criteria include (1) shortfalls in meeting current and projected reenlistment objectives (reenlistment rates and the size of specific-year groups, as well as adjacent-year groups), (2) shortages in current and projected noncommissioned officer manning, (3) high training investment and replacement cost for a skill, (4) expected improvement in retention resulting from designation as a selective reenlistment bonus skill, and (5) priority of the skill.

During fiscal year 2002, the Army\u2019s criteria for selection of critical specialties included (1) budget constraints, (2) current and projected strengths, (3) retention rates, (4) training constraints, (5) replacement costs, (6) priority military occupational specialties, and (7) shortages within mid-grade levels.

For example, in fiscal year 2001, the Navy exceeded its goals in 75 specialties by more than 110 percent. By exceeding its goals in some occupations, the Navy may be neglecting other specialties that could utilize increased bonuses to improve retention.

These factors were (1) the downsizing of the U.S. military forces during the 1990s, (2) a decline in recruiting in the early to mid-1990s, and (3) fewer reenlistments during the late 1990s. The combination of these factors, according to service officials, has contributed to growth in costs during fiscal years 1997-2002. According to the Congressional Research Service, the shortfalls in recruiting and retention in fiscal years 1998-1999 were the first since fiscal 1979.", "Regarding downsizing, the U.S. military substantially reduced its number of active-duty military personnel after the end of the Cold War. During fiscal years 1990-1999, the number of active-duty enlisted personnel declined from 1.7 million to 1.2 million\u2014approximately 34 percent. Part of this reduction in the military force was due to a reduction in the services\u2019 recruiting goals. For example, DOD\u2019s recruiting goals decreased consistently from 229,172 in fiscal year 1990 to as low as 174,806 in fiscal 1995 before increasing again in the years following. One of the intended purposes of reducing these goals was the desire to arrive at a smaller force by decreasing new enlistments instead of forcing more experienced personnel to leave the military. However, according to DOD officials, fewer new enlistments in the mid-1990s produced too few enlisted personnel to meet the services\u2019 needs for mid-level personnel (those with 5-10 years of experience) in the late 1990s.", "The services had varying degrees of success in achieving their higher recruiting goals in the late 1990s. For example, in fiscal year 1999, the Army failed to meet its goal\u2014recruiting only 95 percent of its target. The Navy and the Army also failed to meet their recruiting goals in fiscal year 1998, recruiting 88 and 92 percent, respectively. These failures to achieve recruiting goals were perceived by the services as a serious problem because of its potential impact on the force structure.", "The services also experienced retention problems that coincided with the recruiting shortfalls. While the Army achieved its reenlistment goals for first-term and mid-career enlisted personnel, shortfalls occurred in the career reenlistment term. For example, during fiscal years 1996-1998, the Army\u2019s reenlistment rates for the eligible population decreased from 65.7 to 60.1 percent. First-term reenlistment rates for the Navy decreased consistently during 1996-1999 from a reenlistment rate of 32.9 percent of the eligible population to 28.2 percent.

In the case of the Army, criteria should be established for selecting critical specialties.", "Manage their programs to stay within their appropriations or, if circumstances require, provide the Office of the Secretary of Defense with adequate justification for increased expenditures over appropriated amounts.", "To improve DOD\u2019s oversight and the services\u2019 management of the Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense require that the Undersecretary for Personnel and Readiness issue an instruction that provides the services with guidance for administering and selecting specialties for inclusion in their programs and   conduct annual reviews of the Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program as required by DOD\u2019s directive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided official comments on a draft of this report. DOD did not agree with the report\u2019s conclusion that the Department cannot be sure that the Selective Reenlistment Bonus Programs are being implemented as intended. While DOD stated that program controls are in place to ensure a reasonable balance between oversight and execution, we found that fundamental management controls were not in place. For example, DOD canceled the key instruction that provides the services with essential guidance for administering their programs 7 years ago and has not replaced it. Also, the comptroller\u2019s budget reviews of the services\u2019 programs were limited and, in some cases, were not effectively performed. Furthermore, these budget reviews were never intended to provide detailed programmatic oversight. Office of the Secretary of Defense officials told us that detailed programmatic reviews required by DOD\u2019s directive had not been conducted since 1991. Consequently, without these essential management controls, it is not clear how the Department can be sure that the program is being implemented as intended.", "DOD concurred or partially concurred with our recommendations. Our evaluation of DOD\u2019s comments on these recommendations follows: DOD concurred with our recommendation to issue an instruction that provides the services with guidance for administering their programs. The Department stated that it has drafted and is staffing a new DOD Instruction 1304.22 that will govern the procedures for administering the program.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense require the services to apply all the criteria they have established for selecting specialties under their Selective Reenlistment Bonus Programs. DOD stated that its criteria are sound and that the services\u2019 processes are balanced. As we noted in our report, the Department\u2019s instruction that was canceled required a balanced application of five criteria. We found that the services do not always apply their criteria in a balanced fashion. DOD also stated that, although the Army does not have a regulation governing its Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program, the criteria it uses are sound. However, we found that the Army\u2019s criteria are not clearly defined. Therefore, it is difficult to determine whether the criteria are being applied in a balanced fashion. Not using all the criteria allows the number of specialties included in the program to expand with a corresponding increase in reenlistments. For example, the number of Army reenlistments with bonuses more than doubled from approximately 7,000 in fiscal year 1997 to over 17,000 in fiscal 2001. DOD also stated that it does not use the program to address aggregate end-strength goals. We did not intend to infer that the program is being used to meet aggregate end-strength goals. We removed the discussion of the services use of the program to meet aggregate end-strength goals from the report.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the services manage their programs to stay within their appropriations or, if circumstances require, provide the Office of the Secretary of Defense with adequate justification for increased expenditures over appropriated amounts. DOD stated that, in general, it did not concur with an imposition of new centralized control over the services\u2019 budget execution. Furthermore, DOD stated its concern that the services need to be able to respond to changes in external factors during the 2 years between budget submission and program execution. However, as our  report points out, DOD has repeatedly exceeded its appropriations during the last 5 fiscal years. For example, during fiscal years 1997-2001, the services spent over $240 million above their appropriations. Better program oversight and management by DOD would have required the services to justify exceeding their appropriations during this 5-year period. We do not believe that more accountability for budget execution will diminish the services\u2019 ability to respond to changing operational needs.", "DOD partially concurred with our recommendation that the Office of the Secretary of Defense conduct annual reviews of the Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program. DOD cited the annual reviews conducted by DOD\u2019s Comptroller as an example of routine program reviews. However, as we have previously noted, these reviews are limited to the services\u2019 budget submissions and justification. And, only a small sample of occupations are included in the budget submission. DOD also stated that part of the budget process includes reviews by the Office of Management and Budget. However, Office of Management and Budget officials told us that their reviews are limited and do not constitute a detailed assessment of the services\u2019 programs. DOD\u2019s response also stated that its annual defense report will provide a listing of DOD-critical skills and other pertinent information. However, this listing will not represent a detailed programmatic review. DOD\u2019s Annual Defense Report is an overarching representation of all DOD programs and does not permit the level of detailed information required to fully assess the Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program.", "We continue to believe that our recommendations have merit and have made no adjustments to them. During the course of our review, the House Appropriations Committee directed the Secretary of Defense to report on several aspects of the Selective Reenlistment Bonus Program and to provide the Committee with that report by March 31, 2003. It also directed us to review and assess that report and report back to the Committee by June 1, 2003.", "DOD\u2019s comments appear in their entirety in appendix IV.
