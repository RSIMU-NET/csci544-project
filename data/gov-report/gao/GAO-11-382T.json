This testimony focuses on the importance of auditor and IG independence, GAO's prior concerns with the State OIG's independence and effectiveness, and the status of OIG actions to address GAO's recommendations. The testimony is primarily based on GAO's 2007 report conducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards, as well as the activities conducted to follow up on the status of our previous recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The State Department Office of Inspector General (State OIG) has a critical responsibility in preventing and detecting fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement; and in providing independent audits and investigations of the department's programs and operations. In addition, the Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires the State OIG to perform inspections of the department's bureaus and posts, which is a unique requirement for an IG office. Independence is a critical element to the quality and credibility of an IG's work under the IG Act and is fundamental to professional auditing standards as well as an essential element of IG effectiveness. An IG must be independent and free from personal, external, and organizational impairments to independence in order to effectively fulfill the full range of requirements for the office. GAO's 2007 report identified areas of concern regarding the State OIG's independence and effectiveness. Specifically, the appointment of management and Foreign Service officials to head the State OIG in an acting capacity for extended periods of time is not consistent with professional standards for independence. In addition, GAO reported that the use of Foreign Service officers at the ambassador level to lead OIG inspections resulted in, at a minimum, the appearance of independence impairment. GAO also reported that inspections, by design, are conducted under less in-depth requirements and do not provide the same level of assurance as audits. However, the OIG relied on inspections rather than audits to provide oversight coverage, resulting in gaps to the audit oversight of the department. GAO also reported that inspections performed by the OIG's Office of Information Technology (IT) were not part of an internal quality review process, and that the State OIG and the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) lacked an agreement to coordinate their investigative activities. The State OIG implemented two of GAO's five recommendations and has actions under way related to the remaining three. Specifically, the OIG now includes IT-related inspections in its internal quality-review process and has completed an agreement to coordinate investigations with DS. Also, the OIG is implementing a change to the succession planning for acting IG positions to exclude Foreign Service officers and is in the process of increasing the level of audit coverage through the distribution of staff and audit planning. In addition, the State OIG continues to assign Foreign Service officers at the ambassador level as team leaders for inspections, however, four of the six officers are rehired annuitants unlikely to rotate to State Department Foreign Service positions. GAO remains concerned, however, about the OIG's use of Foreign Service officers and the State Department's need to rely on acting IGs for extended periods of time. GAO continues to reaffirm its recommendations, and encourages the State OIG, with the assistance of the Secretary, to fully address these recommendations to enhance the effectiveness of the OIG's oversight of the State Department's programs and operations. In the 2007 report, GAO recommended that the IG work with the Secretary of State to address two recommendations regarding concerns about the State OIG's independence, and to reassess the mix of audits and inspections to help provide effective audit coverage of the department. In addition, GAO recommended that the IG include inspections performed by the OIG's Office of Information Technology in its internal quality review process and that it work with the department's Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) on an agreement to coordinate their investigative efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of State Office of  Inspector General (State OIG), which is responsible for providing  oversight of the State Department including the Foreign Affairs  community in more than 270 embassies, consulates, and other posts  worldwide as well as the Broadcasting Board of Governors.

I will discuss in more detail (1) the importance of auditor and IG  independence, (2) prior reporting on our concerns with the State OIG\u2019s  independence and effectiveness, and (3) information about the current  status of the State OIG\u2019s actions to address our recommendations.

From 1906  until 1957, inspections were to be carried out at least once every 2 years  and were viewed as a management function, and not a function of an  independent inspector general. In 1957, the State Department  administratively established an Inspector General of Foreign Service,  which was the first inspector general office within the State Department to  conduct inspections. Congress enacted legislation in 1961 and in 1980  creating statutory inspectors general who were tasked with performing  inspections on certain State Department activities. In 1978, GAO reviewed  the IG\u2019s inspection reports and questioned the independence of Foreign  Service officers who were temporarily detailed to the IG\u2019s office and  recommended the elimination of this requirement.  The 1980 legislation,  section 209(a) of the Foreign Service Act, required the State IG to inspect  every foreign service post, bureau, or other operating unit in the State  Department at least once every 5 years.", "In 1982, we reviewed the IG\u2019s operations and noted that the 5-year  inspection cycle led to problems with the IG\u2019s effectiveness by limiting the  ability to do other work. In addition, we continued to question the use of  Foreign Service officers and other persons from operational units within  the department to staff the IG office. In 1986, reacting to concerns similar  to those expressed in our 1982 report, Congress made the State IG a  presidentially appointed inspector general subject to the Inspector  General Act and prohibited a career member of the Foreign Service from  being appointed as the State IG. Starting in 1996 and continuing until  today, Congress, in the Department of State appropriations acts, annually  waives the 5-year statutory requirement for inspections. However, while  the inspection requirement is waived annually by Congress, the State IG  continues to conduct inspections as part of its plan for oversight of the  department.", "The State OIG\u2019s inspection responsibilities encompass a wide range of  objectives, which include reviewing whether department policy goals are  achieved and whether the interests of the United States are represented  and advanced effectively. In addition, the State OIG is assigned  responsibility for specialized security inspections in support of the  department\u2019s mission to provide effective protection to its personnel,  facilities, and sensitive intelligence information. Inspections are defined by  the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE)  as a process that evaluates reviews, studies, and analyzes the programs  and activities of an agency for the purposes of providing information to  managers for decision making; making recommendations for  improvements to programs, polices, or procedures; and identifying where  administrative action may be necessary.", "There are fundamental differences between inspections and audits.  Inspections and audits are typically conducted under separate standards  with different basic requirements. That is, IGs are required by the IG Act to  conduct audits in accordance with Government Auditing Standards (also  known as generally accepted government auditing standards). In contrast,  the IGs follow CIGIE\u2019s Quality Standards for Inspection and  Evaluation when conducting inspections as required by law. By d audits performed under Government Auditing Standards are subject to  more in-depth requirements for levels of evidence and documentation  supporting the findings than are inspections performed under CIGIE\u2019s  inspection standards. Also, auditing standards require external quality  reviews of audit organizations (peer reviews) on a 3-year cycle, while  inspection standards do not require such external reviews. According to  CIGIE, inspections provide the benefits of a flexible mechanism for  optimizing resources, expanding agency coverage, and using alternative  review methods and techniques. However, as reported by a recent peer  review performed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) IG, the State OIG\u2019s Middle East Regional Office did not always  provide audits consistent with generally accepted government auditing  standards (GAGAS). Consequently, because these audits were not  performed in accordance with GAGAS, they were reclassified by the OIG  as inspections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Importance of Auditor and IG Independence", "paragraphs": ["Independence is a fundamental principle to the auditing profession and  the most critical element for IG effectiveness.

Lacking this critical attribute, an audit organization\u2019s wor might be classified as studies, research re ports, consulting reports, or  reviews, rather than independent audits.", "Quality Standards for Federal Offices of Inspector General adopted by  CIGIE includes requirements for IG independence. Specifically, IG their staff must be free both in fact and appearance from personal,  external, and organizational impairments to their independence. The IG s  and their staff have a responsibility to maintain independence so that  opinions, conclusions, judgments, and recommendations will be im and viewed as impartial by knowledgeable third parties. Likewise,  Government Auditing Standards states: \u201cin all matters relating to  work, the audit organization and the individual auditor, whether  government or public, must be free from personal, external, and  organizational impairments to independence and must avoid the  appearance of such impairments to independence.

Examples of impairments t external independence include restrictions on access to records,  government officials, or other individuals needed to conduct the audit;  external interference over the assignment, appointment, compensation, promotion of audit personnel; restrictions on funds or other resou provided to the audit organization that adversely affect the audit  organization\u2019s ability to carry out its responsibilities; or external authority  rces  to overrule or to inappropriately influence the auditors\u2019 judgment as to  appropriate reporting content.", "The IG Act provides the IGs with protections against impairments to  external independence by providing that IGs have access to all agency  documents and records, prompt access to the agency head, and the  authority to independently (1) select and appoint IG staff, (2) obtain  services of experts, and (3) enter into contracts. The IGs may choose  whether to exercise the act\u2019s specific authority to obtain access to  information that is denied by agency officials.", "In addition, the IG Act granted the IGs additional insulation from  impairment of external independence by requiring that IGs report the  results of their work in semiannual reports to Congress without alteration  by their respective agencies, and that these reports generally are to be  made available to the general public. The IG Act also directed the IGs to  keep their agency heads and Congress fully and currently informed of any  deficiencies, abuses, fraud, or other serious problems relating to the  administration of programs and operations of their agencies. Also, the IGs  are required to report particularly serious or flagrant problems, abuses, or  deficiencies immediately to their agency heads, who are required to  transmit the IG\u2019s report to Congress within 7 calendar days.", "Organizational independence refers to the audit organization\u2019s  placement in relation to the activities being audited. Professional auditing  standards have different criteria for organizational independence for  external and internal audit organizations. The IGs, in their statutory role of  providing oversight of their agencies\u2019 operations, represent a unique  hybrid including some characteristics of both external and internal  reporting responsibilities. For example, the IGs have external-reporting  requirements outside their agencies, such as to the Congress, which are  consistent with the reporting requirements for external auditors. At the  same time the IGs are part of their respective agencies and must also keep  their agency heads, as well as the Congress, concurrently informed.", "The IG Act provides specific protections to the IGs\u2019 organizational  independence including the requirement that IGs report only to their  agency heads and not to lower-level management.

These concerns were similar to  independence issues we reported in 1978 and 1982 regarding Foreign  Service officers temporarily detailed from program offices to the IG\u2019s  office and inspection staff reassigned to and from management offices  within the department. In response to concerns about personal  impairments to the State IG\u2019s independence, the act that created the  current IG office prohibits a career Foreign Service official from becoming  an IG of the State Department.", "Nevertheless, our 2007 review found that during a period of approximately  27 months, from January 2003 through April 2005, four management  officials from the State Department served as an acting State IG. All four of  these officials had served in the Foreign Service in prior management  positions, including political appointments as U.S. ambassadors to foreign  countries. In addition, we also found that three of the officials returned to  significant management positions in the State Department after serving as  acting IGs. We found that acting IG positions continue to be used and are  filled by officials with prior management positions at the department.  Independence concerns surrounding such acting appointments are  additionally troublesome when the acting IG position is held for such  prolonged periods.

We found it was State OIG policy for inspections to be  led by ambassador-level Foreign Service officers. These Foreign Service  officers frequently move through the OIG on rotational assignments. As  Foreign Service officers, they are expected to help formulate, implement,  and defend government policy which now, as team leaders for the IG\u2019s  inspections, they are expected to review. These officers may return to  Foreign Service positions in the department after their rotation through  the OIG which could be viewed as compromising the OIG\u2019s independence.

Specifically, we found gaps of OIG audit  coverage in key State Department programs and operations such as (1)  information security, (2) human resources, (3) counterterrorism and  border security, and (4) public diplomacy. In these areas the State OIG  was relying on inspections rather than audits for oversight. In the 10  inspections that we examined, we found that the State OIG inspectors  relied heavily on invalidated agency responses to questionnaires  completed by the department staff at each inspected bureau or post. We  did not find any additional testing of evidence or sampling of agency  responses to determine the relevance, validity, and reliability of the  evidence as would be required under auditing standards.

In December 2010, the  State IG\u2019s investigative office completed an agreement with the bureau\u2019s  Assistant Director of Domestic Operations to address the coordination of  investigative activities. This agreement, when fully implemented, should  help to ensure proper coordination of these offices in their investigations.", "Regarding a succession plan for filling acting IGs positions, the State  Deputy IG stated that he issued a memo to abolish the deputy IG for  Foreign Service position to help ensure that any future deputy IG moving  into an acting IG position would not be a Foreign Service officer. The  Deputy IG stated that he is currently working with the department to  update the Foreign Affairs Manual to reflect this change. Furthermore,  the elimination of this position helps to strengthen the independence of  the OIG. We believe the State IG\u2019s changes are responsive to the  recommendation made in our 2007 report. Nevertheless, the State  Department has relied on acting IGs to provide oversight for over 5 of the  last 8 years since January 2003. (See table 1.) This use of temporarily  assigned State Department management staff to head the State OIG can  affect the perceived independence of the entire office in its oversight of  the department\u2019s operations, and the practice is questionable when  compared to the independence requirements of Government Auditing  Standards and other professional standards followed by the IGs. Further,  career members of the Foreign Service are prohibited by statute from  being appointed as State IG. This exclusion helps to protect against the  personal impairments to independence that could result when a Foreign  Service officer reviews the bureaus and posts of fellow Foreign Service  officers and diplomats.", "Regarding our recommendation to reassess the mix of audits and  inspections for the appropriate breadth and depth of oversight coverage,  especially in high-risk areas and management challenges, we noted gaps in  audit coverage. Specifically, in both fiscal years 2009 and 2010, the OIG  had gaps in the audit coverage of management challenges in the areas of  (1) coordinating foreign assistance, (2) public diplomacy, and (3) human  resources. However, the State OIG has made progress in planning for and  providing additional audit coverage. Since 2007 the State OIG\u2019s resources  have increased, providing the opportunity to augment its audit oversight of  the department. Specifically, the OIG\u2019s total on board staff increased to  227, from 191 in at the end of fiscal year 2005. Also, the OIG\u2019s audit staff  increased to 64 compared to 54 at the end of fiscal year 2005.

OIG officials  stated that there are currently six Foreign Service officers at the  ambassador level serving as the team leaders for inspections, four of  whom are rehired annuitants working for the State OIG. To address  independence impairments the State OIG relies on a recusal policy where  Foreign Service officers must self-report whether they have worked in a  post or embassy that is subject to an inspection and therefore presents a  possible impairment. Further, State OIG officials noted that the team  leaders report to a civil service Assistant IG and the inspection teams  include other members of the civil service. We continue to believe that the  State OIG\u2019s use of management staff who have the possibility of returning  to management positions, even if they are rehired annuitants or currently  report to civil service employees in the OIG, presents at least an  appearance of impaired independence and is not fully consistent with  professional standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Closing Observations", "paragraphs": ["The mission of the State OIG is critical to providing independent and  objective oversight of the State Department and identifying  mismanagement of taxpayer dollars.
