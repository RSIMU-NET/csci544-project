GAO estimated that slightly more than half of the HPSAs were designated for geographic areas--such as counties or portions of counties--or population groups, such as migrant farmworkers. The remaining HPSAs were designated for facilities, such as rural health clinics. In fiscal year 2005, more than 30 federal programs relied on HPSA designations, and in some cases HPSA scores, to allocate resources or provide benefits. The use of the HPSA designation by numerous federal programs to allocate resources or provide benefits is an incentive for obtaining and retaining a HPSA designation. Published reports have pointed to shortcomings in the methodology used for designating HPSAs. These reports' observations were consistent with findings in GAO's 1995 report, Health Care Shortage Areas: Designations Not a Useful Tool for Directing Resources to the Underserved, (GAO/HEHS-95-200, Sept. 8, 1995), including that HHS's methodology did not account for certain types of primary care providers already serving in a HPSA, which can result in an overstatement of the provider shortage. Recognizing the shortcomings of the current methodology, HHS has been working since 1998 on a proposal to revise the designation system. In addition, some HPSAs that no longer meet the criteria have retained their HPSA designation and possibly received benefits from federal programs that rely on that designation. HHS has not complied since 2002 with the statutory requirement to annually publish a list of designated HPSAs in the Federal Register--which would remove the designations of those HPSAs that are no longer listed. Many federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics did not benefit from automatic designation as facility HPSAs because they were located in geographic or population-group HPSAs. In addition, most of the more than 1,600 federally qualified health centers received HPSA scores associated with the automatic designation that were too low to qualify them for certain federal programs that required a minimum HPSA score in 2005, although they qualified for other programs that did not have such a requirement. Of the 590 rural health clinics that chose to certify that they would treat anyone regardless of ability to pay and, as a result, received automatic designation as facility HPSAs, most also received associated HPSA scores too low to qualify for benefits from certain federal programs that required a higher HPSA score."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Many Americans live in areas, such as inner-city neighborhoods or isolated  rural locations, where obtaining health care is difficult because health care  providers are in short supply. To identify areas facing a critical shortage of  providers, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) relies on  its health professional shortage area (HPSA) designation system.  Originally created in 1978 to identify areas in need of physicians and other  health care providers from HHS\u2019s National Health Service Corps (NHSC)  programs, HPSA designation is now used by a variety of federal  programs\u2014including programs that provide grants for health professions  education and training or bonus payments under Medicare for physician  services\u2014to allocate resources or provide benefits.", "A HPSA can be a distinct geographic area (such as a county), a specific  population group within an area (such as low-income individuals), or a  specific health care facility. Facility HPSAs include federal or state  correctional institutions, as well as federally qualified health centers\u2014 facilities that provide primary care services in underserved areas\u2014and  certain rural health clinics\u2014facilities that provide outpatient primary care  services in rural areas. HHS\u2019s Health Resources and Services  Administration (HRSA)\u2014the HHS agency that manages the HPSA  designation system\u2014designates HPSAs based on the ratio of population to  the number of primary care physicians and other factors. HRSA then  assigns each HPSA a score on the basis of specific criteria that ranks its  shortage of primary care providers, or need, relative to other HPSAs.  Some federal health care programs, such as NHSC programs, allocate their  resources on the basis of HPSA scores, not just HPSA designations.", "HHS\u2019s criteria and methodology for designating HPSAs has remained  unchanged since October 1, 1993. In 1998, in an effort to improve the way  underserved areas were designated, HHS published a proposal to revise  the HPSA designation system. The department received more than 800  comments on its proposal from individuals and organizations, including  individual physicians, state primary care organizations, and university or  research organizations. These comments raised several issues, such as  whether or how to count nonphysician providers, such as physician  assistants, in the total number of practitioners serving a population; the  potential number of HPSAs that would lose their HPSA designations  because of changes in the designation criteria; and the incorporation of  certain population factors, such as the percentage of elderly and uninsured  individuals, which reflect a population\u2019s ability to access care. In response  to these comments, HHS withdrew its 1998 proposal, and left the existing  HPSA designation system in place while it began working on another  proposal.", "The Health Care Safety Net Amendments of 2002 required that we report  on the HPSA designation system and on a provision included in the act  that automatically designates health centers and certain rural health  clinics as facility HPSAs. As discussed with the committees of  jurisdiction, this report discusses (1) the number and location of HPSAs  and the federal programs that use HPSA designations to allocate resources  or provide benefits, (2) available research on the criteria and methodology  used to designate HPSAs, and (3) the impact of the automatic HPSA  designation on health centers and rural health clinics.", "To conduct our work, we examined relevant laws, regulations, and HHS  documents related to the HPSA criteria in effect in 2005\u2014criteria that had  remained unchanged since 1993\u2014and reviewed our prior work on the  HPSA designation system. To determine the number of HPSAs, we  interviewed officials from HRSA, who reported that precise, accurate,  historical data on the total number of HPSAs were not available.  Therefore, to estimate the number of HPSAs designated as of September  2005, we designed a methodology that used data from HRSA, including  summary statistics on geographic and population-group HPSA  designations and data files on the facilities that were automatically  designated as HPSAs. We also analyzed a more detailed database of  geographic and population-group HPSAs as of January 2006 in order to  identify (1) the counties in which geographic and population-group HPSAs  were located and (2) the HPSAs that were proposed for having their  designations withdrawn because they no longer met the criteria or did not  provide updated data in support of their designations. After taking steps to  eliminate potential duplications or inconsistencies in the data we used, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To  obtain information on HPSA designations and federal programs that use  HPSA designations, we reviewed Federal Register notices and other  documents obtained from HHS agencies\u2014including HRSA, the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Indian Health Service  (IHS)\u2014and reviewed our prior work on these programs.", "To identify available research on the criteria and methodology used to  designate HPSAs, we conducted a literature search of reports, including  those published in peer-reviewed journals, issued from January 1, 1995,  through November 1, 2005. We identified other published reports  discussing the HPSA designation methodology, including one by the  Council on Graduate Medical Education (COGME). Of the more than 340  articles, studies, and reports\u2014which we refer to as reports\u2014identified in  the search, we identified 7 that addressed the relationship between key  elements of the HPSA designation criteria, such as income, and primary  care physician supply or shortages, or that addressed factors related to the  HPSA designation methodology. We also interviewed researchers who  have studied primary care provider shortages, as well as HRSA officials  knowledgeable about the HPSA designation system. To review the impact  of the automatic designation on health centers and rural health clinics, we  analyzed HRSA\u2019s data on automatic HPSA designations, including the  HPSA scores associated with automatic designation, and interviewed  HRSA officials and officials from associations representing these types of  facilities.

According to HRSA officials, the vast  majority of HPSA designation requests are submitted by state primary care  offices. These requests are received and reviewed by the Shortage  Designation Branch within HRSA. Individual and agency requesters, other  than state primary care offices, are required to submit a copy of their  request for HPSA designation to their state\u2019s primary care office. The state  primary care office solicits comments about the request from state groups,  including the state health department and state professional associations,  and forwards the comments to HRSA. Other interested parties may also  provide comments on the request and submit the comments directly to  HRSA. HRSA\u2019s final designation decision is based on a review of the  request and comments received from the state and other interested parties  (see fig. 1).", "HRSA designates three types of HPSAs: geographic, population-group, and  facility. Geographic HPSAs include entire counties, a portion of a county,  or a group of contiguous counties. Population-group HPSAs include  groups, such as migrant farmworkers, low-income urban populations, or  federally recognized Native American Tribes or Alaska Natives, within a  particular geographic area. Facility HPSAs include federal or state  correctional institutions, health centers, and certain rural health clinics.  To receive HPSA designation, the requesting agency or individual must  provide HRSA with information demonstrating that the area, population  group, or facility meets applicable criteria (see fig. 2).", "Since 2002, two kinds of facilities\u2014(1) health centers and (2) rural health  clinics that certify that they treat everyone regardless of ability to pay\u2014 have been automatically designated as facility HPSAs without going  through the standard request and review process. Health centers include  consolidated health centers, health center look-alikes, and tribal health  centers:  Consolidated Health Centers: These health centers\u2014which include  community health centers, migrant health centers, health centers for the  homeless, and health centers for residents of public housing\u2014receive  grants and grant funding under section 330 of the Public Health Service  Act. Consolidated health centers provide comprehensive community- based primary care services to individuals regardless of their ability to pay  and are required to serve the medically underserved.", "Health center look-alikes: These facilities have been determined to meet  all of the requirements necessary to receive a grant under section 330 of  the Public Health Service Act but do not receive such funding.", "Tribal health centers: These facilities receive federal support to provide  outpatient health services and are operated by tribes, tribal organizations,  or urban Indian organizations under the Indian Self-Determination Act or  the Indian Health Care Improvement Act.", "Rural health clinics are located in rural areas and can operate either  independently or as part of a larger organization, such as a hospital, skilled  nursing facility, or home health agency. Unlike health centers, which are  public or private nonprofit facilities, rural health clinics may function as  for-profit entities. Rural health clinics must offer primarily outpatient  primary medical care, but unlike health centers, they are not required to  serve all individuals regardless of their ability to pay. Therefore, those  rural health clinics that wish to receive automatic facility HPSA  designation must certify to HRSA that they provide services to all  individuals, regardless of their ability to pay, in order to receive the  designation.", "After receiving the HPSA designation, each geographic, population-group,  and facility HPSA is scored on a scale of 0 to 25, with higher scores  indicating greater relative need for primary care providers. The HPSA  score is based on four elements, including elements used for HPSA  designation: the ratio of population to primary care physicians (1 to 5  possible points, then doubled), poverty rate (0 to 5 possible points), infant  mortality rate or low birth weight rate (0 to 5 possible points), and travel  time or distance to the nearest available source of primary care (0 to 5  possible points). For a health center or rural health clinic automatically  designated as a facility HPSA, if complete data are not available or HRSA  cannot match the facility to appropriate data to calculate a HPSA score,  the HPSA receives either a score of 0 or a partial score based on the sum  of factors for which data are obtainable. According to HRSA\u2019s data on  health centers and rural health clinics that received automatic designation  as facility HPSAs, 10 percent of these facility HPSAs had a HPSA score of 0  as of September 2005.", "HRSA calculates the HPSA score using the information from the HPSA  designation request. For health centers and rural health clinics that receive  automatic facility HPSA designation, HRSA calculates the HPSA score  using nationally available data and approximates the service area of a  health center or rural health clinic by using data on the Primary Care  Service Area in which the facility is located. Any automatically  designated facility HPSA located in a geographic or population-group  HPSA may instead use the HPSA score for that geographic area or  population group, which, according to HRSA officials, is likely to be much  higher than the automatic facility HPSA score. According to HRSA  officials, nationally available data used for automatic facility HPSA scores  are often not as current or as precise as data collected for individual  geographic and population-group HPSA designations.", "HHS is required by law to review HPSA designations annually to determine  if the designations remain appropriate in light of the applicable  requirements. Each year, it must also publish a list of designated HPSAs  in the Federal Register. For HPSAs designated through the standard  request and review process, HHS reviews the designations by giving a list  of HPSAs that have been designated for 3 full years to each state and  asking the relevant state groups\u2014including the state\u2019s governor\u2019s office  and state health department\u2014to update the information. HPSA  designations for which data are not provided or that no longer meet the  designation criteria are proposed for withdrawal. A HPSA that is proposed  for withdrawal remains designated as a HPSA until HHS publishes in the  Federal Register either a notification that the HPSA designation has been  withdrawn or an updated list of designated HPSAs that does not include  that HPSA. Before a HPSA designation can be withdrawn, however,  interested parties and groups must be allowed to provide data and  information in support of the designation.

Scholarship  recipients are limited to practicing at NHSC-approved practice sites in  HPSAs with high need, as determined by the HPSA designation score. For  the period July 1, 2005, through June 30, 2006, scholarship recipients  completing training who were primary care physicians were required to  practice in HPSAs with scores of 14 or higher, while those completing  training as nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurse-midwives  were required to practice in HPSAs with scores of at least 13, 13, and 8,  respectively.

In addition to the practice sites approved for scholarship  recipients, loan repayment recipients\u2014including primary care physicians,  nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurse-midwives, and other  providers\u2014may practice at NHSC-approved sites in other HPSAs,  including those with lower HPSA scores. Loan repayment awards are  made to providers who practice in higher-scoring HPSAs first, and then to  providers who practice in lower-scoring HPSAs in descending order as  long as program funds are available.

At the end of fiscal year 2005, about 1,700  NHSC loan repayment recipients were practicing in HPSAs to complete  their NHSC service obligations.", "NHSC State Loan Repayment Program: NHSC provides grants to states to  operate state loan repayment programs. Eligibility requirements and  benefits, such as the maximum amount of loan repayment each year, may  vary from state to state, but state loan repayment recipients must agree to  provide primary health services in a HPSA. At the end of fiscal year 2005,  about 680 NHSC state loan repayment recipients were practicing in HPSAs  under this program.", "NHSC Ready Responder Program: Providers\u2014including primary care  physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and nurses\u2014can  receive salaries, benefits, and moving expenses to serve as commissioned  officers in the U.S. Public Health Service who are assigned by NHSC to  practice for 3 years in the neediest HPSAs.

For  example, rural health clinics are reimbursed under a modified cost-based  method of payment under Medicare. For reimbursement purposes, a rural  health clinic must be located in a geographic or population-group HPSA in  a rural area, a rural area designated by a state\u2019s governor (or chief  executive officer) and certified by HHS as an area with a shortage of  personal health services, or a rural area HRSA has designated as a  medically underserved area (MUA).", "Federal agencies\u2014including HHS, the Appalachian Regional  Commission, and the Delta Regional Authority\u2014as well as state health  departments, operate programs, called J-1 visa waiver programs, to attract  foreign physicians who have just completed their graduate medical  education in the United States to practice in underserved areas. In  exchange for a commitment to practice for at least 3 years at a facility  located in, or treating residents of, a HPSA, an MUA, or a medically  underserved population (MUP), foreign physicians can receive the benefit  of a waiver of a 2-year foreign residence requirement. Of the federal  agencies administering J-1 visa waiver programs in 2005, HHS required  foreign physicians receiving J-1 visa waivers through its J-1 visa waiver  program to practice in certain health centers, rural health clinics, or other  facilities in HPSAs with a HPSA score of 14 or higher.", "More than 15 federal programs that funded health professions education  and training grants in fiscal year 2005 used the HPSA designation to  provide funding preferences to grant applicants.

For purposes of the funding preference, the Public Health Service Act  defines medically underserved communities to include areas or  populations that are eligible for HPSA designation, or that meet other  criteria, such as being eligible to be served by a community or migrant  health center.", "The use of the HPSA designation by more than 30 federal programs to  allocate resources or provide benefits is an incentive for obtaining and  retaining a HPSA designation, even if the HPSA does not want or need  additional primary care providers.

In 1998, COGME reported that one  possible reason that the number of HPSAs had not declined was that \u201cas  the penalty for designation loss has increased, organizations have become  more adept at making the case for retaining or attaining this coveted  status.\u201d"], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Research Points to Shortcomings with Designation Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Of the reports published since 1995 that addressed the criteria or  methodology used to designate HPSAs, we identified one that supported  one key element of the criteria and six that pointed to shortcomings in the  designation methodology. These six reports were consistent with what we  reported in 1995. HHS officials have acknowledged these shortcomings  and the department has been working on a proposal for revising the HPSA  designation system since 1998, which, as of September 2006, had not been  finalized. Another problem we identified in 1995 that persists in 2006 is  HRSA\u2019s lack of timely removal of HPSA designations that no longer meet  the designation criteria.", "Of the seven reports we identified as research on the HPSA criteria or  methodology, one of the peer-reviewed reports addressed the relationship  between one key element of the HPSA designation criteria and primary  care physician supply. This report found a positive association between  primary care physician supply and an area\u2019s income\u2014one of the elements  of the HPSA criteria used to demonstrate unusually high needs for primary  care services. Specifically, the researchers found that areas with higher  incomes had a greater number of primary care physicians than areas with  lower incomes.", "Other published reports have, however, pointed to shortcomings in the  methodology HRSA uses to designate HPSAs\u2014specifically that the system  has not effectively identified areas with primary care shortages or helped  target federal resources to benefit those who are underserved. For  example, reports\u2014including one we issued in 1995\u2014have noted that  HRSA\u2019s designation methodology does not accurately identify those  providers available to furnish primary health care services. As a result,  the HPSA methodology can overstate the need for additional primary care  providers, limiting the usefulness of the HPSA designation system as a  screen to identify which communities should be eligible for additional  program benefits. Since 1995, we and others have reported problems with  HRSA\u2019s exclusion of several categories of primary care providers when  calculating the available primary care providers. For example, in our 1995  report, we estimated that the reported need for additional providers in  1994 would have been reduced by up to 50 percent if certain categories of  primary care physicians and nonphysician providers\u2014which were  excluded by HRSA\u2014had been included in the HPSA calculations. In total,  we estimated that 2,539 primary care physicians already providing services  in shortage areas (including NHSC physicians and foreign physicians with  J-1 visa waivers) and other categories of providers who deliver primary  care services in HPSAs (including physician assistants and nurse- midwives) were excluded by HRSA in 1994.", "Reports have also concluded that some of the geographic areas that HRSA  evaluates for designation\u2014that is, those based on county boundaries\u2014 may not always provide a realistic reflection of an area\u2019s health care  needs. For these HPSA designation requests, measuring the availability of  primary care physicians only in the county where individuals live may  underestimate certain residents\u2019 access to medical care. For example,  two reports we identified discussed the likelihood of people crossing  county lines to obtain health care services when these services were not  available in their community. In one report, researchers evaluated the  relationship between health status and medical care resources and found  that individuals aged 64 years or younger living in nonmetropolitan areas  reported better health when there was greater physician supply in the  county where they lived and adjoining counties. According to these  researchers, the results suggested that younger individuals in  nonmetropolitan areas were willing and able to cross county lines to  obtain health care.", "Researchers have also noted that the HPSA designation methodology  favors those states or areas that have experience in completing and  submitting a HPSA designation request. One team of researchers reported  that officials in certain states and localities were effective in identifying  areas that would qualify for a HPSA designation and in providing timely  and appropriate data for the request, whereas other areas were unable to  navigate the process as effectively. The researchers observed that certain  areas were more likely to have HPSA designations than others\u2014 independent of the actual local situation.", "Recognizing the shortcomings in the HPSA designation system identified  by available research and our prior work, HHS has been working on a  proposal for a revised designation system since 1998. According to HRSA  officials, the proposal incorporates factors to account for all primary care  providers in an area\u2014including foreign physicians with J-1 visa waivers,  NHSC physicians, and nurse practitioners and physician assistants\u2014and  includes the creation of a master database to house national data relevant  to HPSA criteria. As of September 2006, this proposal was in the  department\u2019s clearance process.", "Another problem we identified in 1995, that remains a problem in 2006, is  that HRSA does not review designated HPSAs and subsequently remove  the designation of those areas, population groups, or facilities that no  longer meet the HPSA criteria in a timely manner. While we did not audit  HRSA\u2019s process for periodically reviewing HPSAs, in August 2005, the HHS  Office of Inspector General reported that as of 2003, HRSA had not  conducted timely reviews of HPSA designations. In the agency\u2019s  comments that were included in the August 2005 report, HRSA  acknowledged this problem, stating that the agency was unable to  complete the review of designated HPSAs for continued eligibility in less  than 3 years because of resource limitations. As of September 2006, we  found that although HHS is required to publish a list of designated HPSAs  in the Federal Register by July 1 of each year\u2014thereby removing the  designation of any HPSAs that were proposed for withdrawal that are not  published\u2014the department has not done so since February 2002. HRSA  officials told us in June 2006 that the department has not published a list of  HPSAs in the Federal Register for more than 4 years because of difficulties  with computer programming, but the agency hoped to resolve those issues  and to forward an updated list for publication by fall 2006. Meanwhile,  those HPSAs that were proposed for withdrawal because they no longer  meet the HPSA criteria have retained their HPSA designation.

The department also noted that it  is proposing a change in the process for withdrawing HPSA designations,  but it did not provide any details on this proposal. HHS also agreed with  our recommendation that the department complete and publish its  proposal to revise the HPSA designation system. HHS stated that this  proposal would address shortcomings that we identified in this and  previous reports and would also affect the regulations governing MUA and  MUP designations.", "HHS also commented on our finding that many health centers and rural  health clinics did not benefit from automatic designation as facility HPSAs.  Specifically, HHS stated that our draft report provided a somewhat  misleading assessment of the impact of the automatic designation process  and the department provided additional information on NHSC placements  in automatically designated HPSAs in 2005. Our draft report stated that  few health centers had HPSA scores associated with automatic  designation that were high enough to qualify for a physician through the  NHSC Scholarship Program, but that all health centers that received  automatic designation as HPSAs, even those with lower HPSA scores,  could apply in 2005 for a health care provider through the NHSC Loan  Repayment Program. The data the department provided on NHSC  placements in automatically designated health centers were actually  consistent with the statement in our draft report. HHS\u2019s data, which HHS  officials said included both primary care and nonprimary care providers,  showed that of 216 NHSC providers placed in health centers, relatively few  (less than 5 percent) were placed through the NHSC Scholarship Program  and the NHSC Ready Responder Program (less than 1 percent), whereas  the vast majority (more than 95 percent) were placed through the NHSC  Loan Repayment Program. According to HRSA officials, data for primary  care provider placements (which were not included in the department\u2019s  comments), showed a similar distribution between the three NHSC  programs for 155 primary care NHSC placements in health centers in 2005.  In its comments, HHS also provided information on the process for scoring  automatically designated HPSAs and on NHSC and J-1 visa waiver  programs. In response, we added information on J-1 visa waiver programs  administered by federal agencies other than HHS and by state health  departments.", "Finally, HHS suggested that we clarify that our scope was limited to  primary care HPSAs.

To calculate a HPSA score, points for the  population\u2013to\u2013primary care physician ratio, ranging from 1 to 5 points, are  doubled and then summed with the points for each of the other three  factors. For health centers and rural health clinics receiving automatic  designation as facility HPSAs, if complete data are not available, or if  HRSA cannot match the facility to appropriate data to calculate a HPSA  score, the HPSA receives either a score of 0 or a partial score based on the  sum of factors for which data are obtainable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Medically Underserved Area or Population Designations and Medically Underserved Community Definition", "paragraphs": ["Medically underserved areas (MUA) and medically underserved  populations (MUP) generally are areas, or populations within areas, that  are designated by HHS\u2019s HRSA as having a shortage of health care  services.

This score is used to determine if an area or  population can be designated as an MUA or MUP. Areas and populations  in the country are ranked using this score to determine their order of need  of health services. Areas and populations with scores at or below 62 (the  median score that was calculated for all U.S. counties in 1975 for the four  criteria) are designated MUAs or MUPs. Those populations within areas  with scores above 62 may still be designated as MUPs if they demonstrate  that unusual local conditions impede access to or the availability of  personal health services. Such requests must be documented and  recommended by the state chief executive officer and the responsible  local officials.", "One of the ways in which MUAs and MUPs differ from HPSAs is that MUA  and MUP designations are not required to be regularly updated. According  to a HRSA official, some areas with MUA or MUP designations have not  been reviewed since the 1980s. In 1998, HHS published a proposal in the  Federal Register to revise the MUA and MUP designations and combine  them with the HPSA designation system.
