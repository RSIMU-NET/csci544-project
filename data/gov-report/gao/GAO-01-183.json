These lists of medications, grouped by  therapeutic class, are known as drug formularies. Organizations prefer, and  sometimes require, that these drugs be used as the provider\u2019s first choice  because organizations believe these drugs represent the best value among  therapeutic choices and because by concentrating their purchases  organizations can secure better prices.", "As early as 1955, the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) medical centers  began using formularies to manage their pharmacy inventories, and until  recently each of VA\u2019s 173 medical centers maintained its own formulary. In  June 1997, VA established its national formulary by consolidating locally  developed and managed formularies into a core list of drugs. The national  formulary was intended to give health care providers who have outpatient  prescription privileges the same list of formulary drugs no matter where in  the VA system they practice medicine, and to assure veterans that they will  have access to the same group of formulary drugs for their treatment at all  VA medical centers no matter where they seek care. VA medical centers  were directed to make all national formulary drugs available to prescribers.  To provide flexibility in meeting local patient needs, VA allows its 22  regional Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) to add drugs locally  to supplement the national formulary and requires them to establish  approval processes for prescribers to obtain drugs not listed on their  formularies.", "Over the past few years, you and others in the Congress have raised  questions about VA\u2019s national formulary. In December 1999, we issued a  report addressing your interest in how VA manages its national formulary.  In June 2000, the Institute of Medicine (IOM), as mandated by the Congress  in House Report 105-610, issued its report on the effect VA\u2019s national  formulary has had on the cost and quality of VA health care, the  restrictiveness of VA\u2019s national formulary, and how the national formulary  compares with private and other government formularies.", "To supplement the findings of our December 1999 report, you asked us to  review (1) the impact of national formulary implementation by VISNs and  medical centers on VA\u2019s goal of standardizing its formulary and (2) VISN  and medical center processes for obtaining nonformulary outpatient  prescriptions. You also asked that we examine whether VA\u2019s national  formulary allows health care providers to prescribe the medications they  believe their patients need.", "To address these VA formulary issues, we reviewed the formulary policies  and activities of VA\u2019s central office and its VISNs and compiled and  analyzed nationwide VA prescription data. To assess implementation at the  local level, we also discussed formulary issues with VA officials at three  medical centers we visited in three different VISNs. We selected these  medical centers on the basis of their percentage of prescriptions filled for  formulary drugs. At your request, we also conducted a survey of 2,000  health care providers who have VA prescription writing privileges  (prescribers) to determine whether they believe implementation of the  national formulary has adversely affected their ability to prescribe needed  medications for the veterans they treat.

In contrast, 10 years ago VA\u2019s  pharmacy benefit represented about 6 percent of VA\u2019s total health care  budget.", "Health care organizations\u2019 efforts to control pharmacy costs and improve  quality of care include (1) implementing formularies that limit the number  of drug choices available; (2) establishing financial incentives, such as  variable copayments, to encourage the use of formulary drugs; (3) using  compliance programs, such as prior authorization, that encourage or  require physicians to prescribe formulary drugs; and (4) developing clinical  guidelines for prescribing drugs.", "VA does not have authority to use financial incentives to encourage  compliance with its formulary. VA provides outpatient pharmacy services  free to veterans receiving medications for treatment of service-connected  conditions and to low-income veterans whose incomes do not exceed a  threshold amount. Other veterans who have prescriptions filled by VA may  be charged $2 for each 30-day supply of medication.", "In 1995, VA began transforming its delivery and management of health care  to expand access to care and increase efficiency. As part of this  transformation, VA decentralized decision-making and budgeting authority  to 22 VISNs, which became responsible for managing all VA health care.  VISNs were given substantial operational autonomy. Although VISN and  medical center directors are held accountable in annual performance  agreements for meeting certain national and local goals, attaining  formulary goals has not been part of their performance standards.", "VA medical centers began using formularies as early as 1955 to manage  their pharmacy inventories. Because of the geographic mobility of VA  patients, VA officials believed that a national formulary would improve  veterans\u2019 continuity of care. In September 1995, VA established a  centralized group to manage its pharmacy benefit on a nationwide basis. In  November 1995, VISNs were established, and the Under Secretary for  Health directed each VISN to develop and implement a VISN-wide  formulary. To develop their formularies, the VISNs generally combined  existing medical center formularies and eliminated rarely prescribed drugs.  VISN formularies became effective on April 30, 1996. Also in 1996, the  Congress required VA to improve veterans\u2019 access to care regardless of the  region of the United States in which they live. As part of its response, VA  implemented a national drug formulary on June 1, 1997, by combining the  core set of drugs common to the newly developed VISN formularies. In  addition to the national and VISN formularies, a few medical centers  retained their own formularies.", "VA\u2019s Pharmacy Benefits Management Strategic Healthcare Group (PBM) is  responsible for managing the national formulary list, maintaining databases  that reflect drug use, and monitoring the use of certain drugs. VISN  directors are responsible for implementing and monitoring compliance  with the national formulary, ensuring that VISN restrictions placed on  national formulary products are appropriate, and ensuring that a  nonformulary drug approval process is functioning in all of their medical  centers.", "As all formularies do, VA\u2019s national formulary limits the number of drug  choices available to health care providers. VA\u2019s formulary lists more than  1,100 unique drugs that are assigned to 1 of 254 drug classes\u2014groups of  drugs similar in chemistry, method of action, or purpose of use. After  performing reviews of drug classes representing the highest costs and  volume of prescriptions, VA decided that some drugs in 4 of its 254 drug  classes were therapeutically interchangeable\u2014that is, essentially  equivalent in terms of efficacy, safety, and outcomes\u2014and therefore had  the same therapeutic effect. This determination allowed VA to select one or  more of these drugs for its formulary to seek better prices through  competitively bid committed-use contracts. Other therapeutically  equivalent drugs in these classes were then excluded from the formulary.  These four classes are known as \u201cclosed\u201d classes. VA has not made clinical  decisions regarding therapeutic interchange in the remaining 250 drug  classes, and it does not limit the number of drugs that can be added to  these classes. These are known as \u201copen\u201d classes.", "In some cases, drugs listed on the national formulary may be restricted.  Restrictions are generally placed on the use of drugs if they have the  potential to be used inappropriately. For example, restrictions are placed  on drugs with potentially serious side effects, such as interferon, which is  used to treat such conditions as hepatitis C. VA has also adopted guidelines  to assist practitioners in making decisions about the diagnosis, treatment,  and management of specific clinical conditions, such as congestive heart  failure. In addition, VA has adopted criteria to help standardize treatment,  improve the quality of patient care, and promote cost-effective drug  prescriptions.

We used this database to  develop a sample of VA health care providers who wrote prescriptions,   determine the total number of outpatient prescriptions filled at VISNs  and VA medical centers,   determine the number of filled outpatient prescriptions written for  national formulary drugs within a certain time frame, and  determine how many VISN formulary drug prescriptions were filled in  the three VISNs where we performed site visits.", "We interviewed PBM headquarters officials who had either oversight or  maintenance responsibility for the database to help assess the validity and  reliability of the outpatient prescription data.

We found that data critical to our analysis\u2014the  data field indicating whether a prescription had been written for a national  formulary drug\u2014contained errors.

We selected these VISNs and  medical centers on the basis of formulary drug use from October through  December 1999, the period for which the most recent and complete data  were available at the time we did our work. For example, VISN 8 had the  highest percentage of prescriptions for national formulary drugs (93  percent), VISN 16\u2019s percentage of national formulary drug prescriptions  was at the national average (90 percent), and VISN 14 had the lowest  percentage of prescriptions filled using national formulary drugs (88  percent)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Questionnaire to Prescribers", "paragraphs": ["We mailed questionnaires to a representative sample of 2,000 VA health  care prescribers whose prescriptions had been dispensed from October 1  through December 31, 1999, to obtain their opinions and experiential data  on various aspects of VA\u2019s national formulary.

Some prescribers\u2019 responses indicated that they did not  write prescriptions for drugs; their prescription privileges were limited to  medical and surgical supplies, such as diabetic strips and food  supplements. Other returned questionnaires indicated that the addressee  had either left or retired from VA. These providers were thus considered  ineligible for our purposes and were removed from the sample.  Approximately 11 percent of the questionnaires were returned as  undeliverable, and we received no response from approximately 16 percent  of those to whom we mailed questionnaires.

Sampling errors have two  elements: the width of the confidence interval around the estimate  (sometimes referred to as the precision of the estimate) and the confidence  level at which the confidence interval is computed.", "The confidence interval reflects the fact that estimates actually encompass  a range of possible values, not just a single value, or a \u201cpoint estimate.\u201d The  interval is expressed as a point, plus or minus some value.

We used a 95-percent confidence  level, which means that if we repeatedly took new samples of prescribers  from the October through December prescription database and performed  the same analysis of their responses each time, 95 percent of these samples  would yield estimates that would fall within the confidence interval stated.  In the previous example, this means that we are 95-percent certain that  between 66.5 and 71.7 percent of prescribers believe that the VA formulary  contains to a \u201cgreat extent\u201d or \u201cvery great extent\u201d the drugs they believe  their patients need."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonsampling Errors", "paragraphs": ["Surveys can also be subject to other types of systematic error or bias that  can affect results, known as nonsampling errors.
