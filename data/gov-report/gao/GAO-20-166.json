To prevent insidious use of this plutonium, DOE plans to disassemble pits into metal; convert the plutonium metal to plutonium oxide, a powder-like substance; dilute it with inert material; and dispose of it at WIPP. In May 2018, NNSA issued a plan conceptualizing the dilution and disposal of 34 MT of surplus plutonium at an estimated cost of $19 billion over the next 3 decades. Under this conceptual plan, pit disassembly and production of plutonium oxide would take place at one facility and dilution would be performed in another, with both operations expanding over the next decade.", "GAO was asked to review DOE's plans for plutonium oxide production to dispose of surplus plutonium. This report (1) examines the amount of surplus plutonium in DOE's inventory that could be converted to plutonium oxide for dilution and disposal and (2) examines DOE's capacity to produce plutonium oxide. GAO reviewed the inventory of surplus plutonium, plutonium oxide production requirements and production capacity, and DOE planning documents, and interviewed DOE officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the Department of Energy\u2018s (DOE) inventory of surplus plutonium, about 43.8 metric tons (MT), or 77 percent, is plutonium metal that could be converted to plutonium oxide for dilution and disposal. Of this amount, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) manages 33.3 MT in the form of pits, DOE's Office of Environmental Management (EM) manages 6.5 MT, and DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy manages 4 MT in the form of reactor fuel. EM manages another 11 percent, or 6.4 MT, of DOE's surplus plutonium that is already in oxide form. Most of this is suitable for dilution and disposal at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), a repository in New Mexico. An additional 12 percent, or 7 MT, of DOE's surplus plutonium is contained in spent nuclear fuel that is planned for disposal in a geologic repository. See figure.", "NNSA's 2018 conceptual plan calls for converting 26.2 MT of this surplus plutonium into oxide by 2045. In September 2019, NNSA approved the production of about 1.2 MT of plutonium oxide through 2025 at its Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) located in New Mexico. However, plans for converting additional surplus plutonium into plutonium oxide are uncertain because of two issues. These issues include NNSA's still-developing plans for new pit production, which will also take place at LANL, and issues surrounding the agency's ability to ship newly produced plutonium oxide for dilution to DOE's Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina. According to agency officials, NNSA and DOE are taking several actions that, if successfully implemented, are designed to allow NNSA to meet its long-term plutonium oxide production goals. These actions include continuing to review plutonium oxide and pit production plans, increasing plutonium storage at LANL, reducing the amount of SRS's surplus plutonium, and accelerating the shipment of diluted plutonium from SRS to WIPP."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Plutonium, a radioactive element that is produced by irradiating uranium  in nuclear reactors, is an essential component of nuclear weapons and  U.S. national defense strategy. Plutonium is used to manufacture pits,  the central core of a nuclear weapon. During the Cold War, the United  States manufactured thousands of pits to maintain its stockpile of nuclear  weapons. However, since the Cold War ended in the early 1990s the  stockpile has been reduced, leaving thousands of pits from dismantled  nuclear weapons sitting in temporary storage. In addition to plutonium  from pits, several metric tons (MT) of non-pit plutonium\u2014some of which  were used in the pit manufacturing process\u2014used (spent) nuclear fuel,  and other nuclear fuels containing plutonium are also in temporary  storage.", "Plutonium poses a proliferation risk and a risk to human health and the  environment if not managed safely. The threat of state or non-state  actors, such as terrorists, developing nuclear or radiological weapons by  obtaining some of this plutonium poses one of the greatest challenges to  U.S. and international security, according to the National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the  Department of Energy (DOE).", "In part to address this proliferation risk, DOE established the Surplus  Plutonium Disposition Program in 1997 to dispose of surplus, weapons- usable plutonium at the end of the Cold War. According to NNSA, the  disposition of surplus plutonium is central to the nuclear non-proliferation  goals of the United States and is primarily managed by its Office of  Material Management and Minimization. As of 2007, the United States  had declared a total of 61.5 MT of plutonium as surplus to defense  needs. DOE has disposed of 3.2 MT of surplus plutonium at the Waste  Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), an underground repository for transuranic  waste located near Carlsbad, New Mexico, and is in the process of  disposing of an additional 1.1 MT of surplus plutonium. As a result, as of  May 2019 DOE had 57.2 MT of surplus plutonium in its inventory still  requiring disposition.", "In the 1990s, DOE considered several strategies to dispose of the surplus  plutonium and, according to DOE documents, in 1997 decided on two  strategies to immobilize and irradiate the surplus plutonium before final  disposal in a geologic repository for high-level waste, including spent  nuclear fuel. Immobilization encapsulates the plutonium in glass or  ceramic materials prior to disposal. Irradiation requires that the plutonium  be converted to plutonium oxide, a powder-like substance, and then  blended with uranium oxide to make mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. This MOX  fuel, which DOE planned to fabricate at the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication  Facility (MFFF) at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina,  would then be used in U.S. commercial nuclear reactors to produce  electricity. The plutonium in the MOX fuel would be incorporated into  spent nuclear fuel, a form that would prevent it from being easily used in  nuclear weapons, and would eventually be disposed of in a high-level  waste repository.", "In 1999, DOE began planning for the disposition of up to 50 MT of surplus  plutonium using the immobilization and MOX fuel strategies but changed  that amount to 34 MT as part of an agreement signed with Russia. Under  the Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement (PMDA), signed  in 2000 and amended in 2006 and 2010, the United States and Russia  pledged to dispose of at least 34 MT of surplus weapons-grade plutonium  no longer needed for defense purposes, primarily by irradiating certain  forms of surplus plutonium as MOX fuel in commercial nuclear reactors.", "As we have previously reported, DOE\u2019s cost and schedule estimates for  the MFFF grew significantly. In 1997, DOE originally estimated that  constructing the MFFF would cost about $1.4 billion and be completed in  2004; however, in 2012, NNSA estimated construction costs of $7.4  billion and completion by 2019. In 2016, DOE estimated that construction  of the MFFF would cost about $17.2 billion and be completed by 2048. In  September 2017, we found that DOE\u2019s 2016 cost estimate for the MFFF  could be considered reliable as it substantially met all four characteristics  of a high-quality cost estimate: comprehensive, well-documented,  accurate, and credible. We also reported that NNSA\u2019s life-cycle costs for  the Surplus Plutonium Disposition Program were $56 billion, an increase  of nearly $32 billion over its 2013 life-cycle costs.", "Because of the high cost of the MFFF, NNSA began to assess alternative  strategies for plutonium disposition. In April 2014, NNSA identified an  alternative strategy that it believed could significantly reduce the life-cycle  cost of surplus plutonium disposition. Under this strategy, referred to as  dilute and dispose, NNSA would convert surplus metal plutonium to  plutonium oxide, which could then be diluted by mixing it with inert  material to inhibit plutonium recovery and prevent its future use in  weapons or diversion for any insidious use. The plutonium oxide could  then be packaged for permanent disposal at WIPP. In a letter to the  Senate Armed Services Committee in August 2016, the Secretary of  State wrote that the United States remained committed to the safe  disposition of surplus U.S. plutonium for broader nonproliferation, arms  control, and foreign policy interests and that the dilute and dispose  strategy was the only way to meet disposition targets in a fiscally  sustainable way. In May 2018, NNSA issued a conceptual plan for the  dilution and disposal of 34 MT of surplus plutonium.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 allowed  DOE to terminate construction of the MFFF if, among other things, DOE  identified an alternative that would cost less than approximately half of the  MOX fuel strategy. In its 2018 conceptual plan, NNSA estimated that  the dilute and dispose strategy life-cycle cost would be $19.6 billion, less  than half the estimated $49.4 billion total life-cycle cost of the MOX fuel  strategy. In May 2018, DOE notified Congress of its decision to cancel  MFFF construction, and in October 2018, DOE issued a notice of  termination of the contract for the MFFF, leaving the dilute and dispose  strategy as its preferred potential disposition strategy.", "The Senate committee report accompanying S. 1519, a bill for the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, included a  provision that we review DOE\u2019s current capacity and plans to meet the  plutonium oxide production needs of the plutonium disposition program.

These disposition strategies  have included immobilization, irradiation as MOX fuel, and dilution. In  1997, NNSA planned to immobilize surplus plutonium by encapsulating it  in glass or ceramic materials but terminated its plans in 2002 due to  budget constraints. In the mid-2000s, EM briefly considered vitrification,  which is a form of immobilization using glass, but never developed a plan  to implement it. NNSA planned to irradiate surplus plutonium as part of  the MOX fuel strategy but terminated its plans in 2018 because of high  costs. NNSA\u2019s plans for irradiation of MOX fuel would also have required  disposal of the spent nuclear fuel in a high-level waste repository. EM  began implementing a dilute and dispose strategy for a separate portion  of surplus plutonium in 2012, but suspended its efforts until it resumed  them in 2016. NNSA\u2019s 2018 conceptual plan for the dilute and dispose  strategy would replace the MOX fuel strategy with final disposal of the  diluted plutonium at WIPP. Figure 3 shows a timeline of the changes in  DOE\u2019s strategies since 1997, as well as some key events that have  affected the strategies.

WIPP would not have been able to take surplus plutonium  from these disposition strategies because federal law authorizing disposal  of radioactive waste at WIPP specifically bans the disposal of high-level  waste and spent nuclear fuel, and the final forms of the surplus plutonium  from these disposition strategies would have included both. DOE\u2019s  plans for a high-level waste repository have also changed over time. No  progress toward licensing and building a high-level waste repository has  been made since DOE terminated its licensing efforts in 2010.

According to its 2012 report, NNSA planned for  this plutonium oxide to be a reserve of advance feedstock for the MFFF.  NNSA anticipated it would begin operations in 2019. According to NNSA,  SRS turned out not to be cost-effective at producing plutonium oxide.  Specifically, SRS produced 35 kilograms (0.035 MT) of plutonium oxide at  SRS\u2019s H Canyon facility over a 2.5-year period ending in 2018. NNSA  discontinued plutonium oxide production at H Canyon and focused its  plans on expanding ARIES operations at PF-4. According to NNSA,  ARIES operations at PF-4 currently host the nation\u2019s only cost-effective  plutonium oxide production capability.", "In 1998, DOE established ARIES at PF-4 at LANL in New Mexico as a  technology demonstration project to dismantle pits and convert plutonium  metal into an oxide, incorporating automation to reduce liquid waste and  workers\u2019 exposure to radiation. ARIES\u2019s technology for converting  plutonium to plutonium oxide was designed to generate very little  chemical waste and to permit the application of automation, which  significantly reduces the risk of workers\u2019 exposure to radiation. Pits have  historically been disassembled by a cutting machine. Before ARIES\u2019s  technology, recovery of plutonium from cut pits was by an aqueous  process\u2014that is, by using liquid chemical processing\u2014which generated  significant volumes of both liquid and solid waste.", "In 2008, NNSA shifted the ARIES mission from a technology  demonstration project to a small plutonium oxide production capability.

NNSA officials explained that ARIES did not produce larger  amounts of plutonium oxide because the agency was still evaluating  alternatives for expanding plutonium oxide, but they estimated that ARIES  could produce 300 kilograms to 400 kilograms in a full year of operations.  In addition, LANL shut down the PF-4 facility, including ARIES, from June  2013 through September 2016 to correct safety and operational issues.

NNSA officials said in  August 2019 that they are in discussions with LANL to increase the  short-term production of plutonium oxide to speed the removal of  surplus plutonium from South Carolina. According to NNSA officials,  NNSA and LANL are considering increasing plutonium oxide  production through 2025 beyond what is called for in their short-term  plan that the agency approved in September 2019. This would  involve shipping additional surplus plutonium metal from SRS to LANL  and prioritize converting this material to plutonium oxide. According  to agency officials, LANL would produce additional plutonium oxide  production by using new ARIES equipment installed in PF-4 in 2019.  To achieve this increased production, NNSA officials said that LANL  would need to hire 70 personnel through 2025 to operate ARIES.  Agency officials said that these steps would increase total plutonium  oxide production to approximately 2.1 MT through 2025, an increase  of nearly 1 MT over the short-term plan NNSA approved in September  2019.", "Increasing dilution and disposal rates of the inventory of  plutonium oxide already at SRS. DOE and NNSA officials said that  they would also increase dilution of existing plutonium oxide at SRS  beyond what is called for in the 2018 conceptual plan to help reduce  the inventory of plutonium metal already there. In April 2019, NNSA  officials said their current dilution rate at SRS was about 20 kilograms  (0.02 MT) annually, but that they plan to increase that rate to 1.5 MT  by the late 2020s. Under its 2018 conceptual plan, NNSA had planned  to achieve that dilution rate by 2031, but the budget request for NNSA  for fiscal year 2020 shows that NNSA plans to complete installation of  the capability necessary to achieve that dilution rate by as early as  fiscal year 2028. The effort\u2014known as the Surplus Plutonium  Disposition project\u2014has an estimated cost range from $200 million to  $589 million. It includes removing unnecessary equipment from SRS,  accelerating the project\u2019s construction schedule, installing long-lead  procurement items early in construction, and hiring and certifying  additional personnel. According to NNSA officials, this increase in  dilution capacity by 2028 would enable NNSA to begin shipping  plutonium oxide to SRS for dilution and disposal without suspending  plutonium oxide production at PF-4.", "While NNSA is taking actions to address pit production and shipment  issues, the agency continues to work on refining the long-term plutonium  oxide production goals in its 2018 conceptual plan. However, NNSA  officials said that establishing firm long-term plutonium oxide production  plans now would be premature and that the agency would use the next  several years to balance plutonium oxide production, pit production, and  shipment issues as they refine long-term production plans."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NNSA and DOE for review and  comment.

NNSA said, as noted in our report, that its Office for Cost  Estimating and Program Evaluation would assess the effects of increased  plutonium oxide production on pit production.", "NNSA also said that even with delays in production of plutonium oxide,  the dilution and disposition of surplus plutonium will still be substantially  less expensive than if the agency had maintained its MOX fuel approach.
