The department, with an estimated $39 billion in assets, an almost $40 billion fiscal year 2004 budget request, and more than 170,000 employees, does not have a presidentially appointed CFO subject to Senate confirmation and is not required to comply with the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act (FFMIA) of 1996. In addition, we designated implementation and transformation of DHS as high risk based on three factors: (1) the implementation and transformation of DHS is an enormous undertaking that will take time to achieve in an effective and efficient manner, (2) components to be merged into DHS already face a wide array of existing challenges, and (3) failure to effectively carry out its mission would expose the nation to potentially very serious consequences. In light of these conditions, Congress asked GAO to testify on the financial management challenges facing DHS, steps for establishing sound financial management and business processes at DHS, and GAO's comments on H.R. 2886, The Department of Homeland Security Financial Accountability Act."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Homeland Security Act of 2002 brought together 22 agencies to create a new cabinet-level department focusing on reducing U.S. vulnerability to terrorist attacks, and minimizing damages and assisting in recovery from attacks that do occur. Meeting this mission will require a results-oriented environment with a strong financial management infrastructure. Creating strong financial management at DHS is particularly challenging because most of the entities brought together to form the department have their own financial management systems, processes, and in some cases, deficiencies. Four of the seven major agencies that transferred to DHS reported 18 material weaknesses in internal control for fiscal year 2002 and five of the seven major agencies had financial management systems that were not in substantial compliance with FFMIA. For DHS to develop a strong financial management infrastructure, it will need to address these and many other financial management issues. Through the study of several leading private and public sector finance organizations (Creating Value Through World-class Financial Management, GAO/AIMD-00-134), GAO has identified success factors, practices, and outcomes associated with world-class financial management. Four steps DHS can take to begin developing sound financial management and business processes are to: (1) make financial management an entity-wide priority, (2) redefine the role of the finance organization, (3) provide meaningful information to decision makers; and (4) build a team that delivers results. H.R. 2886 can help facilitate the creation of a first-rate financial management architecture at DHS by providing the necessary tools and setting high expectations. The bill would (1) make DHS a CFO Act agency, (2) require DHS to obtain an opinion on its internal controls, and (3) require DHS to include program performance information in its performance and accountability reports. GAO fully supports the objectives of the CFO Act to provide reliable financial information and improve financial management systems and controls and believes DHS should be included under the act and therefore also subject to FFMIA. Further, GAO strongly believes that auditor reporting on internal control can be a critical component of monitoring the effectiveness and accountability of an organization and supports DHS, as well as other CFO Act agencies, obtaining such opinions. In addition, GAO supports agencies including program performance information in their performance and accountability reports and strongly encourages DHS to report this information voluntarily. Finally, as introduced, H.R. 2886 provided a waiver allowing DHS to forego a financial statement audit for fiscal year 2003. We understand an agreement has been reached to remove this waiver from the proposed legislation. DHS has committed to a 2003 financial statement audit, which is already underway. GAO supports dropping this provision from H.R. 2886."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.

The perspective we offer in this testimony is derived  from an extensive body of work on these topics completed by inspector  generals, independent auditors, as well as from GAO reports; executive  guidance; and testimony related to financial management and DHS.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 brought together 22 diverse agencies  and created a new cabinet-level department to help prevent terrorist  attacks in the United States, reduce the vulnerability of the United States to  terrorist attacks, and minimize the damage and assist in recovery from  attacks that do occur. Efforts to improve homeland security will require a  results-oriented approach to ensure mission accountability and  sustainability over time, and DHS must have a strong financial management  infrastructure to support these goals. As stated in the President\u2019s  Management Agenda, accurate and timely financial information is needed  to secure the best performance and highest measure of accountability for  the American people.", "DHS has stated its commitment to becoming a model of efficiency and  effectiveness for the federal government. To achieve this goal, it must first  overcome significant challenges in integrating 22 separate agencies and  their systems into a single, effective department, as well as correct the wide  array of existing management challenges in the inherited components.  Developing a financial management architecture with integrated systems  and business processes is one of the many difficult challenges the new  department faces. We designated implementation and transformation of  DHS as high risk based on three factors: (1) the implementation and  transformation of DHS is an enormous undertaking that will take time to  achieve in an effective and efficient manner, (2) components to be merged  into DHS already face a wide array of existing challenges, and (3) failure to  effectively carry out its mission would expose the nation to potentially very  serious consequences. Our high-risk program has helped the executive  branch and the Congress to galvanize efforts to seek lasting solutions to  high-risk problems and challenges.", "Complicating DHS\u2019s efforts to develop a strong financial management  infrastructure are the many known financial management weaknesses and  vulnerabilities in the agencies DHS inherited. For example, for four of the  seven major agencies that transferred to DHS on March 1, 2003\u2014the  Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA), the Customs Service, and the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA)\u2014auditors reported 18 material weaknesses  in internal control for fiscal year 2002.

Currently, based on its budget,  DHS is the largest entity in the federal government that is not subject to the  Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990. As such, this department, with  a fiscal year 2004 budget request of nearly $40 billion and currently more  than 170,000 employees, does not have a presidentially appointed CFO  subject to Senate confirmation and is not required to comply with FFMIA.  The goals of the CFO Act and related financial reform legislation, such as  FFMIA, are to provide the Congress and agency management with reliable  financial information for managing and making day-to-day decisions and to  improve financial management systems and controls to properly safeguard  the government\u2019s assets. DHS should not be the only cabinet-level  department not covered by what is the cornerstone for pursuing and  achieving the requisite financial management systems and capabilities in  the federal government.", "The creation of DHS presents an opportunity for the federal government to  ensure that it designs and implements a world-class organization with a  first-rate financial management systems architecture. Providing DHS with  the necessary tools, which would be facilitated by the passage of H.R. 2886,  and setting high expectations are of paramount importance to its success.

Furthermore, some of the entities that transferred may also have  weaknesses not yet identified or reported on merely because the problems  were considered small or immaterial in relation to their large parent  departments, such as the Department of Defense or the U.S. Department of  Agriculture. Such weaknesses may become evident now that these smaller  agencies are proportionately larger as a part of DHS, add to the known  extensive existing challenges, and may therefore be subjected to increased  levels of audit scrutiny. Cumulatively, these weaknesses and the efforts  needed to resolve them to achieve sound financial management and  business processes are an important reason for amending the CFO Act to  include DHS and measuring DHS\u2019s financial management systems and  internal control against the same important financial reform legislation and  performance expectations as other federal departments and agencies.", "DHS, like other federal agencies, has a stewardship obligation to prevent  fraud, waste, and abuse, to use tax dollars appropriately, and to ensure  financial accountability to the President, the Congress, and the American  people. For the most part, DHS\u2019s component entities are using legacy  financial management systems that have a myriad of problems, such as  disparate, nonintegrated, outdated, and inefficient systems and processes.  DHS will need to focus on building future systems as part of its enterprise  architecture approach to ensure an overarching framework for the agency\u2019s  integrated financial management processes. Plans and standard accounting  policies and procedures must be developed and implemented to bridge the  many financial environments in which inherited agencies currently operate  to an integrated DHS system.", "Another significant challenge for DHS is fixing the previously identified  weaknesses that the agencies bring with them to DHS, a number of which I  will now discuss."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Immigration and Naturalization Service", "paragraphs": ["While receiving unqualified audit opinions on its fiscal year 2001 and 2002  financial statements, the former INS under the Department of Justice  (DOJ) faces numerous challenges in achieving a sound financial  management environment.

Specifically, auditors noted limitations  in the design and operation of INS\u2019s financial accounting system, thereby  requiring it to use stand-alone systems or obtain the required financial  information via manual processes and nonroutine adjustments as part of  the financial statement preparation process.

Accordingly, INS was not able to accurately and regularly determine fees it  earns without relying on an extensive servicewide, year-end physical count  of over 5.4 million pending applications, as was the case in fiscal year 2002.  INS has been developing a new tracking system to facilitate its inventory  process. However, until the new system is implemented, INS must rely on  inefficient manual processes that significantly disrupt its operations. These  and other inherent weaknesses in INS\u2019s financial management process limit  its ability to produce useful, accurate, and timely financial information.", "Despite the importance and prevalence of information technology (IT)  systems in accomplishing its core missions, INS has not yet established and  implemented effective controls for managing its IT resources. The root  cause of INS\u2019s systems problems has been an absence of effective  enterprise architecture management and an IT investment management  process. To address such weaknesses, INS has been developing an  enterprise architecture, including a current and target architecture, as well  as a transition plan. Similarly, INS has taken steps to implement rigorous  and disciplined investment management controls. However, with the  transfer to DHS and the splitting of INS, these plans will have to be  reanalyzed, further delaying implementation of effective systems and  complicating DHS\u2019s ability to produce reliable, timely, and accurate  financial statements and information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Emergency Management Agency", "paragraphs": ["FEMA, the only CFO Act agency to transfer in its entirety to DHS, faces  several major financial management challenges, in spite of receiving an  unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 2002 financial statements.

One major  weakness was FEMA\u2019s inability to efficiently prepare accurate financial  statements as called for in the President\u2019s Management Agenda. For  example, auditors reported that for fiscal year 2002, FEMA did not have an  integrated financial reporting process that could generate financial  statements as a byproduct of already existing processes, and that its  financial statements were prepared late and required significant revisions.", "In addition, auditors reported in fiscal year 2001 and again in fiscal year  2002 that FEMA did not have adequate accounting systems and processes  to ensure that all property, plant, and equipment were properly recorded,  accurately depreciated, and tracked in accordance with its polices and  applicable federal accounting standards. As a result, FEMA\u2019s property  management system cannot track items to supporting documentation or to  a current location. Furthermore, FEMA lacks procedures to ensure that   (1) equipment is consistently recorded on either a system or a component  basis, (2) procedures are in place to ensure that property inventories are  performed properly, and (3) all equipment is entered into its personal  property management system. As a result, there is an increased risk that  equipment and other property could be lost, stolen, or improperly recorded  in its accounting records.", "Since FEMA was the only agency to transfer to DHS in its entirety, it, unlike  all of the other agencies, is left without a legacy department to prepare  financial statements for the first 5 months of activity for fiscal year 2003 or  an Office of Inspector General (OIG) to audit them, leaving FEMA\u2019s  financial management information for the first 5 months of this fiscal year  vulnerable to omissions, errors, and ultimately material misstatements.  Given the weaknesses in, among other things, FEMA\u2019s property controls,  we are initiating a review of FEMA\u2019s disbursement activity and property  management controls covering this 5-month period.

This qualified opinion was  due to the identification of four material weaknesses in Customs\u2019 internal  controls by its independent auditors. For example, auditors reported that  Customs\u2019 financial systems did not capture all transactions as they  occurred during the year; did not record all transactions properly; were not  fully integrated; and did not always provide for essential controls with  respect to override capabilities. As a result, extensive manual procedures  and analysis were required to process certain routine transactions and  prepare year-end financial statements.", "Customs, which typically collects and processes over $23 billion in fees  annually, was found to have poor collection procedures throughout the  agency. Ongoing weaknesses in the design and operation of Customs\u2019  controls over trade activities and financial management and information  systems continue to inhibit the effective management of these activities  and protection of trade revenue. For example, auditors reported that  Customs\u2019 Automated Commercial System could not provide summary  information on the total unpaid assessments for duties, taxes, and fees by  individual importer. The system also could not generate periodic  management information on outstanding receivables, the age of  receivables, or other data necessary for managers to effectively monitor  collection procedures. Such a capability would allow Customs to give  managers timely access to program revenue information and more  effectively present performance measures, which is critical for  implementation of the President\u2019s Management Agenda.", "Despite Customs\u2019 progress in implementing recommendations GAO and  others have made over the years, numerous weaknesses continue to hinder  progress toward developing Customs\u2019 planned import system, the  Automated Commercial Environment (ACE). ACE is intended to replace  the current system used for collecting import-related data and ensuring,  among other things, that trade-related revenue is properly collected and  allocated. To ensure proper implementation of these initiatives, DHS\u2019s  management must continue to provide a sustained level of commitment to  its successful implementation. Until this system is fully implemented,  billions in trade-related revenue will continue to be tracked by systems  with inadequate controls.

In fiscal  year 2002, auditors reported five material weaknesses and that TSA\u2019s  systems were not in substantial compliance with FFMIA. Specifically,  auditors found that TSA management had not established written  accounting policies and procedures to properly perform TSA\u2019s financial  management and budgeting functions during fiscal year 2002. This is an  example of what can happen when a newly created entity does not  thoroughly develop and implement standard accounting policies and  procedures. DHS should carefully review TSA\u2019s weaknesses to avoid  experiencing them on a departmentwide basis.", "Auditors also reported that TSA did not maintain complete and accurate  records of its passenger and baggage screening equipment, most notably its  Explosive Detection System (EDS) equipment. For example, a significant  amount of fixed assets were found to not be recorded in the financial  statements and an adjustment of approximately $149 million was made  after year-end to properly record construction in progress for the  manufacture of EDS equipment. Until such weaknesses are resolved,  millions of dollars spent on new equipment and other fixed assets could go  unaccounted for or be improperly recorded, leaving TSA and DHS  vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.", "Another weakness reported by DOT\u2019s OIG was TSA\u2019s inadequate controls  over security screener contracts. Policies and procedures were not  established to provide an effective span of control to monitor contractor  costs and performance.

Our study of several world-class finance  organizations indicated the following as best practices to build a team that  can deliver results: (1) develop a finance team with the right mix of skills  and competencies, and (2) attract and retain talent.", "Given the current demand on resources and the competition for qualified  employees, developing and retaining a talented finance team that is capable  of meeting the changing demands of the federal financial workplace is an  important goal. The lack of highly qualified financial management  professionals can hamper effective federal financial management  operations. The CFO Act requires OMB\u2019s Deputy Director for Management  to develop and maintain qualification standards for agency CFOs and their  deputies; provide advice to agencies on the qualification, recruitment,  performance, and retention of financial management personnel; and assess  the adequacy of financial management staffs throughout the government.  Additionally, the CFO Act places responsibility with the CFO to recruit,  select, and train finance personnel.", "To help department leaders manage their people and integrate human  capital considerations into daily decision making and the program results  they seek to achieve, we developed a strategic human capital model. This  model is applicable to department leadership as a whole but is also  applicable to finance organization leadership as they seek to attract,  develop, and retain talent. The two critical success factors identified in our  model to assist organizations in creating results-oriented cultures are  (1) linking unit and individual performance to organizational goals and (2)  involving employees in the decision-making process. Agency leaders have  other opportunities for displaying their commitment to human capital.  Continuous learning efforts, employee-friendly workplace policies,  competency-based performance appraisal systems, and retention and  reward programs are all ways in which agencies can value and invest in  their human capital. The sustained provision of resources for such  programs can show employees and potential employees the commitment  agency leaders have to strategic human capital management. DHS should  adopt these success factors in building a financial management team that  delivers results.", "It is well recognized that mergers of the magnitude of DHS carry significant  risks, including lost productivity and inefficiencies. Successful  transformations of large organizations generally can take from 5 to 7 years  to achieve. Necessary management capacity, communication and  information systems, as well as sound financial management and business  processes must be established. Though creating and maintaining these  structures will be demanding and time consuming, it is necessary to  effectively implement the national homeland security strategy.", "Over the past several months, we have met with DHS\u2019s CFO, Acting  Inspector General and Assistant Inspector General for Audits, and its  independent auditors performing its financial statement audit for 2003. We  are committed to working in a coordinated effort with the Congress, DHS,  and its auditors to provide advice to DHS on developing a sound financial  management structure that will facilitate, and not hamper, its mission of  securing the homeland.

In addition, H.R.  2886 as introduced would have provided a waiver allowing DHS to forego a  financial statement audit for fiscal year 2003. We understand an agreement  has been reached to remove this waiver from the proposed legislation.  DHS\u2019s 2003 audit is already underway and the department has stated it is  committed to obtaining this audit. The waiver option is, therefore, no  longer needed, and we support dropping the provision from H.R. 2886."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inclusion of DHS as a CFO Act Agency", "paragraphs": ["We supported passage of the CFO Act in 1990 and continue to strongly  support its objectives of (1) giving the Congress and agency decision  makers reliable financial, cost, and performance information both annually  and, most important, as needed throughout the year to assist in managing  programs and making difficult spending decisions, (2) dramatically  improving financial management systems, controls, and operations to  eliminate fraud, waste, abuse, and mismanagement and properly safeguard  and manage the government\u2019s assets, and (3) establishing effective  financial organizational structures to provide strong leadership. Achieving  these goals is critical for establishing effective financial management, and  we fully support amending the CFO Act to include DHS.", "In developing the CFO Act, the Congress viewed the CFO as being a critical  player in the management of an agency. At the time, financial management  was not a priority in most federal agencies and was all too often an  afterthought. All too often, the top financial management official wore  many hats, which left little time for financial management; did not  necessarily have any background in financial management; and focused  primarily on the budget. By establishing statutorily the position of CFO,  requiring that the person in the position have strong qualifications and a  proven track record in financial management, and giving this person status  as a presidential appointee, the Congress sought to change the then  existing paradigm. Of the 24 agencies named in the 1990 CFO Act, 16 were  designated as Level IV, Presidential appointee Senate confirmation  positions and eight were career positions. Today, CFOs have become  influential across government and the quality of the appointees has borne  out the wisdom of the Congress\u2019s insistence that this position be elevated  (meaning it reported to the top and had standing with other top officials).  We have seen an evolution of the CFO position and a quantum change in  the expertise and abilities of CFOs and the attractiveness of this position to  someone having the type of proven track record in financial management  that is needed in the federal government. In the end, the key attribute is the  quality of the person in the position to affect change and carry out the role  of CFO and whether the head of the agency supports the CFO and  empowers that person to do the job needed. Appointment of the CFO by  the President, subject to Senate confirmation, is one way to help ensure  that the goals of the CFO Act are met and that has proven itself over time.", "The CFO Act, as expanded by the Government Management Reform Act of  1994, also requires agencies to prepare and have audited financial  statements. The Congress added further emphasis to the importance of  sound financial management when it enacted FFMIA. Under the  Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, DHS, as an executive branch  agency with budget authority greater than $25 million, would be required to  obtain annual financial statement audits; however, its auditors would not  have to report on compliance with FFMIA. Although DHS has appropriately  contracted with independent auditors to report on its systems compliance  with FFMIA for fiscal year 2003, it is not legally required to do so. FFMIA  requires that agencies implement and maintain financial management  systems that substantially comply with (1) federal systems requirements,  (2) federal accounting standards, and (3) the U.S. Government Standard  General Ledger. The ability to produce the data needed to efficiently and  effectively manage the day-to-day operations of the federal government and  provide accountability to taxpayers has been a long-standing challenge at  most federal agencies. As we discussed earlier, auditors reported that many  of the larger agencies that transferred to DHS were not in substantial  compliance with FFMIA prior to their transfer to DHS. Given these  preexisting compliance issues, in addition to issues that may arise with  system integration initiatives, it is critical that DHS be legally required to  comply with these important financial management reforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Opinion on Internal Controls", "paragraphs": ["Current OMB guidance for audits of government agencies and programs  requires auditor reporting on internal control, but not at the level of  providing an opinion on internal control effectiveness. However, we have  long believed and the Comptroller General has gone on record in congressional testimony that auditors have an important role in providing  an opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting  and compliance with laws and regulations in connection with major federal  departments and agencies. For a number of years, we have provided  separate opinions on internal control effectiveness for the federal entities  that we audit because of the importance of internal control to protecting  the public\u2019s interest. Specifically, we provide separate opinions on internal  controls and compliance with laws and regulations for our audits of the  U.S. government\u2019s consolidated financial statements, the financial  statements of the Internal Revenue Service and Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, the Schedules of Federal Debt managed by the Bureau of the  Public Debt, and numerous small entities\u2019 operations and funds. Our  reports and related efforts have engendered major improvements in  internal control.", "As part of the annual audit of our own financial statements, we practice  what we recommend to others and contract with an independent public  accounting firm for both an opinion on our financial statements and an  opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting  and compliance with laws and regulations. Our goal is to lead the way in  establishing the appropriate level of auditor reporting on internal control  for federal agencies, programs, and entities receiving significant amounts  of federal funding. Additionally, three agencies, Social Security  Administration (SSA), General Services Administration (GSA), and the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) voluntarily obtain separate  opinions on internal control effectiveness from their auditors, which is  commendable.", "Another consideration as the Congress decides whether to enact new  requirements is that an opinion on internal controls is what has been  prescribed by the Congress for publicly traded corporations. A final rule  issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission in June 2003 and  effective in August 2003 provides guidance for implementation of Section  404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires publicly traded  companies to establish and maintain an adequate internal control structure  and procedures for financial reporting and include in its annual report a  statement of management\u2019s responsibility for and management\u2019s  assessment of the effectiveness of those controls and procedures in  accordance with standards adopted by the Securities and Exchange  Commission. The final rule defines this requirement and requires  applicable companies to obtain a report in which a registered public  accounting firm expresses an opinion, or states that an opinion cannot be  expressed, concerning management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of  internal controls over financial reporting.", "Auditor reporting on internal control is a critical component of monitoring  the effectiveness of an organization\u2019s accountability. GAO strongly believes  that this is especially important for very large, complex, or challenged  entities. By giving assurance about internal control, auditors can better  serve their clients and other financial statement users and better protect  the public interest by having a greater role in providing assurances of the  effectiveness of internal control in deterring fraudulent financial reporting,  protecting assets, and providing an early warning of internal control  weaknesses. We believe auditor reporting on internal control is appropriate  and necessary for publicly traded companies and major public entities  alike. We also believe that such reporting is appropriate in other cases  where management assessment and auditor examination and reporting on  the effectiveness of internal control add value and mitigate risk in a cost- beneficial manner.", "We know that some will point to increased costs as a reason to remove this  provision from the legislation. We believe that auditors who follow the  Financial Audit Manual\u2014which was jointly developed by GAO and the  President\u2019s Council on Integrity and Efficiency (PCIE)\u2014should ordinarily  have little to no incremental costs associated with such reporting.", "We fully support having DHS, as well as all CFO Act agencies, obtain an  opinion on its internal control.

The Congress has recognized,  through legislation such as the CFO Act, that the federal government must  be held to the highest standards. We already know that many of the larger  agencies transferred to DHS have a history of poor financial management  systems and significant internal control weaknesses. These known  weaknesses provide further evidence that DHS\u2019s systems and financial  controls should be subject to provisions of the CFO Act and thus FFMIA.
