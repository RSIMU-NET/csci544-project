To reduce the risk of cost and schedule overruns, DOD revamped its acquisition policy in May 2003. The policy provides detailed guidance on how weapon systems acquisitions should be managed. The Senate report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2004 required GAO to determine whether DOD's policy supports knowledge-based, evolutionary acquisitions and whether the policy provides the necessary controls for DOD to ensure successful outcomes, such as meeting cost and schedule goals. The report also required GAO to assess whether the policy is responsive to certain requirements in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003 concerning DOD's management of the acquisition process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD's new policy supports knowledge-based, evolutionary acquisitions by adopting lessons learned from successful commercial companies. One of those lessons is a knowledge-based approach, which requires program managers to attain the right knowledge at critical junctures--also known as knowledge points--so they can make informed investment decisions throughout the acquisition process. The policy also embraces an evolutionary or phased development approach, which sets up a more manageable environment for attaining knowledge. The customer may not get the ultimate capability right away, but the product is available sooner and at a lower cost. Leading firms have used these approaches--which form the backbone of what GAO calls the best practices model--to determine whether a project can be accomplished with the time and money available and to reduce risks before moving a product to the next stage of development. By adopting best practices in the acquisition policy, DOD's leadership has taken a significant step forward. The next step is to provide the necessary controls to ensure a knowledge-based, evolutionary approach. Implementing the necessary controls at all three knowledge points along the acquisition process helps decision makers ensure a knowledge-based approach is followed. Without controls in the form of measurable criteria that decision makers must consider, DOD runs the risk of making decisions based on overly optimistic assumptions. Each successive knowledge point builds on the preceding one, and having clearly established controls helps decision makers gauge progress in meeting goals and ensuring successful outcomes. DOD was responsive to the requirements in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. DOD's responses reflected the committee's specific concerns about the application of certain statutory and regulatory requirements to the new evolutionary acquisition process, for more guidance for implementing spiral development, and about technology readiness at program initiations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) plans to spend more than $1 trillion  from fiscal years 2003 to 2009 for developing and procuring weapon  systems.

The policy embraces a knowledge-based, evolutionary framework that emphasizes shorter development times.", "DOD intends to use its policy to improve its record for meeting cost and  schedule estimates and for delivering capabilities as promised. Congress  has expressed support for DOD\u2019s efforts to revamp its acquisition process  and has established requirements that DOD must take to ensure a  disciplined approach. Recognizing that a consistent and disciplined  application of policies will be key to achieving desired outcomes, the  Senate Armed Services Committee directed us to assess DOD\u2019s  current acquisition policies to determine whether they (1) support  knowledge-based, evolutionary acquisitions, (2) provide the necessary  controls to ensure DOD\u2019s policy intent is followed, and (3) respond to  specific requirements in the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-314) regarding DOD plans to  manage its new acquisition process."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Traditionally, DOD\u2019s strategy for acquiring major weapon systems has  been to plan programs that would achieve a big leap forward in capability.  However, because the needed technologies often are not yet mature,  programs stay in development for years until the technologies are  demonstrated. As a result, weapon systems have frequently been  characterized by poor cost, schedule, and performance outcomes. This has  slowed modernization efforts, reduced the buying power of the defense  dollar, delayed capabilities for the warfighter, and forced unplanned\u2014and  possibly unnecessary\u2014trade-offs among programs.", "Our extensive body of work shows that leading companies use a product  development model that helps reduce risks and increase knowledge when  developing new products. This best practices model enables decision  makers to be reasonably certain about their products at critical junctures  during development and helps them make informed investment decisions.  This knowledge-based process can be broken down into three cumulative  knowledge points.", "Knowledge point 1: A match must be made between the customer\u2019s  needs and the developer\u2019s available resources\u2014technology, engineering  knowledge, time, and funding\u2014before a program starts.", "Knowledge point 2: The product\u2019s design must be stable and must  meet performance requirements before initial manufacturing begins.", "Knowledge point 3: The product must be producible within cost,  schedule, and quality targets and demonstrated to be reliable before  production begins.", "To bolster the knowledge-based process, leading companies use  evolutionary product development, an incremental approach that enables  developers to rely more on available resources rather than making  promises about unproven technologies. While the user may not initially  receive the ultimate capability under this approach, the initial product is  available sooner and at a lower, more predictable cost. Also, leading  companies know that invention cannot be scheduled and its cost is  difficult to estimate. They do not bring technology into new product  development unless that technology has been demonstrated to meet the  user\u2019s requirements. Allowing technology development to spill over into  product development puts an extra burden on decision makers and  provides a weak foundation for making product development estimates.", "DOD understands that it must improve acquisition process outcomes if  it is to modernize its forces within currently projected resources. To  help achieve this goal, DOD has revised its acquisition policy, called the  5000 series, to reflect best practices from successful commercial and DOD  programs. The policy covers most\u2014but not all\u2014major acquisitions. The  Secretary of Defense has delegated authority to the Missile Defense  Agency and to the National Security Space Team to develop separate  guidance for missile defense and space systems, respectively.Approximately 35 percent of DOD\u2019s development funds in 2003 went to  these systems. (Figure 1 shows how $43.1 billion in development funds  were distributed across space, missile defense, and systems covered by  the 5000 series.)

The revised policy has the potential to  transform DOD\u2019s acquisition process by reducing risks and increasing the  chances for successful outcomes. The policy provides a framework for  developers to ask themselves at key decision points whether they have  the knowledge they need to move to the next phase of acquisition. If  rigorously applied, this knowledge-based framework can help managers  gain the confidence they need to make significant and sound investment  decisions for major weapon systems. In placing greater emphasis on  evolutionary product development, the policy sets up a more manageable  environment for achieving knowledge. Another best practice reflected in  the policy\u2019s framework is separating technology development from  product development, which reduces technological risk at the start of  a program.", "As shown in table 1, DOD\u2019s policy emphasizes best practices used by  leading companies.", "Similar to the best practices model, DOD\u2019s policy divides its acquisition  process into phases, as shown in figure 2. Key decisions are aligned with  the three critical junctures of a product\u2019s development, or knowledge  points.", "In other similarities, DOD\u2019s framework pinpoints program start at  milestone B, about the same point as program start on the best practices  model. At the midway point on both approaches, a stable product design  should be demonstrated. With DOD\u2019s framework, managers are required to  know\u2014by the time full-rate production decision review occurs\u2014whether  the product can be produced within cost, schedule, and quality targets.  This requirement occurs earlier in the best practices model, before  production begins, or at knowledge point 3.

Controls are  considered effective if they are backed by measurable criteria and if  decision makers are required to consider them before deciding to advance  a program to the next level. Controls used by leading companies help  decision makers gauge progress in meeting cost, schedule, and  performance goals and ensure that managers will (1) conduct activities to  capture relevant product development knowledge, (2) provide evidence  that knowledge was captured, and (3) hold decision reviews to determine  that appropriate knowledge was captured to move to the next phase.", "To determine if DOD has the necessary controls, we compared controls in  DOD\u2019s policy with those used in the best practices model at three critical  junctures. Table 2 shows the presence or absence of controls for various  versions of DOD policy since 1996, including the May 2003 revision.", "At all three knowledge points, DOD\u2019s policy does not provide all the  necessary controls used by commercial companies. For example, at  program launch (milestone B) or when knowledge point 1 should be  reached, the policy requires decision makers to identify and validate a  weapon system\u2019s key performance requirements and to have a technical  solution for the system before program start. This information is then used  to form cost and schedule estimates for the product\u2019s development.  However, the policy does not emphasize the use of a disciplined systems  engineering process for balancing a customer\u2019s needs with resources to  deliver a preliminary design. The lack of effective controls at knowledge  point 1 could result in gaps between requirements and resources being  discovered later in development.", "At the design readiness review or when knowledge point 2 should be  reached, DOD\u2019s policy does not require specific controls to document that  a product is ready for initial manufacturing and demonstration. DOD\u2019s  policy suggests appropriate criteria, such as number of subsystem and  system design reviews completed, percentage of drawings completed,  planned corrective actions to hardware and software deficiencies,  adequate development testing, completed failure modes and effects  analysis, identification of key system characteristics and critical  manufacturing processes, and availability of reliability targets and growth  plans. However, these criteria are not required. For example, we found  that a key indicator of a product\u2019s design stability is the completion of  90 percent of the engineering drawings supported by design reviews.  DOD\u2019s policy does not require that a certain percentage of drawings or  design reviews be completed to ensure the design is mature enough to  enter the system demonstration phase. As a result, a decision maker has  no benchmark to consider when deciding to advance a program to the  next level of development.", "Finally, at production commitment or when knowledge point 3 should be  reached, DOD\u2019s policy does not require specific controls to document that  a product can be manufactured to meet cost, schedule, and quality targets  before moving into production. For example, the policy states there  should be \u201cno significant manufacturing risks\u201d at the start of low-rate  production but does not define what this means or how it is to be  measured. DOD\u2019s policy does not require the demonstrated control of  manufacturing processes and the collection of statistical process control  data until full-rate production begins but even then fails to specify a  measurable control. Given that low-rate production can last several years,  a significant number of products can be manufactured before processes  are brought under control, creating a higher probability of poor cost and  schedule outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Is Responsive to Congressional Requirements about New Acquisition Process", "paragraphs": ["While supporting efforts to build more flexibility into the DOD acquisition  process and to develop weapon systems using an evolutionary approach,  Congress asked DOD to be more disciplined in its approach.
