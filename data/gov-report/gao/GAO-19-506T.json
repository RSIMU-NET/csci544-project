In response, USDA developed a process for reviewing and acting on its monitoring results.", "Summer Food Service Program (SFSP). In 2018, GAO identified several opportunities for USDA to improve program integrity in the SFSP, which provides food to children in low-income areas when schools are closed for vacation.

Since fiscal year 2013, the school meals programs have consistently reported the highest improper payment rates across the child nutrition programs. Over time, USDA has taken a variety of corrective actions aimed at reducing improper payments in child nutrition programs, yet estimated improper payment rates for these programs remained generally steady until fiscal year 2018. For that year, USDA changed what it considers to be an improper payment in the school meals programs, resulting in improper payment estimates that are substantially lower than those from prior years.

Specifically, in January  2014, we recommended that FNS take two different actions aimed at  providing assistance to improve state oversight of local school food  authority (SFA) administration of the programs; and in May 2014, we  recommended that FNS take multiple actions to improve oversight and  enhance verification processes that ensure only children who meet  income requirements receive free and reduced price school meals.", "In January 2014, we reported that FNS had provided a significant amount  of guidance and training to help states with oversight of local SFAs that  directly provide meals to children in schools, but that certain aspects of  the guidance may have hindered state oversight of program  compliance. (See fig. 1 for entities involved in school meals oversight.)  For example, we found evidence indicating that FNS\u2019s guidance allowing  states to focus their oversight on providing technical assistance to SFAs,  rather than documenting instances of noncompliance and requiring  corrective actions to address them, may have resulted in some SFAs that  were not fully meeting requirements being certified as in compliance.  According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  federal agencies should have policies and practices in place to provide  reasonable assurance that programs are operating in compliance with  applicable laws and regulations. Without documentation of  noncompliance and requirements for corrective actions, SFAs may not  have adequate information on the types of ongoing compliance issues  and the need to take corrective actions. Further, FNS may lack  information on areas that are problematic across SFAs, which could be  the focus of future technical assistance efforts.", "In 2014, FNS substantially revised and updated the process through  which states conduct program oversight\u2014the administrative review\u2014and  in our January report, we also found that states reported a need for more  information and training related to monitoring SFA financial  management. Specifically, we reported that, previously, states had not  been required to assess SFA financial management during monitoring  reviews, but that states were now responsible for reviewing several  aspects of SFA financial management, such as their nonprofit food  service accounts and indirect costs. We surveyed all of the states, and  over three-fourths reported the need for additional guidance or training  from FNS on SFA financial management. We found that while FNS had  provided some assistance to states on the new requirements related to  SFA financial management, FNS officials had not collected information  from all states on their needs in this area. Because state reviews are the  key tool used to ensure the integrity of the school meals programs, if state  reviewers are unable to effectively review SFA financial management, the  federal government will lack assurance that SFAs are complying with  federal requirements in this area.", "In our January 2014 report, we recommended that the Secretary of  Agriculture direct the Administrator of FNS to (1) clarify to states the  importance of documenting compliance issues found during  administrative reviews and requiring corrective actions to address them,  and (2) assess all states\u2019 needs for information to improve their ability to  oversee SFA financial management and provide assistance to meet  identified needs. FNS officials generally agreed with our  recommendations and have since addressed them. For example, FNS  issued a memo on July 11, 2014, to all regional and state directors  reiterating the importance of documenting review findings and any  resulting technical assistance and corrective actions. Also in that month,  FNS completed its initial efforts to systematically assess all states\u2019 needs  for information to improve their ability to oversee SFA financial  management. Further, in 2015 and 2016, FNS discussed financial  management issues with states during a national meeting and held three  national training sessions and a webinar focused on reviewing SFA  financial management.", "In our May 2014 report on school meals, we found that FNS had taken  steps to help identify and prevent children ineligible for free or reduced  price meals from receiving those benefits, but additional opportunities  existed to enhance the application verification process and strengthen  program integrity. For example, we reported that school districts are  required to verify applications for free and reduced price meals if they are  deemed to be questionable, known as for-cause verification. Some school  districts were not conducting any for-cause verifications and FNS  guidance did not provide indicators or describe scenarios that could assist  school districts in identifying questionable applications. Further, FNS\u2019s  data on the outcomes of applications verified for cause were combined  with data on the outcomes of applications verified for other reasons,  limiting FNS\u2019s ability to use these data to assess the effectiveness of for- cause verifications. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government direct agencies to design control activities to ensure  management\u2019s directives are carried out. Without FNS analysis of data  on the outcomes of for-cause verifications, or provision of additional  guidance on applications that may merit for-cause verification, some  school districts may have continued to overlook these applications,  potentially hindering program integrity.", "In our May 2014 report, we recommended that the Secretary of  Agriculture take multiple actions to improve integrity of the school meals  programs through additional verification of applications, including that  USDA evaluate the data collected on for-cause verification outcomes,  and, if appropriate, provide additional guidance for conducting for-cause  verification that includes possible indicators of questionable or ineligible  applications. FNS took actions in response to all of our  recommendations. For example, FNS reported in March 2017 that it  analyzed the data on verification outcomes and did not find that any  benefit in integrity and oversight would be gained by requiring the  reporting of for-cause verification outcomes separately. However, FNS  also reported that it disseminated additional guidance in August 2014 for  conducting for-cause verifications, which included criteria for identifying  possible indicators of questionable or ineligible applications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FNS Took Steps to Improve WIC Program Integrity and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["In 2013 and 2014, we issued two reports on WIC that found multiple  opportunities for FNS to improve program integrity and oversight, many of  which FNS has since addressed. Specifically, in February 2013, we  recommended that FNS review federal monitoring reports on state WIC  program administration to assess program risks at a national level, and in  December 2014, we recommended that FNS take multiple actions to  improve federal WIC oversight and assist states\u2019 efforts to prevent and  address online sales of WIC formula.", "In our February 2013 report, we found that FNS regularly assisted and  monitored states\u2019 administration of WIC but needed to improve agency  oversight of states\u2019 policies and procedures for determining WIC  applicants\u2019 income eligibility for the program. We reported that while  federal regulations define criteria that must be used to determine  applicants\u2019 income eligibility for WIC, state and local agencies are also  given some discretion. We found that FNS generally had not focused its  assistance to states on key income eligibility requirements for which  states have discretion, such as determination of family size and the time  period of income assessed, in the years preceding our report. However,  through its monitoring reports, FNS had identified problems with, or  concerns about, income eligibility determination policies or procedures in  one-third of the states reviewed. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government indicate that management should identify, analyze,  and respond to risks related to achieving defined objectives and note that  risk identification methods may include consideration of deficiencies  identified through audits and other assessments. At the time of our  review, FNS officials said that they planned to begin regularly reviewing  monitoring findings at the national level to identify areas of program risk  and target assistance to states accordingly; however, officials did not  indicate when those reviews would begin. Without conducting a complete  review of its state monitoring findings, FNS lacked information it could  potentially use to target additional assistance and clarification on income  eligibility determination to states and help ensure overall program  integrity.", "In our February 2013 report, we recommended that the Secretary of  Agriculture direct FNS to develop a timeline for reviewing its federal  monitoring reports on state WIC program administration to assess  program risks at a national level and target assistance to states. FNS  officials concurred with our recommendation, and FNS has since  addressed it. Specifically, in that year, FNS staff developed a process to  use an automated report to identify areas in need of correction or  improvement that were found during its monitoring reviews of WIC  conducted across the country. The report went into production on  November 1, 2013, and FNS reported that staff would review the reports  quarterly to assess the frequency of findings in each policy and program  area and respond by providing policy clarification, training, or other  corrective actions to states.", "A posting from late June 2014  included the container size in the title  and stated: \u201cI am looking to sell 5 [brand  name] 12.5oz cans (NOT OPENED)  because  is super picky and does  not want to drink it no matter what i do.   will drink the  kind  for some reason.

We found that FNS had not  conducted any nationwide studies on the extent of online sales of WIC  formula by program participants, though information gathered from state  WIC officials and our own limited monitoring suggested that some WIC  formula was offered for sale online. (See sidebar.) The use of the  internet as a marketplace had substantially increased in the years  preceding our report; therefore, actions needed to ensure WIC  participants did not inappropriately use infant formula had changed as  well. Yet, we found that FNS had not studied cost-effective techniques for  monitoring potential online sales of WIC benefits. Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government note that agencies should identify,  analyze, and respond to significant changes that could impact the internal control system. However, FNS had not directed states to inform  participants that selling WIC formula, including online, is against program  rules, which could lead to participants making these sales and  unknowingly using program resources inappropriately. Further, we noted  that although states are responsible for controlling participant violations\u2014 including sales of WIC benefits\u2014FNS is responsible for determining  compliance with the WIC statute and regulations. However, we reported  that FNS had not required states to describe procedures for controlling  these violations in their WIC state plans, leaving the agency without  assurance that efforts were taking place nationwide.", "Through interviews with state and local WIC agency officials from 12  states for our December 2014 report, we found that states varied in their  approaches and the amount of resources devoted to monitoring  attempted WIC formula sales, and some expressed concerns about the  return on investment for these efforts. Because WIC participants  purchase the same brands and types of infant formula from stores as  non-WIC customers, monitoring attempted online sales of WIC formula  can present a challenge. State officials we spoke with cited additional  challenges to monitoring online sales, including the difficulty of identifying  WIC participants in online posts that allow sellers to remain relatively  anonymous, and as a result, some expressed concerns about the return  on investment for these monitoring efforts. Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government suggest that agencies consider both benefits  and costs when designing and implementing internal controls. However,  because FNS had not assessed the nationwide extent of online sales of  WIC formula by program participants, nor determined cost-effective  approaches for identifying and addressing these sales, FNS and the  states were poorly positioned to strike the appropriate balance of costs  and benefits when determining how to target their resources to ensure  program integrity.", "In our December 2014 report, we recommended that the Secretary of  Agriculture direct the Administrator of FNS to (1) instruct states to inform  participants that they are not allowed to sell WIC food benefits, including  online; (2) require states to inform FNS of their procedures for identifying  attempted sales of WIC food benefits and analyze the information to  ascertain the national extent of state efforts; and (3) collect information to  help assess the national extent of attempted online sales of WIC formula  and determine cost-effective techniques states can use to monitor online  classified advertisements. FNS agreed with our recommendations and  took several steps to address them, though the agency has yet to fully  address the third. Specifically, FNS promulgated final regulations that  were effective in May 2016 requiring state agencies to inform applicants  and participants about the prohibition against the sale of WIC food  benefits, including online. Further, in April 2015, FNS issued guidance  directing states to articulate their policies and procedures for identifying  and monitoring online sales of WIC benefits in their state plans; and in  July 2018, an FNS contractor completed a study analyzing state efforts in  this area. Also in that month, an FNS contractor completed a study  intended to provide information to help FNS address our third  recommendation that the agency assess the prevalence of online sales of  WIC formula and identify cost-effective techniques states can use to  monitor and prevent them. However, FNS indicated that it would not be  releasing the study to states, in part because it included information that  was investigative in nature. In April 2019, FNS officials indicated that they  are currently developing guidance on best practices and cost-effective  techniques identified in the report to disseminate to WIC state agencies  later in 2019. Informing states of cost-effective techniques for monitoring  and preventing online WIC formula sales would address our  recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FNS Is Planning Steps to Address Our SFSP Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In May 2018, we reviewed the SFSP, which generally provides food to  children in low-income areas during periods when schools are closed for  vacation, and assessed several aspects of the program, including  participation. (See fig. 2 for an SFSP breakfast we observed during a  site visit to one of three states we visited.) We found that nationwide, the  total number of meals served to children in low-income areas through the  SFSP increased from 113 to 149 million (about 32 percent) from fiscal  year 2007 through 2016. FNS directs states to use the number of meals  served, along with other data, to estimate the number of children  participating in the SFSP. However, we found that participation estimates  had been calculated inconsistently from state to state and year to year.  Recognizing this issue, in 2017, FNS clarified its instructions for  calculating participation estimates to help improve their consistency,  noting that these estimates are critical for informing program  implementation and strategic planning. However, we determined that the  method FNS directed states to use would continue to provide unreliable  estimates of participation, hindering the agency\u2019s ability to use them for  these purposes. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government  state that agencies should maintain quality data and process it into quality  information that is shared with stakeholders to help achieve agency  goals.", "In our May report, we made four recommendations to FNS to improve the  integrity of the SFSP, including that FNS take steps to improve its  estimate of children\u2019s participation in the SFSP by addressing, at a  minimum, identified issues that continued to limit the reliability of the  estimate. FNS officials generally agreed with our recommendations, and  the agency has since provided information on actions it has planned, or  begun to take, to address them. For example, in March 2019, FNS  reported that it plans to complete an evaluation of how SFSP participation  is calculated by summer 2020. We will continue to monitor FNS\u2019s  progress in addressing our SFSP recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Child Nutrition Programs Estimated $1.8 Billion in Improper Payments in Fiscal Year 2018 and Have Consistently Been Reported as Noncompliant with Improper Payment Requirements", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2018, USDA reported improper payments for the child  nutrition programs totaling an estimated $1.8 billion, or just over 1 percent  of the $151 billion in improper payments federal agencies estimated  government-wide in that year. GAO has reported improper payments as a  material weakness in internal control in its reports on the U.S.  government\u2019s consolidated financial statements, noting that improper  payments have consistently been a government-wide issue and reducing  these payments is critical to safeguarding federal funds. Since fiscal  year 2013, the school meals programs have consistently reported the  highest improper payment rate estimates across the child nutrition  programs. For example, in recent years, USDA reported annual improper  payment rate estimates of about 15 percent and 24 percent for the NSLP  and SBP, respectively, compared to about 5 percent and 1 percent for  WIC and CACFP, respectively. The estimated total amount of improper  payments in the school meals programs are also high, and these  programs, along with WIC, are included on OMB\u2019s list of programs with  over $100 million in annual monetary losses.", "The USDA Office of Inspector General\u2019s (OIG) most recent report on the  department\u2019s compliance with improper payment requirements, which  assessed fiscal year 2017, found that the four child nutrition programs for  which USDA estimates improper payments were noncompliant with  improper payment requirements. The reasons for noncompliance  varied, as the OIG noted that USDA has yet to develop a methodology to  report a complete improper payment estimate for CACFP, and  corrective actions taken in the other child nutrition programs have not  yielded the desired reductions in estimated improper payments.  According to our 2018 report, the four child nutrition programs contributed  to the government-wide total of 58 programs in 14 federal agencies that  agency inspectors general found were noncompliant with improper  payment requirements in fiscal year 2017. Further, the four child  nutrition programs had been reported as noncompliant for 7 years. We  also noted that USDA was one of three federal agencies with programs  reported as noncompliant for 3 or more consecutive years that had not  notified Congress of their noncompliance, as required, despite prior  recommendations that we, and the OIG, had made to USDA to do so.  However, USDA submitted a letter to Congress in June 2018 that  reported these programs\u2019 noncompliance and described the agency\u2019s  planned actions to bring them into compliance.", "Over time, USDA has undertaken a variety of corrective actions aimed at  reducing improper payments in the child nutrition programs, yet the  estimated improper payment rates for these programs remained generally  steady until fiscal year 2018. For that year, USDA changed what it  considers to be an improper payment in the school meals programs,  resulting in improper payment estimates that are substantially lower than,  and not comparable to, those from prior years. According to USDA, FNS  made this change after evaluating its definition of improper payments for  the school meals programs and determining that the agency would no  longer include a previously identified source of error in its estimates.  According to FNS officials, FNS implemented this change after  consultation with OMB, and FNS also briefed the USDA OIG on the  change in advance of implementation. The USDA OIG has not yet  released its report assessing USDA\u2019s fiscal year 2018 compliance with  improper payment requirements.", "To help ensure that annual estimates are produced for all child nutrition  programs susceptible to significant improper payments, a 2018 USDA  OIG report recommended that FNS complete an SFSP risk assessment  for improper payments taking into account all of the risk factors identified  by OMB as likely to contribute to improper payments. Although FNS\u2019s  2017 SFSP risk assessment concluded that the program was at low risk  for significant improper payments, the OIG found that FNS\u2019s assessment  was insufficient because it did not consider multiple risk factors regarding  program vulnerabilities and improper payments that OMB requires be  taken into account. The OIG reviewed SFSP\u2019s payment structure,  monitoring results, and investigations and media cases regarding fraud,  and found that these suggest the program is vulnerable to significant  improper payments. FNS concurred with the OIG\u2019s recommendation. In  April 2019, a senior FNS official indicated that the agency completed a  risk assessment for SFSP in response to the OIG\u2019s recommendation,  determined that the program is at a high risk of improper payments, and  is currently developing a methodology for measuring improper payments  in the program.", "Chairman Roberts, Ranking Member Stabenow, and Members of the  Committee, this completes my prepared statement.
