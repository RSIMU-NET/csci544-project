Further, SEC did not adequately segregate incompatible duties for one of its personnel.

We assessed the effectiveness of both general  and application controls by performing information system controls walkthroughs surrounding the  initiation, authorization, processing, recording, and reporting of  financial data (via interviews, inquiries, observations, and  inspections);  reviewing SEC policies and procedures; observing technical controls implemented on selected systems;  testing specific controls; and  scanning and manually assessing SEC systems and applications,  including EDGAR/Fee Momentum, and related general support  system network devices, and servers.", "We also evaluated the Statement on Standards for Attestation  Engagements report and performed testing on key information  technology controls on the following applications and systems: Delphi- Prism, FedInvest, and Federal Personnel and Payroll System.", "To determine the status of SEC\u2019s actions to correct or mitigate previously  reported information security deficiencies, we identified and reviewed its  information security policies, procedures, practices, and guidance. We  reviewed prior GAO reports to identify previously reported deficiencies  and examined the commission\u2019s corrective action plans to determine  which deficiencies it had reported as corrected. For those instances  where SEC reported that it had completed corrective actions, we  assessed the effectiveness of those actions by reviewing appropriate  documents, including SEC-documented corrective actions, and  interviewing the appropriate staffs, including system administrators.", "To assess the reliability of the data we analyzed, such as information  system control settings, specific control evaluations for each accounting  cycle, and security policies and procedures, we corroborated them by  interviewing SEC officials, including programmatic personnel, and system  administrators to determine whether the data obtained were consistent  with system configurations in place at the time of our review. In addition,  we observed configuration of these settings in the network. Based on this  assessment, we determined the data were reliable for the purposes of  this report.", "We performed this work in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provided a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Securities and Exchange Commission", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, GAO staff who made major  contributions to this report are Michael Gilmore and Duc Ngo (Assistant  Directors); Angela Bell; Monica Perez-Nelson; Priscilla Smith; Henry  Sutanto (Analyst-in-Charge) and Adam Vodraska."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
