Following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, increased demand resulted in rapid increases in Ex-Im's portfolio and exposure. The Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act of 2012 reauthorized Ex-Im through fiscal year 2014 and, as a condition of raising Ex-Im's exposure limit in 2013, required Ex-Im to prepare a report with a business plan and analyses of key operational elements. The act also directed GAO to analyze the Business Plan. This report discusses the extent to which Ex-Im's Business Plan and analyses (1) justify bank exposure limits; (2) evaluate the risk of loss associated with the increased exposure limit, changing composition of exposure, and compliance with congressional mandates; and (3) analyze the adequacy of Ex-Im resources to manage authorizations and comply with congressional mandates. GAO reviewed Ex-Im's Business Plan, analyses, and other reports, and interviewed Ex-Im officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the Export-Import Bank (Ex-Im) Business Plan reported that Ex-Im's exposure limits were appropriate, the forecasting process used to reach this conclusion has weaknesses. Congress increased the Ex-Im exposure limit--the limit on Ex-Im's total aggregate outstanding amount of financing--to $120 billion in 2012, with provisions for additional increases to $130 billion in 2013 and $140 billion in 2014. Although Ex-Im's forecast model is sensitive to key assumptions, GAO found that Ex-Im did not reassess these assumptions to reflect changing conditions or conduct sensitivity analyses to assess and report the range of potential outcomes. GAO used historical data in lieu of these assumptions and found that Ex-Im's forecast of exposure could be higher than the limit set by Congress for 2014. GAO's cost guidance calls for agencies' assumptions and forecasts to be supported by historical data and experience, and a sensitivity analysis, which can assess the effect of changes in assumptions. Because Ex-Im has not taken these steps, the reliability of its forecasts is diminished. This is of particular concern because Ex-Im projects that its outstanding financing in the future will be closer to its exposure limit than it has been historically. Consequently, any forecast errors could result in the bank having to take actions, such as delaying financing for creditworthy projects, to avoid exceeding its limit.", "The Business Plan provided limited analysis of Ex-Im's risk of loss. First, Ex-Im did not provide some forecast data because of pending Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approval of key analyses. For example, Ex-Im did not include conclusions on Ex-Im's overall risk of loss and risk by industry. Second, Ex-Im included only limited analysis to support its conclusions that changes in its portfolio--including subportfolios of transactions supporting congressional mandates for small business, sub-Saharan Africa, and renewable energy--would not affect its risk of loss. In addition, Ex-Im has not routinely analyzed or reported the risk rating and default rate of subportfolios that respond to these mandates, although their performance may differ from the overall portfolio. OMB and banking regulator guidance call for entities, including federal agencies, to be able to provide comprehensive information by subportfolio, product, and other financial performance metrics. By not routinely analyzing and reporting financial performance for mandated transactions, Ex-Im decreases its ability to evaluate such performance at the subportfolio level and inform Congress of related risks.", "The Business Plan provided limited analysis of the adequacy of Ex-Im's resources and ability to meet congressional mandates. From 2008 through 2012, Ex-Im's administrative resources remained relatively flat as its portfolio grew. Ex-Im does not expect to meet its small business or renewable energy mandate targets in 2013 or 2014. These mandate targets are fixed to a percentage of the dollar value of Ex-Im's total authorizations. Although Ex-Im has dedicated resources to support these mandates, as Ex-Im authorizations have grown, the growth in mandate targets has outpaced Ex-Im's increasing support. Ex-Im projects that the targets will continue to outpace its growth in support through 2014. Mandate transactions also are resource-intensive and Ex-Im's ability to expand its renewable energy portfolio may be constrained by the size of the overall market. Communicating the effect of percentage-based targets on Ex-Im's resources and ability to achieve its goals to external stakeholders, such as Congress, is consistent with federal internal control standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im should (1) adjust its forecasting model based on previous experience, (2) assess and report the sensitivity of the exposure forecast model to key assumptions and estimates, (3) routinely report the financial performance of subportfolios supporting congressional mandates, and (4) provide Congress with additional information on the resources associated with meeting mandated targets.

According to Ex-Im\u2019s  Office of the Chief Financial Officer, Ex-Im used the same process to  estimate authorizations for the Business Plan that it had used in previous  years to estimate authorizations for its annual budget estimates. Ex-Im  estimated long-term authorizations in the plan based on an analysis of its  pipeline of in-house applications and expected applications, in which  customers are in consultation with Ex-Im. For example, Ex-Im reviews  aircraft production and delivery schedules to determine when financing for  new aircraft is expected to be needed. Long-term transactions have a  consultation and application period of between 6 months and 3 years.  According to Ex-Im officials, the lead time for the largest project and  structured finance transactions is generally at the upper end of this range,  giving Ex-Im a more specific basis for its estimates within that time  horizon. Ex-Im forecast the average size for individual long-term  structured finance transactions in 2013 at $389 million, and $478 million  in 2014. Individual transportation authorizations for aircraft included in the  2013 and 2014 forecasts average approximately $266 and $203 million,  respectively.

Ex-Im estimated these based on information  gathered from Ex-Im partner banks\u2014as well as Ex-Im officials\u2019 own sense  of overall market trends. Ex-Im short- and medium-term transactions  averaged approximately $2.2 million in 2012.", "Ex-Im\u2019s Business Plan asserts that the pipeline approach has been  demonstrated to be the most effective forecasting methodology, but also  notes that large swings in the amount of transportation and project and  structured finance authorizations may occur due to fluctuations in overall  market conditions or situations unique to the transaction. According to Ex- Im, it is less likely that authorizations for aircraft or larger project and  structured finance authorizations would appear unexpectedly or not  occur, but these transactions may be delayed and their amount may  fluctuate. Smaller project and structured finance transactions and  nonaircraft transportation authorizations may have shorter lead times of  several months. Thus, they can be presented to Ex-Im and authorized  within 2013 or 2014 without Ex-Im having been aware of them in August  2012, when it prepared the Business Plan. Ex-Im\u2019s short- and medium- term transactions generally have shorter lead times than long-term  transactions, increasing the uncertainty of Ex-Im\u2019s forecast for these  transactions in future years. However, because of their generally smaller  size, it would take far more change in the number or size of these  transactions to affect Ex-Im\u2019s overall authorization or exposure estimates.", "Since the submittal of the plan in September 2012, the size of some Ex- Im forecast authorizations has fluctuated, as the plan noted could occur.  Approximately 6 months after preparing the plan, in February 2013, Ex-Im  management reviewed its 2013 authorization forecasts as part of its  internal planning. As of March 28, 2013, Ex-Im reduced its 2013 estimate  by $2.6 billion (6.9 percent) to $35.8 billion.", "Ex-Im reduced its 2013 transportation and structured finance  authorizations but did not change other 2013 forecasts. Changes in Ex- Im\u2019s forecast resulted from  transactions no longer expected to be completed in 2013 (decrease of  $5.7 billion),  changes in the size of specific authorizations still forecast to occur  (increase of $845 million), and new transactions not anticipated at the time of the August 2012  Business Plan forecast (increase of $2.2 billion).", "The forecast change in the total amount of authorizations in turn would  affect Ex-Im\u2019s forecast calculation of exposure.

Ex- Im\u2019s support for renewable energy exports grew from $30 million in 2008  to $721 million in 2011 and is forecast to reach $1.1 billion in 2014.  Although Ex-Im\u2019s renewable energy authorizations generally increased  since 2008, they have remained less than 3 percent of Ex-Im\u2019s overall  authorizations. Based on Ex-Im\u2019s projected total authorizations for 2013  and 2014, Ex-Im would have to authorize $3.8 billion in renewable energy  financing in 2013 and $4.3 billion in 2014 to meet the 10 percent target  (see fig. 8).", "Ex-Im officials stated that additional administrative resources would not  enable it to meet its renewable energy target, as its inability to meet the  target results from a lack of demand for renewable energy export  financing. Seven bank employees are directly involved in meeting Ex-Im\u2019s  renewable energy target, six in the Office of Renewable Energy and one  in the Structured Finance Group. However, Ex-Im officials noted that a  2010 Department of Commerce report estimated the value of all U.S.  renewable energy exports at $2 billion in 2009. Thus, if the bank had  financed every U.S. renewable energy export that year, it still could not  have met its renewable energy target.", "For both small business and renewable energy transactions, the  mandated authorization target is tied to total authorizations, which  increase or decrease based on factors unrelated to Ex-Im\u2019s performance  in support of small business or renewable energy. OMB guidance directs  agency leaders to set ambitious, yet realistic goals that reflect careful  analysis of associated challenges and the agency\u2019s capacity and  priorities. Communicating this information to external stakeholders, such  as Congress, that may have a significant impact on the agency achieving  its goals is also consistent with federal internal control standards.", "In addition to resources supporting renewable energy transactions, Ex-Im  devotes resources to implementing its carbon policy, which was put in  place in 2010, and developed in response to a lawsuit challenging Ex- Im\u2019s compliance with provisions of the National Environmental Policy  Act. The carbon policy (1) promotes renewable energy exports where  carbon dioxide emission levels are very low to zero, (2) establishes a  $250 million facility to promote renewable energy, and (3) calls for  increased transparency in the tracking and reporting of carbon dioxide  emissions. Although Ex-Im\u2019s carbon policy was not mandated by  Congress, the Business Plan notes that 2012 appropriations language  requires Ex-Im to notify Congress of projects that will generate more  greenhouse gases than bank-supported projects generated on average  during the preceding 3 years. The Business Plan also states that Ex-Im  may exceed this threshold as its level of activity increases. Ex-Im has  three environmental engineers who directly support compliance with the  carbon policy. Additionally, the vice president of Ex-Im\u2019s Environmental  and Engineering Division and another employee responsible for legal  policy spend 20 and 50 percent of their time, respectively, on carbon  policy-related activities.", "The sub-Saharan Africa mandate does not have quantifiable targets. This  mandate requires Ex-Im, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce  and the Trade Promotion Coordinating Committee, to promote the  expansion of its financial commitments in sub-Saharan Africa, establish  an advisory committee to assist with the implementation of policies and  programs to support this expansion, and report to Congress on efforts to  improve relations with relevant regional institutions and coordinate with  U.S. agencies pursuant to the African Growth and Opportunity Act. Two  employees from Ex-Im\u2019s Office of African Development are directly  involved in meeting the requirements of the sub-Saharan Africa mandate  and half of the duties of an Ex-Im vice chairman are also related to this  mandate.", "Ex-Im reports that it has met the requirements of this mandate and  expects to continue to meet this mandate. Ex-Im\u2019s efforts to meet this  mandate include: establishing an advisory committee to assist the Board  of Directors in meeting Ex-Im\u2019s sub-Saharan Africa mandate; and creating  a $100 million Africa Initiative to make insurance available for exports to  sub-Saharan African countries that otherwise would not be eligible for Ex- Im support. From 2008 to 2012, Ex-Im\u2019s authorizations supporting the  sub-Saharan Africa mandate increased from $575.5 million to $1.5 billion,  and are projected to decline to about $1 billion in 2013 before increasing  again to approximately $1.8 billion in 2014."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im has experienced enormous growth in its authorizations and  exposure in recent years, challenging its ability to plan for and manage its  portfolio. While Ex-Im may not have been able to anticipate the effect of  events like the 2007-2009 financial crisis on its portfolio, the bank also  has not reacted to the changed environment and taken steps to account  for the uncertainty of its authorization forecasts and reassess its exposure  forecast model and assumptions. These assumptions and forecasts  should be supported by historical data and experience. In addition, a  sensitivity assessment of the effect of these assumptions should be  presented to management.", "Furthermore, Ex-Im is a demand-driven institution, but Congress has  placed specific requirements on the bank\u2019s portfolio to support small  business, sub-Saharan Africa, and renewable energy. The risk profile of  transactions supporting the three mandates differs from the bank\u2019s overall  risk profile, but Ex-Im has not routinely documented the risk effect of  these mandates for its own management or for Congress. Reporting such  information would be consistent with OMB and federal banking regulator  guidance as well as federal internal control standards.", "In addition, the Reauthorization Act and appropriations language reflect  important national priorities and congressional interest in supporting small  businesses and promoting renewable energy. However, because these  requirements are linked directly to the bank\u2019s total authorizations, the  targets are volatile\u2014subject to fluctuation caused by changes in overall  demand for export financing. Recently, the bank\u2019s growth has created  growing targets that could lead the bank to devote an increasing portion  of its limited staff and resources to activities that are particularly time- and  resource-intensive, such as small business authorizations, or set goals  that may not be achievable in the current market, such as providing a set  amount of renewable energy financing that is higher than the demand.  OMB criteria indicate that agency targets should be ambitious, yet  realistic, and reflect careful analysis, factors affecting outcomes, and  agency capacity and priorities. It is important to communicate the effect of  these mandated targets on Ex-Im operations to external stakeholders,  such as Congress, and the potential impacts percentage-based targets  may have on the agency\u2019s resources and ability to achieve its goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide Congress with the appropriate information necessary to make  decisions on Ex-Im\u2019s exposure limits and targets, we recommend that the  Chairman of the Export-Import Bank of the United States take the  following four actions:  To improve the accuracy of its forecasts of exposure and authorizations,  Ex-Im should  compare previous forecasts and key assumptions to actual results  and adjust its forecast models to incorporate previous experience; and assess the sensitivity of the exposure forecast model to key  assumptions and authorization estimates and identify and report the  range of forecasts based on this analysis.", "To help Congress and Ex-Im management understand the performance  and risk associated with its subportfolios of transactions supporting the  small business, sub-Saharan Africa, and renewable energy mandates,  Ex-Im should routinely report financial performance information, including  the default rate and risk rating, of these transactions at the subportfolio  level.", "To better inform Congress of the issues associated with meeting each of  the bank\u2019s percentage-based mandated targets, Ex-Im should provide  Congress with additional information on the resources associated with  meeting the mandated targets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to Ex-Im for comment. Ex-Im concurred  with all of our recommendations, and stated that it would incorporate our  recommendations into preparation of subsequent reports for Congress.  Ex-Im further clarified that it would never exceed the exposure limit set by  Congress. Ex-Im stated that it monitors exposure on a monthly basis and  if necessary on a daily basis and would put in place the necessary  processes and procedures to prevent exceeding the limit. We did not  intend to imply that Ex-Im would exceed its limit, but rather that not  accounting for forecast uncertainty could lead to Ex-Im having to take  such steps to avoid exceeding the limit. We slightly modified the language  in the summary of our key findings to clarify this point.", "We are sending copies of this report to appropriate congressional  committees and the Chairman of the U.S. Export-Import Bank.

For all objectives, we  reviewed and analyzed Ex-Im\u2019s response in the Business Plan.", "To assess the extent to which Ex-Im\u2019s Business Plan and analyses justify  exposure limits, we reviewed the spreadsheet model Ex-Im used to  forecast exposure, and the source data on authorizations and repayments  Ex-Im entered into the model. We met initially with Ex-Im staff who  prepared the spreadsheet model to review the Ex-Im spreadsheet to  understand its structure and formulas. We then received a copy of the  model and reviewed it independently. Following our independent review,  we met a second time to discuss more detailed questions about the  structure, data, and assumptions contained in the model. To assess the  reliability of the exposure model, we compared its August 2012  projections of what exposure would be at the end of September 2012 with  the actual results in Ex-Im\u2019s annual report. To understand the  development of the source data on authorizations used in the model, we  met individually with Ex-Im officials from its various business units who  prepared the estimates. To assess Ex-Im\u2019s methods and data in follow-up  to these meetings, we requested and reviewed additional written detail on  the methodology used for the authorization estimates and source data for  individual estimates of long-term authorizations. We reviewed these  source data to determine the forecast timing and average size of the  estimates, and checked the forecast authorization size against the actual  authorization size for authorizations that occurred through March 2013.  To assess the performance of Ex-Im\u2019s authorization forecast procedures,  we compared previous years\u2019 projections with actual results. We  additionally reviewed Ex-Im\u2019s revised authorization estimates, compared  the original and revised estimates, and assessed the effect of the revised  estimates on Ex-Im\u2019s exposure projection by inputting the revised  authorization estimates into Ex-Im\u2019s spreadsheet model. To assess Ex- Im\u2019s forecast of repayments, we compared the assumption Ex-Im used in  the spreadsheet to previous data on the short-term percentage of the Ex- Im portfolio. We then calculated Ex-Im\u2019s exposure under alternative  scenarios based on these previous actual percentages and alternative  assumptions about repayment terms. Finally, we assessed the  procedures and assumptions Ex-Im used in its Business Plan forecast of  exposure against GAO criteria for developing estimates.", "To assess the extent to which Ex-Im\u2019s Business Plan and analyses  evaluate the risk of loss associated with Ex-Im\u2019s increased exposure limit,  the changing composition of exposure, and compliance with  congressional mandates, we reviewed agency data and documentation\u2014 including Ex-Im\u2019s financial performance data, annual reports, and  quarterly default rate reports. We also reviewed relevant GAO and Ex-Im  Inspector General reports and interviewed Ex-Im officials responsible for  risk evaluation. To further examine Ex-Im\u2019s risk of loss evaluation in the  Business Plan, we examined weighted-average risk ratings from fiscal  years 2008 to 2012 that Ex-Im compiled at our request for subportfolios  supporting congressional small business, sub-Saharan Africa, and  renewable energy mandates. We compared these subportfolio risk ratings  to Ex-Im\u2019s overall portfolio risk ratings for 2008 and 2012. In addition, we  examined default rate data compiled at our request by Ex-Im for these  subportfolios and calculated fiscal year-end default rates for Ex-Im\u2019s  subportfolios for 2008 and 2012. We compared these default rate data to  Ex-Im\u2019s overall portfolio default rate for 2008 and 2012. To assess the  reliability of these data, we reviewed and checked them against previous  Ex-Im reporting. Additionally, we consulted the data review prepared for  another recent GAO report on Ex-Im. We found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of providing context for the financial performance  of overall portfolio and subportfolios in each fiscal year. To evaluate Ex- Im\u2019s risk management, we compared its risk management and analysis  practices against federal banking regulator guidance on financial  performance reporting, Office of Management and Budget guidance on  federal credit programs, and our standards for internal control.", "To assess the extent to which Ex-Im\u2019s Business Plan and analyses  analyze the adequacy of Ex-Im resources to manage authorizations and  comply with congressional mandates under the proposed exposure limits,  we reviewed Ex-Im responses to previous GAO and Inspector General  audit reports.
