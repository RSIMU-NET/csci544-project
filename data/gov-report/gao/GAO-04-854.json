As requested, GAO assessed DOD's planning in its use of logistics support contracts in contingency operations; determined whether DOD has had contract oversight processes that are adequate to ensure that quality services were provided in an economical and efficient manner; and assessed the extent to which DOD provided trained personnel qualified to oversee its contractors. GAO focused its efforts on four logistics support contracts chosen because of their size and chosen to represent more than one military service--the Army's Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) and Balkans Support Contract, the Navy's Construction Capabilities Augmentation Program, and the Air Force's Contract Augmentation Program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The effectiveness of DOD's planning to use the logistics support contracts during contingency operations varies widely between the commands that use them and the contracts themselves. In many cases, planning was done effectively, in close coordination with the respective contractors. For LOGCAP, however, the Army Central Command did not develop plans to use the contract to support its military forces in Iraq until May 2003, even though Army's LOGCAP guidance calls for early planning and early involvement of the contractor. Those plans, moreover, have undergone numerous changes since that initial planning. In Kuwait, as well, the Army has made frequent changes in its use of LOGCAP. DOD's contract oversight processes were generally good, although there is room for improvement. DOD customers have not always ensured that contractors provide services in an economic and efficient manner, although they have a responsibility to do so. We have found that when the customer reviews the contractor's work for economy and efficiency, savings are realized. Under the LOGCAP contract, months-long delays in definitizing contract task orders have frequently undermined the contractor's cost-control incentives, and the absence of an Army award fee board to comprehensively evaluate the contractor's performance has further limited DOD's oversight. DOD did not have sufficient numbers of trained personnel in place to provide effective oversight of its logistics support contractors. The Army has deployed units responsible for supporting the LOGCAP contract, but some of the personnel have little knowledge of the contract. The Air Force did not consistently train evaluators to monitor its logistics support contractor's performance. Military units across the services receiving contractor support have lacked a comprehensive understanding of their roles and responsibilities, which include establishing the work to be done by contractors and monitoring contractors' performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. military has long used contractors to provide supplies and  services to deployed U.S. forces. Since the early 1990s, much of this  support has come from logistics support contracts\u2014contracts that are  awarded prior to the beginning of contingencies and are available to  support the troops as needed. These contracts are currently being used by  the services in more than half a dozen countries, including Iraq, to provide  a wide array of support, such as food service and housing. The contract  support in Iraq is the largest effort in the history of such contracts. While  these contracts provide vital services, they are expensive. The estimated  value of the work under the current contracts we examined is $12 billion,  including $5.6 billion for work in Iraq as of May 2004. Some of the factors  that affect costs are (1) the requirements that must be met from food  service to housing, to name just a few; (2) the conditions under which the  services must be provided, such as the security situation in Iraq; and   (3) the adequacy of government oversight.", "You asked us to (1) assess the effectiveness of the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) planning for the use of logistics support contracts in  contingency operations; (2) assess the adequacy of DOD\u2019s contract  oversight processes; (3) determine if the contracts are being used in an  economical, efficient, and cost-conscience manner; and (4) assess the  extent to which DOD had qualified personnel in place with the training  and skills necessary to provide effective contract oversight. As discussed  with your offices, we focused our efforts on four contracts: (1) the Army  Logistics Civil Augmentation Program (LOGCAP) Contract; (2) the Air  Force Contract Augmentation Program (AFCAP) Contract; (3) the U.S.  Army, Europe, Balkans Support Contract (BSC); and (4) the Navy  Construction Capabilities (CONCAP) Contract. The Army\u2019s LOGCAP  contract is by far the largest of these contracts. The contractors for these  contracts and the military services have, for the most part, worked  together to meet the customers\u2019 needs in sometimes hazardous or difficult  circumstances.", "In conducting our work, we examined a wide range of contract documents  and contracting guidance and met with contracting officers; contract  customers; and the contractors to gain a comprehensive understanding of  the contracts, the contract management process, and issues related to  using the contracts. We visited U.S. military sites using the LOGCAP,  CONCAP, and AFCAP contracts, including sites in Kuwait and Qatar, but  did not visit sites in Iraq. However, to obtain information about the use of  LOGCAP in Iraq, we interviewed personnel who were responsible for  contract management in Iraq, reviewed Defense Contract Management  Agency (DCMA) situation reports written by contracting officers in Iraq,  and met with representatives of the 101st Airborne Division shortly after  their return from Iraq to discuss their experiences with the LOGCAP  contract. In addition, because we visited the Balkans during our previous  reviews of the Balkans Support Contract, we did not visit the Balkans  during this review but did meet with Army personnel in Germany  administering the contract. We determined that the information and data  discussed in this report were reliable for the purpose of the report. We  conducted our review from August 2003 through June 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Since the early 1990s, DOD has used logistics support contracts to  meet many of its logistical support needs during combat operations,  peacekeeping missions, and humanitarian assistance missions, ranging  from Somalia and Haiti to Afghanistan and Iraq. Today these contracts  support contingency operations such as Operation Enduring Freedom and  Operation Iraqi Freedom as a major part of America\u2019s Global War on  Terrorism. Figure 1 shows locations where contractors are being used to  support deployed forces.", "Contracts such as AFCAP, LOGCAP, and BSC provide similar logistics and  engineering services, such as food preparation, laundry, housing, and  construction in support of contingency operations. The Navy\u2019s CONCAP  contract is a contingency construction contract designed to meet  emergency requirements involving natural disaster recovery, humanitarian  assistance, or conflicts.", "All of the contracts included in our review are cost-plus award fee  contracts. Cost-plus contracts allow the contractor to be reimbursed for  reasonable, allowable, and allocable costs incurred to the extent  prescribed in the contract. A cost-plus award fee contract provides  financial incentives on the basis of performance. These contracts allow the  government to evaluate a contractor\u2019s performance according to specified  criteria and to grant an award amount within designated parameters.  Award fees can serve as a valuable tool to help control program risk and  encourage excellence in contract performance. To reap the advantages  that cost-plus award fee contracts offer, the government must implement  an effective award fee process.", "Table 1 provides additional contract information on the logistics support  contracts we reviewed. As can be seen in table 1, LOGCAP is by far the  largest of these contracts both in terms of funds obligated and of the  estimated value of work under the contract.", "The use of LOGCAP to support U.S. troops in Iraq is the largest effort in  the history of the LOGCAP program both in number of troops supported  and in land mass. As of May 21, 2004, the estimated value of contract  services in Iraq was $5.6 billion. Figure 2 illustrates the size of Iraq. As  shown, when superimposed over a U.S. map, Iraq covers an area east to  west that is comparable to that from Washington, D.C., to central Indiana,  and from north to south comparable to Lansing, Michigan, to Raleigh,  North Carolina.", "WASHINGTON, D.C.", "The contractors and the services have, for the most part, worked together  to meet the customers\u2019 needs in sometimes hazardous or difficult  circumstances. For example, the AFCAP contractor is providing air traffic  management at air bases throughout central Asia, reducing the operations  tempo of selected and scarce Air Force assets. In addition, AFCAP is  providing housing and base support in Iraq. Through CONCAP the Navy  has constructed detainee facilities (including a maximum security prison)  at Guantanamo Bay on time and within budget. CONCAP\u2019s projects at  Guantanamo have increased the safety of both the detainees and the U.S.  forces guarding them and will result in real savings in reduced personnel  tempo. For example, CONCAP has increased detainee safety with the  construction of more secure cells and guard safety by providing greater  separation between guards and detainees. LOGCAP is providing life and  logistics support for more than 166,500 soldiers and civilians under  difficult circumstances in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kuwait, and Djibouti, and  customers are generally pleased with the service the contractor is  providing. Finally, BSC continues to provide troops in Kosovo and Bosnia  with a myriad of high-quality services, and the customer works with the  contractor to identify costs savings.", "Many factors can influence the overall cost of the logistics support  contracts. As shown in figure 3, costs can be affected by the size and scope  of requirements identified by customers and by the amount of time the  customer gives the contractor to plan and execute the mission.  Additionally, cost is influenced by the manner in which a unit chooses to  fulfill a requirement. Other resources that are more cost-effective may be  available to the units, such as military troop labor or host nation support.  Cost may also be affected by the quality of documentation prepared by  contract customers and program managers. Concise statements of work  and comprehensive government cost estimates may reduce the likelihood  of incurring additional costs. In addition, the appointment of government  contract management personnel to monitor contractors\u2019 performance  ensures that contractor-provided services meet contract requirements.  Lastly, operational concerns, such as the security situation in Iraq, can  make providing services more costly.", "The military services, as well as DCMA and the Defense Contract Audit  Agency, perform contract management functions to ensure that the  government is receiving quality services from the logistics support  contractors at the best possible prices. The customer is responsible for  identifying and validating requirements to be addressed by the logistics  support contracts as well as evaluating the contractor\u2019s performance and  ensuring that the contract is used in an economical and efficient manner.  The contracting officer is responsible for oversight and management of the  contract. However, the contracting officer may delegate some of the  oversight and management functions to DCMA. When management  functions are delegated by the procuring contracting officer, DCMA may  assign administrative contracting officers to provide on-site contract  administration at deployed contingency locations. The Defense Contract  Audit Agency ensures that costs claimed by the contractor are reasonable,  allowable, and allocable. Table 2 provides additional information on the  roles and responsibilities of contract management personnel.", "Work is done under each of the contracts through task orders. The task  order process begins when the customer, or the unit that is requesting  support from the contractor, identifies a requirement. The requirement is  generally documented in the form of a task order statement of work,  which establishes the specific tasks to be accomplished by the contractor  and the time frames of performance. If the decision is made to use the  logistics support contract to satisfy the requirement, the unit contacts the  contract program management office. The program management office, in  coordination with the contracting officer, determines whether the task is  within the scope of the contract. The program management office obtains  an approximate cost estimate from the contractor and provides the  customer with the information. From this information, the customer  decides if it will use the contractor to fulfill the requirement. If the  government decides to use a logistical support contract, funding is  obtained, the statement of work is finalized, and the contracting officer  issues the contractor a notice to begin work. Significantly, if the customer  identifies a change in the requirement, the process is initiated again.  Figure 4 provides an illustration of the key steps in the task order process.", "We have issued reports on the use of contractors to support deployed  forces in 1997, 2000, and 2003. In 1997 we reported that there were  opportunities to make the use of LOGCAP in Bosnia more efficient and  effective, including developing doctrine and guidance, providing  commanders with training, and providing commands with assistance when  they are using LOGCAP. In 2000 we reported that the Army should  improve its management of BSC, the successor contract to LOGCAP in the  Balkans, including examining the level and frequency of services and  providing a more extensive predeployment training program for all  contract oversight personnel. In 2003 we reported that commanders had  limited visibility and understanding of the extent and type of services  being provided by contractors and those commanders and other personnel  lacked training on their roles and responsibilities in dealing with  contractors.

However, while the  Army has developed guidance to facilitate the use of LOGCAP that clearly  recommends working with the contractor to develop comprehensive  support plans and statements of work in the early stages of contingency  planning, that guidance was not always followed. For example, the Army  Central Command did not follow that guidance when planning for  Operation Iraqi Freedom. Even as it became clear that U.S. forces would  remain in Iraq longer than originally anticipated, LOGCAP planning  continued to be mixed, partly because the Army often did not include the  contractor in its planning and planning did not always take advantage of  lead-time when it was available. However, U.S. Army, Europe, in planning  for the anticipated movement of troops through Turkey into Iraq in  support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and the Marine Corps, in planning for  the deployment of forces to Haiti, followed LOGCAP guidance, which  proved beneficial.

According to the guidance, after  the customer identifies a requirement, the customer and the contractor  work together to develop the statement of work. After the statement of  work is agreed to, the contractor prepares an execution plan that  describes how the contractor intends to meet the requirement.

According to Army Field Manual 3-100.21\u2014\u201dContractors on the  Battlefield\u201d \u2014 integrated planning is a governing principle of contractor  support, and for contractor support to be effective and responsive, its use  must be considered and integrated into the planning process. Proper  planning identifies the full extent of contractor involvement, how and  where contractor support is provided, and any responsibilities the Army  may have in supporting the contractor. This same emphasis on planning  and the early identification of requirements is also discussed in Army  Regulation 700-137\u2014\u201dLogistics Civil Augmentation Program\u201d\u2014which  establishes the policies, responsibilities, and procedures for implementing  LOGCAP. That regulation states that contractor responsiveness similar to  that offered by military units can be achieved only through the careful  drafting of contract requirements (statements of work), and that to  increase proper planning and execution, the contractor should have a  clear understanding of the statement of work. The regulation also urges  commanders not to classify plans at a level where the contractor cannot  have access and, if classification is necessary, commanders should write  unclassified contract statements of work and put time frames, geographic  areas, and other classified material in appendixes. An Army regulation on  contractors accompanying the force similarly states that the most  important factor in ensuring that support services are provided at the  desired levels of quality and timeliness is the establishment of clear and  concise contract requirements in a statement of work,  and Army Materiel  Command Pamphlet 700-30\u2014Logistics Civil Augmentation Program \u2014 designed to help users obtain support through the LOGCAP process  reiterates the point that a major consideration for maximizing LOGCAP  potential is for the customer to be aware of its LOGCAP support  requirements and convey those requirements in a timely manner to the  appropriate personnel. This pamphlet also recommends the early  involvement of the contractor in planning because it allows the contractor  to develop more accurate cost estimates, gives the contractor time to bring  on board reliable subcontractors, and can minimize costs. The guidance  also recommends that the customer and the contractor develop a  comprehensive statement of work in the early stages of contingency  planning.", "Early decisions on how the contract is to be used facilitate a number of  other actions that lead to enhanced contract management and oversight.  Once government and contractor planners are notified of a customer\u2019s  requirements, they can begin developing statements of work. According to  the Army\u2019s LOGCAP guidance, statements of work specify the products  and services required and are the most important documents provided to  the contractor. The contractor uses statements of work to (1) plan how to  satisfy the customer\u2019s requirements in the most efficient and economical  manner and (2) develop cost estimates. These estimates are provided to  the customer and serve as an important decision tool for assessing  contractors\u2019 proposals and deciding between alternative support  strategies. At the same time, representatives from the LOGCAP program  management office use the statements of work to develop independent  government cost estimates. An independent government cost estimate is  the government\u2019s estimate of the costs the contractor is expected to incur  in performing the work.

In October 2002 the command brought  contractor personnel to its headquarters in Europe to help plan and  develop the statement of work.

The planner stated that Army  Central Command raised the security classification for the plan above the  clearance level of the planners and it took some time to resolve this issue.  Thus, during a critical planning period, the planning personnel with the  most experience in using the contract were not part of the planning  process.

While DCMA\u2019s contract oversight generally resulted in cost  savings, opportunities exist to improve oversight. For example, DCMA did  not perform some of its delegated contract administration tasks under  AFCAP, such as ensuring that the contractor maintained appropriate  controls of government property, and the Air Force did not always appoint  contracting officers\u2019 representatives (subject matter experts) to assist with  oversight. Complicating oversight were recurring contractor problems  such as poor cost reporting; difficulties with producing and meeting  schedules; and inadequate controls over purchasing, which made the  LOGCAP contract more difficult to administer. In addition, better  government oversight might have avoided a billing disagreement between  the government and the LOGCAP contractor involving millions of dollars  in food service bills. Moreover, while the AFCAP and BSC task orders  have been definitized within the time allowed by the Defense Federal  Acquisition Regulation Supplement, most of the LOGCAP task orders have  not.

From December 2002 through February  2004, the Army Audit Agency reviewed the Army\u2019s use of LOGCAP in  Turkey, Uzbekistan, and Afghanistan and found that the contract was  being effectively managed.

In Turkey, the Army Audit Agency  reported that appropriate actions to control costs and ensure effective  stewardship of resources were in place; in Uzbekistan, it reported that key  management controls had been identified, were in place, and were  working; and in Afghanistan, the audit agency reported that adequate  procedures were in place to control costs but that the government could  improve the management of government-furnished equipment provided to  the contractor.", "The Army Audit Agency\u2019s conclusions are similar to our observations of  DCMA\u2019s activities in Kuwait, where DCMA\u2019s oversight is resulting in  contract improvements and cost savings. For example, at one location we  visited in Kuwait that included the use of LOGCAP for helicopter airfield  operations, the DCMA administrative contracting officer had an aviation  background and observed that the contract called for more aviation  refueling points than necessary and that the number of sweepers available  for cleaning the runways and parking ramps was excessive. He was able to  reduce the number of refueling points by half, saving the Army money, and  the number of sweepers from five to three. In addition, after conducting a  lease/buy analysis, the administrative contracting officer directed the  contractor to buy the sweepers instead of leasing them because buying  saved the government money. Situation reports filed periodically by  DCMA administrative contracting officers also detail a concerted effort to  reduce contract costs by conducting lease or buy analyses for nontactical  vehicles and generators, critiquing the contractor\u2019s proposed cost  estimates, and monitoring the disposition of government property.

In addition, DCMA\u2019s contracting officers in  southwest Asia did not have a system in place to document what the  contractor was procuring in support of AFCAP task orders and what was  being turned over to the Air Force.

As a result, DCMA believes  that neither it nor the contractor are responsible for the accountability of  the property. However, at the time of our visit to the theater in December  2003, and in subsequent conversations with DCMA contracting officers, we  observed and were told that at that time DCMA was responsible for  property administration but did not have a system in place to document  the property that was purchased under these task orders and that DCMA  contracting officers should have been performing this responsibility.  Notwithstanding the additional guidance that has since been provided by  the AFCAP contracting officer, DCMA was delegated the property  administration responsibility and either should have documented all  property purchased for the Air Force engineering squadrons or sought  clarifying guidance earlier from the AFCAP contracting officer.

Effective oversight of this diverse body of work requires personnel with  knowledge and expertise in these particular areas. DCMA administrative  contracting officers are contracting professionals but may have limited  knowledge of field operations. In these situations, DCMA normally uses  contracting officers\u2019 technical representatives.

Some of the problems  mentioned in these reports follow:    Adequate cost reporting and cost management are important because they  affect the government\u2019s ability to monitor contract spending. Several  administrative contracting officers believe that the contractor\u2019s cost  reports are inadequate and make it difficult to know how much the  contractor has actually spent on the individual task orders. For example,  in the November 13, 2003, report for Iraq, the administrative contracting  officer reported that the contractor was refusing to perform work because  of its contention that no funding remained available, while the cost report  for the previous reporting period showed that the contractor had  expended only 45 percent of the available funds.

Inadequate controls over purchasing and subcontractors hinder  government oversight. Several administrative contracting officers have  noted that the contractor had inadequate controls over its purchasing  system. For example, administrative contracting officers have observed  that requisitions    are not always provided to the administrative contracting officers as  required by the contract,  frequently lack sufficient documentation to justify the lease or  purchase, and    do not provide an accurate estimate of the cost of the item.", "Also, administrative contracting officers have noted that they are unable to  gain accurate status about materiel being purchased through the  contractor, which increases customers\u2019 frustration.

While  contract oversight is the responsibility of the contracting officer, as  indicated in the OMB circular, all managers have a responsibility to ensure  that agency programs operate in an economical and efficient manner and  that costs are controlled. Efforts to control costs vary widely both across  and within logistics support contracts. The Army and the Army Central  Command did not make the need to control LOGCAP spending for  activities in Iraq and Kuwait a high priority until late 2003.

The Army Central  Command, the Army command responsible for paying for LOGCAP, had  no spending limits for LOGCAP until spring 2004, when a $6.5 billion limit  was placed on the amount that could be spent in fiscal year 2004 on the  basis of the estimated cost of required work. The spending limit followed a  December 2003 message from the Army Vice Chief of Staff that asked units  to control costs and look for alternatives to the LOGCAP contract and the  realization that LOGCAP costs were growing rapidly. According to a study  commissioned by the Army Budget Office, from September 2003 through  January 2004, projected LOGCAP costs for services in Kuwait, Iraq, and  Afghanistan grew from $5.8 billion to $8.6 billion. In late 2003, the Army  Central Command requested that \u201cTeam LOGCAP\u201d review the cost  estimates for the task orders being used in Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan  to determine if the cost estimates could be reduced. According to the  Army Budget Office, this review reduced the estimated cost of using  LOGCAP in the Army Central Command\u2019s area of responsibility from   $8.6 billion to $6.5 billion, although most of the reduction came from the  use of more accurate cost data rather than a reduction in requirements or  more economical approaches. According to the Army Central Command,  commanders in the area of operations have established additional review  procedures. For example, all requests for services greater than $50,000  must be approved by a general officer before the requests can be  considered for approval by the local acquisition review board.

At the initiation of each task  order, AFCAP contract administrators negotiated costs proposed by the  contractor in order to receive advantageous pricing for the government.  Additionally, the government\u2019s review of proposed costs allows it to better  define its requirements for the contractor. We reviewed several examples  of the memoranda detailing these negotiations and found that the  government developed cost estimates that were significantly less than the  contractor\u2019s original proposal. For example, the government achieved  reductions that ranged from 6 percent to 97 percent on the basis of the  review and substantiation of the contractor\u2019s cost proposals.

The auditors estimated that reducing  bus service would result in a savings of more than $700,000 during the  remaining 3 years of BSC.  In September 2001Army auditors recommended that the Army provide the  contractor with gravel and sand as government-furnished equipment partly  because the contractor was maintaining excessive inventories of these  materials.

We reviewed the guidance prepared by the Chairman, Joint  Chiefs of Staff; the Army\u2019s regulations and guidance related to planning for  contractor support to deployed forces; and an array of additional guidance  specific to each of the logistics support contracts as follows:  the Army Materiel Command\u2019s LOGCAP battle book,    U.S. Army, Europe, Users\u2019 Guide to the Balkans Support Contract and  operating procedures written by the Balkans Support Contract  procurement contracting office on task order development,  the Air Force\u2019s guide for using the Air Force\u2019s AFCAP contract\u2014the  AFCAP Concept of Operations, and  the Navy\u2019s CONCAP Users\u2019 Guide.", "We met with representatives of the Army Materiel Command\u2019s LOGCAP  program management office to discuss LOGCAP planning and met with  the Army Materiel Command\u2019s LOGCAP planners for Europe and  southwest Asia to determine their roles in planning to use LOGCAP to  support Operation Iraqi Freedom. Additionally, we met with  representatives of U.S. Army, Europe, to discuss planning for both BSC  and the command\u2019s use of the LOGCAP contract and with representatives  of the Army Central Command to discuss their role in planning for  Operation Iraqi Freedom. We also met with the contracting officers for  both the Balkans Support Contract and the LOGCAP contract to obtain  their perspective on planning. To gain a comprehensive understanding of  AFCAP and CONCAP planning, we met with the program managers for  both the AFCAP and CONCAP contracts as well as the procuring  contracting officers for both contracts. We also talked to customers of the  four contracts to gain a better understanding of the customer\u2019s role in  planning and the customer\u2019s views of the planning process. Finally, we  spoke with representatives of Kellogg, Brown, and Root\u2014the CONCAP,  LOGCAP, and BSC contractor\u2014and Readiness Management Support, the  AFCAP contractor, to obtain their views on the planning process.", "To determine the adequacy of the contract oversight process, we  undertook a number of actions. We reviewed a wide array of documents,  including  the Department of Defense\u2019s and the Army\u2019s policies, regulations, and  instructions that relate to the use of contractors to support deployed  forces;    documents specific to the AFCAP, CONCAP, LOGCAP, and Balkans    audit reports prepared by DOD agencies on these contracts, including the  Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Air Force Audit Agency, the Army  Audit Agency, and the Army Materiel Command Inspector General, and we  met with representatives of these organizations as well to discuss their  findings; and  the Defense Contract Management Agency\u2019s (DCMA) situation reports for  September 2003 through May 2004 for Iraq, Kuwait, Afghanistan, and  Djibouti to get a better understanding of the types of oversight actions that  administrative contracting officers and quality assurance representatives  were taking.", "During our visits to Kuwait and Qatar, we met with DCMA representatives  to discuss oversight issues and observe some of their oversight practices  and procedures. In Germany we met with the DCMA administrative  contracting officers assigned to monitor BSC. To gain further insight into  LOGCAP oversight in Iraq, we interviewed one of the senior DCMA  administrative contracting officers responsible for overseeing the  LOGCAP contract in Iraq after he redeployed. We also met the DCMA  representatives located at the headquarters of the Halliburton Company  (the parent company of Kellogg, Brown and Root) to gain a better  understanding of the role of the corporate administrative contracting  officer. We met with officials at all levels of command to gain an  understanding of what they believed their roles were in the oversight  process, and we met with contractor representatives to discuss contract  oversight and contract management from their perspective. We also did  the following:    To understand the definitization process, we reviewed relevant portions of  the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, interviewed  those government-contracting officials responsible for the definitization  process, and reviewed negotiation memoranda documenting the results of  definitization negotiations. We also discussed the definitization process  with representatives of the contractors. To understand the award fee  process and the requirements for an effective award fee board, we  reviewed the Army Audit Agency\u2019s Report on Award Fee best practices  and reviewed the award fee plans for the CONCAP, AFCAP, and Balkans  Support Contract and a draft of the award fee plan for the LOGCAP  contract. We reviewed documentation prepared for award fee boards to  understand the types of contractor performance evaluations that  customers and oversight officials provided. We also attended award fee  boards for CONCAP, AFCAP, and BSC. At the time we completed our  review, the LOGCAP contracting office had not yet held an award fee  board.", "To determine if lessons learned were being collected, we reviewed the  Center for Army Lessons Learned database and the U.S. Army, Europe,  Lessons Learned database to determine if they contained any lessons  learned related to the use of BSC or the LOGCAP contract. In addition, we  reviewed the Coalition Forces Land Component Command\u2019s lessons  learned database for any relevant LOGCAP lessons learned. We met with  contract customers to determine how they documented lessons they might  have learned and to ascertain if lessons learned were shared between  contract users. We also met with officials from DCMA and the contractors  to discuss their lessons learned programs.", "To determine if the logistics support contracts were being used in an  economic, efficient, and cost-conscious manner, we reviewed previous  audits by DOD organizations and command-level audit agencies, such as  the U.S. Army, Europe\u2019s, Office of Internal Review and Audit Compliance.  We met with representatives of the Army Central Command to determine  if they had issued any guidance to the LOGCAP customers on the need to  be cost conscious, and we obtained and reviewed guidance issued by  CJTF-7 and CJTF-180 to determine if they had (1) established the need to  be cost conscious as a priority and (2) established procedures for  reviewing and approving requirements and reevaluating recurring services.  We also met with representatives of Marine Forces Central Command and  U.S. Army, Europe, to get a better understanding of their review processes  for LOGCAP and BSC, respectively. In addition, we met with Navy officials  to determine how they control costs and ensure that the contractor  provides service in an economical and efficient manner and with CONCAP  customers at Guantanamo Bay to determine their involvement with cost  control. Similarly, we met with Program Management and Contracting  Office officials for the AFCAP contract to determine what steps they take  to ensure that the contract is used in an economic and efficient manner  and met with AFCAP customers at Al Udeid Air Base, Qatar, and discussed  cost control. We also reviewed DCMA situation reports to determine if  DCMA officials at deployed locations had any insight into improving cost  control and economy and efficiency.", "To assess the extent to which DOD had a sufficient number of qualified  personnel with the training and skills necessary to provide effective  contract oversight and management in place, we determined the numbers  of DCMA, Defense Contract Audit Agency, and Army Materiel Command  personnel that were deployed in support of AFCAP, LOGCAP, and BSC.  Since we could find no guidelines on the appropriate number of oversight  personnel, we spoke with DCMA officials who oversaw the LOGCAP and  AFCAP contracts to determine if they believed that the number of DCMA  personnel deployed was adequate. We also reviewed DCMA situation  reports to determine if DCMA staffing affected contract oversight. We  interviewed Navy and Air Force officials responsible for overseeing the  CONCAP and AFCAP contracts to determine if sufficient oversight  personnel were available. To determine if the personnel with contract  responsibilities, including customers, had sufficient training to  satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities, we met with personnel at all  levels to discuss the training they had received regarding the use of  logistics support contracts and their understanding of their specific roles  and responsibilities. We also asked them to assess the adequacy of the  training they received. We met with members of the program management  offices to determine if they believed that personnel such as quality  assurance representatives, contracting officers\u2019 representatives, and  contracting officers\u2019 technical representatives had been adequately  trained.", "We visited the following locations during our review:  Office of the Secretary of Defense:  Inspector General Office, Arlington, Va.", "Defense Contract Management Agency, Alexandria, Va.

In addition, although  we did not travel to Iraq, we spoke with a senior DCMA Administrative  Contracting Officer who was recently based in Iraq and obtained situation  reports, which document observations regarding contractor performance.  We also met with representatives of the 101st Airborne Division, who had  been customers of LOGCAP services in Iraq, upon their return to the  United States, and talked to contractor officials working in Iraq. We relied  on data provided us by DOD and the contractor, which we verified where  possible. For example, in assessing billing for dining facilities, we verified  the contractor\u2019s summary data by tracing the summary numbers to the raw  data.

Readiness Management Support expressed concern that the draft  report characterized the use of logistics support contracts as the most  expensive solution for the government. The company stated that, in  the case of its power production contracts, the Air Combat Command  determined it to be less expensive than using military in the  command\u2019s current method while acknowledging that there are  occasions when the contractor does cost more than military execution,  but that, in many of those cases, the contractor is the only solution. We  state in the report that both Air Force and Navy officials believe that  using the AFCAP and CONCAP contracts to fulfill a requirement is  often the most expensive option available and consequently they have  taken steps to control costs. We recognize that this may not always be  the case. However, we are not aware of any comprehensive analysis  comparing the cost of using logistics support contracts to provide  logistics support with the cost of using military personnel to provide  that support. Regarding AFCAP, we were told by Air Force contract  customers that the use of the AFCAP contract was a \u201clevel of  magnitude\u201d more expensive than other alternatives because of the  premiums associated with the manpower the contractor can access  and the speed in which the contractor can provide services.  2.  Readiness Management Support stated that it did not control certain  property acquired under the AFCAP contract but noted that in each  instance the property was properly purchased, documented, and  turned over to the Air Force. In reviewing the government\u2019s role in  property administration under the contract, we stated that DCMA did  not ensure that the contractor maintained appropriate controls of  government property. For task orders performed in southwest and  central Asia, the AFCAP contract administrator delegated the property  administration responsibility to DCMA. From our observations and  conversations with DCMA contract administrators in southwest Asia in  late 2003, we found that DCMA did not have a system in place to  document what was purchased under the contract and what was  turned over to the Air Force, although it was delegated this  responsibility. As a result, at the time of our audit work, neither DCMA  nor the Air Force could account for approximately $2 million worth of  tools and equipment purchased under the AFCAP contract.  3.  Readiness Management Support described our report as stating that  using civil augmentation contracts are not an effective method to  procure equipment and materials and stated that it believed our  research to be incomplete. Our report discusses how circumstances  did not always allow the Army and the Air Force to select a more  economical and efficient method to obtain services. In the case of  AFCAP, we discussed how Air Force engineering squadrons used the  AFCAP contract to buy commodities because they did not deploy with  enough contracting and finance personnel to buy materials quickly or  in large quantities and that the U.S. Agency for International  Development also used the contract to provide disaster relief and  humanitarian assistance supplies. We reported that the AFCAP  contractor received more than $2 million in award fees since February  2002 for these commodity supply task orders. To calculate this  amount, we reviewed data on the amount of award fees that the  contractor received for commodity supply task orders from February  2002 through February 2004. To ensure that we captured only those  task orders in which the contractor purchased commodities, we  provided the AFCAP contract administrator with our analysis of the  task orders to , and he concurred with our analysis. We stated in the  report that Air Force program managers recognized that the use of a  cost plus award fee contract to buy commodities may not be cost- effective and are considering alternative types of contract options for  these task orders for the next AFCAP contract.  4.
