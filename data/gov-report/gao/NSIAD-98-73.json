To help ensure interoperability, the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA)\u2014under the direction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\u2014established the current certification process in 1992. According to Joint Staff guidance, commanders in chief, the four services, and Department of Defense (DOD) agencies are required to use this process to test and certify existing and newly developed systems for interoperability. Generally, newly developed systems are to be denied production approval if they have not been certified. After a system has been fielded and a modification is made that affects interoperability, the system must be recertified.", "In response to your request, we determined (1) whether DOD organizations are complying with interoperability testing and certification requirements and (2) what actions, if any, are needed to improve the current certification process.

For example, the success of the Persian Gulf war in 1991\u2014a major joint military operation\u2014was hampered by a lack of basic interoperability. The current certification requirement was established to help address these problems. The Joint Staff\u2019s Director for C4 systems (J-6) is assigned primary responsibility for ensuring compliance with the certification requirement. DISA\u2019s Joint Interoperability Test Command is the sole certifier of C4I systems. According to Joint Staff guidance, commanders in chief, the services, and DOD agencies are required to adequately budget for certification testing. They can either administer their own tests with Test Command oversight or ask the Test Command to administer them. Certification is intended to help provide the warfighter with C4I systems that are interoperable and to enable forces to exchange information effectively during a joint mission. Specifically, certification by the Test Command is confirmation that (1) a C4I system has undergone appropriate testing, (2) the applicable requirements for interoperability have been met, and (3) the system is ready for joint use. However, while a system may pass certification testing, it may not have been tested against all systems with which it may eventually interoperate. This is because some systems with which they must interoperate become available later and commanders sometimes use systems in new ways that were not envisioned during testing.", "DOD guidance requires that a system be tested and certified before approval to produce and field it. Depending on the acquisition category and dollar threshold of the program, the approval authority may be the Under Secretary of Defense (Acquisition and Technology), with advice from the Defense Acquisition Board; the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence), with advice from the Major Automated Information System Review Council; or the DOD component head (such as the commander in chief of a unified combatant command, the head of a military service, or a DOD agency head).", "A DOD Directive established the Military Communications Electronics Board to provide guidance on interoperability issues referred to it by the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The Board addresses interoperability issues through two subpanels: (1) The Interoperability Improvement Panel monitors C4I interoperability issues surfaced by the commanders in chiefs, military services, and DOD agencies and (2) The Interoperability Test Panel resolves testing disputes (such as appeals of Test Command certification decisions made by commanders in chief, military services, and DOD agencies). The Test Panel may waive the certification requirement to support developmental efforts, demonstrations, exercises, or normal operations. The waiver is not intended to be permanent, and is typically granted for 1 year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Compliance With Certification Requirement Is Inadequate", "paragraphs": ["Commanders in chief, services, and DOD agencies are generally not complying with the certification requirement. As a result, we found instances in which existing, newly fielded, and modified systems are not certified for interoperability. Test Command analysis showed that a significant number of existing C4I systems had not been submitted for certification as required. According to Test Command officials, as of December 1997, the DOD Defense Integration Support Tool database of C4 systems listed about 1,000 systems that may exchange information with another system. In addition, there are about 1,176 unclassified intelligence systems, according to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, C3I. Test Command officials said they did not know precisely how many of these systems require certification. Nor did the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense know which intelligence systems would require certification because they were unable to determine which of these systems were outdated (i.e., legacy systems), stand alone systems, or one-service-only systems. While the Test Command has generally certified increasingly more systems during the past 4 years, officials acknowledged that \u201cthey have not even begun to scratch the surface\u201d of the universe of systems that may require testing and certification. During fiscal years 1994 through 1997, the Test Command certified 149 C4I systems.", "According to Test Command officials, DOD\u2019s Defense Integration Support Tool database attempts to list all C4 systems and other mission critical systems, but it does not contain all C4 systems or indicate whether the systems have been certified. According to DISA documentation, the purpose of the Defense Integration Support Tool is to support a DOD-wide information management requirement for data collection, reporting, and decision support in areas such as planning and interoperability. After discussions with DOD officials regarding this issue, DOD has recently included certification status as part of the database and, as of January 1998, 44 systems reflected this information.", "We recently reported in two separate reports that the Defense Integration Support Tool database is incomplete and inaccurate. In response to our October 1997 report, DOD acknowledged that this database is its official automated repository and backbone management tool for DOD\u2019s inventory of systems. Accordingly, DOD said that it had begun to take major actions to enhance the database by instituting a validation and data quality program to ensure that the database contains accurate and complete data. DOD further stated that it would closely monitor this program to ensure that the data quality is at the highest level as required for reports to senior Defense managers and the Congress. Since this database is an important management tool, it is essential that it be complete and accurate.", "In several instances, new systems have been fielded without consideration of the certification requirement. Two recently fielded Air Force systems\u2014a weather prediction system and a radar system\u2014were not tested for certification by the Test Command, despite June 1996 memorandums from the Joint Staff stating that the service must plan for testing to ensure compliance with interoperability guidelines. Further, since 1994, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence) has approved three of nine major automated information systems for production and fielding that had not been certified for interoperability. For example, the recently fielded Defense Message System was not certified by the Test Command. Test Command officials stated that the system has undergone some interoperability testing but, because of shortfalls, was not certified. A decision was made to field the system while the shortfalls are resolved. Test Command officials believe the system will eventually be certified.", "No newly developed systems purchased through the Command and Control Initiatives Program were tested by the Test Command. (This program allows commanders in chief to purchase low-cost improvements to their command and control systems.) According to DISA officials, DISA had assessed these systems\u2019 interoperability requirements and reminded the users to submit the systems for testing. In addition, during the last  3 years, no systems purchased through the Advanced Concept Technology Demonstrators program were tested and certified. (This program allows a new capability to be quickly developed, purchased, and exercised in the field before an acquisition commitment is made.)", "According to Test Command officials, previously certified systems that were later modified are not consistently submitted for recertification as required. Although Test Command officials do not know the exact number of modified systems that require recertification, they are aware of several systems\u2014such as the Navy\u2019s AEGIS shipboard weapon system and the Air Force\u2019s Airborne Warning and Control System."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Reasons for Inadequate Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Joint Staff officials believe that, although the certification requirement is outlined in several DOD and Joint Staff guidance documents, some system managers are unaware of it. In a study chartered by J-6 and completed in January 1996, only 12 of 424 (less than 3 percent) surveyed acquisition managers and Defense System Management College students knew about the DOD and Joint Staff interoperability requirements. The study team found that this lack of knowledge prevented users from placing interoperability in the initial requirements documents and acquisition managers from building interoperability into approved programs. As a result, the Joint Staff began an effort in 1996 to better educate system managers about the requirement. However, the study points out that education is not a panacea for all interoperability problems.", "Our analysis showed that some DOD organizations, although aware of the requirement, did not submit fielded systems for testing. For example, some program managers did not submit their modified systems for certification because they believed their design, although fielded, was not mature enough for testing. The program managers did not seek a waiver for their systems and ignored the certification requirement. Test Command officials told us that they lack the authority to compel program managers to bring their systems in for testing and must rely on the managers\u2019 cooperation.", "In addition, in fiscal year 1995, only three intelligence systems were certified by the Test Command. Because Test Command officials believed that DOD\u2019s intelligence community was ignoring the certification requirement, in 1996 the Command negotiated an agreement with DOD\u2019s Intelligence Information Systems Management Board (which has responsibility for a portion of intelligence systems) to facilitate better participation in the certification process. In fiscal year 1997, the number of intelligence systems tested and certified increased to 14. Test Command officials believe that the increase is a direct result of the agreement.", "Further, according to Test Command officials, DOD officials do not always budget the resources needed for interoperability testing as required by Joint Staff guidance. In certain cases, the services do not budget sufficient funds to cover secondary C4I systems that are used to test the primary C4I system for interoperability because the services cannot afford to pay for all the testing DOD policy requires. For example, the services are required to provide secondary systems for 10 tactical data link interoperability tests a year. In this case, however, according to a Test Command official, the Army budgets for only seven or eight tests a year. The services are responsible for acquiring systems that satisfy service-unique requirements, and this responsibility sometimes takes precedence over satisfying joint interoperability requirements. In his 1996 report to the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended that funding for DOD C4I systems be reviewed, since the services\u2019 funding decisions may not further DOD\u2019s overall goal of promoting C4I joint interoperability.", "Finally, the various approval authorities are allowing some new systems to be fielded without verifying their certification status. According to a Joint Staff J-6 spokesman, the Joint Staff J-6 representative is to ensure that interoperability certification is addressed at the approval authority acquisition meetings. If the Joint Staff J-6 representative is unable to attend these meetings, the issue of certification is not raised. However, J-6 coordination is obtained on all acquisition decision memorandums granting production and fielding approval. Nevertheless, systems receive approval for production and fielding even though they may not have been certified or obtained waivers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Examples of Interoperability Problems That Are Not Being Addressed", "paragraphs": ["In several instances, the Test Command identified interoperability problems in systems that DOD organizations had not submitted for testing. The following are examples: In 1996, the Test Command expressed concerns to the Air Force that its Joint Tactical Information Distribution System, a computer terminal used to provide surveillance data on F-15 aircraft, had not been certified. The system (a proof of concept demonstration) had operated for 3 years. According to a Test Command memorandum, Command representatives witnessed numerous interoperability problems caused by this system during joint exercises. The memorandum indicated that if the exercise had been a real world situation, the system\u2019s interoperability problems could have resulted in numerous deaths of pilots and enemy penetrations of  U.S. airspace. In a written response, the Air Force stated that it disagreed with the Test Command\u2019s assessment of the problems. Furthermore, the Air Force said that certification of the system was not the best use of resources because the Air Force planned to eventually replace it. According to Test Command officials, the system is scheduled for testing in 1998. Still not certified, the system has been operational for over 1 year since the Air Force\u2019s response.", "Test Command officials have been unable to persuade the Navy\u2019s AEGIS program office to submit all fielded versions of the ship\u2019s weapon system for interoperability testing. Command representatives have observed the weapon system experiencing significant interoperability problems in several recent joint exercises. The Test Command is aware of five fielded versions of AEGIS software, and the program office states there are many more. However, the Test Command has tested and certified only the oldest version (in May 1995), the most basic of the five versions. The need for interoperability certification testing of the uncertified versions has been discussed at joint interoperability meetings and with DISA. The responsible DISA official requested, under Test Command letterhead, that AEGIS submit uncertified versions for joint testing. However, according to AEGIS program officials, none of these versions has been jointly tested because the newer versions either have not yet been tested with other Navy-only systems or are not yet demonstrating adequate interoperability performance in testing with Navy-only systems.", "The Test Command has been unable to persuade users to test DOD\u2019s Air Defense System Integrator, which provides tactical data link translation and message-forwarding functions. The system has been acquired outside the normal DOD acquisition process. About 30 versions of this system have been fielded; none has been jointly tested. According to Test Command officials, the system is experiencing significant interoperability problems because it does not conform to required standards. Interoperability problems with this system could result in hostile systems leaking through U.S. defenses or friendly systems being attacked. Without certification of the interfaces that translate and forward messages among systems, for example, the proper tracking and targeting information may not be provided to our theater air missile defense system. At several 1997 meetings with representatives from all the services, the Joint Staff, and the Test Command, problems with the system were discussed. Solutions are still being developed and implemented."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses Exist in DOD\u2019s Certification Process", "paragraphs": ["Noncompliance with interoperability testing and certification stems from weaknesses in the certification process itself.

The process also does not include a mechanism to notify the services about interoperability problems identified in joint exercises, and the Test Command has only recently begun to contact the services regarding the noted problems.

Generally, the Command develops a master test schedule based on the notification of systems ready for testing by the commanders in chiefs, services, and DOD agencies. As these notifications are received, the Command updates its schedule.", "Furthermore, DOD has not identified the exact number of systems to be certified. A Command official told us that, even if systems are identified, it is difficult to test all C4I systems required to be certified. According to Test Command officials, they are able to test no more than 200 systems per year. Our analysis shows that the Command generally reviews about 100 systems per year and in 1997 certified 44 individual systems for interoperability (not including systems receiving multiple certifications due to modifications or testing with additional systems). According to the official, a list prioritizing systems for testing would assist the Command to use its scarce resources to test the most important systems first.", "In June 1996, the Military Communications Electronic Board reviewed existing command and control systems submitted by the services and determined that 42 were crucial to the needs of military commanders. Our analysis showed that, as of October 1997, 23 had not been tested or certified. According to Test Command officials, the 23 systems were not certified for various reasons. The officials stated that they did not know about 13 of the systems; 7 are scheduled or are to be scheduled for testing, but the schedules could slip; 2 were not submitted for testing by the commanders in chief, service, or DOD agency because 1 is a low priority for testing and the other needs redesign (although both have been operational for several years); and 1 was considered too immature to test. Without an approved DOD-wide testing strategy, the Test Command\u2019s scarce resources may not be best used to test the right C4I systems at the right time.", "Joint Staff, Test Command, and commander in chief officials believe that one area that should receive high priority in any plan for interoperability testing is theater air and missile defense systems. This functional area is heavily dependent on systems being interoperable. According to Test Command officials, about 100 major systems are involved in theater air and missile defense, and about 45 percent of these have not been tested or certified for interoperability. DOD officials stated that significant interoperability problems in these defense systems could have dire consequences for joint and coalition forces. Some joint exercises conducted during the last 2 years have demonstrated the need for better interoperability in this functional area.

The vast majority of these problems were caused by system-specific software problems. Specific problems experienced included failure to accept changes in mislabeled data identifying a friendly aircraft as a hostile aircraft, thereby causing the simulated downing of a commercial airliner; excess messages overloading systems, causing system crashes and the loss of command and control resources during critical periods; improper track identification, creating the potential for either a hostile system to penetrate defenses or a friendly system to be inadvertently destroyed; and duplicate tracks distorting the joint tactical picture, denying vital information to battle managers and shooters.", "In table 1, we list the 15 systems that experienced significant problems and indicate their certification status.", "When the services\u2019 program managers are not advised, significant interoperability problems may arise in subsequent exercises and operations.

The current infrastructure inhibits interoperability necessary to give commanders a unified picture of the battlespace, reduces ability to provide links between the battlefield and the support base, and limits connection to the U.S. industrial base.", "One part of the Defense Information Infrastructure plan is to establish a common operating environment that provides integrated support services and corresponding software for standard functional applications. The idea for the common operating environment originated with an observation about command and control systems. Certain functions (mapping, track management, and communication interfaces, for example) are so fundamental that they are required for virtually every command and control system. Yet, in stand-alone systems across DOD, these functions are built over and over again in incompatible ways, even when the requirements are the same or vary only sightly between systems. The common operating environment is intended to standardize the underlying computing infrastructure used to process information. It is to improve interoperability by creating architecture principles that, if adhered to, will allow for the sharing of software products and services and information across the Defense Information Infrastructure. Both the Defense Information Infrastructure plan and the common operating environment are long-term strategies that extend through the year 2010.", "Finally, DOD\u2019s 1993 Levels of Information Systems Interoperability initiative is to improve C4 and intelligence systems\u2019 interoperability. System developers are to use this tool to assess interoperability, determine capabilities needed to support system development, and determine the degree of interoperability needed between C4I and other systems. The tool has not yet been fully tested or implemented. Major testing is planned for July 1998.", "Concerns regarding the success of some of these initiatives have been expressed by various DOD organizations. Specifically, in its June 1996 report, the DOD Integration Task Force stated that compliance with the common operating environment standards will not ensure that systems will be interoperable because, in part, it does not eliminate the problems of data translation, remapping, and duplication. Further, Test Command officials and others believe the DOD Information Infrastructure and common operating environment requirements need refinement before they can ensure interoperability. For example, these officials believe that the level of compliance with the infrastructure and the common operating environment must be higher than currently required to ensure interoperability. In addition, in a December 1996 report, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff listed several challenges to achieving interoperability through DOD\u2019s initiatives, including security of the infrastructure, overall integration of the DOD organizations into a common operating environment, and the lack of a formal enforcement mechanism to ensure the services conform to the standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "National Security and International Affairs Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Los Angeles Office", "paragraphs": ["George Vindigni Yelena K.
