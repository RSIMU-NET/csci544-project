During that same period, the number of Medicaid beneficiaries increased from 22 million to 33 million. Although about three-quarters of the beneficiaries are poor children and their parents, two-thirds of the expenditures are for poor elderly, blind, and disabled individuals. Funding is a shared responsibility between the federal and state governments, with respective federal and state shares determined through a statutory matching formula. Federal law mandates coverage of certain medical services and population groups. It also includes coverage options, allowing states to choose whether to cover additional services or low-income population groups."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Not 1, but 56 Separate Medicaid Programs", "paragraphs": ["Dramatic differences in Medicaid programs across states reflect spending priorities of the states, their ability to pay, and incentives inherent in the federal matching formula. States partly determine the extent of their Medicaid program when they set eligibility requirements for receiving cash assistance (primarily Aid to Families with Dependent Children\u2014AFDC).Under federal law, AFDC recipients are automatically eligible for Medicaid. States also determine program scope by selecting which optional services or groups to include in their programs. With some discretion to modify eligibility and benefit provisions, the proportion of the poor (as defined by the federal poverty level) and near-poor served by Medicaid varies greatly by state. For example, for every 1,000 people with incomes under 150 percent of the federal poverty level, Rhode Island serves 913 beneficiaries, whereas Nevada serves 284. Nationally, in 1994 Medicaid covered medical services for 58 percent of people under age 65 living in poverty.", "State Medicaid programs also vary in the levels of benefits provided. For example, some states limit their Medicaid coverage of inpatient days (a required service) to a certain number per person. States also have the discretion to drop their coverage of optional services, such as dental or optical care. The average Medicaid benefit (that is, total medical spending divided by total beneficiaries) ranges from $2,372 in Mississippi to $7,286 in New York. (See fig. 1.1 for grouping of states by their average benefit level and table 1.1 for state-by-state data.) States with higher Medicaid benefits tend to cover a greater proportion of poor people, relative to states with lower benefits.

The average per person spending for these beneficiaries exceeded $9,200\u2014four times more than was spent on other adults ($2,292) and seven times more than was spent on other children ($1,360). The per person spending for all Medicaid beneficiaries averaged nearly $3,900; in contrast, health spending per person for the U.S. population averaged about $3,300.", "In 1993, about 35 percent of Medicaid spending was for long-term care, including nursing home care payments.

It is designed to provide a higher federal match to states with low per capita incomes. In fiscal year 1993, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Utah had the highest federal match percentages; each received more than 75 percent of its Medicaid program funding from the federal government. Alternatively for that year, the federal government paid 50 percent of Medicaid costs, the minimum match, in 12 states and the District of Columbia.", "In spite of the formula\u2019s sliding match rate, federal spending per Medicaid beneficiary tends to be highest in states with high per capita incomes. Because high-income states tend to offer relatively generous benefits, the absolute amount of federal spending per beneficiary is high, even though the match rate is only 50 percent. For example, New York\u2014a high-income state with a 50-percent match\u2014receives $3,600 per beneficiary in federal aid, while Mississippi\u2014a low-income state with approximately an 80-percent match\u2014receives $1,900 per beneficiary in federal aid.", "Reporting on this subject in 1983, 1990, and 1993, we noted that the FMAP formula could be improved to meet federal goals.

However, the formula\u2019s reliance on a state\u2019s per capita income does not adequately address these equity goals. In fiscal year 1991, for example, the District of Columbia and Nevada received the same FMAP, despite the District\u2019s greater proportion of people eligible for Medicaid. Our prior work in this area concluded that the formula could better adjust for states\u2019 different needs and varying abilities to fund benefits by considering a state\u2019s number of persons in poverty and more comprehensive measures of taxing capacity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Section 1115 Waivers Permit Major Program Changes Without Congressional Debate", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, many states have been experimenting with health financing reforms.

The mandates also extended transitional Medicaid coverage for families leaving AFDC for gainful employment, established a new categorically needy coverage group for severely impaired individuals under the age of 65, and added coverage of certain chronically ill or disabled individuals. The Kaiser Commission on the Future of Medicaid noted that between 1990 and 1992, enrollment increased by about 6 million individuals, with about one-third of this increase attributable to pregnant women and children. Since some states provided benefits when coverage of these groups was optional, the mandates tended to equalize benefits among states.", "Because both the mandates and options tied coverage to the federal poverty level, which is uniform across states, they greatly increased the number of persons receiving Medicaid who were not eligible for cash assistance.

States then returned to providers the funds collected from such taxes and donations along with part of the matching federal payments.

Under section 1115 waivers, HCFA can waive these restrictions to help states enlist HMOs to serve Medicaid beneficiaries. HCFA can waive the \u201c75-25 rule,\u201d which specifies that HMOs serving Medicaid beneficiaries must have at least 25 percent of their enrollment consist of private patients (with certain limited exceptions), a rule that\u2014in effect\u2014prohibits Medicaid-only HMOs.

Florida, Kentucky, and Ohio have waivers approved by HCFA but not by their own state legislatures. Lawmakers in these states are concerned that implementation of the waivers will increase, not decrease, state costs.

Some states have proposed ambitious coverage expansions, which, through the waivers, would be financed in part by the Medicaid program. While estimating the demonstration projects\u2019 potential impact on federal spending is difficult, the administration\u2019s approval of the waivers as budget neutral depends on a number of critical assumptions that could be subject to challenge. Furthermore, it is not clear that the administration\u2019s rationale for defining budget neutrality in the approved statewide waivers is consistent across all waivers.", "We have been evaluating the budget neutrality of approved waivers using a consistent framework that compares approved budgets with a benchmark using current services budgeting concepts. While more extensive analysis is in progress, it appears that one of the four waivers we analyzed may be budget neutral, but three others may not be if fully implemented by the states. In Tennessee, our analysis indicates that federal spending on the Medicaid demonstration program could be lower over the life of the waiver, compared with what might have been spent without the waiver. However, the demonstration programs in Hawaii, Florida, and Oregon may increase federal spending on Medicaid acute care. Because the waiver agreements only specify ceilings on federal spending, the total amount of new federal dollars that could be required by the demonstrations depends upon several factors, including future action by the states. For example, federal spending for Florida will depend, partly, upon how many of the planned maximum 1,100,000 newly eligible individuals that state will actually cover.", "The potential net spending impact associated with the four state waivers we analyzed, while it could amount to hundreds of millions of additional federal dollars, is small relative to overall federal Medicaid spending. However, the impact of the section 1115 demonstrations could increase substantially if the waivers pending or proposed by several additional states\u2014or even a few large states\u2014are not budget neutral."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Budget Neutrality Redefined", "paragraphs": ["Since the early 1980s, the administration has required that federal spending on a state\u2019s section 1115 demonstration project be budget neutral\u2014that is, federal expenditures may not exceed what would have been spent without the waiver. This budget-neutrality policy is still in force. Since 1993, however, the administration has applied the financial test in such a way as to allow states more flexibility in showing that their proposed projects would be budget neutral.", "Projecting future spending for the current program is a critical element in determining budget neutrality since this amount represents the baseline against which spending for the demonstration project is compared. The two key steps in developing projections for the current program are estimating (1) base, or initial-year, spending and (2) future annual increases. From a state\u2019s perspective, higher base costs or higher annual increases make it easier to claim budget neutrality. That is, a higher baseline makes it possible for planned spending to increase while still meeting the definition of budget neutrality. States have used one or both of the following arguments to secure access to increased federal funds while complying with the current budget-neutrality policy.", "Hypothetical Expansion Argument. Four states\u2014Hawaii, Rhode Island, Kentucky, and Ohio\u2014successfully argued that their baselines should include the cost of extending coverage to optional eligibility groups that could have been, but were not then, served by the state\u2019s Medicaid program. These hypothetical expansions primarily covered women and children (but may also include elderly and disabled individuals), whose coverage was optional. Although in Hawaii many of these individuals received limited benefits under one of two state-funded programs, these groups were not served at all in the Medicaid programs. The states argued that since they could have submitted a state plan amendment and thus received federal medical assistance payments for providing health services to these groups, an equivalent amount of federal funding for the Medicaid demonstration project, which would include them, should be considered budget neutral. Including the section 1902(r)(2) population increased Hawaii\u2019s baseline by about $58 million over 5 years. Although the Kentucky legislature suspended implementation of the state\u2019s waiver, inclusion of the section 1902(r)(2) populations that included the elderly and disabled with incomes up to the federal poverty level would have added about $524 million to the baseline over 5 years.", "Historical Inflation Argument. The administration allowed some states to project increases in their baseline costs at rates higher than the administration\u2019s existing projections of national Medicaid spending growth. These states successfully argued that past years\u2019 spending increases exceeded average national spending growth and thus justified a higher or faster growing baseline. For example, in the first year of their waivers, Florida and Tennessee received relatively large increases (about 16 percent) compared with the previous year. Florida also received large annual increases for the remaining years of the waiver.", "Because Medicaid costs in the late 1980s and the early 1990s grew for reasons not expected to affect future spending, estimates of future Medicaid expenditures that rely on historical cost growth may be inflated. For example, although the states\u2019 use of provider taxes and donations contributed to the rapid rise of DSH payments between 1989 and 1993, recent legislation strictly limits DSH growth. Also, some of the past cost increases were due to the absorption of mandated and optional populations and changes in benefits. Major new mandates have not been added since 1991 and are not likely to be added in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, continued rapid Medicaid cost increases may have been unsustainable because of the great strain they placed on state budgets. Facing rapid cost increases, states would have increased incentive to adopt cost-containment measures. For example, Tennessee officials said the state would have faced massive health care coverage reductions had the waiver not been approved. In another example, after refusing to approve the waiver, the Kentucky legislature reduced physician reimbursements by $50 million.", "Another part of the policy change since 1993 is to allow demonstrations to show budget neutrality over the life of the waiver, but not to require it year by year. HCFA agreed that states\u2019 demonstration projects may involve temporary start-up costs and permitted increased federal funding to help pay these initial costs, as long as states expected to offset these costs by reduced federal funding in later years. Oregon, and perhaps some of the other states with waivers approved since 1993, expect that lower Medicaid cost growth in later years will compensate the federal government for higher expenses in the early years of the demonstrations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Partial Caps May Limit Federal Liability While Heightening State Risk", "paragraphs": ["Each of the waiver agreements ensures some limits on federal spending and holds some financial risk for the states. Because of the bilateral nature of the negotiations between the states and HHS, and because of the discretion granted to the Secretary of HHS in approving the waivers, the terms and conditions for each state are unique. Thus, the net effect on federal spending resulting from the waiver states\u2019 Medicaid programs after the 5-year life of the demonstrations may be different for each state. Under any of the negotiated waivers, however, states are not to receive federal assistance in paying for costs above the agreed-upon limits.", "Hawaii, Kentucky, Ohio, Oregon, and Rhode Island have agreed to federal spending limits called per capita caps, which are based on Medicaid spending per person. As shown in table 4.1, these caps allow per person spending to increase by a fixed percentage (plus the percentage change in medical prices in Hawaii and Kentucky). Thus, if the number of eligibles rises or, in Hawaii and Kentucky, if medical prices increase, the states can obtain additional funding. However, if spending rises because of greater utilization of services or a change in the mix of services provided, the states are financially liable.", "Under the waiver agreements for Tennessee and Florida, \u201caggregate caps,\u201d or limits on total spending, limit the federal government\u2019s financial exposure. In Tennessee, the state and the federal government agreed to set a maximum for federal funding for each year of the waiver. Under these terms, spending for Tennessee\u2019s Medicaid program may increase from $2.7 billion in 1993 to $4.1 billion in 1998. Florida and the federal government also set a maximum for annual federal Medicaid funding. Unlike Tennessee\u2019s agreement, however, federal spending can exceed the specified amounts if the number of traditional Medicaid beneficiaries exceeds the projected number by more than 3 percent. This means the state\u2019s financial risk is limited if the Medicaid rolls swell because of an economic downturn, for example. The two caps also differ in that Tennessee\u2019s covers long-term care expenditures, while Florida\u2019s does not.", "Some states may find funding their planned expansions difficult. Hawaii is experiencing financial problems largely because more new eligibles enrolled than expected. Oregon may also face difficulty, due in part to higher than anticipated enrollment of new eligibles and the continuing effects of a tax initiative passed in 1990 that limits state funds available for Medicaid and other programs. Oregon is considering reducing the capitation rate, changing eligibility rules, implementing premiums and copayments, delaying full implementation of mental health services, and reducing benefits, but will need HCFA approval before doing so. Moreover, a state analysis suggests the program will not be budget neutral without the cost savings anticipated from an employer mandate, for which the state must obtain congressional action. Even with the necessary congressional action, however, state political support for the mandate has eroded because of business opposition and changes in the makeup of the state legislature.", "The impact of higher than anticipated costs on federal funding depends on the specific waiver agreement and HCFA\u2019s enforcement. In Florida\u2019s case, HCFA would help pay for the increased costs over the life of the waiver, but expects to get paid back for the excess costs at the end of the 5-year project. Ohio\u2019s agreement is similar to Florida\u2019s, except that it specifies cumulative cost overrun ceilings. If Ohio\u2019s cumulative spending exceeds the ceiling, the state must submit a corrective action plan. In Tennessee, the budget-neutrality agreement has a formula to prevent federal expenditures from exceeding the yearly cap by more than a specified percentage. Tennessee has agreed to take steps such as limiting enrollment when this happens.", "The total amount of federal funding required for the demonstrations also depends, in part, on how HCFA defines and enforces its methodology for determining the federal expenditure cap in states with per capita limits. For example, even though the Oregon demonstration has been operating for more than a year, HCFA and the state have yet to agree on a specific methodology.

It currently consumes about 6 percent of all federal outlays (3 times the share devoted to Food Stamps and 5 times the share devoted to AFDC). Moreover, Medicaid\u2019s slice of the federal budget is growing faster than most other major budget items, including Medicare. If Medicaid continues indefinitely at its forecast growth rate (10.7 percent), federal spending on the program will double roughly every 5 to 7 years.", "Success in containing cost growth in Medicaid, as for the health care sector at large, has been elusive. Care for the elderly, blind, and disabled populations\u2014particularly long-term care\u2014is expensive, consuming more than $80 billion of the $130 billion cost of Medicaid in 1993. For acute care services, however, the promise of lower utilization has made the capitated payment features of managed care plans attractive to the states.", "Federal restrictions on the use of managed care reflect concerns for quality, because capitated payments allow profits to be earned from underservice. For example, the 75-25 rule seeks to ensure that Medicaid managed care plans are of sufficient quality, as demonstrated by their ability to attract private enrollees. At the same time, states believe that restrictions like this hamper their efforts to implement managed care effectively and that the need to obtain section 1115 waiver approval poses unnecessary obstacles. Requiring states to seek waivers before implementing these health care delivery system reforms may be burdensome, especially if alternatives for addressing quality of care concerns exist. Nonetheless, continuous oversight of managed care systems is required to protect Medicaid beneficiaries from inappropriate denial of care and federal dollars from payment abuses.", "Section 1115 waivers, while freeing states to implement managed care cost-containment strategies, could in the long run undermine efforts to contain federal expenditures. Our study of the section 1115 waivers approved to date raises the following concerns:", "The administration is allowing states to apply the federal share of Medicaid savings from managed care to finance coverage of additional populations not included under Medicaid law. To meet the budget-neutrality terms of section 1115 waivers, the administration and states assume that the enrollment of the Medicaid populations in HMOs will save states enough money to cover additional low-income people in the state at no extra cost to the federal government. Even if the proposed demonstrations will not require new federal dollars, the administration\u2019s approval of coverage expansions means that anticipated Medicaid cost savings (from more aggressive use of capitated care) will not be used to reduce federal spending. At issue is whether the federal treasury should benefit from these savings. Also of concern is whether eligibility should be made available for new groups only after congressional debate and legislative action.", "The administration\u2019s method for determining budget neutrality may allow states access to more federal funding than they would have received without the waiver. Our initial examination of four states\u2019 proposed demonstrations suggests that claims of budget neutrality for these states may not be sustainable in all cases. While Tennessee\u2019s demonstration project may be budget neutral, the demonstrations in Florida, Hawaii, and Oregon may require increased financial commitment from the federal government. Relative to overall federal Medicaid spending, the amount spent in states with approved section 1115 waivers is small.
