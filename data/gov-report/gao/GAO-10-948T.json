These colleges offer degrees and certifications in programs ranging from business administration to cosmetology. In 2009, students at for-profit colleges received more than $4 billion in Pell Grants and more than $20 billion in federal loans provided by the Department of Education (Education). GAO was asked to 1) conduct undercover testing to determine if for-profit colleges' representatives engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, or otherwise questionable marketing practices, and 2) compare the tuitions of the for-profit colleges tested with those of other colleges in the same geographic region. To conduct this investigation, GAO investigators posing as prospective students applied for admissions at 15 for-profit colleges in 6 states and Washington, D.C.. The colleges were selected based on several factors, including those that the Department of Education reported received 89 percent or more of their revenue from federal student aid. GAO also entered information on four fictitious prospective students into education search Web sites to determine what type of follow-up contact resulted from an inquiry. GAO compared tuition for the 15 for-profit colleges tested with tuition for the same programs at other colleges located in the same geographic areas. Results of the undercover tests and tuition comparisons cannot be projected to all for-profit colleges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Undercover tests at 15 for-profit colleges found that 4 colleges encouraged fraudulent practices and that all 15 made deceptive or otherwise questionable statements to GAO's undercover applicants. Four undercover applicants were encouraged by college personnel to falsify their financial aid forms to qualify for federal aid--for example, one admissions representative told an applicant to fraudulently remove $250,000 in savings. Other college representatives exaggerated undercover applicants' potential salary after graduation and failed to provide clear information about the college's program duration, costs, or graduation rate despite federal regulations requiring them to do so. For example, staff commonly told GAO's applicants they would attend classes for 12 months a year, but stated the annual cost of attendance for 9 months of classes, misleading applicants about the total cost of tuition. Admissions staff used other deceptive practices, such as pressuring applicants to sign a contract for enrollment before allowing them to speak to a financial advisor about program cost and financing options. However, in some instances, undercover applicants were provided accurate and helpful information by college personnel, such as not to borrow more money than necessary. In addition, GAO's four fictitious prospective students received numerous, repetitive calls from for-profit colleges attempting to recruit the students when they registered with Web sites designed to link for-profit colleges with prospective students. Once registered, GAO's prospective students began receiving calls within 5 minutes. One fictitious prospective student received more than 180 phone calls in a month. Calls were received at all hours of the day, as late as 11 p.m. To see video clips of undercover applications and to hear voicemail messages from for-profit college recruiters, see http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-948T . Programs at the for-profit colleges GAO tested cost substantially more for associate's degrees and certificates than comparable degrees and certificates at public colleges nearby. A student interested in a massage therapy certificate costing $14,000 at a for-profit college was told that the program was a good value. However the same certificate from a local community college cost $520. Costs at private nonprofit colleges were more comparable when similar degrees were offered."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our investigation into fraudulent,  deceptive, or otherwise questionable sales and marketing practices in the  for-profit college industry. Across the nation, about 2,000 for-profit  colleges eligible to receive federal student aid offer certifications and  degrees in subjects such as business administration, medical billing,  psychology, and cosmetology. Enrollment in such colleges has grown far  faster than traditional higher-education institutions. The for-profit colleges  range from small, privately owned colleges to colleges owned and  operated by publicly traded corporations. Fourteen such corporations,  worth more than $26 billion as of July 2010, have a total enrollment of 1.4  million students.

These  programs include, among others, the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan  Program (Direct Loans), the Federal Pell Grant Program, and campus- based aid programs. Grants do not have to be repaid by students, while  loans must be repaid whether or not a student completes a degree  program. Students may be eligible for \u201csubsidized\u201d loans or \u201cunsubsidized\u201d  loans. For unsubsidized loans, interest begins to accrue on the loan as  soon as the loan is taken out by the student (i.e. while attending classes).", "For subsidized loans, interest does not accrue while a student is in college.  Colleges received $105 billion in Title IV funding for the 2008-2009 school  year\u2014of which approximately 23 percent or $24 billion went to for-profit  colleges. Because of the billions of dollars in federal grants and loans  utilized by students attending for-profit colleges, you asked us to (1)  conduct undercover testing to determine if for-profit college  representatives engaged in fraudulent, deceptive, or otherwise  questionable marketing practices, and (2) compare the cost of attending  for-profit colleges tested with the cost of attending nonprofit colleges in  the same geographic region.", "To determine whether for-profit college representatives engaged in  fraudulent, deceptive, or otherwise questionable sales and marketing  practices, we investigated a nonrepresentative selection of 15 for-profit  colleges located in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania,  Texas, and Washington, D.C.

Factors included whether a college received 89 percent or more of total  revenue from federal student aid according to Department of Education  (Education) data or was located in a state that was among the top 10  recipients of Title IV funding. We also chose a mix of privately held or  publicly traded for-profit colleges. We reviewed Federal Trade  Commission (FTC) statutes and regulations regarding unfair and deceptive  marketing practices and Education statutes and regulations regarding  what information postsecondary colleges are required to provide to  students upon request and what constitutes substantial misrepresentation  of services.

Two students expressed interest in a culinary  arts degree, and two other students expressed interest in a business  administration degree. We filled out information on two Web sites with  these fictitious prospective students\u2019 contact information and educational  interests in order to document the type and frequency of contact the  fictitious prospective students would receive. We then monitored the  phone calls and voicemails received.", "To compare the cost of attending for-profit colleges with that of nonprofit  colleges, we used Education information to select public and private  nonprofit colleges located in the same geographic areas as the 15 for-profit  colleges we visited. We compared tuition rates for the same type of degree  or certificate between the for-profit and nonprofit colleges. For the 15 for- profit colleges we visited, we used information obtained from campus  representatives to determine tuition at these programs. For the nonprofit  colleges, we obtained information from their Web sites or, when not  available publicly, from campus representatives.

When students do not  make payments on their federal loans and the loans are in default, the  federal government and taxpayers assume nearly all the risk and are left  with the costs. For example, in the Direct Loan program, the federal  government and taxpayers pick up 100 percent of the unpaid principal on  defaulted loans. In addition, students who default are also at risk of facing  a number of personal and financial burdens. For example, defaulted loans  will appear on the student\u2019s credit record, which may make it more  difficult to obtain an auto loan, mortgage, or credit card. Students will also  be ineligible for assistance under most federal loan programs and may not  receive any additional Title IV federal student aid until the loan is repaid in  full. Furthermore, Education can refer defaulted student loan debts to the  Department of Treasury to offset any federal or state income tax refunds  due to the borrower to repay the defaulted loan. In addition, Education  may require employers who employ individuals who have defaulted on a  student loan to deduct 15 percent of the borrower\u2019s disposable pay toward  repayment of the debt.

For example, a representative of a privately owned for-profit college in  California told our undercover applicant that the $14,495 cost of tuition for  a computer-aided drafting certificate was \u201creally low.\u201d A representative at  a for-profit college in Florida owned by a publicly traded company told our  undercover applicant that the cost of their associate\u2019s degree in criminal  justice was definitely \u201cworth the investment\u201d. However, based on  information we obtained from for-profit colleges we tested, and public and  private nonprofit colleges in the same geographic region, we found that  most certificate or associate\u2019s degree programs at the for-profit colleges  we tested cost more than similar degrees at public or private nonprofit  colleges. We found that bachelor\u2019s degrees obtained at the for-profit  colleges we tested frequently cost more than similar degrees at public  colleges in the area; however, bachelor\u2019s degrees obtained at private  nonprofit colleges nearby are often more expensive than at the for-profit  colleges.", "We compared the cost of tuition at the 15 for-profit colleges we visited,  with public and private non-profit colleges located in the same geographic  area as the for-profit college. We found that tuition in 14 out of 15 cases,  regardless of degree, was more expensive at the for-profit college than at  the closest public colleges. For 6 of the 15 for-profit colleges tested, we  could not find a private nonprofit college located within 250 miles that  offered a similar degree. For 1 of the 15, representatives from the private  nonprofit college were unwilling to disclose their tuition rates when we  inquired. At eight of the private nonprofit colleges for which we were able  to obtain tuition information on a comparable degree, four of the for-profit  colleges were more expensive than the private nonprofit college. In the  other four cases, the private nonprofit college was more expensive than  the for-profit college.", "We found that tuition for certificates at for-profit colleges were often  significantly more expensive than at a nearby public college. For example,  our undercover applicant would have paid $13,945 for a certificate in  computer aided drafting program\u2014a certification for a 7-month program  obtained by those interested in computer-aided drafting, architecture, and  engineering\u2014at the for-profit college we visited. To obtain a certificate in  computed-aided drafting at a nearby public college would have cost a  student $520. However, for two of the five colleges we visited with  certificate programs, we could not locate a private nonprofit college  within a 250 mile radius and another one of them would not disclose its  tuition rate to us. We were able to determine that in Illinois, a student  would spend $11,995 on a medical assisting certificate at a for-profit  college, $9,307 on the same certificate at the closest private nonprofit  college, and $3,990 at the closest public college. We were also able to  determine that in Pennsylvania, a student would spend $21,250 on a  certificate in Web page design at a for-profit college, $4,750 on the same  certificate at the closest private nonprofit college, and $2,037 at the closest  public college.", "We also found that for the five associate\u2019s degrees we were interested in,  tuition at a for-profit college was significantly more than tuition at the  closest public college. On average, for the five colleges we visited, it cost  between 6 and 13 times more to attend the for-profit college to obtain an  associate\u2019s degree than a public college. For example, in Texas, our  undercover applicant was interested in an associate\u2019s degree in respiratory  therapy which would have cost $38,995 in tuition at the for-profit college  and $2,952 at the closest public college. For three of the associate\u2019s  degrees we were interested in, there was not a private nonprofit college  located within 250 miles of the for-profit we visited. We found that in  Florida the associate\u2019s degree in Criminal Justice that would have cost a  student $4,448 at a public college, would have cost the student $26,936 at a  for-profit college or $27,600 at a private nonprofit college\u2014roughly the  same amount. In Texas, the associate\u2019s degree in Business Administration  would have cost a student $2,870 at a public college, $32,665 at the for- profit college we visited, and $28,830 at the closest private nonprofit  college.", "We found that with respect to the bachelor\u2019s degrees we were interested  in, four out of five times, the degree was more expensive to obtain at the  for-profit college than the public college. For example in Washington, D.C.,  the bachelor\u2019s degree in Management Information Systems would have  cost $53,400 at the for-profit college, and $51,544 at the closest public  college. The same bachelor\u2019s degree would have cost $144,720 at the  closest private nonprofit college. For one bachelor\u2019s degree, there was no  private nonprofit college offering the degree within a 250 mile radius.
