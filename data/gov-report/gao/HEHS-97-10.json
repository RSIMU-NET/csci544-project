Also in 1992, we reported on the gender and compensation of athletic department personnel at NCAA Division I schools\u2014typically those schools with larger athletic programs. We found, for example, that men held all the athletic director, head football coach, and head coach for men\u2019s basketball positions, except at one school, where a woman was the athletic director. Also, head coaches for women\u2019s basketball always had lower average compensation than head coaches for men\u2019s basketball.", "To assist your ongoing review of the implementation of title IX, you asked us for further information on gender equity in intercollegiate athletics.

The Department\u2019s OCR is responsible for enforcing federal civil rights laws as they relate to schools, including title IX. In fiscal year 1995, OCR operated on a $58.2 million appropriation and with 788 full-time-equivalent staff.", "Federal regulations implementing title IX became effective in 1975 and specifically required gender equity in intercollegiate athletics. The regulations gave colleges a 3-year transition period (through July 21, 1978) to comply fully with the regulations\u2019 requirements that equal athletic opportunity be provided for men and women. In 1979, OCR issued a Policy Interpretation providing colleges with additional guidance on what constituted compliance with the gender equity requirements of title IX. Under the Policy Interpretation, OCR applies a three-part test to help determine whether colleges provide equal athletic opportunity to male and female student athletes. To help determine whether equal athletic opportunity exists, OCR assesses whether \u201cintercollegiate level participation opportunities for male and female students are provided in numbers substantially proportionate to their respective enrollments\u201d; whether, when \u201cthe members of one sex have been and are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes . . . the institution can show a history and continuing practice of program expansion which is demonstrably responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the members of that sex\u201d; or whether, when \u201cthe members of one sex are underrepresented among intercollegiate athletes, and the institution cannot show a history and continuing practice of program expansion, as described above . . . it can be demonstrated that the interests and abilities of the members of that sex have been fully and effectively accommodated by the present program.\u201d", "Colleges must meet any one of the three criteria of the test.", "In addition to the three-part test, OCR may use other factors to assess equality of opportunity in intercollegiate athletics, including the financial assistance and travel expenses provided to student athletes, the degree of publicity provided for athletic programs, the extent to which colleges recruit student athletes, and the extent of opportunities to participate in intercollegiate competition. OCR also assesses coaches\u2019 assignments and compensation insofar as they relate to athletic opportunity for students.", "OCR both investigates discrimination complaints and conducts compliance reviews. Compliance reviews differ from complaint investigations in that they are initiated by OCR. Moreover, compliance reviews usually cover broader issues and affect significantly larger numbers of individuals than most complaint investigations do, although some complaint investigations can be just as broad in scope and effect. OCR selects review sites on the basis of information from various sources that indicates potential compliance problems. OCR is authorized to initiate administrative proceedings to refuse, suspend, or terminate federal financial assistance to a school violating title IX. However, in the more than 2 decades since title IX was enacted, according to an OCR official, the Department has not initiated any such administrative action for athletic cases because schools have complied voluntarily when violations have been identified.", "In addition to OCR\u2019s enforcement of title IX, the Department implements the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act. Under the act, coeducational colleges offering intercollegiate athletics and participating in any federal student financial aid program are required to disclose certain information, by gender, such as the number of varsity teams, the number of participants on each team, the amount of operating expenses, and coaches\u2019 salaries. This information must be reported separately for men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams, and colleges were to have prepared their first reports by October 1, 1996; thereafter, reports are to be prepared annually by October 15th. Colleges must make the information available to students, potential students, and the public. Reports are not required to be submitted to the Department, but copies must be made available to the Department upon request.", "NCAA is a key organization in intercollegiate athletics. It is a voluntary, unincorporated association that administers intercollegiate athletics for nearly 1,000 4-year colleges and universities. NCAA member colleges belong to one of three divisions, the specific division generally depending on the number of sports the college sponsors. Typically, colleges with the largest number of athletic programs and facilities belong to Division I, and those with smaller programs are in Division II or III. Division I schools are further divided into three categories, Divisions I-A, I-AA, and I-AAA, with those that have the larger football programs generally placed in Division I-A."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OCR Emphasizes Both Prevention and Complaint Investigations", "paragraphs": ["OCR\u2019s strategy for encouraging gender equity in intercollegiate athletics emphasizes both preventing title IX violations and investigating complaints, although it receives relatively few complaints about alleged violations.

Comments from the focus groups indicated that clarification of the three-part test was needed. While OCR was developing the clarification, the Congress held hearings in May 1995, during which concerns were expressed that the three-part test was ambiguous, thus confirming the need for additional guidance. Subsequently, congressional members asked the Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights to clarify OCR\u2019s policy on the three-part test. The resulting 1996 clarification elaborates upon each part of the three-part test of equal athletic opportunity, provides illustrative examples of its application, and confirms that colleges are in compliance if they meet any one part of the test.", "The clarification states that a college meets the first criterion of the test if intercollegiate participation opportunities are substantially proportionate to enrollments. Such determinations are made on a case-by-case basis after considering each college\u2019s particular circumstances or characteristics, including the size of its athletic program. For example, a college where women represent 52 percent of undergraduates and 47 percent of student athletes may satisfy the first part of the three-part test without increasing participation opportunities for women if there are enough interested and able students to field and support a viable team.", "The second part of the test concerns program expansion. OCR\u2019s clarification focuses on whether there has been a history of program expansion and whether it has been continuous and responsive to the developing interests and abilities of the underrepresented sex. The clarification does not identify fixed intervals of time for colleges to have added participation opportunities. To satisfy the second part of the test, a college must show actual program expansion and not merely a promise to expand its program.", "Under the third part of the test, a determination is made whether, among students of the underrepresented sex, there is (a) sufficient unmet interest in a particular sport to support a team, (b) sufficient ability to sustain a team among interested and able students, and (c) a reasonable expectation of intercollegiate competition for the team in the geographic area in which the school competes. To make its determination, OCR evaluates such information as requests by students to add a sport, results of student interest surveys, and competitive opportunities offered by other schools located in the college\u2019s geographic area.", "Since fiscal year 1992, OCR has investigated and resolved 80 intercollegiate athletics complaints to which the three-part test was applied. Of these 80 colleges, 16 either demonstrated compliance or are taking actions to comply with part one; 4, with part two; and 42, with part three. The remaining 18 schools have yet to determine how they will comply because they are still implementing their settlement agreements.

Within Division I-A, the method cited most frequently for deciding what programs to add was direction from an NCAA conference to its member schools to add specific sports. For Division I colleges with no football programs, the most frequent method was the elevation of an existing club sport to the intercollegiate level.", "Not many men\u2019s sports programs have been dropped in the last 5 years: the mean number ranged from 0.1 to 1.0 per school.
