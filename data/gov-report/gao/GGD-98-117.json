Money laundering provides the fuel for drug dealers, terrorists, arms dealers, and other criminals to operate and expand their activities, which can have devastating social and economic consequences. In your March 24, 1997, letter, you asked us to study the regulatory, international, and law enforcement support roles of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a Treasury Department organization established in April 1990 to help combat money laundering and other financial crimes. In February 1998, we reported on FinCEN\u2019s regulatory role, i.e., the agency\u2019s progress in promulgating Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) regulations. Also, at an April 1998 hearing held by the Subcommittee, we presented information on FinCEN\u2019s various roles, including its efforts to administer civil penalties for BSA violations.", "This report focuses on FinCEN\u2019s products and services in support of law enforcement. Specifically, this report discusses (1) trends in the types and quantities of products and services provided by FinCEN to the law enforcement community; (2) the extent to which FinCEN\u2019s products and services have been considered useful by the law enforcement community in identifying, developing, or prosecuting money laundering and other financial crime cases; (3) the extent to which FinCEN evaluates the states\u2019 compliance with applicable controls over access to and use of information when state law enforcement officials directly access FinCEN\u2019s resources; and (4) FinCEN\u2019s efforts to provide Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 8300 information (Report of Cash Payments Over $10,000 Received in a Trade or Business) to the law enforcement community.", "To determine the trends in and usefulness of FinCEN\u2019s products and services, we focused on five principal types of support provided by FinCEN:", "Tactical support is designed to provide law enforcement officials with leads and other information on individuals, organizations, or activities currently under investigation. Such support can help law enforcement officials locate individuals, determine asset ownership for seizure/forfeiture purposes, and establish links among individuals, businesses, and assets.", "Strategic support is designed to provide federal and state law enforcement officials with intelligence analysis and reports on more broadly scoped topics, such as emerging trends, patterns, and issues associated with money laundering and other financial crimes. Examples of strategic support include (1) the analysis of currency flows to and from federal banks and (2) the assessment of the level of threat in a geographic area to support state-level anti-money laundering legislative efforts.", "Artificial intelligence support is designed to use a computer-based system that groups or links currency transaction reports to identify individuals, businesses, and bank accounts possibly involved in money laundering and other financial crimes.", "On-site tactical self-help (called a \u201cplatform concept\u201d) is designed to provide employees of other federal agencies with direct access to FinCEN\u2019s resources (e.g., BSA financial database and commercial databases) to conduct their own research and analysis.", "Off-site tactical self-help (called \u201cProject Gateway\u201d) is designed to provide designated state and local law enforcement officials with direct, on-line access to financial records filed under BSA. These designated officials conduct on-line inquiries for other law enforcement agencies in the state.", "In conducting our study, we analyzed data showing the number of requests for and/or issuances of each of FinCEN\u2019s principal types of products and services. To assess the usefulness of FinCEN\u2019s tactical support, we surveyed by mail a stratified, statistical sample of 352 federal officials and a simple random sample of 95 state officials who requested tactical support from April 1996 to March 1997 and to whom FinCEN had responded before August 1997. The officials sampled were representative of the universe of requesters in 31 federal agencies and 15 states. To obtain information about the usefulness of FinCEN\u2019s other products and services (i.e., strategic, artificial intelligence, platform concept, and Project Gateway), we (1) distributed surveys to or conducted interviews with the main federal and state agency users of these products and services and (2) interviewed FinCEN officials. For these other products and services, the federal and state agency users we contacted were not representative samples of the universe of users.", "Also, to determine why some federal agencies\u2019 field offices, High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA), and some states requested little or no tactical support from FinCEN, we surveyed (1) selected Treasury and Justice agency field offices and (2) each HIDTA. We also interviewed officials from selected states that requested little or no support from FinCEN. As part of these inquiries, we ascertained what other (non-FinCEN) sources of data and analysis are used. However, it was beyond the scope of our study to evaluate or compare the capabilities or costs related to FinCEN and non-FinCEN sources.", "Further, to determine what controls are in place when FinCEN provides other federal and state agencies with direct access to databases through the platform concept and Project Gateway, we interviewed FinCEN officials and reviewed program documentation. However, we did not audit or test the effectiveness of these controls.", "Finally, to determine FinCEN\u2019s efforts to provide IRS Form 8300 information to the law enforcement community, we interviewed officials from the Treasury Department, FinCEN, and IRS headquarters, and reviewed correspondence between FinCEN and IRS headquarters.", "We performed our work from August 1997 to March 1998, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Appendix I provides further details about our objectives, scope, and methodology.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Department of the Treasury, FinCEN, and the Department of Justice. Their comments are discussed near the end of this letter, and FinCEN\u2019s written comments can be found in appendix VI."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN is a relatively small agency with a fiscal year 1997 budget of about $23 million and an onboard staffing level (as of December 1997) of 162 employees. FinCEN does not initiate or carry out any investigations on its own. Rather, by serving as a central source for financial intelligence information and analysis, FinCEN supports the investigative and prosecutive efforts of numerous law enforcement authorities. These include federal agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), IRS, and the Customs Service; state police departments and attorney general offices; local police departments and district attorney offices; and others, including applicable foreign authorities.", "In supporting these law enforcement entities, FinCEN administers the largest financial transaction reporting system in the world, which is based on recordkeeping and reporting requirements mandated or authorized under the BSA, as amended. To supplement the BSA-related financial database, FinCEN procures access to a variety of commercially maintained databases, such as Autotrack and Lexis/Nexis, which can be used to locate individuals, determine asset ownership, and establish links among individuals, businesses, and assets. Moreover, through specific written agreements, FinCEN can access the investigative-case databases of various federal law enforcement agencies (e.g., DEA and the Customs Service). Further, FinCEN maintains an internal database of the cases or requests it has supported and the related products it has generated. This internal database enables FinCEN to help law enforcement agencies coordinate their efforts. Appendix II contains additional information about the databases used by FinCEN.", "Using these financial, commercial, and law enforcement databases, FinCEN provides five principal types of support. Historically, tactical support in response to law enforcement requests for data and analysis has been a mainstay of FinCEN\u2019s various products and services. Tactical products can be database extracts on a single subject or detailed, in-depth analyses of the financial aspects of major criminal organizations. According to a FinCEN official, routine requests for tactical support are handled on a first-come, first-served basis, with federal, state, and local requests treated equally. The official added that FinCEN can respond to tactical requests requiring immediate attention (e.g., terrorism cases) within 24 hours and sometimes as quickly as 2 to 3 hours. At times, FinCEN may also provide off-site support to investigative teams or task forces working complex cases. Further, FinCEN provides tactical support to assist other types of cases, including classified, terrorism, and grand-jury investigations.", "As the name implies, rather than focusing on individual cases, FinCEN\u2019s strategic support is designed to provide federal and state law enforcement officials with intelligence analyses and reports on longer term or more broadly scoped topics. An example is the analysis of trends, patterns, and fluctuations in currency flows to and from Federal Reserve banks to determine any money-laundering implications. Also, as part of its strategic efforts, FinCEN has developed a \u201ccase lab\u201d unit to assist law enforcement agencies in addressing large-scale money-laundering activity, such as that conducted by drug cartels. According to FinCEN\u2019s Strategic Plan (1997-2002), the agency\u2019s overriding objective over the next few years will be to construct a viable model for determining the magnitude of money laundering.", "FinCEN\u2019s artificial intelligence support is designed to help identify subjects (i.e., individuals and businesses) possibly involved in money laundering and other types of financial crimes. This support relies on computerized technology designed to identify suspicious transactions by reviewing and correlating (i.e., grouping or linking) currency transaction reports required by the BSA. FinCEN has used this technology to self-generate investigative leads as well as to respond to specific requests. In the former instances, FinCEN\u2019s policy is to forward its results to the appropriate law enforcement agency for consideration.", "A fourth type of support is on-site tactical self-help (called a \u201cplatform concept\u201d), whereby FinCEN encourages and trains agents and analysts from federal law enforcement and regulatory agencies to access the BSA financial database and commercial databases (accessible at FinCEN) to conduct their own research and analysis. FinCEN provides office space and database access for these personnel, who use FinCEN resources on a full- or part-time basis and work only on cases for their respective agencies. Most platform users do not have direct access to law enforcement databases or suspicious activity reports. A FinCEN official explained that (1) interagency agreements usually prohibit platform users from accessing law enforcement databases and (2) most federal agencies that use suspicious activity reports have their own access to the reports. When requested, a FinCEN employee will check these databases for platform users.", "Finally, the fifth type of support is off-site tactical self-help (called \u201cProject Gateway\u201d)\u2014a joint effort between FinCEN and the IRS Detroit Computing Center, which receives and processes financial information reported under the BSA (e.g., currency transaction reports). Using custom-designed software, designated state and local law enforcement officials have direct, on-line electronic access to BSA records, including suspicious activity reports. These designated officials also conduct Gateway queries for other law enforcement agencies in their state and can also request information from the Autotrack commercial database. According to a FinCEN official, Gateway users have direct access to suspicious activity reports primarily because state and local law enforcement agencies do not have their own access to the reports. Further, through Gateway, FinCEN can \u201calert\u201d or notify one agency that another agency has or had an interest in the same investigative subject (individual or entity). Each state\u2019s access to Gateway is free of charge (except for telephone charges)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FinCEN Has Issued Fewer Reports While Agencies Have Increased Their Direct Use of the Platform Concept and Project Gateway", "paragraphs": ["While the types of products and services offered by FinCEN have expanded, the volume of tactical, strategic, and artificial intelligence reports has decreased over the past several years. While the reasons for the decreases varied, one significant factor cited by FinCEN was that it assigned fewer staff to support these activities. Since 1995, law enforcement officials have increased their use of FinCEN\u2019s platform concept and Project Gateway to conduct their own research and analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tactical Support Requests May Have Peaked in 1995", "paragraphs": ["FinCEN has been providing tactical support to the law enforcement community since the agency was established in 1990. As figure 1 shows, the volume of law enforcement requests to FinCEN for tactical support increased significantly from calendar year 1991\u2014the first full year of operation\u2014to 1995. However, from calendar year 1995 to 1997, the volume of requests decreased by approximately 38 percent.", "According to a FinCEN official, one primary reason for the decrease in the number of tactical requests was that, in recent years, FinCEN stopped accepting certain types of requests\u2014such as requests involving background checks for employment or security clearance purposes\u2014that did not directly support law enforcement functions. For example, FinCEN stopped supporting certain IRS and U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigations in 1996. As a result, FinCEN\u2019s 1997 workload was reduced by approximately 3,300 cases. The official told us that FinCEN\u2019s expertise is not needed to conduct these types of inquiries and that, as a result, FinCEN has made efforts to encourage agencies to conduct these types of research on their own or by using FinCEN\u2019s platform concept or Project Gateway, as applicable.", "The official told us that FinCEN stopped accepting certain types of requests to compensate for reductions in staff assigned to provide tactical support. As figure 2 shows, from October 1994 to October 1997, the total number of staff (federal and contractor) responding to requests for tactical investigative support decreased from 77 to 40. Of this total, the number of federal staff (i.e., FinCEN employees and detailees from other agencies) decreased from 53 to 19.", "According to the FinCEN official, although the agency\u2019s overall staff levels have remained fairly constant over the years, many tactical staff have been reassigned to support FinCEN\u2019s expanded mission, which includes (1) responsibility for promulgating BSA regulations and (2) a leadership role in international efforts to combat money laundering. The official also told us that several tactical staff were reassigned in March 1997 to support FinCEN\u2019s new Office of Research and Analysis.", "According to FinCEN officials, FinCEN also began to contact requesters in 1995 to determine specifically what type of data and analysis was needed. These contacts included determining which databases had already been researched (outside of FinCEN), which databases FinCEN should research, and what type of report should be provided (e.g., a database extract or an analytical report). The officials told us that, before 1995, FinCEN\u2019s tactical support staff would generally research all of the financial, commercial, and law enforcement databases the agency could access.", "Further, over the past 2 years, an increasing number of tactical reports consisted of database extracts versus reports that contained detailed analysis. According to FinCEN officials, the percentage of tactical products that contained detailed analysis decreased from approximately 25 percent in calendar year 1996 to about 10 percent during calendar year 1997. According to FinCEN\u2019s Strategic Plan (1997-2002), the agency intends to provide better tactical support to its customers by increasing the number of FinCEN analysts capable of performing complex research and analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of Strategic Reports Decreased Significantly", "paragraphs": ["As with tactical support, FinCEN has been providing strategic support to the law enforcement community since 1990. As shown in figure 3, the volume of strategic reports issued by FinCEN has decreased from a high of 23 in 1992 to 1 in 1997.", "According to a FinCEN official, fewer strategic reports were generated in recent years because (1) FinCEN assigned fewer staff to support strategic projects and (2) the products often did not provide the type of information law enforcement officials needed to do their work.", "To increase its emphasis on strategic support and to improve the usefulness of strategic products, FinCEN created a new Office of Research and Analysis in March 1997. Although FinCEN initially planned to staff this office with 23 analysts, only 14 staff were on board as of November 1997. Before this reorganization, FinCEN\u2019s Strategic Analysis Division had five to seven analysts performing strategic analysis.

As shown in table 1, the volume of products generated by FinCEN from artificial intelligence analyses has decreased significantly over the past 2 fiscal years.", "FinCEN officials provided several reasons for the decrease in artificial intelligence products. First, they said the artificial intelligence system was redesigned for fiscal year 1996 to focus on more complex cases, which they defined by the number of subjects per case. FinCEN data indicated there was an average of 2.5 subjects per case in fiscal year 1995 versus an average of 16.2 subjects per case in fiscal year 1996. Second, they said that the majority of the artificial intelligence products generated in fiscal years 1993 to 1995 were self-initiated, and that FinCEN self-initiated very few artificial intelligence products in fiscal years 1996 and 1997, in part because federal law enforcement agencies reportedly did not take any action on many of the former products. Third, they said that FinCEN reduced the number of full-time analysts working on artificial intelligence cases from three in fiscal year 1995 to the equivalent of one-half full-time analyst in fiscal year 1997. In an effort to increase the number and usefulness of investigative leads and products generated, FinCEN assigned three full-time staff to support artificial intelligence cases in early fiscal year 1998."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Increased Their Use of FinCEN\u2019s Platform Concept", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to expand the availability and use of its tactical support resources, FinCEN developed the platform concept in 1994, offering employees of federal law enforcement agencies space at FinCEN and access to BSA financial data and commercial databases so they could conduct their own research and analysis. As table 2 shows, law enforcement agencies have increased their use of platforms. As of April 1998, 51 personnel representing 31 agencies were using platforms on a full- or part-time basis at FinCEN.", "According to data provided by FinCEN, platform users supported 1,477 investigative cases during fiscal year 1997.

Wyoming was the only state that did not use Gateway during this period.", "According to FinCEN\u2019s records, the 57,663 Gateway queries in fiscal year 1997 supported 3,327 law enforcement cases. Approximately 84 percent of the BSA reports reviewed during these queries were currency transaction reports. Also, 21 states made a total of 3,440 automated queries of Autotrack during fiscal year 1997.", "Further, the number of times FinCEN used Gateway to alert or notify one agency that another agency had an interest in the same investigative subject (individual or entity) increased from 356 in fiscal year 1996 to 920 in fiscal year 1997."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Overall, FinCEN\u2019s Products and Services Were Considered Useful", "paragraphs": ["Responses to the surveys we sent to officials from 31 federal agencies and 15 states indicated that FinCEN\u2019s tactical products have been useful in identifying, developing, and prosecuting cases involving money laundering and other financial crimes.

We estimated that 17 percent of the federal officials who received tactical products would suggest that FinCEN should respond to requests in a more timely manner. Although the number of requests received by FinCEN decreased during fiscal year 1997 and FinCEN has taken steps to better focus the scope of each request, the average turnaround time\u2014i.e., the number of calendar days from when a request is received at FinCEN to the day the product is mailed to the requester\u2014for routine requests increased to 2 to 3 months during most of fiscal year 1997.", "According to a FinCEN official, the primary reason for this lengthy turnaround time was because many staff responding to tactical requests were reassigned in March 1997 to support FinCEN\u2019s new Office of Research and Analysis. Consequently, the number of FinCEN staff supporting tactical requests decreased from 19 in October 1996 to as few as 7 during the summer of 1997 before increasing back to 19 in October 1997.", "The official told us the average turnaround time for routine requests was reduced to about 3 weeks in September 1997\u2014about 6 months after the sample period used for our questionnaire\u2014by authorizing overtime and temporarily having more staff do casework.

In and of itself, this is a significant challenge, and given the existence of various intelligence and investigative support centers and other sources of information and financial analysis, it is likely to be a continuing challenge. Also, compounding this challenge, since its inception in 1990, FinCEN\u2019s staffing levels have remained fairly constant, while its mission has expanded beyond its original law enforcement support role to include responsibility for promulgating BSA regulations and assuming a leadership position in international efforts to combat money laundering.", "Nonetheless, to FinCEN\u2019s credit, the agency has expanded its law enforcement support role from providing tactical and strategic products to include use of an artificial intelligence system and implementation of self-help services (i.e., the platform concept and Project Gateway). However, due in part to reallocations of staff to other mission functions, the expansion of FinCEN\u2019s line of products and services has, at times, experienced some growing pains. These include, for example, occasional backlogs and lengthy response times for routine tactical support requests and reductions in the number of strategic and artificial intelligence products generated.", "Similarly, the expansion or evolution of FinCEN\u2019s line of products and services inherently entails some \u201crole-definition\u201d issues. To the extent feasible, for instance, FinCEN considers its expertise best used to support nonroutine cases or analytically intensive cases, which may include tactical and strategic as well as artificial intelligence support. In recent years, however, while users reported that all types of FinCEN\u2019s tactical support have been useful, an increasing number of FinCEN\u2019s tactical reports consisted of database extracts versus detailed analysis. And, the number of analytical products FinCEN generated from strategic and artificial intelligence analyses decreased due, in part, to users\u2019 concerns about the usefulness of these products.", "To better focus its efforts and ensure usefulness, particularly regarding strategic and artificial intelligence products, FinCEN has begun various \u201cpartnering\u201d arrangements with its customers. Also, to better ensure that its tactical staff are available to support traditional law enforcement needs, in 1995, FinCEN discontinued accepting requests for background and regulatory investigations.", "FinCEN is also taking steps to ensure that its tactical staff are used to support complex or significant rather than routine cases. However, FinCEN has not developed and disseminated general criteria or guidelines concerning the types of cases that FinCEN can best support and the most appropriate uses for FinCEN\u2019s resources. We believe such guidance would help FinCEN better utilize its tactical resources. In a similar vein, while FinCEN had taken steps to inform the law enforcement community about its support, some federal law enforcement officials said they were not aware of the various products and services offered by FinCEN. (FinCEN has since taken additional steps to inform the law enforcement community about its products and services.)", "FinCEN\u2019s efforts to promote self-help services have been well received by the users of those services we interviewed. They commented very favorably about the platform concept and Project Gateway. These comments are corroborated by statistics showing that use of these systems has steadily increased. In turn, however, the increased use of these systems underscores the importance of FinCEN\u2019s controls to ensure that only authorized personnel access the systems and use them for legitimate purposes. Because FinCEN has not evaluated states\u2019 compliance with Gateway security policies and procedures, it cannot be sure the controls are working as intended. Periodically evaluating the states\u2019 compliance with these controls and preparing summary reports to management would help FinCEN identify improvements or deterioration in control effectiveness, reassess the related risks, and take appropriate action.", "FinCEN and IRS have been unable to resolve administrative issues related to FinCEN\u2019s dissemination of IRS Form 8300 information. Law enforcement officials believe this information can be useful in tracing cash payments by drug traffickers and other criminals for luxury cars, jewelry, and other expensive items. We recognize the long-standing concerns regarding the protection of taxpayer information, although we note that the Form 8300 contains the same basic information as is contained in the currency transaction report, which is more readily available to law enforcement. IRS has initiated a process for law enforcement agencies to access Form 8300 information directly from IRS.

The Acting Director commented that specific guidelines are impractical because (1) cases differ widely in circumstance and detail and (2) guidelines may result in perceived limitations in the inherent flexibility of FinCEN\u2019s products and services. Also, the Acting Director noted that a more effective and efficient way to communicate is through the generalized meetings and other outreach efforts that FinCEN conducts, although those efforts are already very ambitious for a small agency like FinCEN.", "The intent of our draft recommendation was not that FinCEN develop or communicate inflexible or rigid guidelines for its customers. Rather, given the availability of various other intelligence and investigative support centers that are alternate sources of financial, commercial, and law enforcement data and analysis, we believe that FinCEN\u2019s capabilities would be most fully and appropriately utilized if the agency widely communicates generally applicable criteria or guidance on the types of cases that it can best support. For example, a FinCEN official told us that tactical support is generally best suited for (1) cases that involve large criminal organizations, are of significance to the jurisdiction, or require expert financial analysis and (2) cases where support is not available from in-house sources.", "In our opinion, this kind of general guidance could be more widely disseminated to the law enforcement community, at a minimum, by being included in information on FinCEN\u2019s site on the Internet. As previously noted, FinCEN updated its Internet site in March 1998 to include information on the types of support it provides to the law enforcement community. However, the update did not include general criteria or guidance on the types of cases that FinCEN can best support or on the most appropriate uses of FinCEN\u2019s capabilities. Accordingly, with some modifications to the language in this report for clarification purposes, we are still recommending that FinCEN better communicate to potential customers general criteria or guidance on the types of cases that it can best support and the most appropriate uses of its capabilities.", "On the other hand, the Acting Director concurred with our recommendation that FinCEN develop and implement a program for on-site evaluations of the states\u2019 compliance with control policies and procedures related to Project Gateway. Toward this end, the Acting Director noted that FinCEN had recently (1) reported on an early-1998 audit of Gateway use and activity and (2) issued a comprehensive Gateway Coordinator\u2019s Handbook, which presents up-to-date rules, procedures, formats, dissemination instructions, and warning notices.", "Also, the Acting Director noted that FinCEN is beginning to develop guidelines for FinCEN staff to use in reviewing the compliance of state coordinators with policies and procedures.
