As of April 2008, about 26 million beneficiaries were enrolled in Part D. When beneficiaries encounter problems with Part D, they can either file a complaint with CMS or a grievance with their plan sponsors. CMS centrally tracks complaints data and plan sponsors must report summary data on grievances for each of their contracts. GAO provided information on (1) complaints and what they indicate about beneficiaries' experiences with Part D, (2) whether grievances data provide additional insight about beneficiaries' experiences, and (3) CMS's oversight of the complaints and grievances processes. To conduct its work, GAO reviewed CMS's complaints and grievances data and interviewed the plan sponsors of eight, judgmentally selected contracts, which accounted for 40 percent of 2006 enrollment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the number of complaints filed with CMS and the time needed to resolve them has diminished as the Part D program has matured, complaints data indicate that ongoing challenges pose problems for some beneficiaries. From May 1, 2006, through October 31, 2007, about 630,000 complaints were filed; most complaints were related to problems in processing beneficiaries' enrollment and disenrollment requests. The monthly complaint rate declined by 74 percent over the period, and the average time needed to resolve complaints decreased from a peak of 33 days to 9 days. However, trends in the complaints data also indicate ongoing implementation issues, such as information-processing issues related to beneficiaries' requests for enrollment changes and automatic premium withholds from Social Security payments. In addition, CMS and plan sponsors did not resolve a significant proportion of complaints related to beneficiaries at risk of depleting their medications in accordance with applicable time frames. Due to limitations and anomalies, the grievances data that plan sponsors reported for their contracts did not provide sufficient insight into beneficiaries' experiences with Part D. Specifically, these data did not include information about whether beneficiaries who filed grievances were at risk of depleting their medications or whether plan sponsors were resolving grievances in a timely manner. In addition, GAO identified a number of anomalies in the grievances data, raising questions about whether plan sponsors were reporting these data consistently and accurately. For example, reported grievances were concentrated in a small number of plan sponsors' contracts and at a rate that was significantly disproportionate to their respective enrollment levels; varied considerably among contracts with similar levels of enrollment; and increased from 2006 to 2007, in contrast to patterns in complaints data. CMS's oversight efforts thus far have focused almost exclusively on resolving complaints with little attention devoted to plan sponsors' grievances processes. CMS routinely monitors the status of complaints and has taken actions against plan sponsors who failed to comply with requirements for the complaints process. In contrast, CMS oversight of plan sponsor grievances processes has been more limited. CMS provided plan sponsors with general guidance for classifying grievances and periodically reviewed these data. However, several plan sponsors indicated that the guidance was insufficient, increasing the likelihood that plan sponsors report erroneous and inconsistent information to CMS and that they rely on the wrong processes to address beneficiaries' concerns. Further, CMS could not explain many of the anomalies in the grievances data that GAO identified."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) established a voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit,  known as Medicare Part D. Considered the largest change to the Medicare  program since 1965, the new benefit was intended to provide affordable  prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries. Under the program,  which began providing benefits on January 1, 2006, the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the agency that administers  Medicare\u2014contracts with private companies called plan sponsors to  provide this benefit. Through these contracts, plan sponsors offer  prescription drug plans which may have different beneficiary cost-sharing  arrangements (such as copayments and deductibles) and charge different  monthly premiums. In addition, while each plan may vary in the specific  drugs it covers, all must provide coverage for drugs within certain  categories.", "To obtain the Medicare drug benefit, eligible beneficiaries enroll in a  specific Part D plan offered by a plan sponsor. Approximately 21 million  people enrolled in a Medicare Part D plan during the program\u2019s initial  enrollment period, which ran from November 15, 2005, through May 15,  2006. Subsequent to the initial enrollment period, beneficiaries can enroll  in a plan during the same time period when they become eligible for  Medicare or change plans during the annual coordinated election period,  which runs from November 15 through December 31 of each year. As of  April 2008, nearly 26 million beneficiaries were enrolled in a Medicare   Part D plan. As part of the enrollment process, beneficiaries can choose to  pay for their share of premiums by having the Social Security  Administration (SSA) automatically deduct them from their social security  payments. CMS and SSA coordinate to ensure that this deduction occurs,  and millions of beneficiaries have chosen this option.", "Soon after the implementation of Part D in January 2006, the Secretary of  Health and Human Services (HHS), as well as beneficiary advocacy groups  and states, reported various difficulties beneficiaries experienced when  obtaining and utilizing their Part D benefits. For example, there were  reports that beneficiaries experienced problems enrolling in plans and  being charged incorrect copayments at the pharmacy. As the primary  federal oversight body for Medicare Part D, CMS is responsible for  ensuring that plan sponsors meet applicable requirements, which include  resolving these and other problems that could affect a beneficiary\u2019s ability  to obtain Part D benefits.", "Medicare beneficiaries who experience problems, such as difficulties in  trying to enroll in a Part D plan, or cases when they were charged too  much for their prescriptions, have two distinct processes through which  they can pursue resolution. CMS has established a process through which  a Medicare beneficiary can file a complaint directly with CMS, which will  generally forward it to the appropriate plan sponsor for resolution, or a  beneficiary has the right to file a complaint directly with the plan sponsor,  in which case it is known as a grievance. Complaints are tracked and  resolved through CMS\u2019s centralized complaints system, while grievances  are tracked and resolved by each plan sponsor using its own systems.  Through its outreach efforts, CMS encourages individuals to file  grievances with their plan sponsors before pursuing a complaint with  CMS; however, individuals can simultaneously file a complaint and  grievance on the same issue. CMS\u2019s time frames for resolving complaints  vary and depend on whether the complaint relates to a beneficiary\u2019s  medication supply, that is, whether the beneficiary is at risk of exhausting  his current medication supply unless the complaint is resolved. For  example, CMS defines complaints as immediate need when a beneficiary  has between 0-2 days of medication remaining, and according to its policy,  plan sponsors must resolve such complaints within 2 calendar days of  receiving them. In addition, it defines complaints as urgent when a  beneficiary has between 3 and 14 days of medication remaining, and CMS  officials encourage plan sponsors to resolve these complaints within   10 calendar days. Part D regulations generally require that plan sponsors  resolve grievances within 30 days. Additionally, if beneficiaries  experience problems obtaining coverage from their Part D plan sponsor  for a drug that has been prescribed for them, they must pursue resolution  through a separate process known as a coverage determination. Under this  process, beneficiaries make a formal request to their plan for coverage,  and if they receive an unfavorable coverage determination, they may  appeal the decision.", "You expressed interest in the extent to which beneficiaries may have  experienced problems obtaining and utilizing their benefits under Part D,  and the extent to which CMS has assured the resolution of such problems.  This report provides information on (1) complaints filed with CMS and  what they indicate about beneficiaries\u2019 experiences with Part D, (2) the  extent to which plan sponsor-reported grievances data provide insight  about beneficiaries\u2019 experiences with Part D, and (3) CMS\u2019s oversight of  the complaints and grievances processes.", "To identify and analyze the Part D complaints reported to CMS, we  obtained and analyzed data from CMS\u2019s Complaint Tracking Module  (CTM) database on all complaints filed for the 18-month period from   May 1, 2006, the point at which CMS first began centrally tracking  complaints, through October 31, 2007, the date for which CMS had the  most complete complaints data for our purposes at the time of our  request. For this same time period, we also obtained from CMS  information on the number of beneficiaries enrolled under the plans of  each Part D contract. Based on the information which CMS collected for  each complaint, including its category, or type of issue, and its filing and  resolution dates, we conducted a series of analyses which allowed us to  determine aggregate monthly complaint rates and summary statistics on  the types of issues which generated the complaints. Through these  analyses, we also determined the extent to which complaints were related  to beneficiaries\u2019 medication supplies, the proportion of complaints that  were resolved and their resolution times, and various trends over the   18-month period. We also interviewed CMS officials to obtain a more  thorough understanding of the complaints data and to obtain their views  regarding the trends our analyses identified. To assess the reliability of the  complaints data, we reviewed CMS manuals and other policies for  collecting, categorizing, and analyzing complaints, interviewed CMS  officials responsible for collecting and analyzing the data, and conducted a  series of electronic tests on the data file CMS provided. We determined  that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "To determine whether plan sponsor-reported grievances data provided  insight about beneficiaries\u2019 experiences with Part D, we obtained plan  sponsor-reported grievances data from CMS for each quarter of calendar  year 2006 and for the first 3 quarters of calendar year 2007. As of  December 2007, these data represented the universe of grievances  reported to CMS by plan sponsors. These grievances data, which plan  sponsors are contractually required to report to CMS, contained summary  statistics on the number and type of grievances reported for each Part D  contract. Based on these reported grievances and CMS enrollment data  described above, we conducted a series of analyses to determine the  number and grievance rates by quarter and the types of issues which  generated the grievances. However, while conducting our analyses we  identified a number of limitations and anomalies, and thus we determined  that the grievances data were too limited and not sufficiently reliable for  us to draw conclusions regarding beneficiaries\u2019 experiences with Part D.", "To determine how CMS oversees the complaints and grievances processes,  we reviewed relevant federal statutes and regulations, as well as available  CMS guidance, including standard operating procedures, for tracking,  monitoring, and resolving complaints and grievances. We reviewed other  CMS data, including information on compliance actions taken by the  agency against certain plan sponsors and the reasons for these actions,  and separately reviewed CMS\u2019s audit findings pertaining to grievances. In  addition, we interviewed officials from CMS\u2019s central office responsible  for collecting and monitoring CTM data and for reviewing plan sponsor- reported grievances data. We also interviewed CMS officials in each of its  10 regional offices responsible for ensuring that complaints were entered  into the CTM and were appropriately resolved. Finally, to identify plan  sponsors\u2019 views on the extent to which CMS provided guidance and  oversight for their grievances processes, we interviewed officials from  eight plan sponsors. We selected these plan sponsors based on a number  of factors, including variation in enrollment levels and grievance rates for  some of their specific contracts. The information we obtained from these  plan sponsor interviews was not generalized to all plan sponsors.", "In conducting our work we were unable to definitively determine the  number of complaints and grievances filed since the inception of the   Part D program, and thus assess the full range of implementation problems  beneficiaries may have faced. CMS did not begin centrally collecting  complaints until May 2006, and thus no information was readily available  on complaints filed between January and April 2006. Further, because  beneficiaries could have filed both a complaint and grievance on the same  issue or filed more than one complaint or grievance on the same issue,  complaints and grievances may be duplicative. In addition, for a variety of  reasons, including the newness and uniqueness of the Part D program, we  were unable to determine what an appropriate complaint rate should be.  For example, CMS officials cautioned us about comparing the Part D  complaint rate to that of the Medicare Part C program\u2014which is designed  to provide comprehensive medical coverage\u2014because the Part D data  reflect early implementation challenges, and because the goals of the two  programs and thus, the nature of issues facing beneficiaries, differ.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2006 to June 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

In 2007, CMS entered into more  than 600 individual contracts with about 250 plan sponsors to provide   Part D benefits. Under these contracts, PDP sponsors offered about 1,900  individual plan benefit packages and sponsors of MA-PDs offered about  1,700. The majority of Part D enrollees, about 70 percent, were enrolled  in PDPs during this time.

Processing a Part D enrollment involves multiple,  timely, and accurate electronic data exchanges among federal agencies,  private health plans, and pharmacies. For instance, data exchanges occur  between plan sponsors and CMS to verify benefit eligibility. Pharmacies  rely on this information to ensure that payments for beneficiaries filling  their prescriptions are processed appropriately. During the enrollment  process, beneficiaries choose one of three options for paying their share of  their Part D premiums\u2014direct billing, automated withdrawal from  financial accounts, or automatic deductions from social security  payments, called premium withholds. As of January 2008 about 20 percent  of Part D enrollees\u20144.8 million beneficiaries\u2014opted to have premiums  withheld from their social security payments, which requires coordination  among plan sponsors, CMS, and SSA. When a beneficiary elects this  option, CMS provides enrollment and payment information it receives  from plan sponsors to SSA for processing.

For complaints filed through the toll-free  number, customer service representatives (CSRs) enter details about the  complaints into the 1-800-Medicare database, and assign the complaint to  specific contracts administered by plan sponsors.

According to CMS officials, many of  the complaints related to accurately deducting premiums and forwarding  payments to plan sponsors were due to problems with data exchanges  between CMS and SSA. In addition, CMS officials indicated that  beneficiaries are not always aware that it can take several months for SSA  to process a request for premium deductions; therefore, they may file  complaints when premiums are not immediately deducted from their  social security payments.

For example, despite the trend in the overall  complaint rate discussed earlier and as shown in figure 4, the complaint  rate nearly doubled, from .72 in December 2006 to 1.40 in January 2007.  This was due largely to a spike in the number of complaints related to  delays or errors when CMS and plan sponsors processed beneficiaries\u2019  enrollment and disenrollment requests following the end of the 2007  annual coordinated election period. More specifically, according to CMS  officials this increased complaint rate was due largely to the sheer volume  of transactions processed during this time each year. The officials told us  that while they expect to continue to see an increase in complaints each  year following the annual coordinated election period, they expect the  magnitude of such increases to diminish as the program matures.", "In addition, the general trend of increasing complaint rates from January  2007 through May 2007 reflected increasing numbers of complaints related  to beneficiaries\u2019 requests for automatic withholding of premiums that can  occur when beneficiaries elect to change plans. According to CMS  officials, the timing of when SSA processes the premium withhold request  may affect the accuracy of the deduction, and result in complaints. For  example, as required by law, SSA must process cost-of-living adjustments  for beneficiaries\u2019 social security payments on an annual basis, and  according to SSA, they begin this processing in November of each year. To  process these adjustments for recipients who are also enrolled in Part D  and have chosen the premium withholding option, SSA must rely on CMS  enrollment information to determine the amount to deduct for Part D  premiums. However, because beneficiaries may have elected to change  plans during the Part D annual coordinated election period, which runs  from November 15 through December 31 of each year, SSA\u2019s calculations  may not account for premium differences related to beneficiaries\u2019  subsequent enrollment changes. CMS officials indicated that there is no  easy solution to the data coordination and timing issues between CMS and  SSA at the root of this problem. However, CMS and SSA have formed  several work groups to identify improvements, including improved data  system exchanges, which could help reduce complaints related to this  issue. In the interim, CMS has undertaken outreach efforts to plan  sponsors and beneficiaries to inform them of potential delays related to  requests for automatic premium withholds, letting them know that such  requests may take several months to process.", "Finally, while we found that CMS and plan sponsors resolved complaints,  including immediate need and urgent complaints, more quickly as the   Part D program matured, a substantial percentage of such complaints  were not resolved within CMS\u2019s time frames.

Therefore, CMS does not  have information about whether a grievance is related to a beneficiary\u2019s  medication supply or whether it was ultimately resolved. As a result, we  were unable to determine the extent to which beneficiaries\u2019 grievances  related to medication supply issues, the extent to which plan sponsors  were resolving grievances, or whether they were resolving them in a timely  manner.", "In addition to their limited nature, we identified a number of anomalies in  the grievances data that raise questions about their accuracy and  usefulness in drawing conclusions about beneficiaries\u2019 experiences with  Part D. Among these anomalies, we found that grievances were  concentrated in a small number of contracts, and at a rate that was  significantly disproportionate to their respective enrollments, raising  questions about whether plan sponsors were reporting grievances data for  their contracts in a comprehensive and consistent manner. For example,  in 2006 plan sponsors reported grievances data for 522 contracts, 19 of  which accounted for 80 percent of all grievances but only 49 percent of  enrollment. The concentration was more pronounced in 2007, when 11 of  the 604 contracts for which grievances data were reported accounted for  90 percent of all grievances but only 42 percent of enrollment.", "We also found significant variations in the number of grievances reported  for contracts with similar levels of enrollment, and in the number of  grievances filed between 2006 and 2007.

In addition, in contrast to the decline in the monthly  complaint rate that we identified, available data show an increase in the  average monthly grievance rate between 2006 and 2007. Specifically, while  a total of 310,215 grievances were reported in 2006, for an average monthly  grievance rate of 1.23 per 1,000 beneficiaries, there were a total of 726,440  grievances reported for the first 3 quarters of 2007 alone, for a rate of 3.38  per 1,000 beneficiaries. We found that this variation was predominately  due to differences in the number of grievances reported for three  contracts, which had a total of 70 grievances for 2006, and 495,961 for the  first 3 quarters of 2007, despite having nearly identical levels of total  enrollment in each year.", "Finally, the proportion of grievances assigned to categories varied  significantly between 2006 and 2007, a change that is inconsistent with  trends in the complaints data. For example, while over 60 percent of the  2006 grievances were assigned to the enrollment and disenrollment  category\u2014a percentage generally similar to the complaints data filed with  CMS\u2014they assigned approximately 5 percent of the 2007 grievances to  this category. In commenting on a draft of this report, CMS indicated that  the variation between the two years was likely due to data collection  issues that existed during the early implementation of Part D. For  example, CMS suggested that the grievances data reported by plan  sponsors in 2006 included nongrievances or erroneously categorized  grievances in the enrollment and disenrollment category."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS\u2019s Oversight Focused on Complaints and Not Grievances, Leaving Oversight Gaps", "paragraphs": ["While CMS has a systematic oversight process for complaints, it lacks a  similar oversight framework for plan sponsor-reported grievance  processes. To oversee the complaints process, CMS has established a  framework consisting of several key elements, which include standard  operating policies and procedures and a centralized repository of  complaints data, and staff that routinely review and assess the complaints  data and take actions against plan sponsors it determines have  noncompliant processes. In contrast to complaints, CMS\u2019s oversight of  plan sponsors\u2019 grievances processes has been more limited. CMS  developed guidance for classifying grievances, required plan sponsors to  report summary grievances data for each of their Part D contracts, and  periodically reviewed these data. However, limitations in these oversight  elements have resulted in plan sponsors reporting incomplete and  inconsistent data to CMS, and there is little assurance that beneficiaries\u2019  grievances are resolved or that they are resolved in a consistent fashion.", "To ensure a level of consistency in how complaints are tracked and  resolved, CMS developed standard operating procedures for both its  caseworkers and plan sponsors. These procedures provide guidance on  how complaints should be entered into the CTM as well as how  caseworkers and plan sponsors should resolve them. For example, CMS\u2019s  guidance includes requirements to enter key dates for each complaint,  such as the dates complaints were filed and resolved, and information  about how individual complaints should be categorized by their nature and  issue level. Specifically, CMS\u2019s guidance to plan sponsors provides  information about how they can utilize the CTM to access, review, and  document case resolution, or request CMS assistance in the event they are  unable to achieve resolution. Through its guidance, CMS has been able to  ensure consistency in terms of the information the CTM contains about  each complaint. Further, it has allowed the agency to create, through the  CTM, a reliable source of data from which it can monitor the complaints  process.", "CMS also dedicated significant resources to ensure that beneficiaries\u2019  complaints are addressed. Specifically, CMS officials estimated that  several hundred staff members throughout the agency have some  responsibility for the oversight of the complaints process. For example,  some regional staff members are responsible for reviewing plan sponsors\u2019  case notes included in the CTM to verify their resolution of complaints or  for directly resolving complaints beyond the control of plan sponsors. In  addition, other CMS staff members routinely analyze CTM data to identify  trends in complaint rates and track issues related to the performance of  individual plan sponsors, such as resolution times. For example, on a  quarterly basis, CMS staff members analyze complaint rates for individual  contracts both by overall complaints and by three CTM categories, and  then compare complaint rates among contracts. Based on this  comparison, CMS staff assign a star rating to each contract. Further, CMS  has dedicated staff in the Office of the Medicare Beneficiary Ombudsman  (OMO) who utilize complaints data to identify systemic problems affecting  the implementation of Part D. When OMO staff identify problems, such as  those related to delays in processing enrollment requests and withholding  premiums from Social Security payments, they alert high-level CMS  managers, who in turn are responsible for initiating corrective actions.", "CMS officials informed us that the agency may rely on a variety of actions,  ranging from formal compliance calls to the termination of a plan  sponsor\u2019s Part D contract when it identifies a plan sponsor that is  noncompliant with requirements for the complaints process. CMS officials  indicated that their use of such actions has been limited because informal  conference calls with plan sponsors have frequently been sufficient to  correct problems identified through complaints. For example, although  CMS officials said that they would require plan sponsors with contracts  that received a one or two star rating for 2 consecutive quarters to submit  a business plan describing how they would improve their performance,  they have never had to do so because their informal calls to such plan  sponsors have thus far been sufficient to correct problems. However, in  some cases, CMS has taken more stringent actions. For example, as of  February 2008, CMS had issued 144 notices of noncompliance and 22  warning letters, and initiated 3 audits against plan sponsors that did not  meet their contractual performance requirement to resolve 95 percent of  immediate need complaints within 2 days.45, 46 Additionally, CMS had not  terminated any plan sponsors\u2019 Part D contract or levied civil monetary  penalties in response to issues related to compliance with the complaints  process.", "To determine compliance with the performance requirement, CMS measures the number  of days that have elapsed between the date the complaint was assigned to the contract and  when it was resolved.", "CMS officials noted that they will consider developing additional performance  requirements, such as a requirement related to complaint rates, in the future. However, the  officials noted that they would want to examine data trends from at least a 3-year period  before doing so. medication. CMS also does not have a mechanism to verify that plan  sponsors have effectively resolved complaints. While CMS caseworkers  review plan sponsors\u2019 notes in the CTM, they do not routinely take a  sample of complaints and follow up with beneficiaries to validate the plan  sponsors\u2019 resolution actions. CMS officials indicated that the agency does  not have the resources to perform such a comprehensive check and stated  that beneficiaries who are dissatisfied with their plan sponsor\u2019s resolution  could file another complaint directly with CMS.", "In contrast to complaints, CMS\u2019s oversight of plan sponsor grievances  processes has been more limited. CMS provided plan sponsors with  general guidance for determining whether beneficiaries\u2019 problems were  grievances or coverage determinations, which are addressed through a  separate process. CMS also provided plan sponsors with time frames for  resolving grievances, periodically reviewed plan sponsor grievances data,  and began auditing plan sponsors\u2019 grievances processes in 2007.  However, although CMS\u2019s guidance to plan sponsors included examples of  how they could classify beneficiaries\u2019 problems, several plan sponsors we  interviewed said that this guidance was not detailed enough and raised  concerns about whether plan sponsors were accurately differentiating  among inquiries (i.e., general questions about the Part D program),  grievances, or coverage determinations. CMS officials acknowledged that  some plan sponsors have incorrectly classified inquiries as grievances.  Further, in its 2007 audits of plan sponsors\u2019 grievances processes, CMS  found numerous cases where plan sponsors did not correctly differentiate  between grievances and coverage determinations, supporting plan  sponsors\u2019 concerns about the adequacy of the existing guidance. Such  confusion about how to classify grievances increases the likelihood that  plan sponsors report erroneous or inconsistent information to CMS and  that they rely on the wrong processes to address beneficiaries\u2019 concerns.", "CMS does not require plan sponsors to report certain information on  grievances for each of their Part D contracts, such as resolution dates, that  is essential for determining whether beneficiaries\u2019 grievances are being  resolved, and devotes few resources to reviewing what plan sponsors have  reported for their contracts. Instead, on a quarterly basis, each plan  sponsor reports the total number of grievances for 11 categories for each  of its contracts. CMS officials also could not explain many of the  anomalies we identified in the grievances data, such as substantial  variation in the enrollment category from 2006 to 2007 and considerable  variation in the grievance rates between contracts with similar levels of  enrollment. Further, they acknowledged that they had not undertaken  efforts to review the data in detail or to assess their overall reliability. In  fact, more than a year into the program, CMS officials were still uncertain  as to whether grievances had been reported for all contracts, and as of  May 2008, agency analysis was limited to calculating annual grievance  rates for each contract that did report grievances.", "CMS officials recognized that their efforts to oversee the grievances  process have been limited, as they have chosen to focus their attention on  other oversight issues such as appeals and coverage determinations and  have devoted resources to program implementation issues, such as  enrollment of dual-eligible beneficiaries. In the event that plan sponsors  are not properly responding to beneficiaries\u2019 grievances, CMS officials  stated that the issues could be resolved through the complaints process.  Therefore, by focusing its attention largely on complaints, the agency  expressed confidence that plan sponsors are addressing beneficiaries\u2019  issues. While the agency strongly believes in providing plan sponsors the  latitude to implement their individual grievances processes, CMS expects  to devote more resources to the oversight of grievances processes as the  program matures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["January 1, 2006, marked a new era in the Medicare program as the federal  government began offering outpatient prescription drug coverage to  eligible Medicare beneficiaries. The program is currently in its third year  of operation, and millions of individuals have chosen to enroll. While  trends in complaints data suggest that CMS and plan sponsors have  improved program operations over time, lingering operational issues  continue to pose challenges to some beneficiaries. This has hindered their  ability to enroll in their plans of choice, have their premiums accurately  deducted from their social security payments, or ensure that their  problems related to critical medication supply issues are resolved in a  timely manner. While CMS is taking action to address some of these  operational issues related to complaints, its continued effort to address  these operational challenges will be key to achieving further improvement.  Furthermore, CMS does not have reliable grievances data to identify  problems and needed improvements and ultimately ensure that  beneficiaries\u2019 concerns are addressed. This is particularly important given  that CMS encourages beneficiaries to utilize the grievances process as  their first line of redress when trying to resolve problems. Without reliable  grievances data, CMS cannot ensure that plan sponsors are fulfilling their  obligations and provide a full assessment of beneficiaries\u2019 experiences  with the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve oversight of the Medicare Part D grievances process, and  provide added assurance that beneficiaries\u2019 grievances are being resolved,  we recommend that CMS undertake efforts to improve the consistency,  reliability, and usefulness of grievances data reported by plan sponsors for  each of their contracts.

The agency  concurred with the report\u2019s recommendation to undertake efforts to  improve the consistency, reliability, and usefulness of grievances data  reported by plan sponsors for each of their contracts, and highlighted  steps it already has taken to implement it. CMS took issue with the report\u2019s  conclusion that its oversight activities were focused almost exclusively on  resolving complaints with little attention devoted to plan sponsors\u2019  grievances processes, and noted that it felt some information, such as  details concerning attestations made as part of sponsors\u2019 Part D  applications, had been omitted from our report. In addition to these  comments, CMS provided detailed, technical comments that we  incorporated as appropriate.", "Consistent with the recommendation to improve the consistency,  reliability, and usefulness of grievances data, CMS noted that it has been  working to provide Part D sponsors with more comprehensive guidance,  enhance its oversight activities, and undertake corrective actions as  needed. CMS stated that it recently provided guidance to plan sponsors  regarding statutory definitions of grievances, coverage determinations,  and appeals to facilitate accurate reporting of these data to CMS. For  example, CMS cited its 2008 Reporting Requirements Technical  Specifications, released this spring, as part of its efforts to further educate  plan sponsors about the differences between coverage determinations and  grievances. CMS further stated that it would consider adding data  elements related to plan sponsors\u2019 timeliness and quality of grievances  resolution to its calendar year 2010 Reporting Requirements.", "CMS took issue with the report\u2019s conclusion that its oversight activities  were focused almost exclusively on resolving complaints with little  attention devoted to plan sponsors\u2019 grievances processes. The agency  noted that it considered this conclusion misleading and felt it did not  appropriately weigh all components of CMS\u2019s oversight of plan sponsors\u2019  grievances processes, such as plan sponsor audits, which include a review  of grievances processes. In addition, CMS noted that the report did not  consider a component of the Part D application, in which sponsors must  attest that they will establish and maintain grievances processes in  accordance with federal regulations. Finally, while agreeing with the  report\u2019s statement that the average resolution time for immediate need and  urgent complaints exceeded CMS\u2019s required time frames, CMS noted that  its analysis of more recent complaints data demonstrated that case  resolution time frames had improved and were trending towards CMS\u2019s  standard time frames.", "We recognize that CMS has audited the grievances processes of some plan  sponsors, and the report highlighted key findings from these audits. While  we believe CMS can rely on such audits to improve its oversight in the  future, the agency did not begin auditing plan sponsors until 2007, and has  yet to audit a number of plan sponsors. Further, while we recognize the  attestation component of the application requirement, we believe that  such attestations provide only limited assurance that beneficiaries\u2019  grievances are being resolved appropriately. We do not believe CMS will  be able to ensure that plan sponsors are abiding by their statements until  CMS audits the grievances processes of all plan sponsors. Finally, we did  not evaluate CMS\u2019s findings on resolution time frames from its more  recent data, because the data CMS used to conduct their analyses of  resolution time frames were from a time frame beyond the scope of our  work.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date.
