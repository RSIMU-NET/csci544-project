For these programs, GAO found that DOD plays a limited role\u2014primarily monitoring the availability of specialty metals and conducting periodic reviews of prime contractor quality assurance processes. GAO also reviewed contracts for these five programs and found they contained clauses that require prime contractors to procure specialty metals in compliance with domestic source restrictions, ensure that delivered items meet contract requirements as part of quality assurance, and maintain processes for future material needs. In turn, these prime contractors told GAO that they pass down the contract requirements\u2014including those pertaining to specialty metals\u2014to their subcontractors and defense suppliers, and require them to follow industry standards for quality management. These standards include, among other things, testing subcontractor processes to determine if they meet contractual specifications; reviewing required supplier certifications for items delivered under the contract to confirm compliance with all identified requirements; and rating subcontractors using performance metrics. Prime contractors for these programs also told GAO they use a risk-based approach to oversee subcontractors, including those suppliers at lower tiers.", "DOD recently improved its national security waiver process; but its dissemination of information contained in those waivers is limited. Since 2009\u2014when specialty metals restrictions were changed and the exception for national security was added\u2014DOD has granted six national security waivers to five different weapon system programs known to have procured noncompliant specialty metals. Five of the six waivers were for samarium-cobalt magnets, which were noncompliant largely due to a change in a previously allowed exception for these magnets. During its review, GAO identified weaknesses in DOD's waiver process such as not having defined procedures for requesting waivers; and in June 2014, DOD developed written guidance for program offices to follow when requesting these waivers. However, GAO also found that DOD does not have a mechanism to share information on national security waivers granted for noncompliant specialty metals. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government call for information to be recorded and communicated to management and others, including external parties who need it, such as program offices and suppliers, to help the agency achieve its goals. Disseminating non-sensitive information\u2014including the names of programs that received waivers, sources of the noncompliant specialty metals, and corrective actions\u2014to key stakeholders, such as DOD weapon system program offices and their defense suppliers, could help raise awareness of and compliance with the specialty metals restrictions.

There are few, if any,  substitutes for some of these metals. Specialty metals domestic source  restrictions have been established to ensure that the United States has a  vigorous domestic metals supply chain capable of meeting defense  needs. These restrictions require that such metals for DOD weapon  systems and certain items or components be procured from domestic  sources or certain qualifying countries unless an exception applies.  Exceptions include those for domestic nonavailability, and in situations  where acceptance of an end item is necessary to national security. For  example, if a weapon program is using noncompliant specialty metals, the  Secretary of Defense may issue a waiver for that program, if the  Secretary determines that the acceptance of end items made with  noncompliant metals are in the interest of national security.", "Recent instances of DOD\u2019s noncompliance with specialty metals  restrictions and the number of requests for national security waivers have  raised questions about DOD\u2019s oversight of its weapon systems  contractors. GAO was mandated by a committee report accompanying a  bill for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year  2014 to review DOD\u2019s compliance with specialty metals\u2019 requirements  and its use of waivers for national security interests (national security  waivers). In this report, we assessed: (1) how DOD meets its needs for specialty metals parts and ensures compliance with the specialty metals  restrictions, and (2) DOD\u2019s process for providing national security waivers  for specialty metal procurements and the extent to which it disseminates  waiver information throughout the department.", "To do our work, we examined laws and regulations regarding domestic  source restrictions, including the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation  Supplement (DFARS), as well as reviewed DOD guidance relating to  planning for and compliance with specialty metals and related  requirements of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). We also  selected a non-generalizable sample of five weapon systems as case  studies on the basis of their total acquisition cost, and phase in the  acquisition process as of November 2013; as well as to include  representation of at least one program from each of the military services:  the Joint Strike Fighter, KC-46 Tanker, DDG-51 Arleigh Burke Class  Destroyer, Virginia Class Submarine, and Family of Medium Tactical  Vehicles. We reviewed contracts for these programs to see if they  included the specialty metals restrictions and documentation provided by  contractor and DOD quality assurance staff on specialty metals planning  efforts and parts management planning to understand how contractors  ensure parts availability and mitigate risk. We identified the extent to  which DOD depends on contractors to perform these activities. Our  findings from these five programs cannot be generalized to all programs,  but they provide useful insights into how DOD officials and contractors  work to address requirements associated with specialty metal restrictions.  We also interviewed officials from DOD, including the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD  AT&L), the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA), and selected  weapon system programs, as well as their prime contractors, two  selected subcontractors, and specialty metals company representatives.  We ascertained their roles in determining the needs for specialty metals  parts and monitoring compliance with specialty metals restrictions and  related requirements of the FAR and the DFARS. We also reviewed  DOD\u2019s process for providing waivers for national security interests for  weapon programs that procured noncompliant specialty metals, and  assessed the extent to which DOD disseminates information on national  security waivers it has granted against criteria in Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government. We identified and reviewed the  national security waivers for specialty metal procurements granted by  DOD since 2009, when specialty metals restrictions were changed and  the exception for national security was added. For instances where  noncompliance was reported and a national security waiver was  requested, we reviewed corresponding DOD determinations of whether  the contractor\u2019s or subcontractor\u2019s noncompliance was knowing or willful.  We also reviewed legislative history for DOD\u2019s authority to grant waivers.  We interviewed officials representing USD AT&L to identify other relevant  background, rationale, or circumstances not stated in the waiver  documentation.

The remaining waiver (for the Standard Missile-3  Block II-A program) was granted as a result of an international agreement  that did not address specialty metal restrictions.

However, the companies we spoke with that were  involved in requesting the national security waivers indicated they had not  updated their purchasing processes to reflect this DFARS change,  resulting in noncompliance with specialty metals restrictions. As a result,  five of the six national security waivers were granted due to noncompliant  samarium-cobalt magnets procured by three companies. For each of the  five programs that procured noncompliant samarium-cobalt magnets,  their national security waivers stated that these magnets met the  necessary performance capability requirements for the weapon systems  for which they were procured. The time frame for the contractor\u2019s  discovery of noncompliant specialty metals to when the waiver was  approved by DOD, ranged from two months for the Joint Strike Fighter  parts for positioning external doors and nose and main landing gear, to 10  months for the Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar program. According to  the specialty metal statute, weapon system contractors and  subcontractors that are noncompliant with the specialty metals restrictions  and receive a national security waiver must develop and implement an  effective plan to ensure future compliance, also known as a corrective  action plan. The prime contractor for the Joint Strike Fighter program told  us that it has, as well as its subcontractors, submitted corrective action  plans. In addition, the prime contractors for the F-16 Block 52 aircraft and  the B-1 Bomber Reliability and Maintainability Improvement Program  have also submitted a corrective action plan. There is no plan for the  Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar, as a result of the prime contractor  correcting the noncompliance before the program accepted delivery of the  radar systems regarding the need for the waiver. DOD did not also  require a corrective action plan for the Standard Missile-3 Block II-A,  because the noncompliant components were provided under the terms of  a bilateral agreement and were not procured by a U.S. prime contractor.  The waiver stated that the specialty metals restrictions still apply because  the specialty metals\u2019 components are to be integrated with U.S.-acquired  missile components.", "In addition, in our review of national security waivers approved by DOD,  we found that these waivers contained the elements required by the  specialty metals restrictions.

However, we found that DOD\u2019s process for  granting national security waivers for specialty metals had some  weaknesses. For example, a DOD program office that was in the final  steps of submitting a national security waiver told us they had difficulty in  determining what documentation to include with their waiver request. We  also found that the DFARS guidance at the time that the existing waivers  were submitted did not specify the types of documents required from the  requesting program office to support a waiver request. In June 2014, USD  AT&L developed written guidance for program offices to include how and  when the noncompliance was discovered, a complete description of all of  the items or systems containing noncompliant specialty metals, the  manufacturer and country of origin of the noncompliant material\u2014if  known, and estimated cost and schedule estimates to replace the  noncompliant parts if a national security waiver is not granted. This DOD  guidance also requires the disclosure of whether the specialty metals  DFARS clause was flowed down to subcontractors and whether safety  and operational implications exist. In addition, to prevent  misinterpretation of the current flow down requirement, DOD recently  proposed amending the specialty metals DFARS clause to clarify the  current requirement that the specialty metals restrictions be flowed down  in subcontracts.

According to a deputy director within DCMA\u2019s Industrial Analysis Center,  reports such as this were possibly disseminated throughout DCMA, and  he stated DCMA staff may have shared these reports with the program  offices to which they were assigned. In November 2013, DOD  discontinued these reports. Continued disseminations of this type of  information and sharing them among the DOD weapon system programs  and their supplier-base could heighten awareness, potentially averting  future noncompliance with the specialty metals\u2019 restriction. Further,  GAO\u2019s prior work in October 2008 concluded that DOD often becomes  aware of supplier base problems through informal channels, and greater  visibility of supply chain issues or vulnerabilities could contribute to more  formal mechanisms for addressing supply chain risks. We  recommended that DOD create and disseminate written requirements for  reporting potential concerns about supplier-base gaps. DOD addressed  this recommendation, and in its most recent instruction on Defense  Industrial Base Assessments, dated July 2014, it states that if an  industrial capability is identified as endangered, DOD components must,  among other things, validate whether the industrial capability is relevant  to a satisfaction of a national security requirement. This instruction also  states that to facilitate efficient and effective sharing, a repository of  reports, information, and data will be established by DOD and will contain  a searchable index of reports. Moreover, DOD\u2019s 2014 Chief Freedom of  Information Act Officer\u2019s Report to the Department of Justice states that  the department continues to implement open government principles as  defined by an Office of Management and Budget memorandum, which  encourages greater transparency, participation and collaboration by  publishing non-sensitive government information online for public  review. Establishing a mechanism to disseminate non-sensitive  information\u2014including the names of programs that received waivers,  sources of the noncompliant specialty metals, and corrective actions\u2014to  key stakeholders, such as DOD weapon system program offices and their  defense suppliers\u2014could help raise awareness of and greater  compliance with the specialty metals restrictions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD relies on its prime contractors and subcontractors to plan for and  ensure that specialty metals procured for weapon systems meet the  requirements of the specialty metal statutory provisions and contractor  self-disclosure is the primary way that DOD becomes aware of  noncompliance with this statutory provision. Some recent breaches of  domestic source restrictions have led contractors to notify the government  of noncompliance issues and since these instances occurred, DOD has  granted national security waivers for the affected programs. DOD has  recently defined procedures for requesting national security waivers for  weapon systems programs. However, DOD\u2019s lack of a mechanism to  disseminate information to its key stakeholders within the department\u2019s  weapon system program offices and their supplier-base on national  security waivers granted makes it difficult for others not directly involved  with the waiver request to have awareness of the risks as well as the  consequences. Further, greater awareness of supplier-base problems  and broader dissemination of information could assist DOD in better  discovering vulnerabilities, such as systemic supply chain risks that affect  national security objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide greater awareness of and compliance with the specialty metal  restrictions among DOD weapon system programs and their defense  supplier-base, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense establish a  mechanism for sharing and distributing non-sensitive information about  national security waivers throughout the department and the defense  supplier-base."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report, which  are reprinted in appendix III. In its comments, DOD concurred with our  recommendation to provide greater awareness of and compliance with  the specialty metal restrictions, stating that it will post non-sensitive  specialty metals national security waiver information on the Defense  Procurement and Acquisition Policy website. This publicly available  information would include the number of national security waivers  approved by DOD since 2009; the names of DOD weapon system  programs receiving them; guidance on how to request a national security  waiver, as well as guidance for applying specialty metals\u2019 restrictions to  high performance samarium-cobalt magnets. We believe that this is a  positive step towards enhancing the public transparency of future national  security waivers for non-compliant specialty metals. DOD is considering  resuming the issuance of notification reports when a specialty metals\u2019  noncompliance has occurred. We believe that disseminating this  information across DOD could help officials working on other DOD  programs assess whether similar non-compliance issues may affect  them.

Specifically, we assessed (1) how DOD meets its  needs for specialty metals parts and ensures compliance with the  specialty metals restrictions, and (2) DOD\u2019s process for providing national  security waivers for specialty metal procurements and the extent to which  it disseminates waiver information throughout the department.", "To assess how DOD officials meet their needs for specialty metals used  in DOD weapon systems and ensure compliance with specialty metals  restrictions, we examined laws and regulations regarding specialty metals  domestic source restrictions, including the Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement (DFARS) and DOD guidance relating to planning  for and compliance with specialty metals and related requirements of the  Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). We reviewed DOD guidance on  planning for weapon systems procurements and manufacturing; guidance  on purchasing system reviews and quality assurance from the Defense  Contract Management Agency and U.S. Navy Supervisors of  Shipbuilding, Conversion and Repair; Defense Logistics Agency\u2019s reports  on strategic and critical materials that identified materials with projected  availability risks; and U.S. Geological Survey\u2019s price information for  titanium to identify historical fluctuations in pricing and availability for  specialty metals. We also interviewed officials from DOD, including the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and  Logistics (USD AT&L), the Defense Contract Management Agency  (DCMA), and selected weapon system programs, as well as their prime  contractors, two selected subcontractors, and specialty metals company  representatives. We ascertained their roles in determining the needs for  specialty metals parts and monitoring compliance with specialty metals  restrictions and related requirements of the FAR and the DFARS. We  also interviewed and obtained written responses to questions on specialty  metals planning from six prime contractors responsible for five major  DOD weapon systems programs,. The programs we selected were: the F- 35 Joint Strike Fighter (Joint Strike Fighter), KC-46 Tanker, DDG-51  Destroyer, Virginia Class Submarine, and Family of Medium Tactical  Vehicles, to identify how these programs plan for specialty metals needs  and ensure contract requirements are met. We selected a non- generalizable sample consisting of these five DOD weapon system  programs, based on their greatest total acquisition cost estimates as of  November 2013. Our selection process also ensured that at least one  program was selected from among each of the military services and from  the following four acquisition lifecycle phases: (1) between development  start and production start (e.g., the U.S. Air Force\u2019s KC-46 Tanker); (2)  between production start and initial capability (e.g., DOD\u2019s Joint Strike  Fighter); (3) in production and passed initial capability (e.g., the U.S.  Navy\u2019s DDG-51 Destroyer and Virginia Class Submarine); and (4) nearing  the end of production (e.g., the U.S. Army\u2019s Family of Medium Tactical  Vehicles). We interviewed and obtained written responses to questions  and related contractor documents from these prime contractors regarding  specialty metals availability, planning activities on these programs, and  the methods they use to ensure quality assurance and oversee  subcontractors and suppliers. Our findings from these five programs  cannot be generalized to all programs, but they provide useful insights  into how DOD officials and contractors work to address requirements  associated with specialty metal restrictions.", "In reviewing these programs, we also obtained answers to written  questions regarding specialty metals planning and quality assurance from  DOD quality assurance staff overseeing these programs, including the  Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and the Navy. We  reviewed the results of DOD\u2019s purchasing system reviews for the six  prime contractors in our review to determine whether specialty metals  requirements were flowed down to subcontractors consistent with  DFARS. We also reviewed written responses to questions regarding how  these agencies oversee the prime contractors to help ensure compliance  with their government contracts, including specialty metals domestic  source restrictions. Further, we reviewed the contracts to determine what  requirements related to specialty metals planning and quality assurance  were included, as well as the exceptions to domestic source restrictions  applicable to some of these programs, such as the KC-46 Tanker\u2019s  commercial derivative military article exception. We obtained updated  information regarding these methods from the prime contractors included  in our review.", "We reviewed and analyzed the six national security waivers that the USD  AT&L approved from fiscal years 2009 through 2014. These six national  security waivers included the B-1 Bomber Reliability and Maintainability  Improvement Program, F-16 Block 52 Aircraft, Ground/Air Task Oriented  Radar, Joint Strike Fighter radar and target assemblies parts for  positioning external doors, nose and main landing gear, and Standard  Missile-3 Block II-A All Up Rounds. We also assessed whether these  waivers contained required elements, including whether Congress was  provided advance notifications of the national security waiver  determinations before they were executed as required in accordance with  the statue and regulation. In addition, we obtained documents and  interviewed officials from DOD\u2019s Defense Procurement and Acquisition  Policy office to review their process for granting national security waivers,  including how they make determinations to grant the six waivers for  national security and the extent to which DOD disseminates this  information throughout the department. We assessed the extent to which  DOD disseminates information on national security waivers it has granted  consistent with criteria in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. We reviewed prime contractor and subcontractor corrective  action plans that were submitted to DCMA regarding noncompliant  specialty metals and also examined the congressional notification letters  relating to national security waivers that DOD provided to congressional  defense committees. We met with officials at the C-130 program office at  Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio to discuss possible  plans to request a national security waiver and to discuss their experience  in requesting a national security waiver. We did not assess whether other  exceptions to the specialty metals restrictions were available under the  facts and circumstances present for these waivers we reviewed.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2013 to October  2014 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
