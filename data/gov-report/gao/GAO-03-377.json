Two provisions in Title I--maintenance of effort (MOE) and supplement not supplant (SNS)--are designed to limit the extent to which federal funds could be used to replace state and local resources. To assess the quality of oversight of these provisions, GAO determined (1) how 6 states--Arizona, California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, and Massachusetts--conducted oversight of the MOE and SNS provisions and what factors affected their ability to do so; (2) what efforts were made by the U.S. Department of Education to enforce MOE and SNS; and (3) in the 6 states, what changes have occurred in the federal share of education funding from school year 1999-2000 to 2000-2001."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In the states we visited, state program officials used three tools--the states' annual financial reports, the single audit process, and limited program monitoring--to oversee Title I's fiscal accountability requirements. While program officials had little difficulty in applying the MOE provision because it involves a straightforward calculation, state and local program officials and auditors we spoke with cited a number of factors that made it difficult to enforce the SNS provision under certain circumstances. One of the challenges auditors faced was determining whether a school district would have removed its own funds from a program and allocated them elsewhere even if federal funds had not been available--an action that is allowable. Another challenge was applying the SNS provision in circumstances where it is difficult to track federal dollars such as in schoolwide programs--where all funds are pooled--or in districts undergoing significant districtwide reforms--where comparisons to previous budgets are problematic. While some auditors struggled to apply the SNS provision to the particular circumstance of districts and schools, program officials relied primarily on the results of the single audits without being aware of some of these audit's limitations. For example, some officials did not understand that not all districts, programs, or transactions may be covered by the audit. While program monitoring adds a degree of depth to the efforts to oversee the SNS provision, most of the states in GAO's review conducted only limited program monitoring. We identified three key efforts Education made to guide, monitor, and enforce the fiscal accountability provisions, but each had limitations. First, Education provided guidance and technical assistance to state and local education agencies and auditors on how to interpret and apply Title I's fiscal accountability requirements. Despite the availability of this guidance, many of the auditors and program officials we spoke with expressed confusion regarding the application of these provisions to their particular circumstances, such as schoolwide programs. Second, Education conducted program monitoring of select state and local education programs each year; however, coverage was limited. Third, Education, reviewed the audit reports conducted under the Single Audit Act. However, Education's Office of Inspector General and GAO have criticized the review and audit follow up process. Few changes occurred in the federal/state/local fiscal partnership in financing education services between school year 1999-2000 and 2000-2001. It is too soon to tell how recent increases in federal funds and state and local fiscal pressures will affect funding for education and the federal share."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On January 8, 2002, the President signed the No Child Left Behind Act  (NCLB) of 2001 into law. NCLB amends the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act (ESEA) of 1965 and reauthorizes many federal aid  programs for elementary and secondary education. ESEA\u2019s Title I program  is the largest federal elementary and secondary education program,  providing about $10.4 billion to benefit 11 million low-income and  disadvantaged students in about 45,000 schools nationwide in 2002. Title I  funds are distributed by formula from the federal government to state  education agencies (SEA), which then pass through most of these funds to  their local education agencies (LEA). LEAs use these funds to operate two  types of Title I programs\u2014targeted assistance programs, which target  funds only to qualified low-income children who meet Title I eligibility  requirements, and schoolwide programs, which pool funds to help all  students in a school improve their performance.", "Under NCLB, federal funds for elementary and secondary education have  grown substantially; for example, Title I grew 30 percent from $8 billion in  1999 to $10.4 billion in 2002. These new resources for federal education  programs come at the same time that states and school districts face  difficult funding choices as they struggle to address budget shortfalls  resulting from economic downturns and other requirements, (i.e.,  homeland security.) These shortfalls heighten the risk that state and  school district officials will use federal resources to replace their own  funds. Two provisions in the act limit the extent to which states and LEAs  can do that. First, a maintenance of effort (MOE) provision requires that  an LEA maintain at least 90 percent of its aggregate state and local  education expenditures or its per student expenditures for the preceding  year as a condition for receiving any federal Title I grant funds; this  provision limits the amount of fiscal relief a grantee can achieve by  substituting federal funds for its own by requiring local education agencies  to sustain their own funding levels for education programs in the  aggregate. Second, a supplement-not-supplant (SNS) provision requires  grant recipients to use federal funds to supplement the amount of funds  that would, in the absence of such federal funds, be made available from  nonfederal sources; this provision limits substitution of federal funds for  state/local funds at the school\u2014or program\u2014level by preventing LEA\u2019s  from reallocating funds for specific activities. Some have raised concerns  about whether these provisions are adequately enforced either by the  Department of Education, which is responsible for monitoring the SEAs,  or the SEAs, which are responsible for monitoring LEAs.", "Federal grant management policies require SEAs to take the responsibility  for ensuring that their LEAs comply with federal laws and regulations.  States must  identify to the LEAs all applicable compliance requirements,    monitor LEA activities to provide reasonable assurance that the LEA is in  compliance with federal requirements, and    ensure required audits are performed and require that LEAs take prompt  corrective action on any audit findings.", "Federal grant recipients that spend more than $300,000 in federal awards  in any given year must undertake a single audit as required under the  Single Audit Act (Single Audit Act), as amended. Many grant recipients  spend funds from a number of federal programs, and the single audit  focuses audit resources on a federal grant recipient\u2019s internal controls  which covers an entity\u2019s process over its operations and financial  reporting. In addressing compliance issues, the single audit reviews only  selected provisions of laws and regulations that have a direct and material  effect governing selected federal awards. This is in contrast to the more  detailed transactional auditing that was conducted under program-specific  audits.", "To better assess the adequacy of oversight of the fiscal accountability  provisions, you asked us to determine (1) how selected states ensure  compliance with both the MOE and the SNS provisions and what factors  affect their ability to do so; (2) what efforts were made by Education to  enforce these provisions and what limitations, if any, did these efforts  have; and (3) in selected states what changes occurred between school  year 1999-2000 and 2000-2001 in the federal share of education  expenditures and, in 2000-2001, what share of the SEA operating  expenditures were financed with federal funds.", "As agreed, we focused on six states and six local school districts. We  reviewed guidance on the fiscal accountability provisions developed by  the SEAs, and we reviewed both SEA and LEA budgets and financial  statements for school year 1999-2000 and 2000-2001. We interviewed state  and local program officials, school district administrators, and their  auditors about their roles and responsibilities for enforcing the fiscal  accountability provisions and reviewed the auditors\u2019 workpapers. We  interviewed officials at Education and reviewed Education\u2019s guidance and  regulations on these two fiscal accountability provisions. We also asked  finance officers from the six SEAs to provide us with comparable  information on total funding for education and the federal share of  resources used to finance the SEA\u2019s operating costs. We conducted our  work between July 2002 and January 2003 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

The states then pass through most of these funds to  their school districts after retaining some funds\u2014up to 1.5 percent\u2014for  state administration and state-level school improvement activities.

As long as priority is given to schools with the highest  concentration of children from low-income families, LEAs are generally  free to designate which schools, among those eligible, receive funds and  how much each should get. LEAs can also select the type of framework  through which they deliver Title I services. Some districts have only  targeted assistance in their Title I schools, some only have schoolwide  programs, and others have a mixture of both. When Title I began, all  schools administered targeted assistance programs. These programs  targeted funds and services\u2014such as teachers and materials\u2014to specific  qualified students who met Title I eligibility requirements. In 1978, a  limited number of schools were allowed to deliver the services in the form  of schoolwide programs if 75 percent or more of their student population  was poor. Schools choosing to operate schoolwide programs can combine  federal resources with other funds to improve the school as a whole and  help all students achieve. In subsequent reauthorizations, the schoolwide  option was made available to more schools by lowering the threshold  percentage of low-income children required to operate a schoolwide  program. NCLB allows schoolwide programs in schools with a poverty  rate of 40 percent or more.", "During the mid-1990s there was a trend toward providing more flexibility  to state and local recipients of federal grants so they may operate  programs that best serve the needs of their communities. This trend  towards flexibility is evident, not only in education programs such as Title  I, but in many social service programs and health programs. In these  circumstances, we have found that new approaches to ensuring  accountability need to be designed to achieve a balance between flexibility  and accountability for attaining certain national objectives. In 2001, we  reported on some of the challenges in maintaining a federal-state fiscal  partnership in welfare reform and concluded that a broad-based  maintenance of effort requirement calling for states to maintain spending  across a wide range of relevant programs might both limit substitution of  state funds while at the same time preserve state and local flexibility  better than a traditional supplement-non-supplant requirement.  Specifically, we found that, once accountability shifts to the broad  purposes of the grant, federal fiscal oversight needed to shift as well and  focus not only on the specifics of welfare funding but also on how states  used multiple funding streams\u2014federal, state, and local\u2014to accomplish  the program\u2019s broad goals. These findings could apply to the Title I  program because schoolwide program goals are broader than the goals of  a targeted assistance program and schoolwide programs combine funding  streams."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Title I Fiscal Accountability Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Title I contains three fiscal requirements that grantees must comply with  in order to continue to receive Title I funds from one year to the next.

For example, the  MOE requirement applies only to the LEA not to individual Title I schools.  The Comparability requirement is evaluated at the school level because it  seeks to weigh the services provided in Title I schools with those provided  in non-Title I schools. In contrast, the SNS provision is applied differently  depending on how Title I services are applied. It is applied to the program  or the student in targeted assistance programs to ensure that those  targeted programs are providing more services for a Title I student than  non-Title I students receive, or it is applied to the school if it operates a  schoolwide program.

SEA officials relied primarily on the single audit process to  enforce the SNS provisions. But, many state and local program officials  and auditors we spoke with cited a number of factors that made it difficult  to ensure that grantees were in fact using federal funds to supplement and  not supplant their own funds. These factors include difficulties applying  the SNS provision to unique circumstances in their school districts,  reliance on the single audit to ensure compliance without understanding  its scope and methodology, and limited state and local program oversight  of the fiscal accountability provisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The SNS Provision Is Difficult to Apply in Many Circumstances", "paragraphs": ["It can be difficult for auditors to establish a finding of supplantation. One  of the challenges auditors face in evaluating compliance with the SNS  requirement is determining the basis for the states\u2019 and LEAs\u2019 funding  decisions. The SNS requirement generally prohibits replacing state funds  with federal funds where the displaced state funds could continue to be  available for their original purpose. However, under certain  circumstances, where state funding is discontinued, grantees may be able  to replace these eliminated funds with Title I dollars. For example, if an  SEA or LEA discontinued its own support for a particular program in  response to a potential budget deficit, the use of Title I funds may be  permissible. The challenge for auditors in deciding if an LEA has  improperly supplanted, is determining what the LEA would have done in  the absence of federal funds. For example, where a state reduces its own  financial support for a program and uses federal funds instead, an auditor  may presume supplanting has occurred; but, a grantee could rebut that  presumption by presenting evidence that fiscal stress required state  budget cuts that might not have otherwise been considered. The statute  also permits states to use Title I funds to replace state or local funds that  had been expended for a program meeting a Title I purpose by allowing  such supplemental state funds to be excluded from the SNS compliance  determination. In other words, an LEA is allowed to shift funds from one  state or locally funded program targeted to low-income children,  substitute federal funds for that program, and move its own funds to other  priorities for disadvantaged children.", "Even if auditors could determine what a grantee would have done if it had  not received federal funds, the way that Title I services are delivered can  also make it difficult to apply the SNS provisions. Table 1 summarizes the  relationships between the different ways programs are delivered\u2014 targeted assistance, schoolwide programs, and districtwide reforms and  the application of the fiscal accountability provisions.", "For schoolwide programs the distinction between state/local funds and  federal funds\u2014and hence the notion of supplantation\u2014becomes unclear.  In general, when services are delivered through schoolwide programs,  federal, state, and local funds are pooled, making it impossible to  distinguish among funding streams in an audit because a schoolwide  school does not have to (1) show that Title I funds are paying for  additional services, (2) demonstrate that Title I funds are used only for  specific target populations, or (3) separately track federal program funds  once they reach the school. While one can identify the separate funding  sources going into a school one cannot identify what services they funded.  Therefore, for schoolwide programs a test for SNS compliance could  include either (1) a comparison from one year to the next of total\u2014 federal, state, and local\u2014funds allocated to a Title I school or (2) a  comparison of state and local funds spent in Title I schools and non-Title I  schools.", "However, there are problems applying either test to schoolwide programs.  For example, in the Glendale (Arizona) Elementary School District, every  school is a Title I school and all schools operate schoolwide programs.  District officials argued that because the district met its MOE requirement  (in 2000-2001 it exceeded 100 percent of its preceding years expenditures),  it did not need a separate internal control procedure to test for SNS.  However, auditors cited the district for not having such a procedure. Our  analysis shows that, for districts such as Glendale, in order to avoid  supplanting funds, the district would have to maintain the same state and  local funding from year to year. In other words, in districts where every  school is a Title I school and all schools operate a schoolwide program,  they would have to maintain a much higher MOE requirement,   100 percent, than districts that are not in this circumstance in order to  avoid supplanting funds unless they otherwise would not have spent those  funds.", "Moreover, comparing expenditures from one year to the next in school  districts where there are both targeted assistance and schoolwide schools  presents challenges. Since schoolwide program administrators can  reallocate funds among programs in their schools, they can engage in  budgetary practices that are not allowed in a targeted assistance school in  the same district. Theoretically, the SNS provision imposes a higher  expectation on schools operating schoolwide programs than it does on  their targeted assistance counterparts because a year-to-year funding  comparison essentially requires a schoolwide school to maintain 100  percent of its previous effort in order to comply with the SNS provision.", "Furthermore, comparing the allocation of state/local funds among schools  in the same year also presents challenges. For example, in Duval County  (Florida) all 72 of the district\u2019s Title I schools operate schoolwide  programs but not all schools were Title I schools. Duval\u2019s auditors  assessed compliance with SNS by comparing the per pupil expenditure of  state and local funds in Title I schools to the allocation in non-Title I  schools within the same year. They found that in 2001, 5 of the district\u2019s   72 Title I schools received significantly less state and local funding per  pupil than the average school received, resulting in questioned costs of  $2.5 million. The auditors suspected that the district may have used federal  Title I funds in place of state and local funds in these schools, but district  officials claimed that many mitigating factors, such as higher teacher  salaries for more experienced teachers, could explain variations in the per  pupil expenditures among schools in the same district. The SEA  determined that the information presented in the audit report was not  sufficient to determine that supplanting occurred. SEA officials told us  that auditors would need to have programmatic expertise to interpret the  results of the per pupil cost comparisons in order to prove that  supplantation had occurred. The auditors agreed that many factors could  have contributed to the observed disparity in funding among the 5 Title I  schools, but they said there were limitations to what could be expected of  a single audit and pointed out that ultimately the SEA should use the audit  findings as a basis for determining whether the LEA is in compliance or  not.", "Finally, when a district engages in comprehensive districtwide reform  resulting in programmatic changes, it can be difficult to make the types of  comparisons necessary to determine compliance with SNS, particularly in  the first year of reforms. For example, in 2000, San Diego City (California)", "Unified School District (USD) began school reform that entailed financing  new initiatives. As these reforms were implemented, the district and its  programs were restructured in such a way that there were no longer  points of comparison for determining whether the district was in  compliance with the SNS provision. In other words, funding for programs  in the current school year could not be compared with funding for those in  the previous year, because the programs had not previously existed. The  Superintendent of the San Diego City USD told us that the reform plan  could not have been implemented without the flexibility to reallocate  resources within and among schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Officials Rely on the Single Audit, without Understanding What Its Scope and Methodology Mean for Assessing the SNS Provision", "paragraphs": ["While some auditors struggled to apply the SNS provision to the particular  circumstance of districts and schools, SEA officials were frequently  unaware of what the results of a single audit actually meant, potentially  failing to cover key programs or provisions of law, and thus adding to the  difficulty of enforcing the SNS provision. For example, numerous state  and local program officials told us that they assumed that the single audit  covered every LEA and every program, even though this is not what single  audits are designed to do. As a result, these officials may not engage in  other oversight activities that are warranted. Because only those grant  recipients that spend more than $300,000 in federal awards in any given  year must undertake a single audit, not all LEAs that receive Title I funds  are required to undergo one. Furthermore, even if an LEA is audited, the  Title I program may not be covered in the audit. The 1996 amendments to  the Single Audit Act give auditors more freedom to determine which  federal programs to include in their audit plan each year, allowing them to  exclude some programs based on risk-based criteria and on expenditure- based criteria. Many of the auditors we spoke with assessed risk by  determining whether or not there had been findings of noncompliance in  recent audits. For example, if an LEA had a clean audit with respect to the  Title I program for the last few years, an auditor might legitimately view  the inherent risk of this program as low and exclude it from the audit in  the next year. Auditors for both San Diego City (California) USD and  Jefferson Parish (Louisiana) Public Schools told us that Title I probably  would not be covered in the districts\u2019 2002 single audit since there have  been no recent findings on the program.", "In addition, some officials thought that the single audit examined every  transaction, even though it does not. As a result, officials may think that by  fixing the instances reported they are solving all the problems, when in  fact those problems may be more widespread. Generally accepted  government auditing standards allow statistical sampling methods and  auditors often use audit sampling to evaluate compliance with applicable  requirements. This involves testing less than 100 percent of the items  within a group of transactions for the purpose of evaluating compliance  with applicable laws and regulations. Transactions could be randomly  selected from all of the auditee\u2019s financial transactions for the year under  review. While this technique allows auditors to test the population of  transactions for evidence of noncompliance and internal control  weaknesses, it will not identify every specific instance of noncompliance.  When auditors of Douglas (Arizona) USD identified significant internal  control weaknesses based on analysis of a sample of the district\u2019s financial  they reported that their review of the district\u2019s internal controls would not  necessarily disclose all instances of non-compliance.  However, the SEA  resolved the issue by requiring the auditee to reimburse the Title I program  for the amount of the transaction under question only and did not further  investigate if there were other erroneous payments made.", "While there were problems with program officials understanding what  single audits are and what results from the single audit meant, in general  the auditors\u2019 work plans we reviewed followed the guidance  recommended by Education and OMB for single audits. However, some of  the auditors could not document that they had followed their work plans.  For example, audit workpapers for San Diego City (California) USD show  that auditors held a discussion with a district budget official who told the  auditors that they were in compliance with the SNS provision, but the  workpapers did not indicate independent verification of these claims.", "In five of the six states we reviewed, the SEA had a procedure in place to  resolve audit findings reported through the single audit process. However,  in 2001 the Louisiana Legislative Auditor reported in its statewide single  audit that the SEA did not have adequate internal controls to monitor  subrecipients for compliance with many federal education programs,  including Title I.

While program  monitoring provided a depth of coverage that cannot be achieved in single  audits, these efforts were limited. Furthermore, in all of the states we  visited, the primary focus of any additional monitoring activities has now  centered on addressing efforts to raise the level of student achievement  with considerably less focus given to fiscal accountability requirements.  Informal monitoring by individuals and groups augmented the formal  monitoring process.", "Limited program monitoring also took place during the application review  process. In all of the states we visited, the annual application process for  Title I funding contains questions on historic and proposed program  budget information that can be used by program officials in the SEA to  oversee compliance with SNS and MOE. In addition, some states require  LEAs to complete a self-assessment document in which they are asked to  assess themselves on their compliance with federal program requirements.  SEAs use these self-assessment documents for various purposes. For  example, in Florida, annual self-assessments were used as a self- monitoring tool, but only one-quarter of the LEAs were required to  actually send in the completed guide for review in any given year. In  Arizona, the tool was also required annually and is designed to provide  guidance in program development and to identify areas in which technical  assistance may be needed. In California, LEAs must complete self- assessments once every 4 years, at which time SEA officials evaluate the  self-assessment documents and use them to target their on-site monitoring  activities to those LEAs that pose the highest risks.", "While four of the six states we visited followed up LEAs\u2019 self-assessments  with on-site visits, the extent to which they conducted such visits varied  and, in some cases, was limited. Massachusetts and Arizona have  scheduled on-site monitoring visits in the LEAs at least once every 6 years.", "In Louisiana, state officials said that each LEA is visited once every   3 years. In California, while each LEA must go through the review cycle  every 4 years. In addition, in 2001 two of the six states we visited, Florida  and Indiana, did not follow up on the self-assessments with periodic on- site program monitoring.", "Several state officials highlighted the importance of informal monitoring  networks, such as parents groups, in raising issues of noncompliance.  These watchdog groups play an informal role in questioning inappropriate  spending and submitting complaints to the school boards and, if they feel  their concerns are not addressed at this level, elevating the issues to the  SEA. SEA officials in both Indiana and California discussed recent  inquiries that were brought to their attention, not through single audit  reports or even program monitoring efforts, but rather by informal  watchdog groups. In Indiana, the issues raised dealt with unallowable  costs and high administrative charges to federal programs in one school;  the SEA is investigating and, according to state officials, the matter is still  unresolved. In California, a parents group in San Diego filed a complaint  with the California Department of Education citing issues relating to,  among other things, the reallocation of state and federal funding, including  Title I funds, by the San Diego City (California) USD to fund its  districtwide school reform strategy which, the watchdog group claimed,  no longer provides a comparable level of service to all students with state  and local funding. The SEA concurred and ordered the district to develop  a plan to allocate the state and local supplemental funds that complies  with all the federal comparability provisions. However, Education granted  the district a waiver in August 2002 which will allow the district to proceed  with the reform strategy under its current budget plan for 1 year."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Education\u2019s Key Efforts to Enforce Fiscal Accountability Provisions Have Limitations", "paragraphs": ["We identified three key efforts the Department of Education made to help  enforce the fiscal accountability provisions but each had limitations.

While comparability is primarily  used to ensure that services\u2014not funding\u2014is comparable across schools  in the LEA, the two issues are closely related and frequently confused. For  example, guidance issued by the SEA in Arizona on the comparability  requirement states that comparability is used to ensure that schools within  an LEA do not supplant state and local funds with federal program funds.  Operating under the same misconception, Indianapolis Public Schools  incorrectly used the comparability test as the internal control to ensure  compliance with SNS. Moreover, the district\u2019s auditors failed to question  the appropriateness of this test to ensure compliance with SNS. A similar  confusion was evident when officials in the Duval County Public Schools  told auditors that they could not understand how they failed to comply  with the prohibition on supplantation, given that they had not cut back on  their own overall spending thereby meeting their MOE requirements and  had documented meeting their comparability requirement.", "Education recognizes that there is some confusion about the application  of the provisions.

However, only 1 of the 9 indicators Education\u2019s  monitors used in integrated reviews focused on fiscal issues; the rest  focused on program performance, such as whether the state supported  and promoted high standards for all children, and whether states used  education research findings to inform decision making. Education\u2019s  Inspector General criticized this approach to program reviews in 2001  because the integrated approach allotted insufficient time to monitor  specific programs for compliance with federal laws and regulations. The  Inspector General also found that the various teams of reviewers lacked  knowledge of the single audit process, thereby taking inconsistent  approaches to doing the reviews.", "In 2002 Education drafted guidelines for its monitors to use in a new  approach to program monitoring, but we found that the new approach  gives fiscal accountability requirements little emphasis and it does not  even mention SNS.

SEA operations include the administration of programs\u2014primarily  oversight, technical assistance, and training\u2014related to specific federal  programs operated at the local level. SEAs may also operate state-level  programs, such as vocational rehabilitation. As we noted in a previous  report, the level of federal support for SEA operations varied widely  among states depending on the number and types of federal and state  programs the SEA operates, ranging in fiscal year 1993 from about 10 to  about 80 percent, with the average level of support being 41 percent. To  update this information, we looked at the federal share of SEA funding in  the six states we visited for school year 1999-2000. As in the past, we found  the federal share varied, from 18 percent in Florida to 43 percent in  Indiana. (See the shaded bars in fig. 3.)", "Another way to look at the federal share of SEA operating costs is through  the number of full-time equivalent positions (FTEs) that are funded by  federal funds. Some states operate federal programs at the state level,  such as vocational rehabilitation and disability determination. These may  require many more SEA FTEs than programs operated at the local level.  For example, in 2000-2001, the Florida SEA assumed responsibility for the  federal vocational rehabilitation programs that were previously housed in  another state department, adding more than 1,000 positions to the SEA  and raising its percent of federally funded FTEs from 43 percent to   63 percent.", "Finally, table 2 provides some additional context when making  comparisons and contrasts among the states we visited.

Additional  oversight is always necessary to ensure that grantees are in compliance  with the laws and regulations governing specific programs and grant  management in general. Single audits should inform, not substitute for  program monitoring. However, as we have noted, many state officials told  us that they relied primarily on the single audits to oversee compliance  with federal laws and regulations. Because of this reliance, state program  officials responsible for overseeing this program must have a better  understanding of the scope and limitations of these audits and supplement  the audits with more effective and frequent oversight activities. Instances  of noncompliance found in the course of a single audit should trigger a  broader search to determine whether the error is systemic.", "While NCLB emphasizes achieving higher student achievement levels,  enforcing fiscal accountability is and will remain a critically important  oversight activity. Resources for audit and evaluation activities will remain  limited, and, as a result, these resources must be targeted where they will  have the greatest impact. As we have noted, ensuring compliance with an  MOE provision presents few challenges and requires few additional audit  resources, whereas monitoring the SNS provision is very challenging and  requires significant audit resources.", "Maintaining the intergovernmental fiscal partnership in the education of  disadvantaged and low-income students presents many challenges. Title I\u2019s  two fiscal accountability provisions\u2014the MOE and the SNS provisions\u2014 are intended to limit the extent that grantees can use federal funds to  replace their own and thereby erode the fiscal partnership. But each  provision helps to maintain the fiscal balance in very different ways and at  different levels\u2014schools versus districts. The primary effect of a  nonsupplant provision is to prevent the reallocation of state and local  resources within a Title I school; essentially, that means that expenditures  paid for with state and local resources in a Title I school in one year  cannot be paid for with federal funds the next year. On the other hand, the  MOE provision\u2019s primary effect is to limit the extent to which states and  LEAs can use federal funds for general fiscal relief; that is, substituting  federal funds for state and local funds generally, not just in Title I schools.  As noted, in schoolwide programs grantees are not required to show that  Title I funds are paying for additional services or are targeted to specific  students, nor are they required to separately track federal program funds  with other funds once they reach the school, thus \u201climiting the reallocation  of resources\u201d becomes unworkable in a schoolwide setting.", "An inherent tension exists between fostering a flexible grant environment  and ensuring fiscal accountability. For broader purpose grants, such as  schoolwide programs, the SNS provision can work to constrain local  flexibility in the use of federal funds by preventing districts from  reallocating the use of federal, state, and local funds. Moreover, the  provision is difficult to apply and can be very challenging to monitor and  enforce, primarily because it is not workable in those environments. As we  have previously reported, in flexible grant environments a strong MOE  provision may prove more useful than an SNS provision in limiting the  degree to which grantees can use federal funds to simply reduce their  overall fiscal commitments.", "That different parties would have different views of the value of the  nonsupplant provisions is to be expected. Some argue that allowing  supplantation of any kind increases the likelihood that states could  weaken their commitment to educating disadvantaged children and  diminish the fiscal impact of the federal grant. Potentially, supplantation  allows the SEAs and LEAs to convert the federal Title I grant into a kind of  revenue sharing program with very little incremental impact on education  spending. Others would point to periodic changes to the Title I program  allowing more schools to participate as schoolwide programs, suggesting  that the Congress may be trying to encourage more flexible use of Title I  funds to improve the quality of education for disadvantaged students and  raise student achievement levels for all students, including low-income  students. Furthermore, in times of fiscal stress and greater needs in  educating the disadvantaged, the reallocation of resources within and  among schools may be the only way to finance comprehensive  districtwide reform efforts. A nonsupplant provision could stymie those  districts that need more flexibility to attempt such reforms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To better align its expectations for accountability with Title I schoolwide  program goals, the Congress should consider eliminating the SNS  requirement for schoolwide programs.

Education cited recent  supplanting violations found by Title I monitoring staff to show that it was  possible to assess supplantation in a schoolwide setting. However,  according to an Education official, these findings were not for schoolwide  programs.", "Education says that the loss of the SNS requirement would not be  completely offset by an enhanced MOE requirement because it would shift  responsibility for fiscal accountability from the school to the district level.   However, our review shows that the current requirement is unworkable in  a schoolwide setting. As we said, while one can identify the separate  funding sources going into a school, one cannot identify what services  they funded in a schoolwide setting because federal, state, and local funds  are pooled. In contrast, an MOE requirement is easier to measure, identify,  and track, and therefore better promotes fiscal accountability in these  settings. If Congress considers eliminating the SNS provision, we believe  that enhancing the MOE requirement is a reasonable tradeoff.
