We provided  each of the agencies with our definition of a STEM education program  and asked agency officials to identify programs funded in fiscal year 2016  that met this definition (see text box). We also asked agency officials to  provide information on the status of the 209 STEM education programs  we included in our previous report on STEM education programs.  Specifically, we asked whether the programs were funded in fiscal year  2016 and, if not, whether they were consolidated or terminated.", "Definition of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Program  GAO defined \u201cSTEM education program\u201d as a program funded by allocation or congressional appropriation. An organized set of  activities was considered a single program even when its funds were also allocated to other programs. A STEM education program  that met the definition had one or more of the following as a primary objective:  attract or prepare students to pursue classes or coursework in STEM areas through formal or informal education activities  (informal education programs provide support for activities that offer students learning opportunities outside of formal schooling  through contests, science fairs, summer programs, and other means; outreach programs aimed at the general public were not  included);  attract students to pursue degrees (2-year, 4-year, graduate, or doctoral degrees) in STEM fields through formal or informal  education activities;  provide training opportunities for undergraduate or graduate students in STEM fields (this can include grants, fellowships,  internships, and traineeships that are intended for students; general research grants that involve hiring a student for  lab work  were not considered a STEM education program);  attract graduates to pursue careers in STEM fields;  improve teacher (preservice or in-service) education in STEM fields;  improve or expand the capacity of K-12 schools or postsecondary institutions to promote or foster education in STEM fields; and   conduct research to enhance the quality of STEM education programs provided to students.", "Programs designed to retain current employees in STEM fields were not included. Programs that fund retraining of workers to pursue a  degree in a STEM field were included because these programs help increase the number of students and professionals in STEM fields  by helping retrain non-STEM workers to work in STEM fields. Also included were health care programs that train students for careers  that are primarily in scientific research, but not those that train students for careers that are primarily in patient care (e.g. those that  trained nurses, doctors, dentists, psychologists, or veterinarians).", "Lastly, GAO considered STEM fields to include any of the following broad disciplines: agricultural sciences; astronomy; biological  sciences; chemistry; computer science; earth, atmospheric, and ocean sciences; engineering; material science; mathematical  sciences; physics; social sciences (e.g., psychology, sociology, anthropology, cognitive science, economics, behavioral sciences); and  technology.", "GAO used this same definition of STEM education program in its 2012 report. However, in the current report, GAO explicitly specified  astronomy and material science as STEM fields and also revised \u201cmathematics\u201d to be \u201cmathematical sciences\u201d based on feedback  from agency officials.", "We reviewed the information agencies submitted and took steps to  corroborate it, such as by reviewing program descriptions and budget  documents. Based on our analysis of this information, we sent a web- based questionnaire to 198 programs (see table 1).", "To develop the questionnaire and collect the data, we used recognized  survey design practices to enhance data quality. For instance, we ordered  the questionnaire appropriately and ensured the questions were clearly  stated and easy to understand. The questionnaire solicited information on  federal STEM education programs, including programs\u2019 objectives,  intended groups served, services provided, STEM fields, and obligations.  We did not conduct pretests because most of the questions were included  in our prior questionnaire and had already been pretested.", "On May 8, 2017, we sent an email announcing the online questionnaire to  the officials responsible for programs identified as STEM education and  also notifying them that the questionnaire would be activated that week.  On May 10, 2017, we sent a second message to officials informing them  that the questionnaire was activated and providing them with unique  usernames and passwords. As necessary, we followed-up with program  officials by telephone and email. We collected responses through August  31, 2017.", "Based on our analysis of the questionnaire responses and other  information we received from program officials, we excluded 35 programs  from our inventory. (See table 2 for a summary of those 35 programs and  the reasons we excluded them.)", "Nine of the 35 excluded programs had been reported by agency officials  as STEM education programs in our previous report. In most cases (8 of  9), we excluded these programs in this report because the programs did  not include STEM education as a primary objective in fiscal year 2016. In  the remaining case, we excluded the program because it was a  component of another fiscal year 2016 STEM education program, and  thus would be duplicative. We confirmed this information and the  programs\u2019 exclusion with the administering agencies.", "After we completed our analysis, we identified 163 programs as STEM  education for fiscal year 2016. Programs officials responsible for all 163  of these programs completed our questionnaire. We used standard  descriptive statistics to analyze responses to these completed  questionnaires. We also used recognized survey design practices to  process and analyze data collected via the questionnaire. For instance,  we performed automated checks to review the data and identify  inappropriate answers. We also reviewed the data for missing or  ambiguous responses and followed up with program officials when  necessary to clarify their responses. We did not verify all responses since  we had applied recognized survey design practices and follow-up  procedures, and had determined that the data used in this report were of  sufficient quality for the purposes of our reporting objectives."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) Education Programs and Reported Fiscal Year 2016 Obligations", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Current Implementation Status of Selected COMPETES Act Provisions to Coordinate Federal Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Committee on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Bill J.
