However, among the 9 grants that did not require allocations or awards for indigent defense, two-thirds or more of state, local, and tribal respondents to GAO\u0092s surveys reported that they did not use funds for this purpose, partly due to competing priorities. DOJ has listed the grants on its website. However, no more than 54 percent of grantees or public defender offices responding to GAO\u0092s surveys were aware that such funding could be used to support indigent defense. Taking steps to increase awareness would better position DOJ to help ensure that eligible grantees are aware that they can access federal funding to help address their needs. DOJ officials acknowledged that opportunities exist to enhance grantees\u0092 awareness.", "When recipients allocated funding for indigent defense, the amount was generally small relative to the total award and most commonly used for personnel and training. For instance, among grant recipients who reported in GAO\u0092s surveys that they had allocated funding for indigent defense, allocations as a percentage of total awards ranged from 2 percent to 14 percent.", "DOJ generally collects data on funding allocated for indigent defense when the grant program requires such funding or identifies it as a grant priority, but does not do so in two juvenile-focused grants. According to DOJ, it does not collect such data in these two programs because indigent defense is 1 of 17 purposes for which grant funds can be used. GAO has previously reported that agencies should collect data to support decision making, and the Attorney General has committed to focusing on indigent defense issues. Collecting data on the amount of funding from these two grants that is used to support indigent defense would position DOJ to better assess if it is meeting the Attorney General\u0092s commitment.", "DOJ assesses the impact of indigent defense grant funding and has mechanisms to help indigent defense providers evaluate services. All 9 of the DOJ grant programs that required or prioritized funding to be used for indigent defense included output measures that described the level of grant activity, such as the number of defenders hired, and 7 of the 9 included outcome measures that described the intended results of the funds, such as the percent increase in defendants served. Nine of the 118 public defender offices or agencies that responded to GAO\u0092s survey provided GAO with a copy of an evaluation that had been conducted of their office; those that did not most frequently cited lack of personnel (28 of 62) and lack of expertise or the need for technical assistance (26 of 62) as the reasons.

Because all recipients of JABG and JJDP funding were included  in our population and we received response rates of 82 and 89 percent,  we consider our results generalizable to the population of JABG and  JJDP recipients. While all eligible members of our target population of  JAG recipients and recipients of BIA Tribal Courts TPA distributions were  included in our survey, due to the relatively low response rates and the  possibility of other errors all questionnaire surveys face, our results  represent only those respondents who participated in our survey and  should not be generalized to the population of JAG recipients or  recipients of BIA Tribal Courts TPA distributions.

The principles include the  fundamental criteria necessary to design a system that provides effective,  efficient, high-quality, ethical legal representation for indigent defendants  in which defenders have no conflicts of interest, such as representing two  defendants in the same case. According to DOJ, BJA will award $1.4  million of new discretionary grant funding to support projects that help  make achievement of these principles a reality. According to officials from  BJA and ATJ involved in developing the solicitation, BJA and ATJ staff  worked closely together to develop the grant, and also conducted  outreach to indigent defense advocates to determine the type of  assistance that would benefit public defenders. The officials explained  that the grant will be flexible enough that a diverse group of public  defender offices will be eligible to apply for funding because it will allow  both less developed and more developed offices to identify areas for  improvement in adhering to the ABA principles.", "In addition to funding, DOJ, BIA, and the Administrative Office of the U.S.  Courts (AOUSC) provide training and technical assistance to indigent  defense providers.Assistance Center (NTTAC) accepts requests for and provides training  and technical assistance to state, local, and tribal criminal justice   For instance, BJA\u2019s National Training and Technical  stakeholders.

DOJ officials stated that they  limited the requirement to 5 project identifiers to help ensure that the  identifiers selected were most representative of the projects being funded.  BJA also noted that, during its application review, BJA staff have the  option to select additional project identifiers that would assist in the  description and tracking of projects being funded.", "Second, as part of its efforts to revise JAG performance measures, which  were made partly in response to our review, BJA has drafted a  performance measure for the amount of funding spent on defense.  Moreover, DOJ recently improved its efforts to collect data on the extent  to which JAG grantees have allocated funds for indigent defense, but  DOJ does not collect data on whether JABG or TJADG grantees have  allocated funding for this purpose. According to an OJP official  responsible for the grant system, all project identifiers are available to any  OJP grantees, including JAG as well as JABG and TJADG grantees.  However, unlike the JAG program, JABG and TJADG grantees are not  required to identify project identifiers to describe proposed project  activities when applying for funding; therefore grantees may choose not to  use them. Moreover, 3 of the 5 JABG survey respondents who reported  allocating funding for indigent defense with whom we spoke reported that  they were unaware of an indigent defense project identifier, and an  additional respondent reported being aware, but unlikely to use it.", "DOJ officials responsible for the JABG program explained that they  collect data on grantees\u2019 allocation of funds for the JABG purpose area  that includes hiring court-appointed defenders, but the data are not  detailed enough to identify allocations specifically for indigent defense.  Moreover, the officials noted that this purpose area is only 1out of 17  JABG purpose areas. Similarly, the purpose area that includes hiring  court-appointed defenders is only 1 out of 17 TJADG purpose areas, and  TJADG data we obtained from DOJ did not identify whether funding was  awarded for indigent defense. In addition, JABG and TJADG applicants  have not been required to identify project identifiers because, according  to an official from OJJDP, the office that administers the programs,  OJJDP was not aware that the project identifiers available to JAG  grantees could also be used by OJJDP staff and grantees. We have  previously reported that agencies should collect sufficiently complete,  accurate, and consistent data to measure performance and support  decision making at various organizational levels. General has identified a crisis in criminal defense and committed the  department to focusing on indigent defense issues and developing and  implementing solutions, collecting data on whether grantees have  allocated or awarded funding for indigent defense could help DOJ better  assess whether funding is supporting this commitment.", "GAO/GGD-96-118."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOJ Assesses the Impact of Indigent Defense Grant Funding and Has Mechanisms to Help Indigent Defense Providers Evaluate Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOJ Has Measures to Assess the Impact of Indigent Defense-Related Grant Funding", "paragraphs": ["According to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), performance  measurement indicates what a program is accomplishing and whether  results are being achieved. For all DOJ grant programs that either  require funding be used for indigent defense or identify it as a priority,  DOJ has or is developing indigent defense-related performance  measures and requires grantees to provide data to inform these  measures. For example, for the Byrne Competitive, TCCLA, TJADG, and  JABG programs\u2014where DOJ has prioritized indigent defense-related  funding\u2014DOJ requires grantees to report indigent defense-related  measures such as the number of public defenders hired. In the JAG  program, DOJ is developing a measure\u2014the number of cases   For a list  defended\u2014in its revisions to its online performance measures.of performance measures DOJ uses to assess the impact of funding used  for indigent defense-related activities, see appendix VI.", "OMB guidance outlines four types of performance measures agencies  may use to assess program impact: those that describe the level of  activity that will be provided over a period of time (output measures),  those that describe the intended result of carrying out the program  (outcome measures), those that indicate how well a procedure, process,  or operation is working (process measures), and those that describe the  resources used to produce outputs and outcomes (input measures).  While each type of measure provides information that can help assess  the impact of the program, OMB also states that appropriate performance  goals should, among other things, focus on outcomes, but use outputs  when necessary. In addition, OMB strongly encourages the use of  outcomes because they are more meaningful to the public than outputs.  As we have previously reported, developing output measures is a step  toward developing outcome measures, and an important initial step in  measuring progress. However, we have also previously reported that  leading organizations promote accountability by establishing results- oriented, outcome goals and corresponding performance measures by  which to gauge progress towards attaining these goals.", "We found that all nine of the DOJ grant programs that required or  prioritized funding for indigent defense included output measures that  described the level of grant activity. In addition, seven of the nine grant  programs included outcome-oriented performance measures that  described the intended results of the program. For example, for the  Juvenile Indigent Defense National Clearinghouse Grant, DOJ developed  the outcome measure \u201cpercentage of people exhibiting increased  knowledge of the program area,\u201d which demonstrates a clear linkage to  the program goals to improve juvenile indigent defense, to build the  capacity of the juvenile indigent defense bar, and to promote the zealous  and effective advocacy for juvenile indigent defendants. See appendix VI  for our more detailed analysis of the measures used.", "The John R. Justice and JAG programs do not include indigent defense- related outcome-oriented performance measures that gauge impacts or  results. However, DOJ requires states that receive John R. Justice  funding to submit, at the conclusion of the grant, an assessment of the  program\u2019s impact on retention of prosecutors and defenders in the state,  which would allow DOJ to assess whether the program is achieving  intended results. DOJ officials explained that they required grantees to  submit this assessment because the DOJ Inspector General is required in  the statute establishing the John R. Justice program to report on the  program\u2019s impact on the retention of prosecutors and public defenders.", "As a result, DOJ decided to require these assessments from recipients in  order to provide this information to the Inspector General, if requested.", "In addition, according to DOJ officials, they have not developed indigent  defense-related outcome-oriented performance measures for the JAG  program because the ways in which JAG funds can be used vary  significantly across and within the seven purpose areas, making the  development of outcome-oriented measures that could capture the  intended results of the program difficult. Even among grantees that  allocated funding for indigent defense, the purposes varied significantly.  For instance, one JAG grantee with whom we spoke reported using  indigent defense-related JAG funds to update the case management  system at a public defender\u2019s office, for which an outcome measure could  be the increase in the efficiency with which cases are handled, while  another used the funds to pay for an attorney, for which an outcome  measure could be the decrease in the number of cases each attorney  handles. Further, OMB has acknowledged that developing performance  measures for programs that, like JAG, address multiple objectives and  support a broad range of activities can be challenging. For programs that  focus funds on specific purpose areas, as JAG does, OMB states that  agencies can address the challenge by articulating national goals, and  then working with state and local entities to identify specific objectives  and measures linked to the national goals that the grantee will address.However, because indigent defense is not a JAG purpose area, such a  solution would not result in indigent defense-related measures. In  addition, DOJ officials stated that asking grantees to develop measures  would place an additional reporting burden on the grantees. DOJ officials  also stated that while they do not have indigent defense-related outcome- oriented measures in the JAG program, they do ask grantees to report on  what they have accomplished with their grants. Like an outcome  measure, this could allow DOJ to assess the results of the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indigent Defense Providers Generally Reported That Evaluations of Their Services Have Not Been Conducted; DOJ Has Mechanisms to Support Such Evaluations", "paragraphs": ["With its indigent defense-related performance measures, DOJ can assess  the impact of a grantee\u2019s use of funds, such as whether the funding  resulted in an increase in the number of defenders hired. However, its  assessments are not intended to evaluate the effectiveness of a  grantee\u2019s, or any indigent defense provider\u2019s, programs or services, such  as whether the defender\u2019s ability, training, and experience match the  complexity of the case, which is one of ABA\u2019s principles for public  defense delivery systems. Instead, as we have previously reported,  evaluations may be used to assess a program\u2019s effectiveness, identify  how to improve performance, or guide resource allocation. Moreover,  evaluation can play a key role in strategic planning and in program  management, providing feedback on both program design and  execution. For example, respondents to our survey of public defender  offices and agencies reported using evaluations for purposes such as  enacting system improvements (8), supporting funding requests (8), and  addressing caseload issues (4), among others. Of the 118 public  defender offices or agencies that responded to our survey, 9 provided us  with copies of evaluations that they had conducted of their office or  agency or that another entity conducted, such as a consultant or  oversight body.oversight committee for a local jurisdiction\u2019s indigent defense services\u2014 collected data and used it to assess compliance with local indigent  defense standards.

Appendix VII provides  additional details on these evaluations.", "Sixty-two percent (68 of 109) of public defender offices or agencies that  responded to our survey reported that no evaluation had been conducted  of their office or agency. Respondents who reported reasons for not  conducting an evaluation most frequently cited lack of personnel (46  percent, 29 of 63) and lack of expertise and/or the need for technical  assistance (43 percent, 27 of 63) as the reasons. Moreover,  respondents identified challenges to collecting data on factors that affect  their ability to provide indigent defense services\u2014information that could  be used to conduct an evaluation. For example, 50 percent (59 of 118)  reported that the amount of face-to-face time a public defender spends  with a client\u2014a potential indicator of effectiveness\u2014is difficult or  burdensome to collect, and data on client satisfaction are also costly to  collect (18 percent, 21 of 118), difficult to measure (47 percent, 56 of  118), and imprecise (32 percent, 38 of 118). However, respondents also  reported currently collecting data on factors that DOJ and indigent  defense stakeholders report could affect the quality of indigent defense  services. For example, according to BJA, managing defender workloads  is important to ensuring that the administration of justice is fair and  equitable, and quality of service may be impacted when public defenders  are forced to manage too many clients with inadequate resources.  According to respondents, data currently being collected includes both  average caseload per public defender (86 percent, 96 of 111), and the  number of active cases per public defender (84 percent, 94 of 112).  Respondents also reported collecting data on average salary or hourly  rate of public defenders (76 percent, 83 of 109)\u2014a factor that indigent  defense stakeholders have identified as relevant to the ability to attract  and retain qualified attorneys. Appendix VIII provides additional  information on the extent to which public defender offices or agencies  reported collecting data that could be used to conduct an evaluation and  the associated challenges or limitations of the data.", "DOJ has mechanisms that could help to address some of the evaluation  challenges that indigent defense offices and agencies reported, including  a lack of expertise or the need for technical assistance. For instance, BJA  provides technical assistance with evaluation through its Center for  Program Evaluation and Performance Measurement website, and makes  technical assistance available to SAAs and BJA applicants, among  others.", "Further, DOJ reported that it has funded more narrowly scoped,  nongeneralizable, case studies intended to help inform a broader study of  indigent defense and provide insights, as well as available resources, for  criminal justice stakeholders.

For fiscals years 2005 through 2010, to what extent was eligible DOJ  and BIA funding allocated and awarded for indigent defense, what  factors affected decisions to allocate and award funding for this  purpose, and what actions have DOJ and BIA taken, if any, to  address these factors?  3.  When fiscal year 2005 through 2010 federal funding was allocated or  awarded for indigent defense, how did it compare to the total  allocations or awards made, and how did recipients use the funding?  4.  To what extent does DOJ collect data on indigent defense funding  when the grant program specifies that funds be allocated or awarded  for this purpose or highlights it as a priority?  5.  When a grant program specifies that funds be spent for indigent  defense or highlights it as a priority, to what extent can DOJ assess  the impacts of this grant funding, and to what extent have there been  evaluations of indigent defense programs and has DOJ supported  these evaluation efforts ?", "To determine what DOJ grant programs and BIA funding could be used to  support state, local, and tribal indigent defense from fiscal years 2005  through 2010, we reviewed the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance,  DOJ\u2019s website, and BIA\u2019s annual budget justifications. In addition, we  spoke with public defenders and state and local government offices in  selected states to determine whether there were additional grants they  had applied for or received related to indigent defense that we had not  already identified. We selected these states based on geographical  location, the extent to which state and local government offices had  received federal funding, and the structure of the state\u2019s indigent defense  system. We also met with agency officials in DOJ\u2019s Office of Justice  Programs (OJP), who are responsible for administering the programs,  and BIA\u2019s Office of Justice Services, who provide support to tribal courts,  to discuss the federal funding programs in more detail. Once our  determinations were made, we sent OJP officials a list of funding  programs to be included in our review, and asked for confirmation of this  list. The DOJ grants included in our review were the Edward Byrne  Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program; the Juvenile  Accountability Block Grant (JABG); the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention Title II (JJDP); John R. Justice Program; Byrne Competitive  Program; Capital Case Litigation Initiative; Wrongful Conviction Review  Program; Tribal Civil and Criminal Legal Assistance Program; Tribal  Courts Assistance Program; Juvenile Indigent Defense Clearinghouse  Grant; Tribal Juvenile Accountability Discretionary Grant; Juvenile Justice  and Mental Health Collaboration Grant; and Adult Drug Court  Discretionary Grant. The BIA funding included in our review was the  Tribal Courts tribal priority allocation (TPA) distributions. We obtained  records of all recipients of these grants from DOJ and by reviewing BIA\u2019s  budget documentation. Further, we interviewed knowledgeable agency  officials about the source of the grant data and the controls in place to  maintain the integrity of the data and determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In addition, to determine what other  assistance DOJ and BIA made available to support indigent defense, we  interviewed DOJ and BIA officials responsible for training and technical  assistance to identify assistance other than funding that the agencies  provide to support indigent defense.", "To determine the extent to which state, local, and tribal governments  allocated federal funding for indigent defense, the factors that influenced  their decisions, and the amounts allocated, we conducted separate Web- based surveys of all recipients of fiscal year 2005 through 2010 DOJ  formula grants that could be allocated for indigent defense\u2014the JAG,  JJDP, and JABG grants\u2014and tribal governments that received BIA Tribal  Courts TPA distributions from fiscal years 2005 through 2010.develop the survey questionnaires, we reviewed existing literature about  the provision of indigent defense, and interviewed state JAG, JABG, and  JJDP recipients, local JAG recipients, and tribes. We designed draft  questionnaires in close collaboration with a GAO social science survey  specialist. We conducted pretests with five state and local JAG recipients,  three JABG recipients, three JJDP recipients, two tribal JAG recipients,  and two recipients of BIA Tribal Court TPA distributions to help further  refine our questions, develop new questions, and clarify any ambiguous  portions of the survey.", "We developed and administered the web-based questionnaires  accessible through a secure server. We emailed each recipient a unique  identification number and password, and a link to the questionnaire for  their population.

While we  also included all eligible members of the target populations in our state  and local JAG, tribal JAG, and Tribal Courts TPA surveys, because of  their relatively low response rates and the possibility of other errors all  questionnaire surveys face, our results represent only respondents  participating in these surveys and should not be generalized to the  populations. Specifically, certain members of these populations may have  been more or less likely to respond to our survey and this may affect our  data. For instance, our data may overrepresent allocations for indigent  defense because recipients that allocated funding for indigent defense  may have been more likely to respond to our survey than recipients that  had never done so. In addition, on the JAG survey, recipients of larger  amounts of money and recipients of multiple years of funding were more  likely to respond, but recipients of funding awarded solely pursuant to  amounts appropriated through the American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act were less likely to respond. However, the responses provide insights  into the extent to which JAG and BIA Tribal Courts TPA funding has been  allocated for indigent defense.", "The practical difficulties of conducting any survey may introduce errors in  estimates. For example, difficulties in interpreting a particular question,  sources of information available to respondents, or entering data into a  database or analyzing them can introduce unwanted variability into the  survey results. We took steps in developing the questionnaire, collecting  the data, and analyzing them to minimize these errors. In addition, as  indicated above, social science survey specialists designed the  questionnaire in collaboration with GAO staff that had subject matter  expertise. We then conducted pretests to check that (1) the questions  were clear and unambiguous, (2) terminology was used correctly, (3) the  questionnaire did not place an undue burden on respondents, (4) the  information could feasibly be obtained, and (5) the survey was  comprehensive and unbiased. We made multiple contact attempts with  nonrespondents during the survey by e-mail, and some nonrespondents  were also contacted by telephone. When we analyzed the data, an  independent analyst checked all computer programs. Since this was a  web-based survey, respondents entered their answers directly into the  electronic questionnaire, eliminating the need to key data into a database,  minimizing error. We assessed the reliability of funding allocation data  that was provided by including a series of questions pertaining to the  accuracy of reported data in our survey and reviewing the data for  obvious errors. Dollar amounts reported through our surveys, particularly  by JAG respondents, have limitations and should be treated as estimates.  For instance, respondents may have had difficulty identifying the precise  amount of funding allocated for indigent defense in the earlier years of our  time frame (fiscal years 2005 through 2010), may have been unable to  determine the exact amount of funding that was allocated for indigent  defense if grant funds were used for multiple purposes, or may not have  had sufficient information to provide total amounts allocated to indigent  defense because they had not yet fully allocated their grant funds. In  addition, our JAG data may overrepresent allocations to law enforcement  because it was the first category listed in our survey and respondents that  were unable to split their funding across purpose areas may have  reported allocating all funding to law enforcement.", "To determine the extent to which DOJ awarded discretionary grants for  indigent defense, we obtained project descriptions for all discretionary  grants that could have been awarded for indigent defense in fiscal years  2005 through 2010 from DOJ. We then reviewed these descriptions to  determine the recipients of the grant services. In addition to indigent  defense providers, this included the following categories: civil defenders,  criminal defenders, prosecutors, law enforcement providers, court offices,  correctional agencies, crime victims, reentry service providers, juvenile  delinquency prevention organizations, appellate defenders, drug  treatment providers, community and public outreach providers, non- attorney staff, innocence projects, and universities. Many grants had  multiple recipients of grant services. In these instances, we classified the  grants to reflect all recipients; as a result, grants may be counted in more  than one category. For each grant program we determined the number of  grants used exclusively for indigent defense, the number of grants used  for indigent defense with another grant recipient category, and the  number and amount of grants that were not used for indigent defense.  Two analysts made these classifications in order to verify each other\u2019s  work.", "To determine what factors influenced public defenders\u2019 decisions to apply  for funding, we conducted a web-based survey of public defenders.

We identified the following possible uses: training,  technical assistance, personnel, planning and evaluation, technology  initiatives, equipment, case management, conflict counsel, outreach and  public education, facilities, codes and legal rules, and representation from  an outside source. For each grant, two analysts came to agreement on  the categorization. As with the recipients of grant services, many grants  had multiple uses. In these instances, we classified the grants to reflect  all their uses; as a result, grants may be counted more than one time in  our overall analysis. With this information we were able to provide the  amount and use for all discretionary grants that were used all or in part for  indigent defense.", "To determine the extent to which DOJ collects data on whether recipients  allocate funds for indigent defense when such funding is required or  highlighted as a priority, we reviewed all grant solicitations to determine  whether DOJ required that funding be allocated or awarded for indigent  defense or identified indigent defense as a purpose area or priority. For  grants in which we found that it was, we spoke with DOJ officials about  why they chose to do so. In addition, through document requests and  interviews with DOJ officials, we asked the agency to provide information  that describes the extent to which they track how grantees have allocated  funding, including for indigent defense, and how they do or could do so.  We analyzed this information to ascertain the status of their efforts and  the mechanisms available to conduct such tracking.", "As part of this analysis, we requested data from DOJ on its fiscal year  2011 JAG grantees because\u2014beginning in fiscal year 2011\u2014JAG  grantees were required to select up to five project identifiers to indicate  how their 2011 JAG funds would be used, and DOJ developed a project  identifier for indigent defense. We compared this data with our survey  results from JAG grantees to determine the extent to which grantees that  indicated in our survey that they are likely to allocate funding for indigent  defense also selected indigent defense as a project identifier in their fiscal  year 2011 grant application in order to assess the accuracy of the project  identifier data.
