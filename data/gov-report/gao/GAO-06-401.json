The average age of all enrollees in the federal program was younger than the average age of enrollees in individual products and older than the average age of enrollees in group products. The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program paid 39 percent of what it initially projected to pay for claims per enrollee. The number of claims paid per enrollee was also lower than initial projections.

Private insurance covered 7 percent of this  amount, about $14 billion, while most long-term care services were  financed by government programs, primarily Medicaid. The elderly\u2014 people 65 years old and older\u2014consume about two-thirds of all long-term  care services. As the elderly population begins to grow with the aging of  the baby boomers, the increasing demand for long-term care services will  continue to strain federal and state resources. Some policymakers propose  that increased use of long-term care insurance, particularly by the baby  boom generation, may be a means of reducing some of the future financial  burden on public programs. In September 2000, Congress passed the Long- Term Care Security Act. The act required that the federal government offer  long-term care insurance to its employees, their families, and others.  Congressional committee reports accompanying this act indicated that a  long-term care insurance program could encourage more people to obtain  long-term care insurance, serve as a model for other employer-sponsored  programs across the nation, and possibly shift some of the future burden  to private payment sources.", "In December 2001, at the conclusion of a competitive bidding process, the  Office of Personnel Management (OPM)\u2014the federal agency responsible  for administering governmentwide compensation and benefit systems\u2014 contracted with Long Term Care Partners, LLC (referred to as Partners)  for 7 years to provide long-term care insurance for active federal civilian  employees, members of the uniformed services, and Postal Service  employees; federal, military, and Postal Service retirees; qualified  relatives; and certain others. Partners is a joint venture formed by two  large carriers selling long-term care insurance products in the private  market, John Hancock Life Insurance Company and Metropolitan Life  Insurance Company. The Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program  conducted limited early enrollment from March 25, 2002, through May 15,  2002, and open enrollment from July 1, 2002, through December 31, 2002.

As agreed to  by the committees of jurisdiction, this report addresses the following  questions:    How do benefits and premiums for the Federal Long Term Care Insurance  Program compare with those of other products available in the long-term  care insurance market?", "How do enrollment rates and the characteristics of enrollees in the  Federal Long Term Care Insurance Program compare with those of other  products available in the long-term care insurance market?", "How does the early claims experience of the Federal Long Term Care  Insurance Program compare with initial expectations?", "To obtain data on benefits, premiums, enrollment, and enrollee  characteristics, we surveyed Partners, the California Public Employees\u2019  Retirement System (CalPERS), and five of the largest long-term care  insurance carriers. The five insurance carriers were AEGON USA,  Bankers Life and Casualty Company, Genworth Financial, John Hancock  Life Insurance Company, and Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. All  five carriers sold products in the individual market, and two of the five  carriers\u2014John Hancock Life Insurance Company and Metropolitan Life  Insurance Company\u2014were also among the five largest carriers that sold  products in the group market. We requested data from Partners on new  policies sold during two time periods: (1) from March 25, 2002, through  February 7, 2003, to correspond to the federal early enrollment and open  enrollment periods and (2) from March 25, 2002, though March 31, 2005,  to capture the full experience of the program\u2019s first 3 years. We asked  CalPERS and the five carriers to provide data for policies sold from July 1,  2002, through March 31, 2005. We then compared the benefits offered,  enrollment, and enrollee characteristics of the federal program, CalPERS,  and the five carriers. To compare premiums, we asked CalPERS and the  carriers to price the benefit packages offered in the federal program. In  addition, we obtained data from Partners on the expected and early claims  experience of the federal program to provide an early indicator of financial  performance. Because of the proprietary nature of the data provided by  the five carriers, we aggregated data across the individual and group  carriers for reporting purposes. While we aggregated the CalPERS data  with the private market group data in all cases, we also separately  reported publicly available CalPERS data in two places because its  experience in managing benefits for large numbers of public employees,  retirees, and their families is most comparable to the federal program.", "To supplement the data we collected, we interviewed officials at OPM,  Partners, CalPERS and the organization that administers its program, the  five carriers, and five trade associations representing groups such as  insurers and actuaries. We also interviewed three experts on long-term  care insurance. In addition, we reviewed several studies, including recent  studies addressing (1) the long-term care insurance market, (2) buyers of a  long-term care insurance product and those who considered buying  coverage but decided not to buy, and (3) claims experience. We assessed  the reliability of the data we obtained from Partners, CalPERS, and the  five carriers and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our study.

As  some of these services can be expensive, especially services provided in a  nursing home, long-term care insurance helps people pay for the cost of  care. However, relatively few people have obtained long-term care  insurance through products sold in the individual and group markets.

Both paid and unpaid caregivers may provide  long-term care services. As a person ages, his or her ability to perform  basic physical functions typically declines, increasing the likelihood that  he or she will need long-term care services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Long-term Care Insurance", "paragraphs": ["People can purchase long-term care insurance directly from carriers that  sell products in the individual market or can enroll in products offered by  employer-sponsored and other groups. Long-term care insurance policies  sold in the individual and group markets cover costs associated with long- term care. For a specified premium amount that is designed\u2014but not  guaranteed\u2014to remain level over time, the carrier agrees to provide  covered benefits under an insurance contract. First sold in the 1970s, long- term care insurance has evolved from initially offering coverage for  nursing home care only to offering comprehensive coverage.  Comprehensive coverage pays for care provided in facilities such as  nursing homes and other settings such as a person\u2019s home. Insurance is  generally purchased for defined daily benefit amounts and benefit periods,  with elimination, or waiting, periods. For example, long-term care  insurance might provide coverage at $100 per day for care provided in a  nursing home or in other settings for 3 years after a waiting period of   90 days. Because long-term care insurance claims might not be filed for  many years after the product is purchased, the insured can purchase  protection against inflation, which can increase the daily benefit amount  covered. In addition, long-term care insurance products can (1) cover  home care at varying percentages of the daily benefit amount; (2) offer  people a range of other types of options, such as policies that return a  portion of the premium payments if the person dies; and (3) include  selected benefits, such as international coverage or care-coordination  services that, among other things, provide information about long-term  care services to the enrollee and monitor the receipt of services.", "Many factors affect long-term care insurance premiums. Carriers charge  higher premiums for richer benefits; for example, higher daily benefit  amounts, longer benefit periods, and higher levels of inflation protection  will increase the cost. Premiums are based on the age of the applicant,  with premiums increasing more rapidly as age increases. Premiums are  also based on the health status of the applicant. Most carriers selling  coverage in the individual market assign applicants to one of three general  rating categories based on health status when underwriting the coverage\u2014 preferred, standard, or substandard\u2014with associated discounts and  surcharges. In addition, carriers in the individual market usually offer  discounts to married couples when both spouses purchase coverage.  Products sold in the group market may be sold on a guaranteed issue basis  during an open enrollment period, with no or limited underwriting for  employees actively at work who enroll through an employer-sponsored  program, and the products generally do not provide discounts for spouses.  Carriers cannot increase a particular person\u2019s premiums but can increase  premiums for a group of people who bought the same type of policy when  the carrier can demonstrate that anticipated costs will exceed premium  revenue. Carrier pricing assumptions, including projected interest rates,  morbidity or illness rates, and lapse rates\u2014the number of people expected  to drop their policies over time\u2014all affect premium rates and rate setting.", "Carriers estimate the total amount of premiums to be collected for long- term care insurance policies sold as well as projected claims and  administrative costs for these policies using an anticipated lifetime loss  ratio. This ratio describes what portion of total premiums is expected to  be paid for claims for the reimbursement of the costs of long-term care  over the life of a set of policies. The portion of premiums not spent on  claims is used to pay for administrative costs, such as marketing, agent  commissions, claims handling, overhead, and taxes, and for profits. In the  past, National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) model  regulations for long-term care insurance stated that carriers should spend  a minimum of 60 percent of collected premiums on claims. However, in  model regulations released in August 2000, NAIC recommended that  carriers price their products high enough initially to prevent the need for  future rate increases rather than target a minimum percentage to be spent  on claims. So far, according to NAIC, a majority of states have adopted  long-term care insurance regulations based on the 2000 NAIC model, while  some states still require minimum loss ratios. Many large carriers set  premium rates on a national rather than regional basis. Carriers also price  to cover a profit margin and administrative costs as well as to meet  minimum loss ratios.", "Few claims are expected to be submitted during the early years of a long- term care insurance policy. As a result of underwriting, it is unlikely that  many people could meet the eligibility requirements to buy the policy yet  submit a claim within 3 years. Industry experts suggested that the effects  of underwriting begin to decline and the rate of claim submissions starts to  increase after about 3 to 7 years. The rate of increase in claim submissions  depends on the average age of the enrollees, with most long-term care  insurance claims submitted when people reach their mid-70s to mid-80s.  Industry experts also noted that the rate of claim submissions in the  federal program is expected to peak 25 years or more after the program  began. Because the average age of enrollees in the individual market is  higher than the average age of enrollees in the federal program, the rate of  claim submissions is likely to peak earlier in the individual market, after 15  to 25 years. The rate of claim submissions is likely to peak after 30 to   40 years in the group market because of the younger average age of its  enrollees.", "The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA)  specified conditions under which long-term care insurance benefits and  premiums would receive favorable federal income tax treatment and  provided specific protections to people who purchased tax-qualified  plans. Long-term care insurance plans must meet certain requirements  contained in HIPAA to be considered tax-qualified. For example,  according to HIPAA, a plan must begin coverage when a person is certified  to need substantial assistance with at least two of the six ADLs and a  disability is expected to last 90 or more days, or to need regular  supervision because of a severe cognitive impairment. In addition,  federally tax-qualified plans must comply with the NAIC long-term care  insurance model act and regulations in effect as of January 1993, as  incorporated into HIPAA. These provide certain consumer protections,  such as preventing a carrier from (1) not renewing a long-term care  insurance policy because of age or deteriorating health and (2) increasing  the premium of an existing policy because of a person\u2019s age or claims filed.  Another consumer protection was that carriers had to offer inflation  protection as specified in the NAIC model regulations.", "Each state establishes its own long-term care insurance laws and  regulations that cover areas such as benefits, premium setting, and  consumer protections. As a result, product requirements in the individual  and group markets can vary among the states.

Groups usually design the benefits, and enrollees are often given  some benefit options from which to choose, for example, differing daily  benefit amounts and benefit periods. However, benefit choices offered in  employer-sponsored group products tend to be more limited than those  that are available in the individual insurance market. Some groups offer  benefit packages in which the benefit options are predetermined. In  contrast to health insurance, where employers often contribute a share of  the premium costs, enrollees in group long-term care insurance coverage  usually pay the entire premium.", "A recent downturn in the long-term care insurance industry has led to  more conservative assumptions when setting premiums and consolidation  among carriers. The long-term care insurance industry experienced 18  percent annual growth in the number of policies sold from 1987 through  2002, but the industry has experienced a downturn in more-recent years.  Beginning in 2003, many carriers in the individual market raised  premiums, left the marketplace, or consolidated to form larger companies.  This activity occurred in response to several factors including high  administrative expenses relative to premiums; lower-than-expected lapse  rates, which increased the number of people likely to submit claims; low  interest rates, which reduced the expected return on investments; and new  government regulations limiting direct marketing by telephone. Many  carriers revised the assumptions used in setting their premium rates,  taking a more conservative approach that led to higher premiums, while  state regulators increased their oversight of the industry.

Some of the lower-than-expected  enrollment can be explained by the low participation rates for active  military members and Postal Service employees. Additionally, according  to Partners, the terrorist attacks in the fall of 2001 resulted in slower sales  of discretionary products, such as long-term care insurance, and also  resulted in temporarily reduced access to federal employees, military  members, and Postal Service employees for marketing purposes during the  open enrollment period. A representative of Partners and an expert  knowledgeable about the federal program indicated that a pool of at least  200,000 enrollees is adequate for the federal program to achieve financial  stability, although no minimum number was ever formally established.", "The federal program focused its marketing efforts on a core group of  nearly 6 million people out of an estimated eligible population of almost 19  million people, and the majority of the enrollees came from this core  group. The core group consisted of 1.8 million active federal civilian  employees, 1.4 million active military members, 0.8 million active Postal  Service employees, and 1.8 million spouses of active employees and  military members, as shown in table 3. Almost two-thirds of the 218,890  people enrolled from March 25, 2002, through March 31, 2005, came from  this core group. According to OPM officials, the federal program also  reached out to retired federal employees, retired military members, and  retired Postal Service employees.", "The enrollees during the first 3 years of the federal program represented  about three-quarters of the applications submitted. The federal application  approval rate of 74 percent was similar to the average approval rate of   75 percent for individual products, but lower than the average approval  rate of 84 percent for group products, which may enroll active workers  using guaranteed issue during an open enrollment period. The most  common reasons for denial of an application for the federal program and  for the group products were height and weight outside of insurable  standards, a chronic condition such as diabetes or cardiac problems, and  cognitive impairment. In addition to these reasons, the most common  reasons for denial of an application for the individual products included  cancer, stroke, and musculoskeletal problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Program Enrollees Were Younger Than Enrollees in Individual Products and Older Than Enrollees in Group Products, and More Women Than Men Obtained Coverage for All Products", "paragraphs": ["The average age of federal enrollees was 56 years at the time of  enrollment, compared with an average age of 60 for enrollees in individual  products and 52 for enrollees in group products, as shown in table 4.

It is still too early to  determine whether this trend will continue or whether adjustments to the  expected claims experience or premiums are needed. About half of the  total amount of claim payments was spent on facility care.

While the overall claims experience for the first 3 years was  lower than expected, the number of claims paid as a percentage of  expected claims in each consecutive year of operation was higher than the  previous year. In the first year of operation, the amount paid for claims per  enrollee was 40 percent of expected payments and the number of claims  per enrollee was 4 percent of expected claims. By the third year of  operation, the amount paid for claims per enrollee had remained level at  40 percent of expected payments, while the number of claims per enrollee  had increased to 48 percent of expected claims.", "It is still too early to determine whether the early claims experience will  continue or whether adjustments to the expected claims experience or  premiums are indicated. While having lower-than-expected claims  experience is a positive financial indicator, if the claims experience is  significantly lower than expected over the longer term, then it is possible  that the premiums are too high. On the other hand, in accordance with  NAIC premium-setting guidelines, it may be appropriate to project the  claims experience assuming moderately adverse results to protect against  the need to raise premiums. As noted earlier, it is expected that the  number of claims submitted in the first years of a long-term care insurance  program will be a small percentage of the claims submitted over time\u2014 most claims are not expected to be submitted until 25 years or more after  the program begins. Additionally, the expected claims experience is  sensitive to factors such as the level of underwriting, the total number of  enrollees, the ages of the enrollees, and the types of enrollees\u2014for  example, active workers, retirees, or relatives. Furthermore, the claims  experience is only one of many factors\u2014such as interest rates, lapse rates,  and mortality rates\u2014that affect the long-term financial outlook of the  program. The financial projections for long-term care insurance are  sensitive to changes in assumptions about all these factors. Figure 3 shows  the amount of paid claims per 10,000 enrollees and figure 4 shows the  number of paid claims per 10,000 enrollees during the first 3 years of the  program compared with the expected claims experience over the first   35 years of operation.", "Facility care accounted for a considerable portion of the federal program  claim payments in the first 3 years.

The federal program offered benefits comparable to other  products at competitive premium rates for similar benefits. Ultimately, the  premium any enrollee pays for a long-term care insurance product is  affected by several different factors, including the benefit options  purchased, the age of the enrollee at the time of purchase, applicable  discounts or surcharges, and the results of underwriting decisions. In  addition, the premium is affected by the underlying assumptions about  what will happen in the future regarding the number and dollar value of  claims filed, interest rates, mortality rates, and lapse rates. If the actual  claims experience, interest rates, mortality rates, or lapse rates vary  significantly from what was expected, then this could mean that the  premiums were too low or too high, and that premium or benefit  adjustments could be warranted. Because the federal program had been  offering coverage for only about 3 years at the time of our study, it was too  early to draw conclusions about the claims experience, especially in  relation to the premiums charged. Consistent with other long-term care  insurance products, the federal program expected most enrollees, who  averaged 56 years old when they enrolled, to submit long-term care  insurance claims in their mid-70s to mid-80s\u2014the time when most claims  are submitted. While the early claims experience of the federal program  was considerably lower than initially projected before the program began,  an assessment of the claims submitted during the next several years and of  other factors that affect the financial performance of the program will  begin to provide a clearer picture of the longer-term implications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Director of OPM take the following two actions.
