Concerns have been raised about the effectiveness of today\u2019s safeguards in light of the recent disclosures of unethical Cold War-era radiation experiments and reports of infringements on subjects\u2019 rights, such as in a contemporary study of breast cancer.", "Over the past 3 decades, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)\u2014the primary federal sponsor of biomedical and behavioral research\u2014has established procedures to minimize risks experienced by patients and healthy volunteers who participate in research that it supports or regulates. We reviewed HHS\u2019 human subject protection system, concentrating on the prevention, monitoring, and enforcement activities of the National Institutes of Health\u2019s (NIH) Office for Protection from Research Risks (OPRR) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Within FDA, we examined the human subject protection activities of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research because drug research is the largest segment of biomedical research. We interviewed federal and research institution officials; medical and behavioral researchers; representatives of the drug industry; and experts in bioethics, law, and social science. We also reviewed HHS and FDA regulations, guidelines, and records and human subject protection procedures and records at research institutions.", "I would like to highlight three key findings from our report. First, HHS\u2019 oversight of tens of thousands of studies appears to have reduced the likelihood that serious abuses of human subjects, comparable to past tragic events, will occur. Second, no practical level of oversight can guarantee that each researcher will protect subjects with complete integrity. The detection of recent instances of potential or actual harm to subjects both demonstrates that abuses can occur and also suggests that the current oversight activities are working. Finally, various time, resource, and other pressures have reduced or threaten to reduce the effectiveness of such oversight."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Since the 1960s, there have been significant advances in protecting the rights and welfare of human subjects in biomedical and behavioral research. The federal presence has grown in this area, establishing and enforcing regulations for protecting human subjects in federally funded and federally regulated research. HHS\u2019 regulation of biomedical and behavioral research consists of two principal tiers of review: one at the federal level and one at the research institution level. Both tiers are responsible for ensuring that individual researchers and their research institutions comply with federal laws and regulations for protecting human subjects. When the core of HHS\u2019 human protection regulations was adopted by 15 other federal departments and agencies in 1991, it became known as the Common Rule.", "Within the HHS oversight system there are several entities overseeing compliance with human protection regulations. At the federal level are the NIH\u2019s OPRR and the FDA. At the local level, institutional review boards (IRB)\u2014that is, review panels that are usually associated with a particular university or other research institution\u2014are responsible for implementing federal human subject protection requirements for research conducted at or supported by their institutions. In general, IRB members are scientists and nonscientists who volunteer to review proposed studies.", "The Common Rule requires research institutions receiving federal support and federal agencies conducting research to establish IRBs to review research proposals for risk of harm to human subjects and to perform other duties to protect human research subjects. It also stipulates requirements related to informed consent\u2014how researchers must inform potential subjects of the risks to which they, as study participants, agree to be exposed. HHS regulations contain additional protections not included in the Common Rule for research involving vulnerable populations\u2014namely, pregnant women, fetuses, subjects of in vitro fertilization research, prisoners, and children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preventive Efforts Have Been Important in Reducing Likelihood of Abuses", "paragraphs": ["Preventing harm to human subjects\u2019 rights and welfare is the overarching goal of HHS\u2019 protection system.

Assurances are contract-like agreements made by research institutions to comply with federal human subject protection requirements. Assurances include the following: a statement of ethical conduct principles, a guarantee that an IRB has been designated to approve and periodically review the institution\u2019s studies, and the specifics of the IRB\u2019s membership, responsibilities, and process for reviewing and approving proposals. An institution must have an assurance approved by OPRR before the institution can receive HHS research funding.", "Depending on an institution\u2019s willingness and expertise, as well as the requirements of specific research studies, OPRR can negotiate several different types of assurances. Through a multiple project assurance, for example, OPRR can delegate broad authority to an institution, allowing it to approve a wide array of research studies. Or, through a single project assurance, OPRR can retain the authority to approve studies one by one. As of November 1995, OPRR had 451 active multiple project assurances and over 3,000 active single project assurances. OPRR also had over 1,300 active cooperative project assurances, which pertain to multiple-site research projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fda Reviews Subject Protections Before Permitting Drug Studies", "paragraphs": ["FDA works to prevent the occurrence of human subject protection violations in the drug research it regulates.

For each study conducted using human subjects, researchers must first get IRB approval. In fact, HHS will neither fund new human subject research nor authorize ongoing research to continue without IRB approval. The IRB\u2019s basic role when deciding whether to approve new research is to determine if the rights and welfare of subjects will be safeguarded. IRB members ensure that a study\u2019s procedures are consistent with sound research design and that the consent document conforms to federal rules for adequate informed consent. IRB reviews, however, generally do not involve direct observation of the research study or the process in which a subject\u2019s consent is obtained.", "IRB members are expected to recognize that certain research subjects\u2014such as children, prisoners, the mentally disabled, and individuals who are economically or educationally disadvantaged\u2014are likely to be vulnerable to coercion or undue influence. The local nature of most IRBs enables members to be familiar with the research institution\u2019s resources and commitments, the investigators\u2019 capabilities, and community values.", "IRBs are also required to review previously approved research periodically. The purpose of these continuing reviews is for IRBs to keep abreast of a study\u2019s potential for harm and benefit to subjects so that boards can decide whether the study should continue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Monitoring and Enforcement Identify and Address Human Subject Protection Violations", "paragraphs": ["No system of prevention is foolproof.

FDA\u2019s inspections of IRBs demonstrate that, at some institutions, compliance with federal oversight rules is uneven. Between January 1993 and November 1995, FDA issued 31 Warning Letters to institutions regarding significant deficiencies in the performance of their IRBs\u2019 oversight of drug research. Among the more serious violations cited were the following: participation of researchers as IRB members in reviewing their own studies, absence of a process for tracking ongoing studies, and failure to ensure that required elements of informed consent were contained in consent documents. The FDA Warning Letters terminated the IRBs\u2019 authority to approve new studies or to recruit new subjects into ongoing studies until FDA received adequate assurance of corrective action. From October 1993 to November 1995, FDA found less serious deficiencies involving about 200 other IRBs, such as failure to document the names of IRB members and failure of IRB minutes to identify controversial issues discussed.", "In addition to monitoring IRBs, FDA must be satisfied that manufacturers have complied with human subject protection regulations during clinical trials. To this end, FDA conducts on-site inspections of individual drug studies. When examining how a trial was conducted, FDA determines, for example, if subject selection criteria were followed, if subjects\u2019 consent was documented, and if adverse events were reported. FDA\u2019s principal focus in these efforts, however, is to verify the accuracy and completeness of study data as well as the researcher\u2019s adherence to the approved protocol.", "Most of the drug study violations FDA identifies are relatively minor. From 1977 to 1995, about one-half of the violations related to the adequacy of the informed consent forms. FDA also identifies more serious violations. Since 1980, FDA has taken 99 actions against 84 clinical investigators regarding their conduct of drug research with human subjects. It cited such instances of serious misconduct as failure to obtain informed consent; forgery of subjects\u2019 signatures on informed consent forms; failure to inform patients that a drug was experimental; and failure to report subjects\u2019 adverse reactions to drugs under study, including a subject\u2019s death."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Fda Can Impose Penalties for Serious Violations", "paragraphs": ["FDA has used four types of actions to enforce its regulations: (1) obtaining a promise from a researcher to abide by FDA requirements for conducting drug research, (2) invoking a range of restrictions on a researcher\u2019s use of investigational drugs, (3) disqualifying a researcher from the use of investigational drugs, and (4) criminally prosecuting a researcher."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Oprr Investigates Allegations of Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["OPRR also responds to inquiries and investigates allegations of potential harm to human subjects. These inquiries and investigations are largely handled by telephone and correspondence; few investigations result in site visits. Over the past 5 years, OPRR has investigated numerous allegations of serious human subject protection violations. One such example was OPRR\u2019s investigation of whether informed consent procedures clearly identified the risk of death to volunteers in the tamoxifen breast cancer prevention trial. OPRR found that informed consent documents at some sites failed to identify some of tamoxifen\u2019s potentially fatal risks, such as uterine cancer, liver cancer, and embolism. In another instance, OPRR compliance investigators found deficiencies in informed consent and in IRB review procedures in a joint NIH-French study of HIV-positive subjects in Zaire.

Various factors reduce or threaten to reduce the effectiveness of IRBs, OPRR, and FDA.", "First, pressure from heavy workloads and competing priorities can weaken IRB oversight.", "In some cases, the sheer number of studies necessitates that IRBs spend only 1 or 2 minutes of review per study.", "Some IRBs allow administrative staff with no scientific expertise\u2014not board members themselves\u2014to review continuing review forms, ensuring only that the information has been provided.", "The independence of IRB reviews can be compromised in cases in which IRB members have close collegial ties with researchers at their institutions, when there are pressures from institution officials to attract and retain funding, when IRB members have financial ties to the study, and when IRB members are reluctant to criticize studies led by leading scientists.", "The increasing complexity of research makes it difficult for some IRBs to adequately assess human subject protection issues when members are not conversant with the technical aspects of a proposed study, or when studies raise ethical questions that have not been satisfactorily resolved within the research community.", "Given the growing number of large-scale trials, if most involved IRBs have approved a proposed study, then IRBs at other institutions may feel pressured to mute their concerns about the study.", "Pressures to recruit subjects can lead some researchers and IRBs to overlook informed consent deficiencies.", "Second, various factors may hamper OPRR oversight.", "OPRR staff make no site visits during assurance negotiations; instead, they review an institution\u2019s written application and conduct written or oral follow-up. In contrast, on the basis of experience gained from on-site investigations for compliance purposes, OPRR staff told us that their ability to evaluate an institution\u2019s human protection system is greatly enhanced by direct observation and personal interaction with IRB staff, IRB members, and researchers. In the future, OPRR expects to conduct from 12 to 24 technical assistance visits annually to institutions holding OPRR assurances.", "NIH\u2019s organizational structure may hamper the independence of OPRR with respect to its oversight of studies conducted by NIH\u2019s Office of Intramural Research. From a broad organizational perspective, a potential weakness exists because NIH is both the regulator of human subject protections as well as an agency conducting its own research programs. The NIH Director, therefore, has responsibility for both the success of NIH\u2019s intramural research programs and the enforcement of human subject protection regulations by OPRR.", "Third, FDA\u2019s inspections of drug research may permit violations to go undetected.", "FDA\u2019s inspection program is geared more toward protecting the eventual consumer of the drug than the subjects on whom the drug was tested. FDA does not inspect all drug studies but concentrates its efforts on commercial products likely to be approved for consumer use. Furthermore, FDA\u2019s routine on-site inspections of drug studies are conducted only after clinical trials have concluded and subjects have completed their participation.", "Gaps also exist in FDA\u2019s inspection of IRBs. FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research annually issues the results of about 158 inspections of the approximately 1,200 IRBs reviewing drug studies, although its goal has been to complete and issue reports on about 250 inspections each year. We found that in one of FDA\u2019s 21 districts\u2014one that contains several major research centers conducting studies with human subjects\u201412 IRBs had not been inspected for 10 or more years. Furthermore, FDA is 3 to 5 years behind in its scheduled reinspection of some IRBs with which it had noted problems.", "FDA officials told us that some of its inspectors may be inadequately prepared to understand the human subject protection implications of drug studies and to ask meaningful follow-up questions on the research protocols they review.", "Fourth, additional pressures make it difficult to guarantee the protection of human subjects.", "When seriously ill individuals, such as some HIV patients, equate experimental and proven therapies, some question the need for protections that appear only to restrict their access to therapy.", "When physician-researchers do not clearly distinguish between research and treatment in their attempt to inform subjects, the possible benefits of a study can be overemphasized and the risks minimized.", "When physicians use an innovative but unproven technique to treat patients, they may not consider the procedure to be research. Such treatments, however, could constitute unregulated research, placing people at risk of harm from unproven techniques."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our work suggests that over the last 3 decades federal regulators and members of the research community have improved the protection of human research participants. However, holes inevitably exist in the regulatory net because no oversight system can guarantee complete protection for each individual.
