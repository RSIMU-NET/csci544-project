Specifically, it discusses (1) tribal entities' ability to obtain and access spectrum to provide broadband services and the reported barriers that may exist, and (2) the extent to which FCC promotes and supports tribal efforts to obtain and access spectrum. For that report, GAO interviewed 16 tribal entities that were using wireless technologies. Selected entities varied geographically, among other characteristics. GAO analyzed FCC's license and auction data as of September 6, 2018, reviewed FCC's rulemakings on spectrum for broadband services, and interviewed other tribal and industry stakeholders and FCC officials. The information obtained was not generalizable to all tribes or industry participants. As an update, GAO reviewed FCC's June 2019 draft order related to spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The tribal entities\u2014tribal governments and tribally owned telecommunications providers\u2014GAO contacted for its November 2018 report cited various barriers to obtaining spectrum licenses in bands that can be used to provide broadband services. Based on data from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as of September 2018, GAO identified 18 tribal entities that held active spectrum licenses in such bands. For example, of these 18 tribal entities, 4 obtained licenses through secondary market transactions\u2014that is, they bought or leased the license from another provider, and 2 obtained a license through an FCC spectrum auction. The barriers tribal officials identified to obtaining licensed spectrum include high costs at auctions and, in the case of secondary market transactions, a lack of information on who holds licenses over tribal lands. Because most spectrum allocated for commercial use has already been assigned, the secondary market is one of the few avenues available to tribal entities that would like to access licensed spectrum.", "At the time of GAO's November 2018 report, FCC had taken some actions to increase tribal access to spectrum. For example, FCC issued proposed rulemakings in 2011 and 2018 that sought comment on tribal-specific proposals, such as establishing tribal-licensing priorities and initiating processes to transfer unused spectrum licenses to tribal entities. FCC had not finalized these rules at the time of GAO's report, but FCC published a draft order in June 2019 that would create a tribal-licensing priorty window, whereby tribal entities would have an opportunity to obtain spectrum in the 2.5 gigahertz (GHz) band prior to the spectrum being auctioned. FCC adopted the order on July 10, 2019. FCC stated that it will implement spectrum initiatives and that it recognizes the importance of promoting a robust secondary market to improve communications throughout the United States, including tribal lands. However, GAO found that FCC had not consistently collected data related to tribal access to spectrum. For example:", "FCC did not collect data on whether spectrum auction applicants are tribal entities and therefore did not have a comprehensive understanding of the extent that tribal entities are attempting to obtain licensed spectrum.", "FCC did not analyze the extent that unused licensed spectrum exists over tribal lands. Although FCC officials said evaluating the effectiveness of FCC's secondary market policies is a way to increase the use of unused spectrum, FCC's approach did not include an analysis of unused spectrum licenses on tribal lands. As a result, FCC's evaluations of the secondary market may not accurately reflect how its policies affect tribal entities.", "By collecting data on the extent that tribal entities are obtaining and accessing spectrum, FCC could better understand tribal spectrum issues and use this information as it implements ongoing spectrum initiatives. Further, given that the secondary market is one of few ways for tribal entities to access licensed spectrum to provide Internet service, FCC could promote a more robust secondary market by analyzing unused licensed spectrum over tribal lands and using that information to inform FCC's oversight responsibilities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the November 2018 report, GAO made three recommendations to FCC, including that FCC should collect data on tribal access to spectrum and analyze unused licensed spectrum over tribal lands.

Broadband  service on tribal lands continues to lag behind the rest of the country,  especially on rural tribal lands. According to the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC), this gap could hinder tribal efforts to  promote self-governance, economic opportunity, education, public safety,  and cultural preservation. In prior work, we found that one barrier to  increasing broadband access on tribal lands is the cost of deploying  infrastructure in areas with challenging terrain. However, broadband  service can be delivered through wireless technologies using radio  frequency spectrum, and according to FCC, such wireless technologies  are more cost-effective for some remote and sparsely populated areas,  such as tribal lands. In 2010, FCC reported that increasing tribal access  to and use of spectrum would create additional opportunities to expand  broadband service on tribal lands.", "My remarks today are based on the November 2018 report and selected  updates and address (1) the ability of tribal governments and  telecommunications providers, which we refer to as \u201ctribal entities,\u201d to  obtain and access spectrum to provide broadband services on tribal lands  and the reported barriers that may exist, and (2) the extent to which FCC  promotes and supports tribal efforts to obtain and access spectrum for  broadband services. For our report, we reviewed relevant statutes and  regulations, FCC documents, and academic and government  publications on spectrum-related issues on tribal lands. We analyzed  FCC data on spectrum auction applicants and license holders as of  September 6, 2018 and reviewed the list of federally recognized tribes  published in the Federal Register. To obtain stakeholder views, we  interviewed stakeholders, such as tribal associations, regional  consortiums, private providers that deliver Internet services to tribal lands,  industry associations, and companies that work with tribal entities. In  addition, we interviewed 24 tribal entities\u201416 of which were using  wireless technologies to provide Internet services\u2014that we selected to  include variation in terms of geographic location, level of broadband  deployment, population size and density, and urban or rural distinction.  Stakeholders were selected to represent a range of views and experience  working with tribes and broadband service; their views are not  generalizable. To assess FCC\u2019s efforts, we interviewed FCC officials and  reviewed relevant FCC-rulemaking proceedings and related public  comments, and compared FCC\u2019s actions against recommendations made  in FCC\u2019s National Broadband Plan, FCC\u2019s current strategic plan, and  federal internal control standards related to using quality information. For  this testimony, we reviewed the status of related FCC rulemakings and  contacted FCC about action FCC has taken in response to our  recommendations. Further details on our scope and methodology are  included in our report.", "We conducted the work on which this statement is based in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

Mobile wireless broadband  technologies also establish an Internet connection that requires the  installation of antennas, but this technology provides connectivity to  customers wherever they are covered by service, including while on the  move, such as with a cell phone. Spectrum is the resource that makes  wireless broadband connections possible. Spectrum frequency bands  each have different characteristics that result in different levels of ability to  cover distances, penetrate physical objects, and carry large amounts of  information. Examples of some of the frequency bands that can be used  by commercial and nonfederal entities for broadband services are shown  in figure 2.", "The frequency bands that can be used for broadband services are either  licensed or unlicensed. For licensed spectrum, FCC can assign licenses  through auctions, in which prospective users bid for the exclusive rights to  transmit on a specific frequency band within geographic areas. Having  exclusive rights ensures there will be no interference from other spectrum  users in that band. License holders may sell or lease their license, in  whole or in part, to another provider, a process that is known as a  secondary market transaction, with FCC\u2019s approval. FCC has assigned  licenses administratively in two frequency bands that can be used for  broadband services.", "FCC also authorizes the use of unlicensed spectrum, where an unlimited  number of users can share frequencies without a license, such as  wireless microphones, baby monitors, and garage door openers. In  contrast to users of licensed spectrum, unlicensed users have no  regulatory protection from interference by other licensed or unlicensed  users in the bands.", "In March 2010, FCC issued the National Broadband Plan that included a  centralized vision for achieving affordability and maximizing use of high- speed Internet. The plan made recommendations to FCC, including that  FCC should take into account the unique spectrum needs of tribal  communities when implementing spectrum policies and evaluate its  policies and rules to address obstacles to spectrum access by tribal  communities. With regard to tribal lands, the plan recommended that FCC  increase its commitment to government-to-government consultation with  tribal leaders and consider increasing tribal representation in  telecommunications planning. FCC established the Office of Native  Affairs and Policy in July 2010 to promote the deployment and adoption of  communication services and technologies to all native communities, by,  among other things, ensuring consultation with tribal governments  pursuant to FCC policy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Few Tribal Entities Had Obtained Licensed Spectrum and Face Barriers Doing So", "paragraphs": ["For our November 2018 report, we identified 18 tribal entities from FCC\u2019s  license data that held active spectrum licenses in bands that can be used  to provide broadband services as of September 2018. Of those 18, 4  obtained the spectrum through a secondary market transaction and 2  from an FCC spectrum auction.", "We interviewed 16 tribal entities that were using wireless technologies at  the time to provide service, and 14 told us that they were accessing  unlicensed spectrum to do so. While representatives from most of the 16  tribal entities reported some advantages of unlicensed spectrum, such as  the spectrum is available at no cost, they also discussed their  experiences with the limitations of unlicensed spectrum, including issues  with interference and speed or capacity. Some of the stakeholders we  contacted and FCC have highlighted the importance of exclusive-use  licensed spectrum for tribal entities. For example, FCC\u2019s Office of Native  Affairs and Policy reported in 2012 that unlicensed spectrum is not an  option across all tribal lands and that tribal access to robust licensed  spectrum is a critical need. In addition, representatives from the  stakeholders we interviewed told us that there are non-technological  benefits for tribal entities to obtain greater access to licensed spectrum,  including: enhanced ability to deliver additional Internet services, enhanced ability to sell or lease spectrum for profit, and additional opportunities to obtain federal funding that requires entities  to hold or have access to licensed spectrum.", "Furthermore, two tribal stakeholders and representatives from several  tribal entities told us that having access to licensed spectrum would  enable tribes to exercise their rights to sovereignty and self- determination. For example, representatives from four of the tribal entities  told us that having access to licensed spectrum would ensure that  spectrum is being used in a way that aligns with tribal goals and  community needs, further supporting their rights to self-determination.", "In our November 2018 report, we described barriers tribal entities  reported facing in accessing licensed spectrum. First, representatives  from tribal entities we contacted said that obtaining a spectrum license  through an auction was too expensive for many tribal entities. Indeed,  over 60 percent (983 of 1,611) of the winning bids from a 2015 spectrum  auction were more than $1 million. Representatives from some tribal  entities told us they were unable to obtain financing to participate in  auctions because tribal governments cannot use tribal lands as collateral  to obtain loans and that participating in spectrum auctions requires  auction-specific expertise that tribal entities may not have.", "Second, tribal entities reported facing barriers obtaining spectrum through  secondary market transactions. Most of the spectrum allocated for  commercial use has already been assigned through spectrum auctions  and other mechanisms to private providers that may not be providing  service on tribal lands. As such, there may be tribal areas where  providers hold licenses for bands but are not using the spectrum to  provide Internet service. All three of the tribal associations we contacted  confirmed that there were unused spectrum licenses over tribal lands,  and representatives from a nationwide provider indicated that they only  deploy services if there is a business case to support doing so.  Accordingly, the secondary market is one of few avenues available to  tribal entities that would like to access licensed spectrum. However,  representatives from tribal entities we contacted told us it could be  challenging to participate in the secondary market because there is a lack  of willing sellers, license holders are not easily identified, and tribal  entities may not be aware of how to pursue secondary market  transactions. For example, representatives from a tribal entity that had  been successful in obtaining a license through the secondary market told  us that an Indian-owned telecommunications consulting company was  pivotal in identifying the license holder and facilitating the transaction, and  without such assistance, the transaction would not have occurred."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCC Had Taken Some Actions to Increase Access, but Does Not Collect or Communicate Key Spectrum-Related Information to Tribal Entities", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our November 2018 report, we found that FCC had taken  some actions to increase tribal access to spectrum.

As of July 12, 2019, FCC  had not adopted new rules or taken further action on the 2011  rulemaking.", "FCC issued a proposed rulemaking in May 2018 that sought  comment on establishing a priority window for tribal nations located in  rural areas to obtain a license in the Educational Broadband Service  spectrum band (also known as the 2.5 GHz band). In the proposed  rulemaking, FCC had found that significant portions of this band were  not being used, primarily in rural areas. FCC had not finalized this rule  at the time of our November 2018 report, but published a draft order in  June 2019 that would establish a priority filing window so that tribal  entities could get access to unassigned spectrum in the 2.5 GHz band  on rural tribal lands prior to an FCC auction. FCC adopted this order  on July 10, 2019.", "FCC\u2019s Office of Native Affairs and Policy conducts training,  consultation, and outreach to tribal entities on spectrum-related  issues, such as communicating with tribal entities prior to FCC  auctions or when FCC regulatory actions or policies would affect tribal  governments and spectrum over their lands.", "FCC\u2019s 2010 National Broadband Plan stated that ongoing measurement  of spectrum utilization should be developed to better understand how  spectrum resources are being used because some studies indicated that  spectrum goes unused in many places much of the time. The plan stated  that any spectrum utilization studies that FCC conducts should identify  tribal lands as distinct entities. The plan also stated that FCC should  make data available that would promote a robust secondary market for  spectrum licenses, such as information on how and to whom spectrum is  allocated on tribal lands. In FCC\u2019s 2018 strategic plan, FCC stated that  it will implement ongoing initiatives that will assist in spectrum policy  planning and decision making, promote a robust secondary market in  spectrum, and improve communications services in all areas of the United  States, including tribal areas. Additionally, federal internal control  standards state that agencies should use quality information, including  information that is complete, to inform the decision-making processes and  communicate with external entities. Tribal governments are an example  of such external entities.", "However, in our 2018 report, we found that FCC had not consistently  collected data related to tribal access to spectrum or communicated  important information to tribes. In particular:", "FCC did not collect data on whether spectrum license-holders or  auction applicants are tribal entities. Without this information, FCC did  not have a comprehensive understanding of the extent that tribal  entities are attempting to obtain or access licensed spectrum or have  been successful at obtaining and accessing it.", "FCC did not analyze the extent that unused licensed spectrum exists  over tribal lands, even though FCC had the information\u2014broadband  availability data from providers and information on geographic areas  covered by spectrum licenses\u2014needed for such an analysis.  Although FCC officials told us evaluating the effectiveness of FCC\u2019s  secondary market policies is a way to increase the use of unused  spectrum, FCC\u2019s approach did not include an analysis of unused  spectrum licenses on tribal lands. As a result, FCC\u2019s evaluations of  the secondary market may not have accurately reflected how its  policies affect tribal entities. Because the secondary market is one of  few ways for tribal entities to access licensed spectrum, such an  assessment would enable FCC to better promote a robust secondary  market that provides opportunities for tribes to access spectrum.", "FCC did not communicate information to tribes that could benefit them  in their efforts to obtain spectrum in the secondary market. As  described earlier, the secondary market is a significant mechanism for  tribal entities to obtain spectrum licenses, but representatives from the  tribal entities we interviewed reported challenges related to  participating in the secondary market, such as not knowing whom to  contact should they wish to engage in a secondary market transaction  to obtain a spectrum license.", "We concluded that FCC\u2019s efforts to promote and support tribal entities\u2019  access to spectrum had done little to increase tribal use of spectrum. In  particular, FCC lacked information that could help inform its decision- making processes related to spectrum policy planning, which is intended  to improve communications services in all areas of the United States,  including tribal lands. By collecting data on the extent that tribal entities  are obtaining and accessing spectrum, FCC could better understand tribal  spectrum issues and use this information as it implements ongoing  spectrum initiatives. Furthermore, the ability of tribal governments to  make informed spectrum planning decisions and to participate in  secondary market transactions is diminished without information from  FCC on the spectrum transactions that occur over tribal lands. Providing  this information directly to tribal entities could enable them to enter into  leasing, partnership, or other arrangements to obtain spectrum. In our  November 2018 report, we recommended that FCC (1) collect data on the  extent that tribal entities are obtaining and accessing spectrum and use  this information as FCC implements ongoing spectrum initiatives; (2)  analyze data to better understand the extent that unused spectrum  licenses exist over tribal lands, such as by analyzing the data for a  sample of tribal lands, and as appropriate use this information to inform  its oversight of the secondary market; and (3) make information on  spectrum-license holders more accessible and easy to understand for  interested parties, including tribal entities, to promote their ability to  purchase or lease spectrum licenses from other providers. FCC agreed  with these recommendations and described the actions it plans to take to  implement them. For example, according to FCC, it will consider ways to  collect data on the extent to which tribal entities are obtaining and  accessing spectrum; analyze data from a sample of spectrum licenses on  tribal lands to inform FCC\u2019s spectrum policies; and transition to a more  user-friendly system for its licensing data.", "Chairman Hoeven, Vice Chairman Udall, and Members of the Committee,  this concludes my prepared statement.
