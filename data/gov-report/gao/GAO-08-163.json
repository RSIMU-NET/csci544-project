This report examines (1) concentration in the market for public company audits, (2) the potential for smaller accounting firms' growth to ease market concentration, and (3) proposals that have been offered by others for easing concentration and the barriers facing smaller firms in expanding their market shares. GAO surveyed a random sample of almost 600 large, medium, and small public companies on their experiences with their auditors. GAO also interviewed the four largest accounting firms and surveyed all other U.S. accounting firms that audit at least one public company. GAO also developed an econometric model that analyzed the extent to which various factors, including concentration and new auditing requirements, affected fee levels. To supplement this work, GAO interviewed market participants, including public companies, investors, accounting firms, academics, and regulators.

According to GAO's survey, 82 percent of large public companies--the Fortune 1000--saw their choice of auditor as limited to three or fewer firms, and about 60 percent viewed competition in their audit market as insufficient. Most small public companies reported being satisfied with the auditor choices available to them. Although audit fees rose significantly in recent years, market participants attributed these increases to expanding accounting and auditing requirements and higher costs for accounting firm personnel. GAO's model also found that factors other than concentration appeared to explain audit fee levels. Public company officials generally acknowledged that audit quality had increased. Although current concentration does not appear to be having a significant adverse effect, the loss of another large firm would further reduce large companies' auditor choice and could affect audit fee competitiveness. Smaller accounting firms face various challenges in expanding to audit more public companies, although most are not interested in these clients. As a result, concentration in the audit market for large public companies is likely to continue. Large public companies that GAO surveyed said that smaller firms lacked the capacity and technical expertise they wanted in an auditor. Audit firms that GAO surveyed said that adding qualified staff and increasing their name recognition were the most significant challenges they faced in expanding their public company audit practices. Some have taken steps to increase their capacity by joining networks with other firms. Academics and business groups have put forth proposals to reduce audit market concentration and address challenges facing smaller accounting firms, including capping auditors' liability and creating an office to share technical expertise. Market participants raised questions about the overall effectiveness, feasibility, and benefit of these proposals, and none were widely supported. Given the lack of significant adverse effect of concentration in the current environment and that no clear consensus exists on how to reduce concentration, no compelling need for immediate action appears to exist."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Public and investor confidence in the reliability of financial reporting is  critical to the effective functioning of the U.S. capital markets. Federal  securities laws require that a company raising capital by issuing securities  to the public have an independent public accountant perform an audit of  the company\u2019s financial statements to provide reasonable assurance about  whether the financial statements are fairly presented. Since the 1980s, a  small number of large U.S. accounting firms have traditionally performed  audits for the vast majority of the public company market (when measured  by the share of total audit fees collected). Among the clients of these large  firms are almost all of the largest U.S. companies. The small number of  large accounting firms performing such audits has decreased as a result of  mergers and the dissolution of one firm, falling from eight in the 1980s to  four today. These four firms\u2014referred to here as the largest firms\u2014have  thousands of partners, tens of thousands of employees, offices located  around the world, and each had more than one thousand public company  audit clients for 2006. The next four largest accounting firms\u2014referred to  here as midsize firms\u2014operate nationally, and to some extent,  internationally but have substantially fewer employees and partners, and  each had less than 500 public company audit clients for 2006.

In 2003,  we conducted a study (mandated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act) on  consolidation that had occurred in the accounting profession. Our study  followed the dissolution of one of the then-five largest accounting firms,  Arthur Andersen. At that time, we found that although audits for large  public companies were highly concentrated among the largest accounting  firms, the market for audit services appeared competitive according to  various indicators. Given that several years have passed since the  dissolution of Arthur Andersen and the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,  which introduced reforms to public reporting and auditing, this report  provides an update on the trends in the market for public company audits  that we identified in 2003 in the market for public company audits. Among  the changes affecting the audit market that have occurred since our last  report are additional requirements for public companies and auditors to  assess, report on and attest to companies\u2019 internal control practices,  restrictions intended to ensure the accounting firm\u2019s independence that  limit public companies\u2019 ability to use their auditors for certain other  services, and the creation of a new oversight body for accounting firms.", "We prepared this report under the Comptroller General\u2019s authority to  conduct evaluations on his own initiative as part of a continued effort to  assist Congress in reviewing concentration in the market for public  company audits.

We developed an econometric  model to evaluate how various factors, including the level of market  concentration, could explain fees that public companies paid to their  auditors. To obtain the views of public companies and accounting firms on  audit competition and challenges, we conducted two surveys. First, we  surveyed a random sample of 595 of more than 6,000 publicly held  companies, some of which had recently changed auditors. Our sample  included large public companies (those in the Fortune 1000); midsize  public companies (those outside the Fortune 1000 with market  capitalizations\u2014the value of the total outstanding shares of stock\u2014above  $75 million); and small companies with less than $75 million in market  capitalization. Our response rate for this survey was 73 percent. Because  our survey was based on a random sample of the population, it is subject  to sampling errors. The likely range of these errors for any survey  statistics is no greater than plus or minus 12 percentage points, unless  otherwise noted. In addition, we surveyed representatives of all 434 U.S.  accounting firms that audited at least 1 public company in 2006 and were  registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  (PCAOB). Our response rate was 58 percent.Results from our survey of  accounting firms are limited to those midsize and smaller firms with five  or more public company clients.

The Securities Act of 1933  and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 established the principle of full  disclosure, which requires that public companies provide full and accurate  information to the investing public. Under these federal securities laws,  public companies are responsible for the preparation and content of  financial statements that are complete and accurate and are presented in  conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  Financial statements, which disclose a company\u2019s financial position  (balance sheet), stockholders\u2019 equity, results of operations (income  statement), and cash flows, are an essential component of the disclosure  system on which the U.S. capital and credit markets are based.", "Federal securities laws also require that public companies have the  financial statements they prepare audited by an independent public  accountant. The independent public accountant\u2019s audit is critical to the  financial reporting process because the audit subjects companies\u2019  financial statements to scrutiny on behalf of shareholders and creditors to  whom company management is accountable. The auditor is the  independent link between management and those who rely on the  financial statements. The statutory independent audit requirement, in  effect, grants a franchise to the nation\u2019s public accountants, as an audit  opinion on a public company\u2019s financial statements must be secured  before an issuer of securities can go to market, have the securities listed  on the nation\u2019s stock exchanges, or comply with the reporting  requirements of the securities laws.", "Having auditors attest to the reliability of financial statements of public  companies is intended to increase public and investor confidence in the  fairness of the financial information. Moreover, investors and other users  of financial statements expect auditors to bring integrity, independence,  objectivity, and professional competence to the financial reporting process  and to prevent the issuance of misleading financial statements. The  resulting sense of confidence in companies\u2019 audited financial statements,  which is key to the efficient functioning of the markets for public  companies\u2019 securities, can exist only if reasonable investors perceive  auditors as independent and expert professionals who will conduct  thorough audits. In the event that companies are alleged to have misled  the public or presented falsified financial information, the accounting  firms that performed those audits are also sometimes included in suits  brought by investors or actions pursued by regulators.", "Accounting Firm Structure  Most accounting firms that audit public companies in the United States are  organized as partnerships. Unlike corporations, which generally issue  stock to their shareholders in exchange for capital to conduct their  operations, accounting firms structured as partnerships obtain capital  from their partners. To conduct an audit of a public company, an  accounting firm establishes an engagement team that is typically headed  by a lead audit partner and includes a concurring audit partner, audit staff  and managers, and, as needed, technical specialists. The lead audit partner  has responsibility for decision making on significant auditing, accounting,  and reporting matters that affect the financial statements; reviewing the  audit work; and maintaining regular contact with management and the  audit committee. The concurring audit partner is responsible for reviewing  the audit.", "To provide technical assistance to engagement teams, the larger  accounting firms have national offices staffed with experts in auditing and  accounting standards. These national offices are made up of accounting  and auditing technical specialists who assist engagement teams by  responding to complex questions, researching answers, and providing  guidance to individual audit teams.

The reforms include the following:    Section 404(a) of the Act requires that in each annual financial report filed  with SEC the management of public companies must (1) state its  responsibility for establishing and maintaining an adequate internal  control structure and procedures for financial reporting and (2) assess the  effectiveness of its internal control structure and procedures for financial  reporting.", "Section 404(b) requires that each public company\u2019s accounting firm must  attest to and report on management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of  internal control over financial reporting.", "A separate provision prohibits the company\u2019s auditor from providing  certain nonaudit services, including bookkeeping, appraisal services,  actuarial services, and internal audit outsourcing services.", "Another provision requires the mandatory rotation of lead and reviewing  audit partners after they have provided audit services to a particular public  company for 5 consecutive years.", "The Act also established the PCAOB as a private-sector nonprofit  organization subject to SEC oversight.

Since 2004, PCAOB has  conducted full scope inspections of accounting firms of all sizes.

According to PCAOB, Auditing Standard No. 2 was more costly than  expected, and the related effort involved in complying with it appeared to  be more than was necessary to conduct an effective audit of internal  controls over financial reporting. Specifically, PCAOB noted that auditors  were focusing on minutiae that were unlikely to affect the financial  statements and that audit programs were not tailored to small companies.  Auditing Standard No. 5, which is expected to address some of the cost  issues, became effective for audits in fiscal years ending on or after  November 15, 2007.", "Other accounting and financial reporting standards and requirements have  been implemented in recent years.

Larger public companies  indicated that the industry expertise and technical capability that they  sought in an auditor generally meant that their choices were limited to the  largest accounting firms in this highly concentrated market. Those we  spoke to and surveyed had mixed views on the extent to which the current  level of concentration adversely affected choice, audit prices, and audit  quality, but most participants did not see the current level of  concentration as significantly affecting these aspects of competition.

Using data from Audit Analytics, which collects  audit fee information from the filings public companies submit to SEC, we  found that the largest firms collected 94 percent of all audit fees paid by  public companies in 2006, slightly less than the 96 percent they collected  in 2002. As a result, the overall market continues to represent a tight  oligopoly, which is a concentrated market in which a small number of  firms have large enough market share to potentially use their market  power, either unilaterally or through collusion, to greatly influence price  and other business practices to their advantage.", "A key statistical measure used to assess market concentration and the  potential for firms to exercise market power is the Hirschman-Herfindahl  Index (HHI). The HHI for a market is calculated using the various market  shares (in the case of the audit market, measured by total audit fees  collected) of all the firms competing to offer services within that market.  In 2006, the HHI for the overall market for public company audits was  2,300. According to guidelines issued jointly by the Department of Justice  (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), an HHI above 1,800  indicates a highly concentrated market. Analyzing the audit market by  industry and region reveals that many industries have similarly highly  concentrated audit markets. For example, in 2006 the HHI of the audit  market in the utilities sector was over 3,500. The audit market was also  similarly concentrated for companies across six major geographic regions  of the country. (App. II contains further discussion of overall market  concentration.)", "In addition to the potential for dominant competitors to use their market  power to charge uncompetitive prices, highly concentrated markets also  raise other competitive concerns. For example, firms with significant  market power have the potential to reduce the quality of their products or  to cut back on the services they provide because the lack of competitive  alternatives would limit customers\u2019 ability to obtain services elsewhere.  Similarly, firms that dominate a given market may feel less pressure to  introduce innovative products and services. Finally, a highly concentrated  market increases the potential for the dominant firms to engage in  coordinated actions that can harm clients, such as coordinating actions to  influence the development of standards that raise costs for their  customers. However, the presence of high market shares does not  necessarily mean that anticompetitive behavior is occurring. Competition  in an oligopoly can also be intense and result in a market with competitive  prices, innovation, and high-quality products.", "Markets with a few large dominant firms can form for natural reasons and  can also be beneficial. As we reported in 2003, several key factors spurred  the increased consolidation in the market that resulted from the mergers  of the eight largest accounting firms in the 1980s and 1990s. For example,  as U.S. corporations have increasingly expanded into global markets, their  need for accounting firms with greater global reach also increased. Many  public companies have developed more complex operations and financial  transactions, such as the increasing use of derivatives and other financial  arrangements, and these changes increased the need for auditors with  specialized industry-specific or technical expertise.", "Further, some accounting firms wanted to modernize their operations,  build their staff capacity, and spread their risk over a broader capital base,  and large firms can achieve greater economies of scale by spreading  certain fixed costs, such as staff training, over an expanded client base.  Therefore, the size of the largest firms may enable them to develop  sufficient technical expertise and the ability to conduct work globally to  meet the needs of complex multinational audit clients and to do so at a  lower cost than could be provided by smaller audit firms.

In addition, 80 percent cited the auditor\u2019s  technical capability with accounting principles and auditing standards and  67 percent cited the need for industry specialization or expertise as of  great or very great importance as reasons why they would not consider a  midsize or smaller auditor. Similarly, in interviews and comments on our  survey, some company officials noted that they chose the largest firms  because they believed that these firms had the attributes the company  needed, while midsize and smaller firms did not. For example, the audit  committee chair of one large company commented that the company  would not choose a midsize or smaller auditor because the company\u2019s  industry was very complex, and, therefore, the company needed an auditor  with specific industry experience. The chief financial officer (CFO) of  another large public company noted that because of the company\u2019s size  and international operations, the largest firms were the only viable  options.", "The need to comply with independence standards and other factors can  further limit the number of choices available to large public companies for  their auditor of record. As required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, SEC  rules, and auditing standards, a company\u2019s auditor must be independent.  Public companies are prohibited from obtaining audits from firms that  also provide the company with certain nonaudit services, including  bookkeeping, design and implementation of financial information systems,  valuation services, and internal audit outsourcing services. Ninety-six  percent of large companies reported that they used one of the largest firms  for some nonaudit services, potentially further reducing the number of  choices for their auditor of record if they are precluded from using those  firms due to independence rules. According to our survey data, 27 percent  of large public companies that had not switched auditors since 2003  reported that the independence restrictions on using certain firms were of  at least some importance in deciding to retain their current auditor,  although only 9 percent listed these restrictions as of great or very great  importance.", "In interviews, officials from a few large public companies indicated that  they maintained options while remaining in compliance with  independence requirements by not using at least one of the largest firms  for prohibited nonaudit services, in some cases by using smaller firms for  these services. In this way, they hoped to ensure that they would have at  least one independent firm to choose if they had to change auditors. Some  interviewees we spoke with suggested that companies using only the  largest firms for both audit and nonaudit services could be unnecessarily  limiting their choices because many midsize and smaller firms were  capable of handling certain nonaudit services.", "A few companies may feel constrained in their choice of auditors for other  reasons. For example, some companies\u2019 desire to avoid using a  competitor\u2019s auditor can reduce the number of choices they have,  according to several industry participants. However, over 90 percent of the  large companies that responded to our 2003 survey were willing to choose  a firm as their auditor regardless of whether that firm also audited a  competitor. Further, some market participants and regulators noted that  in certain industries, large public companies may have more limited  choices because one or more of the largest firms was not very active in  those industries. For example, in 2006 one of the largest firms held 77  percent of the market for public company audits in the agriculture,  forestry, fishing, and hunting industry, while another of the largest firms  had only a 1 percent market share.", "Consistent with reporting that they were not likely to use midsize and  smaller audit firms, large companies also indicated that they had a limited  number of firms to choose from, and many believed that this number was  generally insufficient. According to our survey, about 80 percent of large  public companies said that they would have three or fewer accounting  firms (other than their current auditor of record) to choose from if they  needed to change primary auditors. The proportion of large companies  that reported having three or fewer choices was about the same for both  domestic and multinational companies. Furthermore, over half (57  percent) of large public companies stated that the number of accounting  firms that they could choose among was not adequate. Forty-three  percent of large public companies that responded to the survey we  conducted for our 2003 report indicated that they had insufficient choices  for an auditor of record.", "Large public companies\u2019 preference for the largest audit firms was  illustrated by the firms these companies choose when they changed  auditors. Although some public companies maintain their relationships  with the same audit firm for many years, there were almost 6,000 changes  in auditors between 2003 and 2007. We analyzed data from Audit Analytics  and found that 102 large companies had changed auditors between  January 1, 2003, and June 30, 2007. Of the 95 large companies that were  previously audited by one of the largest firms, 88 (93 percent) of these  companies changed from one of the largest auditors to another of the  largest auditors. Only seven switched to a midsize auditor. The remaining  seven large companies that changed auditors during this period had been  previously audited by a midsize or smaller auditor, but switched to one of  the largest firms.

Many  of the market participants we interviewed felt that competition was quite  strong and not significantly affected by concentration. For example,  representatives of the largest firms told us that they competed intensely  with each other. Some of the public company officials we spoke with also  saw the audit market as competitive. For example, the audit committee  chair of one large public company said that although a major competitor  was lost when Arthur Andersen dissolved, the market had adjusted and  was still competitive. However, several companies we surveyed  commented that, with few firms to choose from, the market did not have  enough competition. For example, the CFO of a midsize company said that  consolidation in the market had led to a decline of value-added services by  auditors and an escalation of audit pricing. Another company official that  responded to our survey stated that the audit market was an oligopoly  with little price competition and too little concern for service. The CFO for  another company commented on our survey that something needed to be  done to force more competition, while a different CFO commented that  although more competition was desirable, action to break up the largest  firms was not warranted.", "Based on the results of our survey, 57 percent of public companies thought  that the level of competition for audit services for their company was  sufficient. However, while about 70 percent of small companies saw the  level of competition as adequate, only about 40 percent of large Fortune  1000 companies shared this view (fig. 7). About half of midsize companies  saw the level of competition as adequate.", "Although highly concentrated markets typically raise concerns about price  competition, our analysis indicated that other factors appeared to explain  the increases in audit fees in recent years. Data on audit fees paid by  public companies show that these fees have increased substantially since  2000, a period that included the dissolution of Arthur Andersen and the  passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Audit fees have risen for companies of  all sizes and across industries and regions. However, the fee increases, as  a percentage of client company assets, were most dramatic for smaller  companies. Between 2000 and 2006, median fees as a percent of assets  more than quadrupled (a 334 percent increase) for companies with less  than $100 million in revenue, more than tripled (a 239 percent increase)  for companies with revenue between $100 million and $1 billion, and  almost tripled (a 190 percent increase) for companies with revenue over  $1 billion. After these increases, median fees were about $111,000 for  companies with less than $100 million in revenue, $900,000 for companies  with revenue between $100 million and $1 billion, and $3,156,000 for  companies with revenue greater than $1 billion. Although audit fees  increased significantly on average for all sizes of firms, the amount that  companies spend on audit fees generally remains a small portion of their  overall revenues.", "Market participants and others cited various factors that had contributed  to recent fee increases. The most significant factors that staff from the  largest firms cited in interviews were the increasing complexity of  accounting and financial reporting standards and the additional  requirements of new auditing standards that had increased the amount of  work involved in audits and the need for technical expertise. For example,  one of the largest firms noted that the number of experts on staff at the  firm more than doubled between 2003 and 2007. Many market participants  noted similar factors as impacting fees. The largest firms also cited the  increased costs of attracting and retaining talented staff and specialists.  Similarly, midsize and smaller firms reported on our survey that the top  four factors increasing their costs since 2003 were complexity of  accounting principles and auditing standards, additional requirements of  new standards, the time and effort necessary to prepare for PCAOB  inspections, and the costs incurred to hire and train staff.", "In particular, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which increased the amount of audit  work performed at public companies, was frequently cited as one of the  major factors in the recent fee increases. This legislation introduced a  number of new requirements for audits of public companies, and many  market participants told us that the new requirements accounted for much  of the fee increases since 2002. Representatives from some audit firms we  spoke to said that section 404 of the act had, where implemented,  substantially increased their workload and costs for implementing new  methodologies and staff training. (Section 404 requires the accounting firm  to attest to, and report on, management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness  of its internal control over financial reporting.) In addition, 84 percent of  companies reporting that their audit fees had increased since 2003  indicated on our survey that the audit of internal control over financial  reporting was one of the reasons for the increase. To date, only larger  public companies\u2014which SEC calls accelerated filers\u2014have had to  comply with the new requirements for assessing these internal controls.  Smaller public companies\u2014those considered nonaccelerated filers\u2014are  scheduled to fully comply with the new audit requirements in annual  filings after December 15, 2008, potentially resulting in further increases in  these companies\u2019 audit fees.", "Independence requirements may also have changed the way some firms  price audits, resulting in rising fees. DOJ officials and others stated that  audit firms were now less likely to price audits as a loss leader in order to  sell nonaudit services because of these requirements in the Sarbanes- Oxley Act."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effects of Concentration on Fee Increases", "paragraphs": ["The results of an econometric model we developed to assess the extent to  which various factors could be influencing audit fees in recent years also  indicated that factors other than concentration appear to explain audit  fees. Our model analyzes the extent to which audit fees paid by public  companies appear to be explained by a variety of factors that could affect  those fees. For example, our model included such variables as the  concentration within the audit market for a particular industry (as  measured by HHI), the size of the company, whether the company\u2019s fiscal  year ends during a busy period, whether the company completed a  Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 internal control audit, the number of times the  company changed auditors, and other factors that could affect the  company\u2019s audit fees. Appendix V explains our model in detail.", "The results of our model suggested that higher audit market concentration  across individual industries was not associated with higher audit fees.  Specifically, our model found that, in general, public companies operating  in industrial sectors with more concentrated audit markets were not  paying higher audit fees than companies in sectors with less concentrated  audit markets. However, for the largest companies we found some  evidence that audit market concentration within an industry did have a  very small effect on fees. More precisely, after isolating the effect of other  factors, our model results indicated that large companies in industries  with audit markets that were 10 percent more concentrated than the  average industry sector (as measured by HHI) paid on average about half a  percent more in audit fees than other large companies. By comparison, the  model results also indicated, after controlling for other factors, that  companies that completed the Sarbanes-Oxley section 404 internal control  audit, which increased the amount of work done by auditors, paid roughly  45 percent more in audit fees than companies that did not complete the  internal control audit. This finding was consistent with estimates from  other studies that examined the effect of the implementation of this  requirement. Although factors other than concentration appeared to  explain audit fee levels, the available data did not allow us to conclude  that audit fees were competitive overall or to determine whether  individual companies were charged competitive fees.", "In addition, the analysis we conducted with our model indicated that  individual accounting firms appeared to charge higher fees when they  controlled a large portion of the audit market within a particular industry,  but this finding did not appear to be the result of anticompetitive pricing.  Rather, it appeared that these firms may have been charging a premium for  their industry expertise. We found that the price premiums received by  accounting firms that collected a large share of the revenues from audits  conducted within an industry sector were similar across all sizes of  companies, including those small companies that typically have many  accounting firms to choose from. This suggests that higher fees are more  likely the result of these firms being able to charge premiums as the result  of their industry expertise rather than of anticompetitive pricing. For  example, a firm with industry expertise may develop and market audit  services that are specific to clients in the industry and that provide a level  of service exceeding that provided by other firms in the same industry. If  this is the case, the higher fees these firms may charge could reflect the  specialized service they offer rather than anticompetitive pricing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Potential Effects of Concentration", "paragraphs": ["While some market participants expressed concern that concentration in  the audit market could negatively affect audit quality, others said that the  quality of audits had improved in recent years. According to DOJ and FTC  guidance on analyzing market competitiveness, sellers with market power  may lessen competition on dimensions other than price, such as product  quality, service, or innovation. However, even in highly concentrated  markets, including oligopolies, competition among sellers may lead to  innovation and high-quality products. The effect of concentration on audit  quality is difficult to measure empirically. However, we asked market  participants about their views on several aspects of audit quality, including  the experience and technical capability of their accounting firm\u2019s partners  and staff, the firm\u2019s ability to efficiently respond to client needs, and its  ability and willingness to appropriately identify and surface material  reporting issues in financial reports. Most market participants who  commented on audit quality in our interviews and many on our survey said  that audit quality had improved, which some attributed to the Sarbanes- Oxley Act. However, four others, including some academics, a former  regulatory official, and an industry consultant with whom we spoke,  expressed concerns that concentration was affecting the quality of audits.  For example, one said that that having only four firms in the market  resulted in low-quality audits that harmed investors. Appendix IV provides  more information on trends in audit costs and quality.", "High concentration may also diminish competition because dominant  sellers, in this case accounting firms, may be more likely or more able to  engage in coordinated interaction in ways that can affect auditing  practices or prices. Some market participants we interviewed expressed  concern that the prevalence of the largest firms on advisory panels or  standard-setting bodies enabled them to coordinate actions to influence  the development of new standards in a way that hampered competition or  otherwise disadvantaged public company audit clients. However, most  market participants we spoke to did not express such concerns."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Further Concentration Could Adversely Affect Audit Fees and Limit Choices", "paragraphs": ["Although the current level of concentration does not appear to be having  significant adverse effect, the potential for further concentration in the  audit market did raise concerns. Further concentration could arise as a  result of several events. For example, audit firms face the risk that civil  litigation could result in their insolvency or inability to continue  operations. Since 1998, audit firms may have paid at least ten settlements  or awards of $100 million or more that have resulted from private  litigation. In addition, a jury recently found BDO Seidman, the sixth- largest accounting firm, liable for $521.7 million in damages, although BDO  Seidman plans to appeal the verdict. Several officials we spoke with  commented that litigation increases during periods of high market  volatility. As a result, litigation-related costs to auditors could increase in  the case of an economic downturn. Officials from the largest firms told us  that litigation costs have significantly increased since 2003. Some officials  we interviewed from the largest firms and the insurance industry told us  that the largest firms do not have insurance coverage to protect against the  largest claims, both because insurance at that level is not available and  because of fear that having more insurance could induce plaintiffs to seek  higher awards. However, full information on litigation risk and costs and  accounting firms\u2019 insurance coverage is not publicly available, so we could  not identify the magnitude of the risk that litigation poses to these firms.  Some officials we spoke with also suggested that litigation could damage a  firm\u2019s reputation, causing the firm to fail if its clients began seeking other  firms for their audits. For example, according to some academics,  Laventhol & Horwath, the seventh-largest accounting firm in 1990,  declared bankruptcy that year in part due to a series of class action  lawsuits that resulted in a loss of reputation and the firm\u2019s inability to  attract new work.", "Firms also face the risk of failure from federal or state regulatory action  and criminal prosecution, among other reasons. State Boards of  Accountancy can revoke accounting firms\u2019 licenses to practice in their  state for violating board rules or for other reasons. Under SEC rules,  convicted felons shall be suspended from practicing before the SEC, so an  accounting firm convicted of a felony could not continue to audit its SEC- registered clients and would likely fail. Further, an indictment for a felony  could contribute to a firm\u2019s failure if clients began leaving in anticipation  of a potential conviction. For example, many of Arthur Andersen\u2019s clients  had changed to a different auditor even before Arthur Andersen was  convicted of obstruction of justice for destroying Enron-related  documents in 2002. The market for public company audits could also  become significantly more concentrated if any of the existing largest or  midsize firms chose to discontinue operations for other reasons.  Mismanagement of a firm\u2019s financial obligations could also lead to its  bankruptcy.", "As has happened in the past, a merger could also lead to further  concentration in the market. DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission  published Horizontal Merger Guidelines for use in determining whether a  merger is likely substantially to lessen competition. The guidelines include  steps for assessing whether the merger would significantly increase  concentration, the potential for any of the firms to exercise market power  after the merger, and the difficulty of entry into the market for new firms.  Concerns that DOJ raised about a proposed merger of accounting firms in  the late 1990s suggest that the agency would be less likely to approve any  future mergers among the largest accounting firms. In 1997, shortly after  two of the six largest firms at the time, PriceWaterhouse and Coopers &  Lybrand, announced their intention to merge, two of the other six largest  firms, KPMG Peat Marwick and Ernst & Young, also announced plans to  combine their operations. According to the DOJ Antitrust Division\u2019s 1999  Annual Report, these two firms abandoned their plans to merge after DOJ  raised concerns that this merger would have \u201cadversely affected  competition by reducing the already limited number of firms providing  auditing services to Fortune 1000 companies.\u201d", "The loss of another large accounting firm from the audit market could  significantly increase the level of concentration. If one of the largest firms  failed or left the market, concentration would increase if many of this  firm\u2019s public company clients engaged one of the remaining three largest  audit firms. To illustrate the effect of such an event, we simulated the  effect of the failure or exit of the smallest of the largest firms. To  redistribute the clients of this firm, we assigned them to other firms in the  same proportion as the clients of Arthur Andersen were distributed after  that firm dissolved. Under this scenario, the resulting HHI of the overall  audit market would rise from 2,300 to roughly 3,000, substantially above  what DOJ considers to be a highly concentrated market. The increase in  HHI would likely be even greater in the large public company market.  Higher concentration could increase the risk that the remaining large  accounting firms would exercise market power to raise prices and  coordinate their actions among themselves to the detriment of their  clients. Appendix II contains more information on our simulations of the  result of the loss of one of the largest firms through a failure or a merger.", "Further concentration could have various other negative effects on public  companies and their investors. While many public companies and other  market participants indicated that there were enough auditors to choose  from, further concentration would leave large companies with potentially  only one or two choices for a new auditor, as our survey indicated that 86  percent of large companies would likely only use one of the largest  auditors if they had to switch auditors. Many interviewees said that this  would not be enough choices. As in the current market, independence  rules that prevent companies from using as their auditor firms that provide  them with certain nonaudit services could further limit these choices.  Also, companies in specialized industries could have fewer choices if some  accounting firms do not operate in those industries. Many we interviewed  also suggested that further concentration would reduce competition and  potentially increase the cost of an audit.", "Further, public company officials stated that changing auditors could be  costly for the companies involved. According to our survey results, 44  percent of large companies that had not recently changed auditors  reported that the burdens of time, effort, and cost were of great or very  great importance in their decision not to change auditors. In addition, only  102 large (Fortune 1000) public company auditor changes occurred  between January 2003 and June 2007, suggesting that large companies  preferred to use the same auditor from year to year. If the market were  further concentrated among three large firms, the affected companies  would need to change auditors and incur the associated costs. Similarly, to  the extent the remaining largest firms resigned as auditors for smaller  clients as they absorbed the failed firm\u2019s larger clients, these small  companies would incur the costs of finding a new auditor. Finally, the  market disruption caused by a firm failure or exit from the market could  affect companies\u2019 abilities to obtain timely audits of their financial  statements, reducing the audited financial information available to  investors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Could Act to Mitigate the Effects of Further Concentration", "paragraphs": ["If the number of large accounting firms were to decrease, the  organizations with oversight responsibility for the public company audit  market could act to mitigate the effects on the market.

SEC is responsible for protecting  investors, maintaining efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation  and also oversees PCAOB. Similarly, PCAOB is responsible for overseeing  the auditors of public companies in order to protect the interests of  investors and further the public interest in the preparation of informative,  fair, and independent audit reports. In the event of the loss of one of the  largest firms, the agencies\u2019 actions could vary according to the facts and  circumstances of the situation, such as the size of the affected firm, the  reason the firm left the market, or the degree to which an orderly  transition of audit services was available. For example, in order to support  its mission and address temporary market disruptions and difficulties  companies had in meeting financial reporting deadlines when Arthur  Andersen was indicted in 2002, SEC issued a number of measures  providing guidance and regulatory relief to Arthur Andersen\u2019s clients. This  rulemaking provided Arthur Andersen clients with extended deadlines to  submit audited financial statements and hotline numbers for companies  and investors to call with questions.

As part of ensuring  competition in the U.S. economy, the Antitrust Division of DOJ is  responsible for enforcing antitrust laws. Under DOJ merger guidelines, the  division would challenge any merger likely to substantially lessen  competition. DOJ officials explained that action on their part would only  occur if a merger among current competitors was proposed or if an  antitrust or criminal case was brought against one of the firms. As a result,  the division has not been formally reviewing trends in the market. When  asked whether the Antitrust Division might review the competitiveness of  the market if one of the largest firms exited the market for reasons other  than a merger, an official stated that the division might analyze the market  using publicly available information and offer its expertise and advice to  other regulators.

Second,  firms that do want to audit large public companies continue to face  challenges to expanding their public company practices. Chief among  these challenges are having adequate capacity (e.g., staff and geographic  coverage) to audit large public companies, acquiring the needed technical  capability and industry specialization, and developing name recognition  and a reputation for this kind of work.

According to  our survey of the 118 accounting firms with at least 5 public company  clients, the 4 midsize firms and 79 percent of the smaller firms that  responded expected to increase the number of public companies they  audited in the next 5 years. However, when asked if they would consider  expanding their market share if they had the opportunity to add  acceptable clients, 74 percent of both midsize and smaller firms said that  they were not interested in serving as auditor for additional large public  companies. Some firms and market participants told us that the  possibility of being sued created a disincentive against entering or  expanding in the audit market for large companies because the failure of  one large client could jeopardize the audit firm. Large companies can pose  a greater financial risk to their auditors than smaller clients. The amount  shareholders recovered in settlements of class action lawsuits against  public companies and their auditors tends to increase in proportion to the  company\u2019s market capitalization. Midsize and smaller firms also may not  be seeking to perform audits of large public companies, because they have  had new opportunities to provide companies of all sizes with nonaudit  services, such as consulting, since 2003.

Specifically, 92 percent of those companies said that the  inability of midsize and smaller firms to handle their company\u2019s size and  complexity was of great or very great importance in their unwillingness to  consider them (fig. 8). For example, the audit committee chairman of a  large technology manufacturing company we interviewed said that an  auditor smaller than the company\u2019s current large firm could not audit a  business of his company\u2019s size. Similarly, the audit committee chair for a  large automobile manufacturer told us that large companies did not  consider using midsize firms because those firms did not have the number  of experienced staff that the firms had.", "To meaningfully reduce concentration in the large public company market,  then, midsize and smaller firms would need to staff audit teams that were  large enough to serve multiple large public companies. However, these  firms face challenges recruiting and retaining staff. As we reported in 2003,  it is not uncommon for an audit of a large national or multinational public  company to require hundreds of staff, and most midsize and smaller firms  do not have the staff resources necessary to commit hundreds of  employees to a single client. As table 2 illustrates, the largest firms have  significantly more capacity, in terms of staff and partners than midsize and  smaller firms.", "To approach the capacity of the largest firms, midsize and smaller firms  would have to grow substantially. The gap between the largest and midsize  firms is significant, however. Combined, the four midsize firms still have  over 2,600 fewer professional staff than the smallest of the largest firms,  KPMG. The midsize firms also have significantly fewer public company  clients. But midsize and smaller firms told us that obtaining additional  staff to expand their audit practices was difficult. Specifically, 58 percent  of midsize and smaller firms responding to our survey that want to audit  large public companies said that the ability to recruit and retain qualified  staff was a great or very great impediment to expansion. While the  representatives from the largest firms told us that they also faced this  challenge, one smaller firm representative said obtaining sufficient  numbers of staff was particularly difficult for smaller firms, which have  fewer resources (salaries and benefits) to use in competing for talent with  the largest firms, the public companies themselves, and others needing  public accountants. According to many market participants we  interviewed, the demand for qualified accountants has increased  significantly in recent years because accounting firms, including the  largest firms, need additional staff to conduct the audits of internal  controls required in section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Firms are not  only competing with each other for staff, but also with public companies  that need additional accounting staff to comply with certain requirements  of Sarbanes-Oxley. In addition, firms are competing with regulators who  need more staff to oversee the accounting profession.

These firms have established alternative practice structures, in  which the firm engaged in attest services is closely aligned with another  organization that performs other nonaudit services. One example is where  owners of the accounting firm sell the nonaudit portion of their practice to  a new entity, which may be publicly or privately owned. The work the firm  previously conducted is then essentially divided into two separately  controlled entities, one of which conducts most of the firm\u2019s nonaudit and  attest work, while the other conducts audits. Owners of the audit firm are  also employees of the nonaudit entity, and the audit firm generally leases  employees, office space, equipment, administrative support, and other  services from this entity. Audit firms gain additional access to capital from  the initial sale of the nonaudit entity or loans from the new entity that they  can use for acquisitions and other growth activities. However, some firms  with alternative practice structures told us that getting approval for their  organizations from some states was challenging and that they were subject  to additional scrutiny because their uncommon structure raised concerns  about independence.

All midsize firms and  over 60 percent of smaller firms responding to our survey belonged to a  network or affiliation, generally to increase competitiveness with larger  firms and extend their national and international reach.

For example, according to  our survey results, approximately 40 percent of public companies had  used their current auditor for at least 5 years, and almost a quarter had  used their current auditor for at least 10 years. While generally proposed  as a means of enhancing auditor independence by periodically bringing in  a new auditor for a \u201cfresh look\u201d at a company\u2019s financial statements,  mandatory rotation could potentially reduce concentration to the extent  that it provided more opportunities for midsize and smaller firms to  compete to provide audit services to public companies.", "Although mandatory auditor rotation would increase opportunities to  compete, it would not increase the number of viable competitors, and  views on its effectiveness as a means of reducing concentration were  mixed.

One person we interviewed noted that mandatory rotation  might not be feasible, since some companies had very limited choices due  in part to the restrictions of independence requirements.

In our 2003  report, we found that many audit firms and large companies surveyed  believed that mandatory rotation would increase initial year audit-related  costs by more than 30 percent. For example, we reported that audit firms  could incur higher marketing costs as they increased efforts to acquire or  retain clients. With new auditors every few years, public companies also  would incur higher support costs for assisting the new audit firm in  understanding the companies\u2019 operations, systems, and financial reporting  practices. Others expressed concern that new audit firms would need a  period of time to become fully familiar with a client\u2019s operations.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires mandatory rotation of lead and reviewing  audit partners after they have provided audit services to a particular public  company for five consecutive years.

This insurance would  provide coverage for investors in the public company against losses  suffered as a result of problems with the company\u2019s published financial  statements. Insurance companies, to lower their risk of such losses, would  then appoint and pay audit firms to attest to the accuracy of the financial  statements.

Opponents of extending outside ownership argue that,  without CPAs as majority owners, external shareholders might make  business decisions in a firm\u2019s economic interests that compromise its  independence for purposes of performing audits. One report  recommending consideration of changing outside ownership rules  indicated that appropriate safeguards would be needed to ensure  independence and audit quality. Several of the midsize and smaller firms  we interviewed said that access to capital did not pose a significant  impediment to expansion, because firms currently raised sufficient capital  through traditional channels such as loans backed by the partnership and,  in some cases, alternative practice structures. In fact, 61 percent of  midsize and smaller firm survey respondents said that increasing their  access to capital would be only slightly effective or not at all effective in  helping them increase the number of audit clients they served.

The AICPA is working with NASBA  and the state boards of accountancy to develop uniform legislation and  accountancy rules in each state to eliminate some of the barriers that exist  for CPAs who perform work across state lines. If the current initiative is  successful, the regulatory burdens associated with licensing will be  significantly improved.

Audit Analytics also provides a comprehensive listing of all  reported auditor changes that includes data on the date of change,  departing auditor, engaged auditor, nature of the change (dismissal or  resignation), any going concern flags or other accounting issues, and any  fee disputes or fee reductions. Using this database, we identified 5,867  auditor changes from January 2003 through June 30, 2007. For our  econometric model we also used data on audit opinions (going concern  opinions), restatements, 404 compliance (internal control), and late filers  that were also maintained by Ives Group in the Audit Analytics database.  We used Public Accounting Report (PAR) and other sources for the  remaining trend and descriptive analyses, including the analyses of the top  and lower sizes of accounting firms, contained in the report.", "In addition to reviewing the data collection methods and management  controls over these databases that we conducted for a previous report, we  assessed the reliability of the current data in other ways. We performed  several checks to verify the reliability of the Audit Analytics databases. For  example, we crosschecked random samples from each of the Audit  Analytics databases with SEC proxy and annual filings and other publicly  available information. Additionally, we compared our HHI calculations  based on Audit Analytics data to HHI calculations based on the Who  Audits America database, a directory of public companies with detailed  information for each company, including the auditor of record, maintained  by Spencer Phelps of Data Financial Press. We also spoke with other users  of the Audit Analytics data. While we determined that these data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of presenting trends in audit fees and  auditor changes, as we have previously reported, the descriptive statistics  on audit fees contained in the report should be viewed in light of a number  of data challenges. First, the Audit Analytics audit fee database does not  include fees for companies that did not disclose audit fees paid to their  independent auditor in an SEC filing. Second, some companies included  in the database\u2014especially small companies\u2014did not report complete  financial data. We handled missing data by dropping companies with  incomplete financial data from any analysis involving the use of such data.  As a result, we are not dealing with the entire population included in the  Audit Analytics database but rather with a large subset. Because of these  issues, the results should be viewed as estimates of audit fees and market  concentration based on a large sample rather than precise estimates based  on the entire population. Moreover, the sample we used to produce the  estimates throughout the report does not include funds, trusts,  nonoperating companies, or subsidiaries of another public company.", "For a previous report we performed similar, albeit more limited, tests on  PAR data, and concluded that they were appropriate for its use in this  report. However, these data are self-reported by the accounting firms,  which are not subject to the same reporting and financial disclosure  requirements as SEC registrants. Moreover, while the data are suitable for  comparing the largest firms to midsize and smaller firms, caution should  be used in comparing midsize and smaller firms to each other.", "To assess the market for new publicly traded companies we obtained data  using SEC\u2019s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval (EDGAR)  system, a database that includes information on registered companies\u2019  initial public offering (IPO) in the United States.

In a previous report, we  crosschecked these data with NASDAQ data on NASDAQ IPOs for  consistency. For our analysis of size of the companies going public and  their auditor of record, we dropped companies from our analysis that were  missing the requisite revenue data in the database. We looked at a sample  of these companies and concluded that companies dropped from our  sample are largely companies that used either pro forma or partial year  revenues in their preliminary filings, or were funds, trusts or banks. While  funds and trust have been eliminated in our empirical work in this report,  some publicly traded banks have also been excluded in our analysis of  IPOs by size.

In  addition, we determined during our pretests that many of the survey  questions were irrelevant for the largest firms, so we administered  selected survey questions orally to representatives of each of the largest  firms and conducted indepth individual interviews with representatives of  each of these firms. That information is reported separately from the firm  survey results.", "While the accounting firm survey results came from a census of the  population, we limited our analysis in this report to the 118 responding  firms with 5 or more publicly held clients because the response rate of  firms with only 1-4 clients was significantly lower (53 percent) than for the  larger firms (65 percent). Our analysis suggested that those small firms  responding were different from those that did not, in terms of geography  and number of clients. We were concerned that some small firms did not  respond because the prospect of more auditing work for publicly held  clients did not appeal to them and, thus, they found the survey request  irrelevant. The small firms that responded could have answered the survey  questions differently than the nonresponding small firms would have. As a  result, reporting percentages based on responding small firms with one to  four clients could introduce bias into results if those results were  generalized to all accounting firms that audited at least one publicly traded  company.", "In addition to potential nonresponse bias, there are other practical  difficulties in conducting any survey that may contribute to errors in  survey results.

An HHI for a  market is calculated using the various market shares of the firms  competing to offer goods or services within it. According to merger  guidelines issued by DOJ, an HHI below 1,000 indicates a market that is  predisposed to perform competitively and one that is unlikely to have  adverse competitive effects. An HHI between 1,000 and 1,800 indicates a  moderately concentrated market, while an HHI above 1,800 indicates a  highly concentrated market.", "As shown in figure 12, the HHI in 2006 for the overall market for public  company audits\u2014as determined based on the audit fees collected by  accounting firms auditing public companies\u2014was 2,300, a level  considered to be significantly concentrated. This represents a slight  decline since 2002, when the audit market\u2019s HHI was around 2,390 after it  peaked following the dissolution of Arthur Andersen.", "We also found that analyzing the audit market by region and industry  reveals that many industries were similarly highly concentrated and that  concentration also exists across six major geographic regions of the  country. We segmented the market into distinct economic sector  (industry) audits and distinct regional audits. As figure 13 illustrates, all  industries are above the threshold for significant market power and have  generally shown some improvement since 2002, but some sectors are  significantly more concentrated than others. A number of these industry- specific markets would not only be considered tight oligopolies but would  also be considered dominant firm markets (one firm holding over 60  percent of the market with no significant competitors).

When simulating the effect of the failure or exit of the smallest of  the largest firms, we distributed the clients of the failed firm among the  remaining firms in the same proportion as the clients of Arthur Andersen  were distributed after that firm dissolved. Under this scenario, the  resulting HHI of the overall audit market would rise from 2,300 to roughly  3,000 which is considerably further above what DOJ considers to be a  concentrated market (fig. 14). Further, figure 14 shows that if we segment  the audit market by size, that the increase in HHI would be greatest among  large companies. Higher concentration could increase the risk that the  remaining large accounting firms could exercise market power to raise  prices and coordinate their actions among themselves to the detriment of  their clients.", "The figure also shows that a merger between two of the largest firms could  significantly increase concentration for the overall audit market. To  identify the result of such a merger, we simulated the effect of a merger  between the two smallest of the largest firms and found that HHI for the  market as a whole would increase from 2,300 to 3,124, which is again well  above DOJ\u2019s threshold for a concentrated market and higher than in the  case of a firm failure.

Therefore, despite  the largest firms experiencing a net loss of over one thousand clients, most  of these were smaller companies with lower revenues and audit fees.  Companies that changed from one of the largest firms to another had  average revenues of over $1 billion, while companies that changed from  one of the largest firms to a smaller firm had average revenues of just over  $60 million.", "Within these changes, we also found that midsize firms gained clients in  particular regions and industries.

Many large companies also reported changing  auditors to obtain a better working relationship with their auditor (67  percent). Others said they changed auditors to obtain lower fees (26  percent).", "In interviews, representatives of public companies, accounting firms, and  other market participants attributed many of the midsize and small  company auditor changes to the aftermath of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,  which, among other things, enhanced auditor independence and required  increased reviews of public companies\u2019 internal controls (which initially  affected larger public companies) and prompted the largest firms to focus  on providing those services to their large clients. This increased workload  increased the largest firms\u2019 costs and fees and necessitated that some  smaller public companies expand their options and look to midsize or  smaller firms. Officials from two of the largest firms told us that they did  make changes to their client portfolios in the period after Sarbanes-Oxley  was passed, including resigning as auditor of record from some clients for  risk or capacity constraint reasons. On our survey of the over 400 U.S.  accounting firms that audit public companies, midsize and smaller  accounting firms responding also reported resigning as auditor of record  for risk mitigation reasons, specific issues with the client, or fees being  insufficient to cover audit costs. Midsize and small companies that  recently changed auditors indicated on our survey that they did so to  obtain better customer service, a better working relationship with their  auditor, lower fees or because their auditor resigned. In addition, some  companies commented that they changed because their auditor was too  busy and expensive for them or because their auditor wanted to focus on  larger clients.

Many market participants have noted that the number and complexity of  requirements associated with accounting and auditing standards have  contributed to firms performing new and additional procedures to help  comply with the new requirements and reduce audit and litigation risk.  Since 2000, public companies and their auditor have, where applicable,  had to deal with new and expanded accounting standards dealing with  hedge activities, derivatives, other financial instruments, impaired assets,  and intangible assets including goodwill. In addition, firms have had to  deal with new and expanded audit standards related to fraud, audit  documentation, and fair value measurements and disclosures.", "In response to the demise of Arthur Andersen in 2002, more than 1,000 of  its public company audit clients had to find new audit firms. In addition, as  firms and public companies adjust to market-related changes following the  2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, auditor change has continued. Our analysis of  auditor changes found that between 2003 and 2007 almost 6,000 auditor  changes occurred. Echoing our 2003 study of audit firm rotation, some  market participants we spoke to said that changing auditors would  increase public company audit-related costs. As part of our 2003 study of  audit firm rotation, we surveyed large (Fortune 1000) public companies  and firms that audited more than 10 public companies and more than 67  percent of companies and firms responded that a change in auditor would  likely increase firms\u2019 initial year audit costs and public company audit  support costs\u2014taken together\u2014by more than 30 percent. In addition,  accounting firms we have spoken to and surveyed cited increased costs of  attracting and retaining talented audit staff and specialists. Many of those  commenting on this factor linked the higher costs of attracting and  retaining talented staff to the increased capacity-related demands facing  the firms associated with implementing the Act.", "Also, the Act established a new major audit requirement that has  significantly expanded the scope of financial audits for public companies  by requiring, among other things, that their auditor assess and report on  the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting (Section  404b). Representatives from all sizes of accounting firms we spoke to said  that the new audit requirement related to internal controls, which  generally became effective for the 2004 audits of the largest public  companies, has resulted in a substantial increase in their workload and  related costs associated with additional audit staff and expertise, and audit  methodologies. Until 2008, auditors for only the largest public companies,  those considered to be accelerated filers, have had to comply with the new  internal control audit-related requirements. Firms that audit smaller public  companies, those considered nonaccelerated filers, are scheduled to  comply with the new audit requirement with annual filings after December  15, 2008. When effective for smaller public companies, the requirement is  expected to further increase their audit fees.", "The accounting firms that we have spoken to noted that, in addition to  requiring new internal control work; other requirements of the Act have  contributed to increased audit costs and the fees charged to public  companies. The Act established a new regulatory oversight structure for  firms that audit public companies with the creation of the Public Company  Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). To date, PCAOB has established  firm registration and inspection programs and has adopted auditing  standards that Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved  that registered firms must follow. Several firms we have spoken to since  the PCAOB was established noted that they have incurred additional costs  to support PCAOB-related activities, as well as respond to the audit  documentation standard and a shorter audit partner rotation period  mandated by the Act. In addition, since a key provision of the Act made  public company audit committees responsible for hiring the firm and  overseeing the audit, some firms we spoke to said they have seen a  substantial increase in their staffs\u2019 interaction with the audit committees  members, which has added to audit costs.", "A number of firms we spoke to also noted that the Act\u2019s stricter  independence requirements may have contributed to higher audit fees by  causing some firms to change the way they price their audit service. The  stricter independence requirements were intended to significantly limit the  types of nonaudit services firms can sell to their audit clients without  impairing the firm\u2019s independence. Department of Justice (DOJ) officials  and others we spoke to stated that the significant limits on firms\u2019  opportunities to sell audit clients nonaudit services make them less likely  to under price audits as a loss leader. To the extent that firms in the past  have underpriced their audits expecting to sell nonaudit services which  are now prohibited, it is reasonable to believe that these firms have  increased their audit fees to cover their audit cost.", "The results of our survey of midsize and smaller firms and our discussions  with the largest firms generally confirmed the factors that have increased  the audit cost fees. All four of the largest firms reported in interviews that  the increasing complexity of accounting and auditing standards and the  additional requirements of new standards were factors having a significant  effect on the cost of audits. The largest firms and the other firms differed  only slightly on other factors that have significantly affected audit cost.  The largest firms noted costs to attract and retain talented staff and costs  related to litigation as the two other top factors contributing to increased  audit costs. In addition to the requirements of new standards and the price  of talent, the other firms cited the time and effort to prepare for the  PCAOB inspection and the complexity of accounting principles and  auditing standards as their top factors.", "The results of our survey of the audit committee chairs of over 500 public  companies also show that increases in audit hours and rates charged by  firms and other factors have led to increased audit fees.

Concerns raised with  the audits of public companies in the 1970s focused attention on the need  to improve the quality control mechanisms used by firms to ensure that  professional standards were being met.

All of the  largest firms and over 80 percent of the midsize and 3 accounting firms  responding to our survey said that, since 2003, it has been harder to  maintain audit quality.

In addition, we added  information on these companies using the Late Filer, Internal Control,  Restatement, Auditor Change and Audit Opinion databases also  maintained by Audit Analytics. In this manner, we were able to include  information on the risk and auditing characteristics of the companies as  additional control variables in the resultant econometric model. Moreover,  a panel data set, that is data pooled across all companies over the 2000 to  2006 period, allowed us to account for variances in audit fees across  companies and over time as well as use techniques that enhance the  validity of the parameter estimates. We deleted from our sample various  entities including funds, plans and trusts, subsidiaries with parent data  already included in the database, blank check and nonoperating entities  and duplicate entries. Table 8 reports the descriptive statistics on the  resultant panel data set. Because some companies either did not exist until  the later years, merged with other companies, went private, entered into  bankruptcy, or otherwise failed to report at some point over the period,  not all the companies have the requisite data for each year. Moreover,  companies were not required to report audit fees until 2001. As a result,  the panel is unbalanced. The public companies clients remaining in our  sample were used initially to investigate two related questions:    When other important factors influencing audit fees are accounted for, do  companies operating in more concentrated sectors of the economy pay  higher fees?", "When other important factors influencing audit fees are accounted for, do  companies audited by accounting firms with higher market shares in a  certain sector pay higher fees?", "Our panel data approach investigates industry (economic sector)  concentration (HHI) from 2000 to 2006 since there is variation in the  degree of concentration across industries and within industries over time.

Sullivan (2007) takes a different approach in addressing anticompetitive  pricing, using auditor change (switching) data from 1988 to 2005 and  similarly attributes audit fee increases to the new regulatory environment  and increased effort on the part of auditors rather than anticompetitive  behavior. Asthana, et al.

In a random effects  model, in this context, these individual effects are captured through  treating the intercept as a random variable with a unique error term for  each company. While each model has its advantages and disadvantages,  the random effects model is appropriate when we can plausibly assume  that the individual effects (which are unobserved and unmeasured in the  model) are uncorrelated with the explanatory variables that are measured  and included in the model.

However, when the true model is random-effects  model, pooling the observations in this manner using OLS produces biased  estimates that are also not efficient when compared to the more complex  generalized least squares (GLS) procedure (outlined below). Moreover, the  pooled OLS model is also susceptible to omitted variables bias.

In other words, it is assumed that the intercept is a random outcome variable that is a  function of a mean value plus a random error. the new disturbance term which incorporates the individual random effect  of each company, the appropriate method for producing estimates is GLS.  Feasible GLS derives an estimate of the covariance matrix of the error  term and uses the information (heteroscedasticity from repeated  observations of the same crosssection unit) to estimate the coefficients in  the model.", "The drawback to this approach is that it forces one to make the strong  assumption that the unobserved random-effects are uncorrelated with the  explanatory variables in the model E(Xit\u03b1) = 0 in addition to the standard  assumption E(Xit\u03b7it) = 0). As a result, the random effect treatment of the  panel data may also produce estimates that suffer from the inconsistency  due to omitted variables.

If this is the case, the random-effect model may  produce more appropriate estimates than the fixed-effects model.

We also interacted  the HHI variable with measures of company size, to allow for distinct  effects for large and small companies.

Similarly, in some econometric specifications we dropped  Agricultural and Warehousing companies as the numbers fell below 30 and  15 companies respectively in most years.", "While the HHI variable captures the impact of overall concentration on  audit fees, the market share variable can capture two distinct types of  effects.

On the other  hand, high market share could result in economies of scale and lower  costs which are then passed on to clients in the form of lower audit fees.  In the case of the market for audit services the market share variable  could also proxy for industry expertise (quality-differentiated services),  which would justify higher fees. Therefore, a positive relationship between  market share and audit fees would be consistent with both market power  and an expertise or quality premium. We further explore this with a  number of models to determine whether individual market power  (monopolistic pricing) or industry expertise most likely explains the  positive relationship we find between market share and audit fees (see  results section).", "Although, the fixed effect model guards against time invariant omitted  variables bias, it is always advisable to explore possible causes of  heterogeneity.

As a  result, we also included time period fixed effects to control for regulatory  changes, changes in the scope and complexity of audit engagements,  changes in the manner in which, the audit was priced or audit fees were  categorized and recorded, and other forces that can be captured by a  company-invariant (consistent across companies) fixed effect. Collectively  the variables and techniques help capture the characteristics, of the public  company client (effect of the amount of effort required by the auditor), of  the auditing industry (e.g., pricing differences across accounting firms), of  the auditor (e.g., knowledge advantages due to specialization) and of the  engagement (e.g., busy season) and help explain the variation in audit fees  across companies. All appropriate variables were adjusted for inflation.", "As table 11 shows there is a low degree of correlation between most of the  explanatory variables in the panel. However, there is a high degree of  correlation between the market share variable, the dummy indicating  whether a firm is an industry expert and the dummy variable which  indicates whether a company is audited by one of the largest accounting  firms (Big 4/5 dummy variable). In fact, principal components analysis  suggests the Big 4/5 dummy variable adds very little to a model once the  market share variable is included. As a result the Big 4/5 is not included in  a given model if the market share variable is also being estimated. We also  drop the expert variable in some specifications for sensitivity analysis in  lieu of the somewhat high correlation with the market share and the  interaction variables. It should be noted however, the correlation between  HHI and market share is relatively low."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results", "paragraphs": ["We ran roughly 100 different models, including several pooled OLS,  random-effects and fixed-effects models with varied specifications as  sensitivity tests. Given the number of issues that plague the simple OLS  model and that formal tests strongly rejected the pooled OLS model in  favor of fixed-effects, we do not report the pooled OLS results in this  appendix. Moreover, since the Hausman test overwhelming rejected the  random-effects in favor of the fixed-effect model, we present the results  for the random-effects models for comparison only. Note, also, that the  time invariant variables (Z), such as number of auditor changes over the  period, and industry and region indicators appear in the random-effects  model but not in the fixed-effects models as these variables are collinear  with the unique fixed-effect estimated for each company. The random and  fixed-effects models run on 2002 through 2006 data suggest that, in  general, companies operating in more concentrated industries do not pay  higher fees when other important drivers of audit fees are included (table  12). Moreover, focusing on the fixed-effect results, we found this result to  hold even when we included 2000 and 2001 in the analysis or if we include  only the post Sarbanes-Oxley years (2003-2006). In all cases, the HHI is  positive but statistically insignificant.", "To explore the differences between different size companies, we also  interacted the HHI variable with a dummy variable that indicates whether  a company exceeds $250 million in assets. This variable is both positive  and significant, indicating that larger firms operating in more concentrated  industries may pay higher fees, but we note that this effect is very small.  Because this was an arbitrary definition which would include a number of  companies considered small by other sources, we varied our definition of  large using various cut-off values. When we defined large as $1 billion or  $3.5 billion in assets the results remain the same. Consistently the  estimates suggest that a 10 percent increase in the HHI for large  companies results in an increase in audit fees around 0.5 percent. Since  the dissolution of Andersen initiated an increase in the HHI by about 18  percent, the model suggests that the result on audit fees for the largest  public companies would have been less than 1 percent. By comparison  the estimated effect of the 404 internal control requirements resulted in  roughly a 45 percent increase in audit fees, while issuing a financial  restatement is associated roughly with an 11 percent increase in fees.  However, when we ran the models only on companies with assets greater  than $250 million in assets (or any other sub-samples of large companies  defined by assets) we found no relationship between industry  concentration and audit fees for these companies. When we defined large  by some measures we found a negative but statistically insignificant  relationship between HHI and audit fees. Further, when we ran the model  only on clients of the largest firms the coefficients on the interaction term  were either much smaller (substantively insignificant) or statistically  insignificant. As a result, this finding regarding the price impact for larger  companies may not be robust and should be interpreted with caution.", "The models also consistently show that accounting firms holding a larger  market share of the industry in which the public company operates are  found to charge higher fees (Sharef is statistically significant and positive  in each instance) but this leaves open the question as to whether the  empirical evidence is supportive of expertise-quality-differentiated  services or anticompetitive pricing. Unfortunately, these are extremely  difficult issues to address in a rigorous and comprehensive manner.  Similar to other studies, we investigated the audit fee-market share  relationship in various large and small client segments of the market. We  found that market share-related price premium also exists in the small  client segment of the market and these premiums were not statistically  different from those that existed in the large company segment of the  market (table 13). Even when we ran the model on companies with assets  below 100 million, we still found a statistically significant and positive  relationship between the auditor\u2019s share of the market (Sharef) and audit  fees. It should be noted that the HHI for this sector was well below the  critical value of 1,000 in 2006. Therefore, the persistence of this positive  relationship between market share and audit fees in all segments of the  market\u2014even those predisposed to perform competitively\u2014suggest it is  more likely due to industry or technical expertise (quality-differentiated  service) and in the case of the larger firms, brand-name reputation. A firm  with industry expertise may exploit its specialization by developing and  marketing audit-related services which are specific to clients in the  industry and provide a higher level of assurance. If this is the case, such  firms could earn a return on this investment by charging higher audit fees  than other firms and remain competitive for the most relevant  opportunities, even at a premium price. It should be noted that Oxera  (2006), using similar modeling techniques, interpreted this association as  an indicator of market power in U.K. audit markets but did not  acknowledge the presence of quality differentiated services and industry  expertise nor report any further investigation to unpack the relationship.", "We conducted a number of sensitivity test to examine the robustness of  our findings. For example, we used the log of audit fees\u2014net of audit- related fees\u2014as the dependent variable and obtained similar results. To  investigate whether multicollinearity was an issue, we ran a number of  models excluding the potentially collinear variables and obtained similar  results. We also altered the functional form, using market share instead of  logged market share, and obtained results which more strongly supported  our initial results. Because estimated coefficients of the fee determinants  could differ significantly for the largest and other auditors, we also ran the  model separately for these two classes of firms. To address potential  problems of endogeneity we estimated the relationships using two-stage  least squares. Finally, to investigate whether the results were sensitive to  unbalanced nature of the data\u2014the number of companies in the sample  for each industry differs across the years\u2014we estimated the model using  sample probability weights, where the weights are based on the number of  companies in a given industry (or alternatively total revenues, fees paid or  assets). In our case, this amounted to de-meaning the data to obtain the  fixed effects estimates and then running weighted least squares.  Consistently, we found no evidence of a positive and significant  relationship between industry concentration and audit fees.", "While our analysis suggests the increase in audit fees appears largely  unrelated to supplier concentration, it is difficult to determine the extent  to which audit pricing is consistent with competitive behavior with the  available data because of all the contemporaneous changes occurring in  the market. As a result these results should be interpreted with a  consideration of a number of limitations. First, this is an aggregate  analysis and, therefore, does not demonstrate that all companies receive a  competitive price (local markets may be important). Moreover, the  absence of evidence of uncompetitive pricing does not necessarily imply  that we can conclude that the market is competitive from a pricing  perspective. Second, our results are based on one battery of tests focused  on industry (economic sector) concentration and this does not imply that  it is the definitive way to examine the effect of concentration on prices.  While evidence suggests that some sectors have particularly complex  audits and sector-specific expertise is an important determinant of auditor  choice many companies are involved in activities that cut across multiple  industries raising some questions about characterizing industry-specific  markets as unique audit markets, especially for large firms. Our  investigation was undertaken because it appeared to be a useful way to  consider the effect of concentration given the available data. Additional  data may allow for analysis that may address the issue more completely or  more validly. Third, although the fixed effect estimator is robust to the  omission of any relevant time-invariant variables and we have explained  over 90 percent of the variation in fees, if there are time-varying  differences that have been omitted, the results could be biased. As  complexity and inherent risk of the individual client audits could vary over  time there is some concern that financial variables traditionally included  in the literature could not be included here (e.g. number of subsidiaries,  inventory and receivables). However, this threat should be balanced  against the power of the fixed-effects estimator which may capture some  of this effect.", "Fourth, our conclusion that quality-differentiation and industry expertise  most likely better explains market dynamics than monopolistic pricing,  while standard in the academic literature, critically hinges on the smaller  company segment actually performing competitively. We, like others, have  made this assumption based on the low HHI statistics computed for that  segment of the market and other market indicators that suggest  competitive pricing for smaller companies. Users of this report should  note that our tests of individual market power were limited and the results  should be interpreted in light of this limitation. Fifth, potential  measurement error in the audit fee variable, assuming it is random, would  make it more likely that we would conclude that a relationship does not  exist when indeed it does. Given the large amount of the variation in fees  we have explained and the techniques we have used, this (statistical  validity) would not appear to be an issue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contacts named above, Cody Goebel and John J.
