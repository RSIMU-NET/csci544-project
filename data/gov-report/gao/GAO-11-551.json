TRS is similar to TRICARE Standard, a fee-forservice option, and TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider option. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 directed GAO to review TRS education and access to care for TRS beneficiaries. This report examines (1) how DOD ensures that members of the Selected Reserve are informed about TRS and (2) how DOD monitors and evaluates access to civilian providers for TRS beneficiaries. GAO reviewed and analyzed documents and evaluated an analysis of claims conducted by DOD. GAO also interviewed officials with the TRICARE Management Activity (TMA), the DOD entity responsible for managing TRICARE; the regional TRICARE contractors; the Office of Reserve Affairs; and the seven reserve components."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not have reasonable assurance that Selected Reserve members are informed about TRS. A 2007 policy designated the reserve components as having responsibility for providing information about TRS to Selected Reserve members on an annual basis; however, officials from three of the seven components told GAO that they were unaware of this policy. Additionally, only one of the reserve components had a designated official at the headquarters level acting as a central point of contact for TRICARE education, including TRS. Without centralized responsibility for TRS education, the reserve components cannot ensure that all eligible Selected Reserve members are receiving information about the TRS program. Compounding this, the managed care support contractors that manage civilian health care are limited in their ability to educate all reserve component units in their regions as required by their contracts because they do not have access to comprehensive information about these units, and some units choose not to use the contractors to help educate their members about TRS. Nonetheless, DOD officials stated that they were satisfied with the contractors' efforts to educate units upon request and to conduct outreach. Lastly, it is difficult to determine whether Selected Reserve members are knowledgeable about TRS because the results of two DOD surveys that gauged members' awareness of the program may not be representative because of low response rates. Because TRS is the same benefit as the TRICARE Standard and Extra options, DOD monitors access to civilian providers for TRS beneficiaries in conjunction with TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries. DOD has mainly used feedback mechanisms, such as surveys, to gauge access to civilian providers for these beneficiaries in the absence of access standards for these options. GAO found that jointly monitoring access for these two beneficiary groups is reasonable because a claims analysis showed that TRS beneficiaries and TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries had similar health care utilization. Also, during the course of GAO's review, TMA initiated other efforts that specifically evaluated access to civilian providers for the Selected Reserve population and TRS beneficiaries, including mapping the locations of Selected Reserve members in relation to areas with TRICARE provider networks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Defense direct the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs to develop a policy requiring each reserve component to designate a centralized point of contact for TRS education.

GAO modified the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the Department of Defense  (DOD) has increasingly relied on reservists to support military operations,  such as the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. This has increased both the  number of Selected Reserve members\u2014reservists who are considered  essential to wartime missions\u2014supporting DOD\u2019s current operations and  the duration of their active duty service. In recognition of this, Congress  has increased the health care benefits available to reservists and their  dependents, which include spouses and dependent children. Specifically,  the National Defense Authorization Acts (NDAA) for Fiscal Years 2004,  2005, 2006, 2007, and 2010 expanded the number of reservists (including  Selected Reserve members) who qualify for TRICARE, the military health  care program, and increased the period of time during which they qualify.  The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2005 also established the program that DOD has  named TRICARE Reserve Select (TRS), under which most members of the  Selected Reserve who are not on active duty may purchase TRICARE  coverage after the coverage associated with active duty expires. TRS is the  same benefit as TRICARE Standard, a fee-for-service option, and  TRICARE Extra, a preferred provider option. All three programs cover  health care provided at military treatment facilities and through civilian  providers, both network (TRICARE Extra) and nonnetwork (TRICARE  Standard). However, unlike TRICARE beneficiaries who use the Standard  and Extra options, TRS enrollees must pay a monthly premium to receive  benefits through the program.", "In recent years, members of Congress have raised questions about  whether reservists, including members of the Selected Reserve, and their  dependents have adequate health insurance when they are not on active  duty and whether they have difficulty using TRICARE when they are  eligible for it. In 2007, we reported on several issues related to reservists,  including DOD\u2019s efforts to educate reservists and their dependents about  TRICARE benefits, reservists\u2019 satisfaction with TRICARE, and the types of  problems that reservists and their dependents experienced when using  TRICARE. We found that DOD was challenged by the task of educating  reservists and their dependents about TRICARE, and we recommended  that DOD provide additional briefings to reservists and their dependents at  specific points in time. We also found that although a majority of reservists  reported that they were satisfied with their TRICARE benefits, some  reservists reported experiencing difficulties when using the program,  including difficulties understanding TRICARE and difficulties finding a  health care provider who accepted TRICARE beneficiaries as patients.", "Subsequent to our report, the Commission on the National Guard and  Reserves reported to Congress in 2008 that the TRICARE Management  Activity (TMA)\u2014the DOD entity responsible for overseeing TRICARE\u2014 and the military services have not undertaken a sufficiently aggressive  educational campaign to help improve reservists\u2019 and their families\u2019  understanding of TRICARE. More recently, groups representing military  beneficiaries told us that they were concerned about low enrollment  within the TRS program, and they questioned whether these enrollment  numbers are the result of inadequate education by DOD. According to  DOD officials, as of December 2010 about 392,000 of the more than  858,000 members of the Selected Reserve were eligible for TRS. Of these,  about 67,000 members (17 percent) had purchased TRS.", "Concerns have also been expressed about the ability of reservists,  including members of the Selected Reserve, and their families to access  health care. In June 2007, DOD\u2019s Task Force on Mental Health reported  that because reservists may not live near military installations like their  active duty counterparts, they may not have convenient access to military  hospitals and clinics and must instead rely more heavily on civilian  providers for their care.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 directed us to review DOD\u2019s efforts to  educate members of the Selected Reserve about TRS and access to care  for TRS beneficiaries. This report examines (1) how DOD ensures that  members of the Selected Reserve are informed about TRS and (2) how  DOD monitors and evaluates access to civilian providers for TRS  beneficiaries.", "To examine how DOD ensures that members of the Selected Reserve are  informed about TRS and how DOD monitors and evaluates access to  civilian providers for TRS beneficiaries, we interviewed officials with  TMA, including officials with the Warrior Support Branch, which oversees  TRS, and officials with the Communications and Customer Service  Division, which develops educational materials for TRICARE. We also  interviewed officials from each of the three TRICARE Regional Offices  (North, South, and West) and officials from each of the regional managed  care support contractors (contractors) to discuss their responsibilities for  educating members of the Selected Reserve about TRICARE, including  TRS, and for ensuring beneficiaries\u2019 access to civilian providers. In  addition, we interviewed officials from military coalition groups that  represent reservists to obtain their perspectives on TRS education and  access to civilian providers. To identify TRS education requirements, we  reviewed and analyzed policy guidelines and TRICARE managed care  support contract requirements. We interviewed officials with the Office of  Reserve Affairs as well as officials from each of the seven reserve  components to identify their role in educating the Selected Reserve about  TRICARE. We also reviewed relevant standards for internal control in the  federal government. Additionally, we evaluated two surveys conducted by  DOD that collected information on whether members of the Selected  Reserve were aware of the TRS program\u2014the Status of Forces Survey and  the Focused Survey of TRICARE Reserve Select and Selected Reserve  Military Health System Access and Satisfaction.", "To determine how DOD monitors and evaluates access to civilian  providers for TRS, we reviewed TMA\u2019s beneficiary surveys on access to  civilian providers under TRICARE Standard, TRICARE Extra, and TRS. We  also reviewed the TRICARE Regional Offices\u2019 recent efforts to evaluate the  adequacy of access to civilian providers under the TRICARE Standard,  TRICARE Extra, and TRS options. Additionally, we evaluated an analysis  of claims conducted by TMA\u2014at our request\u2014that compared claims filed  by TRICARE Standard and Extra beneficiaries with those filed by TRS  beneficiaries for fiscal years 2008 through 2010 to identify demographic  differences between these populations and to determine whether these  populations used similar types of providers and obtained similar types of  care. We assessed the reliability of these data by speaking with  knowledgeable officials and reviewing related documentation, and we  determined that the claims analyses presented in this report are  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. (See app. I for more detail about the  claims analyses.) We also reviewed efforts by TMA to identify locations of  the Selected Reserve members and analyze whether they resided within an  area that was served by a TRICARE provider network. Finally, we  reviewed TMA\u2019s efforts to repeat its survey that is specific to the TRS  program (Focused Survey of TRICARE Reserve Select and Selected  Reserve Military Health System Access and Satisfaction).", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2010 through June 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The portion of the premium paid by the members of the  Selected Reserve and their dependents for TRS coverage varied based on  certain qualifying conditions that had to be met, such as whether the  member of the Selected Reserve also had access to an employer- sponsored health plan. The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2006 established two  levels\u2014which DOD called tiers\u2014of qualification for TRS, in addition to  the tier established by the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2005, with enrollees  paying different portions of the premium based on the tier for which they  qualified.", "The NDAA for Fiscal Year 2007 significantly restructured the TRS program  by eliminating the three-tiered premium structure and establishing open  enrollment for members of the Selected Reserve provided that they are not  eligible for or currently enrolled in the FEHB Program. The act removed  the requirement that members of the Selected Reserve sign service  agreements to qualify for TRS.

During preactivation,  when members of the Selected Reserve are notified that they will serve on  active duty in support of a contingency operation in the near future, they  and their families are eligible to enroll in TRICARE Prime, and therefore,  they do not need to purchase TRS coverage. This is commonly referred to  as \u201cearly eligibility\u201d and continues uninterrupted once members of the  Selected Reserve begin active duty. While on active duty, members are  required to enroll in TRICARE Prime. Similarly during deactivation, for  180 days after returning from active duty in support of a contingency  operation, members of the Selected Reserve are rendered eligible for the  Transitional Assistance Management Program, a program to transition  back to civilian life in which members and dependents can use the  TRICARE Standard or Extra options. When members of the Selected  Reserve return to inactive status, they can choose to purchase TRS  coverage if eligible.", "As a result of the TRICARE coverage cycle and program eligibility  requirements, TMA officials estimate that at any given time, fewer than  half of the members of the Selected Reserve are qualified to purchase TRS.

However, according to officials from the Office of Reserve  Affairs, they have not met with the reserve components since 2008 to  discuss how the components are fulfilling their TRS education  responsibilities under the policy. These officials explained that they have  experienced difficulties identifying a representative from each of the  reserve components to attend meetings about TRS education. When we  contacted officials from all seven reserve components to discuss TRS  education, we had similar experiences. Three of the components had  difficulties providing a point of contact.

The contractors use briefing materials  maintained by TMA and posted on the TRICARE Web site. In addition to  conducting briefings, the three contractors have increased their outreach  efforts in various ways, including creating an online tutorial that explains  TRS, mailing TRS information to Selected Reserve members, and working  closely with Family Program coordinators to provide TRS information to  family members.", "However, the contractors are challenged in their ability to meet their  requirement for briefing all units annually. First, they typically provide  briefings to units upon request because this approach is practical based  upon units\u2019 schedules and availability. For example, officials from one  contractor told us that even though they know when geographically  dispersed units will be gathering in one location, these units have busy  schedules and may not have time for the contractor to provide a briefing.  Each contractor records the briefings that are requested, when the briefing  requests were fulfilled and by whom, and any questions or concerns that  resulted from the briefings. However, some unit commanders do not  request briefings from the contractors. For example, officials with one  reserve component told us that they do not rely on the contractor to brief  units because they were unaware that the contractors provided this  service. In addition, these officials as well as officials from another reserve  component told us that they did not know if their unit commanders were  aware that they could request briefings from the contractors. All of the  contractors told us that they conduct outreach to offer information to  some of the units that have not requested a briefing, including both calling  units to offer a briefing and providing materials. They added that more  outreach is conducted to National Guard units because they are able to  obtain information about these units from state officials. The TRICARE  Regional Offices also told us that they conduct outreach to units to let  them know that the contractor is available to brief the units about TRS.

However, as we  have noted, the response rate for this survey was almost 18 percent,  although TMA took steps to adjust the data prior to reporting the results.

However, educating this population about TRS has been challenging, and  despite efforts by the reserve components and the contractors, some  members of the Selected Reserve are likely still unaware of this option.  Most of the reserve components lack centralized accountability for TRS  education, making it unclear if all members are getting information about  the program\u2014a concern that is further exacerbated by the lack of  awareness about the TRS education policy among officials from some of  the reserve components. Additionally, the contractors\u2019 limitations in  briefing all of the units in their regions about TRS make each component\u2019s  need for a central point of contact more evident.

However, DOD countered that each designee  should coordinate the provision of reserve unit information through the  TRICARE Regional Offices rather than communicating directly with the  TRICARE contractors, noting that the TRICARE Regional Offices have  oversight responsibility for the contractors in their respective regions. We  understand the department\u2019s concern about coordinating contractor  communications through the TRICARE Regional Offices, and we have  modified our recommendation accordingly.
