Two weeks prior to the  meeting, TSA I&A sends out materials including a list of new rules, rule  changes, archived (discontinued) rules, and the rationale and links to the  underlying intelligence supporting each rule change.

For example, TSA Chief Counsel officials reported that  they review rules and the supporting intelligence to ensure that the rules  meet legal sufficiency standards. A TSA Privacy official stated that they  review rules and the supporting intelligence to ensure rules do not violate  passengers\u2019 rights. All stakeholders review the rules to ensure they are  based on current intelligence that identify specific threats. If a  stakeholder finds that there is insufficient current intelligence to support  the rule, TSA I&A officials stated that they would modify it to ensure it is  tailored to current intelligence or archive a rule when the intelligence- based threat is no longer relevant. For example, during the March 2019  quarterly review meeting TSA I&A officials discussed archiving a Silent  Partner rule due to insufficient current intelligence to support it.

TSA procedures specify that in  standard circumstances, all rule changes are to be supported and  approved in writing prior to implementation. Specifically, TSA I&A is to  draft a memo with the nature of the threat and how all components of the  rule address the concerns from intelligence reporting. The memo, along  with all pertinent intelligence sources, is then required to be routed  through TSA Chief Counsel and TSA leadership for intelligence, legal,  and policy review. TSA\u2019s April 2012 Quiet Skies Implementation Plan specified that the Chief Counsel\u2019s review is to ensure that the proposed  rule targets the threat presented in the assessment, the assessment  properly documents the reasons for the recommendation, and the  recommendation is in compliance with relevant legal authorities,  regulations, and DHS policies. Upon approval, the memo is referred to  TSA senior leadership\u2014the TSA Administrator or TSA Deputy  Administrator\u2014for final written approval.

In  exigent circumstances\u2014circumstances requiring immediate action\u2014the  TSA I&A Assistant Administrator or his or her designee may direct that  the rule be implemented immediately without a signed decision memo.  The signed memo is still required, but can be drafted, reviewed, and  approved after the change is implemented.

TSA\u2019s SOP states that the exigent review process may be  used \u201cif TSA determines that exigent circumstances require immediate  implementation of a Silent Partner rule.\u201d However, the SOP does not  clarify who or which office within TSA makes this determination or what  types of circumstances would be appropriately characterized as exigent.", "TSA I&A officials told us that exigent circumstances were very rare. They  estimated that in the last 3 years exigent circumstances had occurred  once. Yet, the same officials also estimated that they implemented  approximately 90 percent of the rule changes following verbal approval  from either TSA or I&A leadership and drafted the required memos after  the fact. This indicates that TSA I&A officials have not followed the  standard review process when implementing rule changes in  circumstances they regard as standard, and the process followed  appears to be closer to what would occur in exigent circumstances.  These TSA I&A officials explained that drafting and processing the  approval memo after they implement a rule change allows them to more  quickly respond to changing intelligence. TSA\u2019s SOP provides flexibility  for this in exigent circumstances. However, given the absence of clarity in  the SOP about when the exigent process is to be used and who is to  make that decision, it is unclear whether or not TSA I&A used the exigent  review process\u2014a process which is not, initially, contingent upon TSA\u2019s  legal review or I&A\u2019s written support\u2014in circumstances that DHS and  TSA leadership who oversee the program would regard as standard.", "According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government,  management should implement control activities through policies by, for  example, documenting responsibilities in policies and periodically  reviewing policies and procedures for continued relevance and  effectiveness. As TSA I&A updates its Silent Partner and Quiet Skies  SOPs in fall 2019, clarifying the criteria for standard and exigent rule  review procedures would provide greater assurance that screening rule  changes are reviewed as intended.", "TSA I&A officials further told us that they do not document or otherwise  have a way of determining what proportion of rule changes have been  reviewed in accordance with the standard process versus the exigent  process because they had not identified a need to do so. According to the  2012 TSA memo establishing Quiet Skies as a permanent program, at  the program\u2019s outset a working group of DHS and TSA stakeholders  identified the need for transparency as the first of seven key areas of  consensus.
